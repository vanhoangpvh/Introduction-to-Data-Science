Fairy Tail OVA (2016),https://myanimelist.net/anime/32930/Fairy_Tail_OVA_2016,"[""I'll openly admit, Fairy Tail has been hit or miss for me the pass couple of years. Well more or less the anime. When I first saw it I loved the hell out of it and watched the episodes on repeat. When the 2014 season came out I can't fully explain why but I just couldn't get into and paid more attention to the manga for the most part really. Fairy Tail has got a little on my nerves a little though. It just certain stuff that kept me off it for a couple of months. But this... I think this has a good chance...of being pretty goodHello all you people. For those who don't know I'm Josh and today I am reviewing (will be revised when all episodes air) the first episode of the Fairy Tail 2016 OVA. Let's do this people.Story- It was mostly fan service and was based off a bet from the grand magic games between team A and Team B of Fairy Tail. I won't say who won cause I don't want to spoil it fully, but the losing team had to basically do what the others said. That being said going back to what I first said, the first episode was mostly ecchi and fan service. Don't worry though it is not Eiken level though. God forbid any anime go that low. There was a nice thing with Cana and Wendy which I did smile at and I did laugh at a couple of things. Overall the story gets a 7/10 from meArt- Arts never been a issue with me in Fairy Tail especially with A-1 at the helm of it. It is pretty good and I loved it. Overall the art gets a 8/10 from me.Sound- Being a OVA I wasn't expecting some great song. The opening and ending were alright though. Pretty average to me compared to the other fairy tail openings and endings. That might just be me though. Voice acting was good as always so I can't really complain about that though. Overall sound gets a 7/10 the voice acting being the main thing keeping that from being lower from meCharacters- Other than the main ones, I have always struggled with remembering the members in fairy tail and the other guilds. Some are eh to me, others are alright and the rest I have to see their faces or atleast called by their name for me to remember. But the first episode had pretty much the character I know about the most and care about the most in the first episode. Plus I'm not a big Cana fan and never have beenbut I will openly admit I liked her in this first episode and the moment she had with Wendy. I sincerely liked it. But overall I'm giving it a 6/10Enjoyment- I enjoyed it. I have moved away a little from Fairy Tail but I sincerely enjoyed seeing this. Granted some weird ecchi and fan service scenes I did enjoy it. 7/10Overall- It was a pretty good 1st episode in the OVA. I enjoyed it fully. I recommend you guys check this out. Overall the first episode gets a 8/10 from me. Granted some people might not want to see it because of the fan services, it is pretty good overallAnd with that I am out.

Peace People"", ""The actual review is 2 paragraphs down, the first 2 are basically me imposing on anime with my British customs.As someone who has never visited, read about or looked to much into the culture and social norm of Japan, I can assure you that this took me by surprise. Not because its good or because there were any developments. But because they dressed a 12-15 year old in bondage clothes. As someone who lives in Britain, you can be sure how that surprised me, because over here, we can't show a child being killed/dying (pretty much at all) or imply that something remotely adult happened...to one without a big old 18+ sticker getting slapped on it (basically rated R). So when I saw that Wendy had been dressed like this (even for a split second), I knew that the rest of the episodes were going to be incredibly sexualized.Holy sh*t.... I was right..... nooooo waaaaaaaaaaaaaay. /sThis is this closest thing to an official porn parody that you will find, even for fairy tail, HELL, even for anime, this OVA took it quite a way. While I may sound pretty naive to some people, do keep in mind that i tend to research the anime that I watch (just for a premise) and tend to go towards either the more westernized ones or the more critically acclaimed ones which tend to have fewer OVA's, don't last as long or simply don't leave room for any sex appeal.Any way, naive western shock rant over... OVA review time:Story: There is nothing of relevance in the OVA, they are bolt on's. But you probably didn't need me to tell you that. If you finished the main content and you want a bit more then go ahead and watch this but BE AWARE, there is next to no fighting in this, even in the playful sense honestly.... The most beaten up thing in all the three episodes ended up being the trees.This is not a bad thing, keep in mind, the content of the episodes are humorous in many ways and OF COURSE, that is what you expect from an OVA in the first place .....an off topic comedy night is the best way to describe it.Art: Everyone involved in Fairy Tail wanted the chance to practice drawing abs and boobs. Other things would be easy to 'miss'.Sound: You got your Fairy Tail music, its not in abundance but its there. The application is sort of off point for what I'd expect, so the score takes a necessary hit as it just left me feeling cringed out.Characters: The core prospect of Fairy Tail: characters. While you shouldn't expect them to be cast in the same light, they are there, their relationships are expressed very well but the fact they are all naked half the time does kind of take away from the whole badass persona that is built up throughout both of the Fairy Tail iterations. Again, as to be expected, but I feel as if they kind of lingered in the middle of trying to maintain that persona, and letting it go in favor of boobs n' sh*t, which kind of damaged the direction that they were trying to send the characters in these episodes.Enjoyment: It was alright I guess. I'm pretty lenient on Fairy Tail but even I have to admit that it wasn't the best use of my time.Overall: You can afford to miss it, if you just finished Fairy Tail and need more then try the manga because this may contradict your closing thoughts on all the characters. If you are THAT big on Fairy Tail though, go for it, its only 3 episodes so what have you got to lose. to one without a big old 18+ sticker getting slapped on it (basically rated R).

Basically ""thank you for buying the home release."" And that\'s really what it comes down to. Sex sells, and unless you\'re the average troglodyte twitter user that thinks sexualizing underage fictional characters is ""problematic,"" you\'ll probably think this is alright.I\'m mainly addressing a couple other reviews I saw on this sight for this anime. Are people really this freaking sensitive? Boo hoo, you looked on the Fairy Tail wiki and found out a character is canonically 15 or whatever. Tell me, do you know any real life 15 year...old humans that look anything like Fairy Tail characters? Nevermind the fictional ages, you need to get your eyes checked if you can\'t tell humans apart from drawings. It\'s like the people who try to equate lolicon with real life pedophilia, like making a lewd drawing and saying it\'s and 11 year old is somehow equally as bad as abducting and abusing actual children. Calm down twitter.Anime is one of the last few bastions of media where the ""woke"" western media has not completely destroyed creative expression. I can\'t watch TV or movies from the west now because it\'s all about pushing agendas and shoehorned messages about diversity or some other subversive crap. Here we have a perfect example where none of that gets in the way, and we can just go ""ha ha, look boobies"" without some 5th wave college feminist telling us why we\'re part of the patriarchy.Plot wise, like I said, there isn\'t any. Well there was a little bit, and it was a neat tie-in to the Fairy Tail Zero arc, but it was ultimately still a vehicle for more fanservice. So I\'m gonna have to give this a 7/10 anime tiddies old humans that look anything like Fairy Tail characters?

So if you are worried about lewd stuff to continue reading (if not skip the ova, but second-half of episode 2 is worth story-wise), if you would love to see the girls as nude as possible, then just go ahead and watch the 3 episodes.1st of all, see all episodes of season 2 so episode 2 makes sensEpisode 1: Is sexual abuse in many ways....Public spanking with butt + underwear full view in front of many random guys. Kissing a monkey. Boobies or butt full view (just one step away from being mild nudity) every few seconds (How in the world is this 13 or over?).Episode 2: Bath, you see butts and everything except girly bits (again, I don't get how this is 13 or over....), mix bath as well. The second part is well worth as a continuation, sort of, from the last few episodes (but not last 2) from season 2.Episode 3: Start with Christmas cleaning and ends up with Erza's butt full view as she walks away fully naked (is it 13 or over because she still wears a hat?). This episode is beyond words, you don't realise this because it is only for a few seconds they show what they were ordered to do but it doesn't change that the girls are forced to go around in public half-naked, 1 being in underwear, another trying her best to cover herself with her top as she is bottomless and so on....

It's pretty poor, the characters and designs do not use the new character designs, rather it used the old Yamamuro designs. The background was a blank colour with no actual location, just sorta in space (maybe). Shenron (Shenlong) is a horrendous 3D model that feels entirely removed from the rest of the scenes.Goku is pretty dumb, though fitting as an ad in that particular location, but it is a shame either way. Frieza (or Freeza) just sorta makes an appearance and turns golden. Broly, however, does not make any appearance despite it being an ad for the movie of...his name.The throwbacks to the original Dragonball, Z, Super and some of the movies were a nice addition. But the only thing directly related to the upcoming movie comes after the credits roll, showing a small trailer for the movie.Audio is fine enough for what it is.

Fuujin Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1524/Fuujin_Monogatari,"[""First off I will admit that I am softy for Slice of Life series. My top five anime series are all about teenage girls exploring day to day life and Windy Tales (Fuujin Monogatari) is one of them.Immediately the unique animation style struck me. Why is a story about a high school girl who likes to take pictures of clouds drawn in such an obscure way? The animation at times accentuates certain features we would not normally notice and obscures other features making the characters look a part of their environment. Whenever I see pictures of Windy Tales I get overjoyed, they satisfy ever corner...of my eyes as normal anime characters don't. There's no sparkle in their irises or shiny wetness to their hair, they look sharp, drawn and fit like puzzle pieces in the background. I see this more as a good thing, it adds a spice and an absurb warped view on the story as if we're looking through slanted glass.The stories in each episode are heart warming but not over-the-top or dramatic at all. They don't inspire or teach, but they settle. I feel calm and completely pacified after each episode but nowhere near bored. The placement of the music makes me feel like I'm lost in a happy memory and the nostalgic feel is superior to anything Azumanga Daioh ever achieved. I wanted to rest my head while watching but I didn't want to sleep in case I missed a beautiful still shot of clouds reflecting in windows with that amazing track playing, it's those small seemingly insignificant scenes which makes Windy Tales so special to those who want to appreciate it.The characters themselves are sweet, cute in a different way to girls in Manabi Straight!, and all so familiar. I would be lying if I said Windy Tales had no sentimental effect on me. Nao looks almost exactly like my older sister and in fact all the characters look similar, their almond shaped eyes and teddy bear like mouths, they all look kind and mature but at the same time very innocent.I would add other reasons why the series is special to me above all others but then you'd assume it's an acquired taste. Well, it is. Not everyone will like this, but if you're one for very niche anime then this one is a diamond in the cave. There are moments where I feel like I'm a part of the conversation, or a part of the memories. Episode 10 has some of the most astounding scenes I've experienced in anime and episode 5 is my personal favorite episode from any anime of all time. Everybody should watch it even if they don't intend to finish the series. of my eyes as normal anime characters don't.

Right off the bat, one will notice that the art style is seemingly messy and hastily drawn. In fact, it could even be called ugly. However, I found that it complemented the wind element of the show and meshed quite nicely with the animation. What struck me most about the art were the character designs: those tiny hands and feet, as well as those angular eyes that give the characters a distinct Asian appearance. I was also impressed by how...highly expressive the characters\' faces were. Joy, surprise, and even fear were depicted very effectively, despite the rather simple facial features of the characters.Wind is the primary element that drives Fuujin Monogatari. Or rather, it starts off that way. During the first few episodes, the characters learn how to control the wind, but by episode three, these wind powers sort of fade into the background as the show becomes more episodic in nature. A more conventional slice-of-life show would have probably shown the characters using their powers in everyday situations, but we don\'t really see this in Fuujin Monogatari. Although the concept of wind control is revisited occasionally throughout the show, it mainly serves as a motif and is often paralleled with the occurrences and themes in each episode. For instance, the act of controlling the wind is often likened to showing responsibility and taking control of one\'s life. Of course, this is never stated outright; it\'s up to the viewers to catch the subtle messages behind an event or a character\'s actions.Although the show is soothing and even lighthearted at times, it\'s not afraid to show those darker moments in life. For example, one episode depicts the change in attitude of a character who was involved in a near-fatal motorcycle accident. Another episode contains a metaphorical scene in which the act of suicide is illustrated with haunting imagery. Fuujin Monogatari is honest in its portrayal of events — a refreshing trait in a genre full of optimism and carefreeness.As with all slice of life shows, Fuujin Monogatari is driven by its cast, and fortunately the characters here are quite likeable and respectfully represented. The main character of the show is Nao. Observant and thoughtful, she is one of only two members of her middle school\'s photography club, the other being her best friend Miki, who is more assertive. They are eventually joined by a boy named Jun, who becomes Miki\'s love interest. He\'s a bit of an airhead and provides much of the comic relief in the show. Although the characters don\'t get too much development, their personalities do get fleshed out and they feel delightfully genuine. I mean, Nao considers Benjamin Franklin her idol! Even the adults in the show, such as Taiki and even Nao\'s parents, are well depicted and play meaningful roles in several episodes. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the flying cats, who have their own special moments.Another aspect of the show I enjoyed was the dialogue. It\'s subdued and representative of what people would say in everyday situations. After all, Nao and everyone around her are just normal people living their lives, and it\'s great to see that the dialogue is driven by their characterization and not by drama or plot. For example, there\'s one episode in which Nao listens to two adults talking about traveling. The conversation is very matter-of-fact, almost boring, but it provides a lot of insight into the adults\' personalities.The music in Fuujin Monogatari is calm and very soothing, greatly enhancing the atmosphere of the show. There\'s the typical soft piano tracks, of course, but some songs incorporate bells and even the flute, which are very befitting for the show\'s wind motifs. In addition, the OP is incredible and captures the essence of the show very well. It\'s one of those OPs that you never skip.With all that being said, Fuujin Monogatari is not a perfect show. The characters\' wind control powers are never really explored in depth, which may be off-putting. Episodes vary in quality, which is to be expected of an episodic series. While I don\'t consider any of them ""bad,"" there are undoubtedly some episodes that are weaker than others. Also, the concept of wind is not incorporated in every episode (and in some, it\'s very loosely connected at best), making those episodes seem thematically detached from the rest of the series.From its unique art style to its down-to-earth nature, Fuujin Monogatari is worth a watch for anyone who\'s interested in something a little different from the typical slice of life fare. highly expressive the characters\' faces were.

The reviewer before me has done such a good job that I really don't stand a chance now do I? lol I'm just going to add that this anime has the most beautiful score I have ever heard. No it's not everyone's cup of tea (I know the animation style can put many people off; though personally, I find it cute and very interesting), but honestly, I could watch it without visuals or words - the music is just that captivating. So go on, if you're in the mood to watch something...intriguing that will leave you feeling calm and strangely content, check this out. It's no masterpiece, but maybe it will have as special and mysterious an effect on you as it did on me.. intriguing that will leave you feeling calm and strangely content, check this out. It's no masterpiece, but maybe it will have as special and mysterious an effect on you as it did on me.."", ""Slice of life as a genre has a small problem. By itself, there is not much to base an entire show on – there has to be some sort of focus, a setting or concept that allows for individual stories to exist while also providing a solid base that pulls all of the ideas together. Fuujin Monogatari takes its identity as an episodic slice of life show to heart, almost to a fault – the individual episodes contain themes and ideas that are usually interesting and sometimes even compelling, but there is just about no connection between episodes thematically. The consequence to this is that...Fuujin Monogatari is a show of widely varying quality.Not to say that there is not a string tying the show together, loosely at least. That string is the titular wind, which the main characters (among others) can control at will, for some reason. This seems like it might be an important mechanic that would set Fuujin Monogatari apart from similar shows, such as having the main characters using the wind powers in otherwise normal situations to make them more interesting. In execution it is actually not so. Instead, the show offers a low key usage of the wind powers, mostly used for interesting visual effects while the story and the characters take breathing time. This is also useful for the viewer, as this downtime provides a relaxing section of an episode where one can reflect on the events that have occurred; on the other hand, these scenes could be replaced by just about any sort of relaxing or visually interesting scene, making the wind mechanic seem like little more than a gimmick in the end. A very pretty gimmick.The art in the show is a juxtaposition of purposefully rough character designs and almost impressionist background art, which works to a good effect and is most definitely the strongest part of the production. The minimalist design of the characters allows for exaggerated yet meaningful motions and facial expressions, and they also give the characters a definitively “Asian” look. There is not much detail in their designs; luckily, the show avoids characters looking too similar to each other by keeping the cast small, though in darker scenes where you can't see the color of their hair they look a little too similar. The backgrounds, though, are consistently beautiful. It's almost a shame that Nao is so obsessed with taking pictures of clouds, because the world of Fuujin Monogatari is lovely and detailed, contrasting in many ways the simple character designs – though they both share the sketchy, purposefully rushed-appearing aesthetic, keeping the overall feel of the show internally consistent, despite the huge difference in detail.There are also some cool visual ideas used sparingly in the show - portraying texts with handwritten-looking colored text on the screen, or a phone call by overlaying the characters onto each others' settings, or flashbacks and dreams indicated with characters filled in with a single color. On one hand I appreciate that it did not abuse these things, but on the other they feel a bit wasted, sometimes only being used once in the whole run.Similarly, the soundtrack and voice acting are lovely but subdued. This is a good thing – the sound is never overbearing, but is consistently supportive of the atmosphere that Fuujin Monogatari naturally builds. Voice acting is done in a subtle way, never overacting but also hardly ever relaying strong emotion, even when a scene calls for it, which is unfortunate.However, the most hit and miss aspect of the entire production is the writing. As I stated before, there is little consistency when it comes to theme. Supporting others, avoiding responsibility, and finding your worth are all examples of ideas that Fuujin Monogatari plays with, but none is given a decent amount of time before the next comes along to take its place. In this sense, Fuujin Monogatari tries to live up to its main character Nao's goal as stated in the very first scene – to capture the wind. Like the wind, Fuujin Monogatari moves and changes as it pleases. Consequentially, not all episodes are created equal. There are a handful of absolutely amazing, perfectly executed episodes, and it is not a coincidence that these episodes tend to make good use of the interesting visual style matched with an equally simple concept as well as Nao as a competent narrator, but there are many more flops, usually too self-indulgent to come off as meaningful.The episode about trying to get a perfect picture of a runner, for example, manages to use Fuujin Monogatari's strengths to much better effect than an episode about helping a momonga learn to fly, even though the latter has much more to do with the show's distinguishing idea. I should also point out an episode that takes place almost entirely in the nurse's office, featuring a fever dream contrasted by a completely normal conversation which utilizes Fuujin Monogatari's visual style to an extent never matched again.If only every episode was as simple and effective as that one, this show would be an instant classic. As it stands, though, it is a compilation of mostly uninspired stories interspersed with small moments of genius. If you are a fan of the slice of life genre, you will definitely find plenty to like in this show, but people less patient with the trappings of the genre will frequently have their patience tested. Fuujin Monogatari is a show of widely varying quality.Not to say that there is not a string tying the show together, loosely at least. That string is the titular wind, which the main characters (among others) can control at will, for some reason. This seems like it might be an important mechanic that would set Fuujin Monogatari apart from similar shows, such as having the main characters using the wind powers in otherwise normal situations to make them more interesting. In execution it is actually not so. Instead, the show offers a low key usage of the wind powers, mostly used for interesting visual effects while the story and the characters take breathing time. This is also useful for the viewer, as this downtime provides a relaxing section of an episode where one can reflect on the events that have occurred; on the other hand, these scenes could be replaced by just about any sort of relaxing or visually interesting scene, making the wind mechanic seem like little more than a gimmick in the end.

It doesn't try to be anything more or less than what it is, and that is what makes it shine.As a slice-of-life, Windy Tales premise is relevant enough in each episode to create interest, but doesn't overshadow the stories themselves. Although the main characters learn about moving the wind to their advantage, we don't see them use it to fight evil or get what they want. Instead we see them go through their day to day lives WITH this power. The power to move wind isn't the main plot, the characters are. Personally, I found this to...be a breath of fresh air. When a show has characters with powers, we don't think of slice-of-life. Instead we think of shonen anime, magical girl anime, adventure anime, anything BUT slice-of-life. Rarely is it we get to see a calm slice-of-life anime with powers in between, and it was very fun to watch it for what it was.The animation and art of Windy Tales is obviously very unique. One could even compare it to some of Masaaki Yuasa's works. The characters don't look like the typical anime characters, with small eyes, and their bodies looking like they were made up of shapes, sometimes uneven and rough. I personally loved the look of it. The art style was very innovative, and made it even more fun to watch the show.The Soundtrack was mostly in the background, barely there. It wasn't really anything new to listen to, and wasn't amazing in any way, but it didn't need to be. it was there to give atmosphere, which overall made me feel relaxed as I watched. The music was good, and fulfilled its purpose.The characters to Windy Tales, as stated above, were the main focus of the series. As such, each were fleshed out accordingly. Each character was distinct and entertaining. By the end of the show, each character would've grown on you by being themselves. Now, not EVERY single character got development, mostly just the main three, but those that did were the highlight of the show.Overall, Windy Tales was a pleasant take on the slice-of-life genre. The animation style was refreshing, the sound relaxing, and the characters enjoyable. Not every episode was enjoyable, there were some in the middle that were, at the very least, repeated themselves a bit too much, but most episodes were a lot of fun to go through. I highly recommend this show to people who like unique slice-of-life shows, as well as those who have yet to get into the genre. It has enough of the 'wind power' premise to keep one interested and entertained, and that was more than enough for me. be a breath of fresh air.

Sometimes, they drown in the sky and are lost. Just like people get swallowed by the waves.""Fuujin Monogatari is an example of an anime whose aesthetic is so well cultivated that its main theme, wind, is represented in every aspect. The rough, have seen it described as ""draft-like,"" art; the music and sound design, the visuals, character designs and story-lines will all remind the the viewer of wind. Not just the idea of wind but the experience of it.The creators of this show seemed content to be suggestive rather...than overt in their exploration of this theme. This works out very well for the show, especially the way they handled the fantasy elements. As fantastical, and strange, as they are the viewer is often only able to see them moving in the background. The ordinary takes center stage, however these elements form a core to the show that cannot be ignored. It is in this manner that the anime is able to explore its main thematic material and get its message (whatever that is) across. It seems apparent that what we see is meant to be taken literally. However, FM blurs the line between visual metaphor and fantasy in the way every other allegorical anime tries to do. I think it is the most successful in this aspect. Clearly there is something this anime wants to tell us. However the creators must have felt that wrapping it up in the right package was more important than bombarding us. This works out very well for basically every second of the anime. Can\'t say this enough but the modus operandi of Fuujin Monogatari is subtlety and it\'s ingenious.Wind is constant movement and is evidence for the passage of time and of change. Whether it be the experience of growing up, feelings of nostalgia, looking forward, looking back, experiencing a mid-life crisis, worrying, contemplating; all of these experiences occur in time and are of time, we find all of these experiences explored in this anime. Sometimes subtly sometimes more directly. What we find is that FM may be more of a show about time than of wind. This is often portrayed in the dialogue of the series but can also be seen within the animation itself.The series moves at a slow pace allowing the viewer to get lost in the unique art style. It is often optimistic but at times somber. Contemplative, nuanced and subtle. The characters themselves are interesting even if they only exist as another piece of the artistic puzzle. Dialogue is realistic (and just like I like it) well placed and brief. It is episodic in nature. Timelines within the episodes themselves are sometimes experimented with in a neat way, this and plenty of other small touches would be better if experienced rather than read about.  The anime wants to engross you, so you better get engrossed! FM isn\'t an anime you can get away with watching while eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. I learned that the hard way.I would call this a mature series. Not in the sense of its content but of its message and style. Had I watched this as a kid I don\'t see how this wouldn\'t have changed my life. Watching now I can only appreciate everything it does. It uses its intelligence to make you feel rather than think. (I had a huge smile on my face throughout the entire series)Some other comments:When I watched episode 7 I felt that it was prophetic of a certain kind of ending.

Miki and Nao are best friends who are apart of the Digital Photography Club. Nao loves to take pictures of the sky or rather, the clouds and the wind. Through this Nao and Miki discover a girl who can manipulate wind, Ryouko; she tells Nao how she too, can learn this ability. Flying cats are involved too and they really set the story in motion.The story, if there is one, is either too deep or...metaphorical for me to understand, unfortunately I'm not so good at picking things apart and trying to understand deeper meanings of a show, so to me, Windy Tales was a very nice, slow slice of life anime.I really liked the art style, it's what drew me to watch Windy Tales in the first place. Instead of having just the clouds and sky and wind be extra stylized, the entire anime is stylized and man, it's incredible. There are probably hundreds of ways one could draw a world to symbolize things like the wind and the clouds, I feel like Windy Tales did a fantastic job showing us a really unique and special outlook on a world where the wind is more than an unseen force. I absolutely enjoyed seeing the wind visualized and when it's being manipulated, I love the multi colored lines to show that it was being manipulated.Music and all things related to audio in Windy Tales is phenomenal, there are so many good piano arrangements and really good pieces of music being played. There are certain songs that use drums and it really hits you while watching the crazy art and story unfold. The OP is absolutely amazing I feel like it's slow pace and relaxing melody portrays and conveys Windy Tales incredible well. The ED used is okay, it's more upbeat and cheerful inspiring a lot of fun, but that's not bad, since the show is very very fun.I enjoyed all the little stories told in each episode, making Windy Tales for the most part, very episodic and slow. There is very little drama, very little to get upset about and a lot to enjoy. I also kept finding myself really enjoying how the characters were drawn. The accentuated and exaggerated art style is truly remarkable and I'd like to watch more anime that do things so boldly and different. metaphorical for me to understand, unfortunately I'm not so good at picking things apart and trying to understand deeper meanings of a show, so to me, Windy Tales was a very nice, slow slice of life anime.I really liked the art style, it's what drew me to watch Windy Tales in the first place.

Okay, I actually don\'t know what moe is. It\'s just something for elitist whiners to...complain about. Probably...Anyway, it\'s likely best embodied in the usual output of the kind of anime labeled as ""cute girls doing cute things,"" and those usually belong to the slice of life genre, where we see our cute moeblobs washing the dishes, eating cupcakes, or playing instruments, or some other inane crap that is boring to watch. ""Wow, oh boy, I hate washing the dishes, but I LOVE watching young girls wash the dishes UwU!"" or ""I hate going outside, but I like to watch young girls go outside! Wow, sugoi!"" or ""I wish I had a loving family member in the country who would let me loiter around and suck popsicles and spitoon watermelon seeds during the summer and that I didn\'t think life was meaningless!"" is the basic mentality, I guess.It\'s gotten to the point where I have dismissed slice of life as a term, other than to describe garbage anime series where girls eat smores at summer camp. For one, it sounds stupid. Are you eating it like it\'s a pizza? Why is it a slice? Why not slime of life? Iyashikei is a closely related term that means the equivalent of ""healing,"" so for people who just watch anime instead of going to the doctor when they have a booboo (not a bad idea in many cases). This series, as well as other popular shows like Mushishi, are referred to as both iyashikei AND slice of life, but most series with these labels are gutter sludge.I\'ve taken to using the idiom and literary term mono no aware to refer to anime of this nature—so long as it\'s good, has actual themes, strives towards beauty or the sublime, appropriate attention to detail, a non-sterile/generic appearance, and a sense of space or atmosphere; all of which is the opposite of the stereotypical moeblob slice of life. It sounds more pretentious, like when people use random French phrases to present themselves as cultured: Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît pas. See how smart I look now? Mono no aware\'s translation as ""a sensitivity to ephemera"" applies pretty well to Windy Tales, and there is a heavy emphasis on impermanence, with an exploration of the seasonal cycle and quoted poetry that touches directly on the subject.However, I will say that Windy Tales is obviously in the mono no aware camp. There\'s a certain spiritual vibe that can be extracted from the dense atmosphere of the titles I would loosely lump into this camp—in terms of visual art from other mediums, I would say it\'s most easy to find this specific feeling from film auteurs like Yasujiro Ozu or Andrei Tarkovsky. Trust me, this is not a podiatrist-pandering show like Akebi with constant feet shots and filthy clip and sniff scenes, nor is it filled with embarrassing dad rock references about ""Jeff Becku"" and pretending to play instruments (cute girls pretending to do cute things) like in K-On.I\'ve chosen Windy Tales to be the guinea pig for the preceding ramble because I believe that of all anime series, this one best embodies what I\'ve described above. For one, it has a very unique look. Everything has an imperfect hand-drawn style—somewhat charmingly crude to the point one might think this was a Masaaki Yuasa project. Gone are the ugly CGI backdrops and never-ending panning shots over tedious scenes—we really do judge books by their cover, and no matter how well-written a visually generic, copy and paste show is, the disposable artificiality dampens the emotional impact. The characters look completely unlike anime, and they are ideal for interesting character animation, even if their feet look like toothpicks (definitely not the best feet winner of 2004). The effects animation focuses on wind, often depicted as wisps, lines, or swirls, or the manipulation of objects by the wind. It\'s not uncommon for environmental shots to receive a lot of attention, and there is a deliberate inclination on the part of the staff to build atmosphere. The series does not have a strict thematic focus, but there are different themes presented within various episodes, and this maintains the typical free-form, not overly drama or plot-focused, and relaxing style of most slice of life, but it is far more carefully directed and written per episode.I\'m definitely no stranger to anime series that are as formulaic as the typical school series, but add in some fantastical or magical element to spice up a humdrum script—often this fantasy element seems almost pointless or just a trite hook to peddle the same pablum. The wind manipulation here functions as an authentic magical realist device. There appears to be a more direct purpose for wind manipulation, based on the tradition of the village in the first two episodes, but other than the great and fantastical visual of cats lackadaisically floating through the sky, the primary purpose of the wind manipulation in terms of storytelling has to do with the user\'s connection to his or her own emotions in particular and to nature more generally. The wind is perfectly incorporated into the story throughout, often in many novel, subtle and metaphorical ways, as well as adding a spiritual, mystical, or even poetic sense that is further accentuated by the ambient score and striking visuals. It also makes for very exciting and expressionistic animation, and it\'s always refreshing to see effects animation that has nothing to do with fight scenes or explosions.This is a heavily episodic series, though the first two episodes count as a fairly distinct arc (with the last episode circling back), but luckily it does have some overarching character development and thematics that prevent it from feeling purely episodic, and this format works much better for the equivalent of bittersweet short stories than it ever could for the usual episodic formula, which tends to be monster of the week.Certain episodes are better than others. Episode 3, with the main character\'s attempt to capture the wind through photography is a little dry and drawn-out, and episode 4 feels a little bit too much like a kid\'s movie with the adorable flying squirrel. These are still good episodes, and I wouldn\'t say any of them were at all bad. The final episode is somewhat rushed and incorporates a little too much, lacking the tight focus of preceding episodes; the impact was muted and the cross-over of past with present was clumsy, and other aspects of the episode were vague or not fully explored.One of the strongest episodes, bringing to mind new wave films, would probably be the fever dream that is episode 5—there are plenty of themes here concerning ambivalence about adulthood and conformity, dreams, and nostalgia. Very good character interaction and naturalistic dialogue here, and I was glad Makino returned for the conclusion. The kick-the-can episode is also vividly depicted with its nocturnal atmosphere.Often not enough attention is paid to OP/ED combos, and I think, to end, it would be good to talk about the final thing we see, the ED. While the OP is a more laid-back pop song that sets the tone for the show well, featuring plenty of wonderful animation, the karaoke pop of the closing (however, this does get incorporated nicely into a later episode), set to mediocre photos and little animation cutouts is probably not the best choice. Using still photography kind of makes sense given that the characters are part of a digital photography club, but they\'re not very appealing photos, and a more serene and slower pace with ambience—or even ambient pop—would be a better way to close the show. I\'m imagining something like environmental shots and contemplative characters being gently nuzzled by the wind. complain about.

It also makes for very exciting and expressionistic animation, and it\'s always refreshing to see effects animation that has nothing to do with fight scenes or explosions.This is a heavily episodic series, though the first two episodes count as a fairly distinct arc (with the last episode circling back), but luckily it does have some overarching character development and thematics that prevent it from feeling purely episodic, and this format works much better for the equivalent of bittersweet short stories than it ever could for the usual episodic formula, which tends to be monster of the week.Certain episodes are better than others. Episode 3, with the main character\'s attempt to capture the wind through photography is a little dry and drawn-out, and episode 4 feels a little bit too much like a kid\'s movie with the adorable flying squirrel. These are still good episodes, and I wouldn\'t say any of them were at all bad. The final episode is somewhat rushed and incorporates a little too much, lacking the tight focus of preceding episodes; the impact was muted and the cross-over of past with present was clumsy, and other aspects of the episode were vague or not fully explored.One of the strongest episodes, bringing to mind new wave films, would probably be the fever dream that is episode 5—there are plenty of themes here concerning ambivalence about adulthood and conformity, dreams, and nostalgia. Very good character interaction and naturalistic dialogue here, and I was glad Makino returned for the conclusion. The kick-the-can episode is also vividly depicted with its nocturnal atmosphere.Often not enough attention is paid to OP/ED combos, and I think, to end, it would be good to talk about the final thing we see, the ED. While the OP is a more laid-back pop song that sets the tone for the show well, featuring plenty of wonderful animation, the karaoke pop of the closing (however, this does get incorporated nicely into a later episode), set to mediocre photos and little animation cutouts is probably not the best choice. Using still photography kind of makes sense given that the characters are part of a digital photography club, but they\'re not very appealing photos, and a more serene and slower pace with ambience—or even ambient pop—would be a better way to close the show. I\'m imagining something like environmental shots and contemplative characters being gently nuzzled by the wind.', '""Fujin Monogatari"" stands as an epitome of artistic brilliance within the realm of anime, captivating audiences through its unparalleled animation style and gripping storyline.

Speed is topological in nature, it changes only be degree, by quantity, never by quality, being indivisible. All these multiplicities described are this way, changing only in degree, differences in kind only emerging from that. What is changing in degree in all of these is motion, some level of motion. This is the nature of wind as well, with ""wind"" not being so much an entity encapsulated like the word claims to, but instead being a motion across...the atmosphere caused by a variety of factors. Such is the nature of wind in this show, an extremely powerful contemplation on this very idea and its magical and practical applications. In the twelfth episode, Nao presents the first half through her own mind, showing us artistically distorted images of the sakura season. Taiki-sensei said earlier that the sakura season reflects the color of one\'s heart, a telling reference to the explored ideas when they went to the Wind Village, where they learned to cultivate the wind ""inside their hearts"". Nao shows us in plain terms then, her own heart, letting the wind flow through her and directing those flows, showing us the way of topological, multiplicitous magic. This lesson is further shown in the way they must almost die in order to realize the wind, the emptiness of falling, of motion of a motorcycle or accidental fall, Nao opens her heart to these flows and controls them as they pass through her. By all of this, Fuujin Monogatari shows us a radically monist path, the way to navigate metaphysical praxis in a world of flows and degrees, showing us the way to become the flying cats - true daoist masters. the atmosphere caused by a variety of factors.

It\'s about as far as one can be from the battle shounens, shoujo rom-coms, and loopy gag shows that dominated that decade. A largely episodic story about a group of schoolgirls who discover a secret ability to manipulate wind, this unexpected superpower is introduced into an otherwise un-fantastic world, albeit one with healthy amounts of whimsy. As the characters enter their last years of school,...this ""wind in the heart"" serves as a symbol for untapped potential and childhood innocence (which most users lose at a certain age, but some rare adults manage to retain). There are no wind-based fights if that\'s what you\'re looking for, and this ability often takes a back seat to more low-stakes stories about the characters who fill out the show\'s neighborhood. As a coming-of-age show about the cusp of adulthood, Windy Tales is sometimes languid to a fault, and most inner conflicts are merely hinted at or left unresolved, true to the show\'s ethos of melancholy magical realism. No one in the show has any major problems other than the usual doubts and misgivings of a person wondering what their life is going to be like. This leisurely, muted tone is contrasted against a nearly-abstract, unique art style of sketched-out, disproportionate characters, and backgrounds--courtesy of Shichiro Kobayashi--that seem inspired by Expressionist paintings (the show\'s memorable depiction of the sun in particular strongly recalls Edvard Munch). There is a sense of unreality and timelessness to Windy Tales\' world--compounded by Kenji Kawai\'s soundtrack--which fits the seemingly-endless summers of adolescence and the equally-endless days of school. It\'s not the kind of show you should binge, but one that should be taken slowly and casually, the kind of thing that could hypnotize you if you\'re ready to get on its wavelength. If you\'ve ever wanted Dennou Coil\'s sense of urban mystery with Tekkonkinkreet\'s abstract-fantastical sensibilities, Windy Tales is your show. this ""wind in the heart"" serves as a symbol for untapped potential and childhood innocence (which most users lose at a certain age, but some rare adults manage to retain).

Iyashi-kei always has a kind of animistic, spiritual element to it (hence i\'ve always thought...to myself that Blame! is in part like Iyashi-kei without any divine harmony, no benevolent gods or spirits, only the chaotic god of the out of control, autoimmune-diseased netsphere and megastructure itself, conjuring new sentient forms and new material out of thin air).the wind rises when the heart is moved. daily life is kind of a vehicle toward finding these moments. it\'s not riding the motorcycle, it\'s not becoming an idol, it\'s not the first kiss. these are all just the clouds, the haystacks. occasions to feel the wind. it\'s because of the wind that we are even motivated to pursue these mundane objects and events. but what is it about a first kiss that stirs up the wind? in the episode about the cherry blossoms it\'s acknowledged that a poem about missing the cherry blossoms can be even more profound and beautiful than one about seeing them. amid these sorts of missed opportunities and connections, does the wind move, or not?i don\'t think the series shows a moment of this kind, but i am inclined to think yes. or rather, it shows such moments, but never with the wind moving, even while it seems to acknowledge that it should. it doesn\'t put two and two together here. however, i can also certainly imagine a first kiss so terrible, so unsatisfactory or unwanted that nothing moves at all. perhaps there are both pleasing and unpleasing failures and misrecognitions of these kinds.perhaps really it would NOT be the failure to get at the desired thing that leads to the wind\'s stillness, but actually getting the thing most deeply desired, bringing the end of desire itself, the lack of the constitutive lack of subjectivity. the final gust of wind. with no wind left, there\'s no reason to go on searching for moments and situations that make the wind fly.like in Cardcaptor Sakura when Sakura has the nightmarish vision of a world where the characters don\'t have a desire for each other anymore during her final trial, and it revitalizes her to keep fighting (appropriately, the series ended for 20 years at the moment she finally confessed her own feelings). i wish Fuujin Monogatari explored this a bit more, but i also can\'t complain much about the episodes that we got. well.. maybe i would\'ve replaced the one with the stupid squirrel (plz forgive me...).i would have to admit that this is not the kind of premise i go for too much these days, but it was nice to watch and offers some things to think about, if one chooses. i actually really liked the episode where Nao keeps passing these auditions to become an idol and she\'s just like ""why me? this is terrible. why did they have to decide that i\'m special?"" which i thought was quite truthful. and all of her classmates start thinking there really is something special about her, while she\'s exactly the same. i was dreading the outcome of her auditions. maybe the apparent disaster represented by Nao, who won\'t even submit her photos to contests, winning the opportunity to become an idol, is echoed by the impossibility of Yukio and Taiki ending up together, or Makino-sensei and the married school nurse he clings to. to myself that Blame! is in part like Iyashi-kei without any divine harmony, no benevolent gods or spirits, only the chaotic god of the out of control, autoimmune-diseased netsphere and megastructure itself, conjuring new sentient forms and new material out of thin air).the wind rises when the heart is moved. daily life is kind of a vehicle toward finding these moments. it\'s not riding the motorcycle, it\'s not becoming an idol, it\'s not the first kiss. these are all just the clouds, the haystacks. occasions to feel the wind. it\'s because of the wind that we are even motivated to pursue these mundane objects and events. but what is it about a first kiss that stirs up the wind?

Ginga Densetsu Weed,https://myanimelist.net/anime/915/Ginga_Densetsu_Weed,"[""Edit: After I re-watched this series, I have decided to re-review Ginga Densetsu Weed. I realize that I wasn't in the best of moods while writing my previous entry and now I'll write this review with a more... Level head.Ginga Densetsu Weed is the sequel to Ginga Nagareboshi Gin. Both share a few of the same characters and the like. Ginga Densetsu Weed, however, is much newer (having been made in 2005 while Ginga Nagreboshi Gin being made in 1986). However, being relatively new does not automatically make it great, but GDW might be worth looking into since there is an extreme lack in dog...anime out there (that aren't cute anyway).Yes, Ginga Densetsu Weed has comedy scenes, but this is no Massugu ni Ikou (A rather overly-cute dog anime). GDW is an action anime, with cannibal dogs, assassinations, and even Ninja dogs. Humans play almost no role in the anime.The main character is Weed, an Akita / Kishu mixed dog that is the son of Gin (the main character in Ginga Nagareboshi Gin) and Sakura. Weed has an extreme sense of justice and is also a good fighter despite being less than a year old. He is perhaps the most annoying main character you'll ever find.The voice acting was good to an extent. But voice actors were changed and some character even shared the same voice so it was clear that Studio DEEN wasn't trying very hard.Probably the lowest point of Ginga Densetsu Weed is the animation quality. Studio DEEN had on and off days with this. For instance, the last episode had great animation, but there were scenes in other parts of the series that makes eyes bleed. Sometimes the animators would animate every limb separately to make a nice flowing animation; other times the most animation in a scene was moving the character designs up and down. Studio DEEN should learn proper canine anatomy before making an anime that involves dogs as main characters.The background scenery was pretty though.And speaking of character designs, Studio DEEN made some weird changes. They changed Gin's eye color from brown to blue (probably to match Weed) and made both Gin and Weed a pretty good shade of blue; almost to the point of being unnatural. Ben's collar seems to have changed color and other little tidbits are there.The anime and manga differences are to be expected. The manga (running 50+ volumes currently) is longer and therefore is definitely different from the anime. The anime, being a measly 26 episodes, ends with only two arcs completed [Kaibutsu and Fight for Gajou arcs]. Some characters were never introduced in the anime and other times some scenes were changed from their original format.The anime ending was also completely different.Maybe the GDW anime is trying to be more positive than its manga counterpart. Considering that Gajou blows up, Sniper tries to get revenge on Gin, George is there, etc, etc, happened in the manga and not in the anime... Studio DEEN is still being hypocritical about characters and sub-plots by killing off some characters when they didn't die in the manga and adding characters that weren't even in the original story.The Ginga Densetsu Weed anime overall was a let down.This version just can't live up to the manga: It doesn't follow the original storyline at all, characters are left out that are vital to the story, Weed is whiner than usual, everyone was made into hypnotized robots in the anime and mutually accepted Weed as leader, they made the old dogs weak to make the younger dogs look cooler, and there are so many plot holes it's not even funny.Ginga Densetsu Weed anime in a nutshell:~ Pros:+ OP and EN themes songs are great+ Can be enjoyable to watch at some points~ Cons:- Inconstant animation- Change from old voice actors/lazy hiring- Too short compared to the manga- Weed- PLOTHOLESEnd Note: Many people, despite there being obvious flaws in the anime, still enjoy watching this series (I admit that I did during my first run-through since I read the manga afterwords) so you really shouldn't skip out on GDW. It's just that... The manga's better.

The story line, characters, they were all made carefully and actually had me crying during things like deaths, and betrayals. If you are looking for a new anime to watch this would defiantly be the anime to watch.The art was good but I think the way they moved their mouths and some of the actions done could have been a bit better. But that shouldn't affect the overall Storyline and the overall of this action packed anime. Throughout the whole series it had me starring at the computer screen,...I couldn't take my eyes off of it.So if you enjoy action, a bit of blood, a deep storyline, as well as even just dogs. This is an anime you should watch. I couldn't take my eyes off of it.So if you enjoy action, a bit of blood, a deep storyline, as well as even just dogs. This is an anime you should watch."", ""My god I remember watching this back in 2007. This was seriously the most fun I've had watching a 26 episode anime.The story is really interesting, it has two parts to it. The first part is about some lab experiment gone wrong in Japan that results in a half dog half lion creature that kills a bunch of the lab dogs, but befriends a german shepared who apperes later in the show. Its pretty weird and has nothing to do with the actual main story, except introduce the german shepard character and his strange past.The second part is more about the akia...dog Weed, and how he finds out that he's the son of the legendary bear killing dog, Gin. Weed goes on a journey to find his dad and on the way meets many other dogs before becoming their leader. Weed and co. encounter two evil great dane brothers who are trying to find Weed and kill the remaining family of Gin.This anime has a lot of emotion for having dogs as the main characters. But its still great to watch, and if you are a dog lover like I am, you will love to see all the different kinds of dogs. What I think these series represent is the courage to fight for whats right, no matter the species. Weed goes through a lot of struggles in the show and becomes a better dog because of it, he grows from a scared little puppy to a fierce leader, like his father.I haven't seen the original Gin series, But I'm sure I would like it because the concept is so ingaging. Never thought I would enjoy an anime about dogs more then most about people.Take care everyone. dog Weed, and how he finds out that he's the son of the legendary bear killing dog, Gin. Weed goes on a journey to find his dad and on the way meets many other dogs before becoming their leader. Weed and co. encounter two evil great dane brothers who are trying to find Weed and kill the remaining family of Gin.This anime has a lot of emotion for having dogs as the main characters. But its still great to watch, and if you are a dog lover like I am, you will love to see all the different kinds of dogs.

And it's prequel, is in my top 3s right along with this one. I actually started with this one when watching the series, but as soon as i realized there was a series before this one, (Ginga Nagareboshi Gin) i stopped at episode 2 and watched the whole first series, then i continued this one after about at most, a week after finishing the first one. I was totally impressed with the difference in art, and sound, (then again these were made 20 years apart, and it did bother me that they...changed the look of tthe dogs from the Ginga Nagareboshi Gin, which had a change in color, and slight change in patterns on some of the dogs) but it didn't stop me from watching it at all, i was once again sucked into the story and I enjoyed it just as much as, if not more than the first part. It has just as much action and adventure as the first one, and slightly more comedy, (but still not much), One thing i would like to note though that bothered me, is that there was no sign of the same humans from the first series that took care of Gin (Weed's father), they, in a way, would have probably allowed me to rate a 20 out of 10, (if that was ever possible), and it also bothered me that Weed never got the oppurtunity to have a human friend/partner like his father gin. but with all of the unique dog personalities, the human involvement didn't bother me as much in this show (but i guess you could say i just love the idea of a human having an animal as a partner/friend, so that is why my ratings stay how they are, and aren't lowered) this one is a bit more bloody and gory then the first one, but once again, it is still worth the watch. changed the look of tthe dogs from the Ginga Nagareboshi Gin, which had a change in color, and slight change in patterns on some of the dogs) but it didn't stop me from watching it at all, i was once again sucked into the story and I enjoyed it just as much as, if not more than the first part.

This is possibly the hardest review I\'ll ever do considering the opinions of many on this series which is so dear for me, but I\'ll try my best to make this a good review. I got to know this series almost immediately after I had seen GNG, so I also got to know this at a young age and it also became one of my favorite series! At the time, though, I couldn\'t say which one is slightly better, because now I know that this doesn\'t completely surpass GNG, but I...still don\'t think this series is as bad as other fans say!Story: 9/10The story is still quite addictive like its predecessor, the only difference being that there are two villain arcs here: Kaibutsu arc (not the character\'s real name, it just means ""monster"" in Japanese, but fans know him better by that name so I\'ll use this ""name""), which includes episodes 1-5, and Hougen arc which includes rest of the series, episodes 6-26. Both were well-built antagonists whose tragic pasts gave them the motivation to be the way they are. Kaibutsu had been used as a test animal and Hougen had been kept with his brother Genba in a dark cabin throughout his childhood. However, I would say maybe the latter arc was better because, well, it was longer and had more time to focus on the relationships between the characters. Also, the substitute thing in the first arc was a bit weird, just like in the manga. ""Gin"" appears to Weed, but then when he dies, it\'s revealed that he wasn\'t the real Gin, but Gin\'s substitute Tokimune, which feels like Takahashi wanted to trick his readers/viewers. In any case, GDW\'s story also contains a lot of sad and touching moments, and I often find myself being a touched a little more when watching this series than in GNG (for example Sakura\'s death, Smith\'s death, John\'s death, Toubee\'s death and Jerome\'s death (even tho he doesn\'t die in the manga))!Also I like that this have a bit more humor than in GNG in my opinion which provides a good contrast to the serious series. The fights are still great too, even the duel between Weed and Hougen at the end, although otherwise the ending feels a bit rushed when Hougen had to be killed in a really amusing way and randomly WITH A LIGHTNING STRIKE! But since the very final scene is absolutely wonderful, I forgive the creators of the series for this.Art: 7/10And now we get to the part that is perhaps the most criticized by fans, which is Studio Deen\'s animation! It\'s true that the quality has dropped a bit from GNG, but it\'s still not the worst animation I\'ve seen. Sometimes it feels like they just didn\'t know how to draw or animate dogs properly, which is understandable because Deen has mostly only made series about people. However, it has never bothered me because I take these things with humor and like to make memes of these funny animation moments. I would say that in terms of animation, the best episodes are 1, 5 and 26. The others are mostly average, not that good but not that bad either. I also kind of like the style of episode 19 because it fits quite well with the rather comedy oriented episode where GB is the hero and that\'s why it\'s one of my favorite episodes!Sound: 9/10Since this series is much newer than GNG, naturally the sound quality is also significantly better. However, there are some strange solutions, such as the voice actors imitating the dog, which sometimes feels a bit embarrassing, instead of using a real dog\'s sound like in GNG which slightly lowers the scores (thankfully, at least they used it sometimes, for example at the beginning of episode 10, where the dogs howl in grief after John\'s death).Music: 9/10GDW\'s music don\'t surpass GNG\'s, but it\'s still very good! Despite Y2DOGS clearly plagiarizing/copying from other composers, that fact doesn\'t take away from the enjoyment. My favorite songs from the OST are: ""Successor to the Spirit"", ""Onward, Soldiers"", ""GB\'s Theme"", ""Kyoshiro\'s Theme"", ""Escape From Death"",  ""The Iron Hammer of Justice"", ""His Name Is Weed"" and ""The Breath of Ouu"". Like its predecessor, GDW also has really good opening and ending themes, ""Ginga Densetsu WEED"" and ""Tsukiakari"" by Dohatsuten. Also the insert song from the episodes 4 and 20, ""Way of the Soldier - Way of the Beast"" is so banger!However, unfortunately some badass tracks aren\'t heard in the anime, like ""Akame\'s Theme"" and some songs heard in the anime weren\'t released for the OST, (like the ultimate tear jerker ""Tears for the fallen""), so the music also gets a 9/10 from me.Voice acting: 10/10Surprisingly, the voice acting is the best part of this series! The great seiyuus have been chosen for the characters, who know what they are doing. GB was even voiced by the real comedian Naru Kawamoto, who knows how to capture the character\'s comedic features very well! Also, Sachi Kokuryu is really good as Weed, despite the fact that she was still a new voice actress in this career. Kouji Ishii also does a very impressive job as the main villain himself, Hougen!Characters: 8/10Otherwise, I would give the same scores as in the GNG review, but since the anime has left out a lot of characters, I will give a little less. For example Daisuke, who was a familiar character already from GNG and was a really important character in the manga after all, and Ben and Cross\'s son Jouji (or George, in the Finnish translated manga he was Jouji) have been completely left out of the anime. Also, some characters were much more tolerable in the manga, like Mer, while in the anime, I don\'t think he did anything important except in the episode 12 where he protected the Gajou alone. Many fans find Weed particularly annoying in the anime, but I find his morals rather just a little odd. He keeps saying that he doesn\'t approve of killing, but he still killed some characters like Kaibutsu and Sancho the wild boar (although it might have been just defense, but then again, he didn\'t agree to kill Hougen at the end...). Otherwise, GDW is also full of great characters and it\'s always really nostalgic to see old characters from GNG again.Enjoyment: 10/10After all, despite its problems, GDW is still a really enjoyable anime. It has a lot of drama, epicness and emotions that will make me touching again and again!Overall, GDW gets 9/10 from me! It\'s a very controversial sequel among fans, but for me it\'s almost as good as GNG even tho GNG is a bit better!

Please respect that without further ado. Please mind if there are any grammatical errors. I\'ll try to keep it a little brief though.Story: (9)I loved this original story for Ginga Densentsu Weed. Like how life goes, there are events throughout the show that draws the characters a little off corse. But there aren\'t so much where the characters are blinded to what their main goal is. Like many shounen anime, there will be various fight scenes. Bloodshed, bruises, and the tension of the battle field. There was never a time...in the anime did I think ""is it done yet?""Art: (7)Dogs and wolves, what an interesting idea. The dogs\' movements sometimes look a little wonky. Especially when you see the backs of them as they run. All the other movements are actually very well done. The muscles of the dogs are a little humanized, so the art style is a little bit of an acquired taste.Sound: (6)The characters don\'t have a bad sound quality. You never hear the audio break or have wrong sound effects. Things sound right, and never dip. It never sounded stuffy when it comes to sound quality.Characters: (10)I became very attached to all the characters in Ginga Densentsu Weed. Whenever a character died I wanted to cry. The character development was gradual, but you could feel like you knew the characters all your life. There were no surprises when it came to character actions. Characters didn\'t break from their personality, and I couldn\'t hate any of the characters. Even the antagonists you could definitely feel sypothy for. Sometimes there were times where I didn\'t want the main antagonists to die.Overall: (9)Overall this is my favorite anime. I could rewatch every episode without getting tired of a character. in the anime did I think ""is it done yet?""Art: (7)Dogs and wolves, what an interesting idea.

But let\'s dig a bit deeper.Story:The storyline is continuous, each episode builds on the previous ones. And because this is a sequel it even builds a lot onto the prequel anime, Ginga Nagareboshi Gin. However, it\'s not a problem if you haven\'t seen that one first, because this anime will tell the basic things which you need to know...in order to understand who is who in the story.It could be said that the plot is pretty simple, there is the Big Bad, and the protagonists have to defeat him to bring peace. At first it might look this simple, but when we see the backstory of the villains, and different problems arises between the protagonists, then the story suddenly doesn\'t feel very simple at all. Sometimes it even presents situations where one cannot make a right moral decision, but the main character still have to do something. Apart from this we get a deep-dive in the feelings of a few of the protagonists, which results in very touching moments, and makes us understand them even better.Now as I write all of this, the story might seem dramatic. It is, but of course as in most story even here there is a comic relief, who can always put a smile on the viewers\' faces.There are many fighting scenes in series, and they\'re all exciting and well made. Sometimes the characters need to use strategy and bluffing to keep their lives, and at other times they die like heroes while giving speeches which are heart-gripping.The end of the story is unarguably beautiful and satisfying, we get a nice happy ending, even if not everything is happy. The final battle was a bit rushed, and was altered in a weird way, but it\'s kind of understandable, and not that bad.Art:This aspect is the one which is the most controversial among fans. It\'s undeniable, there are badly animated scenes, where the faces and shapes really look weird. But this is not that common. Many people have strong opinion about Deen\'s animation quality, but here they were able to achieve a decent animation, with some scenes being a bit derpier, but also some episodes were animated outstandingly good. For example in many scenes the lighting is astonishing, and they paid great attention to the details. So if you heard at some places that this anime has ""crappy animation"", then I would advise you to still give it a chance, it\'s not as bad as they say.The backgrounds were always drawn very beautifully, and those combined with the beautiful lighting could create a very memorable and touching moment.Sounds:The sounds are great, and seiyuus are awesome! Everyone\'s voice fits well, and they could always give the feeling what they needed to give.The music were amazing, some of them rose the given scene so high... It really enhanced the experience. Especially when suddenly in a dramatic scene a fitting music starts playing, and from that point on not only the characters talk, but it\'s something lot more. My personal favorite is the opening and ending, ""Verge of Death"", ""Spirit of Succession"", but all of them great.Characters:This is also an aspect of the anime in which it really shines. The main protagonists starts out as a puppy, who know very little, so obviously he will make mistakes. Sometimes his decisions might even seem wrong, but he is still learning, and developing. And I think this is a great thing in this anime. If we look back from the end to the beginning of the story, then we can see how much each character have developed. It\'s hard to tell specifics without spoilers, but many characters will change their minds entirely about specific things, and this is also very satisfying to watch.It\'s a good feature in the series that at the end the team of protagonists is not a randomly assembled group of strays, but all the characters are well known, and we know what to expect from them.The villains were also interesting in this series, especially the first one, but generally all of them had an interesting backstory, which makes the viewers understand why they became so ruthless.Enjoyment:If you like action animes with animals, then I\'m pretty sure you\'ll have a good time watching this series. The drama, emotions, and epic action hooked me a lot.In my opinion this series is one of those which cannot be forgotten easily, it has many memorable scenes and likeable characters. So I would recommend everyone to give it a try. Maybe you will enjoy it even more if you already seen the prequel, but as I said at the beginning it\'s not necessary. in order to understand who is who in the story.It could be said that the plot is pretty simple, there is the Big Bad, and the protagonists have to defeat him to bring peace.

Even tho GDW is newer than GNG I still think that GNG is animated better. I think you all have seen those GDW animation fail pics and if you haven't you really should check some out.First few episodes are well made but then in some point it seems that animating gets a bit different. I can't really explain it so you should really see it by yourself.GNG and GDW share some same characters like Akame,Smith and John.Even tho I didn't like animating at some points the story is emotional and just simply awesome. I know GDW has kinda like same plot...as GNG but tyrannical bear was just changed to huge dog.I've watched this anime many times and I own the completed series box but anyway I prefer manga version and GDW manga story actully goes further than anime. as GNG but tyrannical bear was just changed to huge dog.I've watched this anime many times and I own the completed series box but anyway I prefer manga version and GDW manga story actully goes further than anime."", ""The series was good, no doubt and it does make a fair watch for all those watchers who are into animal-related anime series.

In Weed\'s defense, many say: ""Oh, well hes just a puppy!"" but think about this, Gin was only two-three weeks when he was faced with Akakabuto and his destiny, yet he took it head-on and did a very good job with facing his enemies. Yes, Weed is very smart and powerful for such...a young dog, but he needs to learn more. Perhaps it will come with expirance.However, the animation for the Anime was absolutly horrible. Such as, in Episode #2 - almost everything looked like a box or out of proportion.The manga was well-drawn, at the least.Anyways, the emotional deph in the deathes of some old characters (Ex: John, Moss, ETC...) was very deep. They all died for the sake of their beliefs and their friends, which I personally think touched many. Personally, it touched me as well. Even with some of the newer characters that were recently introduced and then killed off, (Ex: Kaibutus, Shigure, ETC...) had their own stories that seemed to \'rattle\' the reality most of us face. (EX: Kaibutsu with Animal Testing). The emotional deph was amazing, and I must give Yoshihiro Takahashi and Studio DEEN that much.Some of the voices, I found, were a bit confusing. Such as in the case of Mel, the Golden Retriever puppy. He was a male, but his voice sounded a bit femine.There were aso differences with older characters appreances. Such as Gin, who was silver with blackish stripes and brown eyes. They changed him to blue with no stripes and blue eyes. And John, who was giving a lighter coat color and brighter eyes. They also mis-played Akakabuto\'s death in the flashback beginning. In the GDW(Ginga Densetsu Weed) Anime they suggested that Gin took out Akakabuto\'s heart, when it was really his head he took off.And with the Antagonists, such as Hougen, Genba and Kamakiri - many of them had very interesting, painful pasts that seemed to tie in to how they grew up and reacted around others. I think that the fate of bad animal breeding and horrible animal testing is a very real, very sorrowful world issue that Yoshihiro Takahashi delivered in his messages with GDW & GNG.Personally, I prefer GNG(Ginga Nagareboshi Gin) over Ginga Densetsu Weed.

Gegege no Kitarou (2018),https://myanimelist.net/anime/37140/Gegege_no_Kitarou_2018,"['Even though Gegege no Kitaro is an really old anime series, i\'ve never had any contact with Kitaro series before this 2018 version, even if since 1968 it has a new remake airing each decade...At first, to a person who never heard about Gegege no Kitaro, the anime seems silly and adding the children rate, most people would not even give a chance to this one, but thank God i gave that chance... becauseconsidering it is a children rated anime, which is mostly to introduce the yokai culture to the new generation, this anime is really amazing.Instead of treat Yokais as something silly...with superficial stories and mostly censured to a children... this anime do the opposite. Since the beginning it\'s said ""Just because we can\'t see them, doens\'t mean they doesn\'t exists""... and the episodic stories about the yokais are told in a deep way while makes lots of critizes related to Japan\'s society, and all these stories are embedded within the modern tenet of the 21st century, such as the use of technology for support on yokai related situations, something that didn\'t exists in previous versions.Story: 9/10As i said before, instead of tell superficial stories just to introduce the yokais to the new generations, the anime has a good way of treat the stories while mixes the darkest moments with good comical timing, what holds you in the show. Also using a totally original character (Mana Inuyama), a human, to introduce the yokai Kitarou and his crew to the anime watchers, in the first episode was a really good move, and it\'s really good that she is a regular character who actually has some plot.Art: 8/10To a Toei\'s anime it\'s has a really good art, having a good amount of consistence in the character design and being very well animated in action points.Sound: 9/10The vibes that Yasuharu Takanashi\'s musics give fits very well with this anime story theme, something old, mixed with more modern arrangements that contrasts with the ""introduction of tecnology in modern days to Kitaro and his crew"".Characters: 8/10It has really good main characters, these being are introduced through the episodes. All the characters have their moments, and even the original girl seems to have some good developments with Kitaro, who is more colder in this version compared to previous ones.Enjoyment: 10/10I really liked this anime, more than i should haha, but i can really say something... This anime is amazing, so good that made me look for the previous versions to watch.General: 9/10It\' is a really good anime.

It's long and unless you're really into Japanese yokai and folktales you most likely won't like this series that much. However it still is really good and fun to watch.This series is a mixture of a sort of overall main plot of trying to get humans and yokai to get along, while also having many sub stories that take a few episodes to just being episodic of one episode stories. In all, each of the stories were interesting with few exceptions, and have some relevance to the main plot. I both laughed, felt extremely sad, and really...happy while watching the series and while it's not one of my favorite shows of all time it has a close place in my heart.The characters are all pretty interesting and our main cast get some good character development while the other side characters don't really get all that screen time they do get like an episode or two which gives them the spotlight and after awhile, especially after watching the show for 2 years, the characters really grow on you.It's one of those shows where after awhile you feel like a part of their group, you feel like you're apart of Gegege forest and close to the characters, as long as you like or at least semi like the characters and story.Overall, was a fun show to watch weekly for 2 years, sad it ended after all this time but I had a blast. Definitely not a series for everyone but give it a few episodes and see if you enjoy it. happy while watching the series and while it's not one of my favorite shows of all time it has a close place in my heart.The characters are all pretty interesting and our main cast get some good character development while the other side characters don't really get all that screen time they do get like an episode or two which gives them the spotlight and after awhile, especially after watching the show for 2 years, the characters really grow on you.It's one of those shows where after awhile you feel like a part of their group, you feel like you're apart of Gegege forest and close to the characters, as long as you like or at least semi like the characters and story.Overall, was a fun show to watch weekly for 2 years, sad it ended after all this time but I had a blast.

As an adult, however, the episodes are usually enjoyable but can be a bit hit or miss. However, the show isn't afraid to delve into much darker themes which have produced some great episodes that I would see myself going back and re-watching.I never grew up with Gegege no Kitarou so the entire idea of yokai was new to me. Though, that never decreased how much I liked the show or my understanding. On the other hand, the older watchers are more than likely watching it (at least in some...part) out of nostalgia. part) out of nostalgia."", 'Updated, no-spoiler review. We\'re at 51 episodes, and the Sixth GeGeGe no Kitaro adaptation is going into its second year of airing. Congratulations!As I stated in my old review, I grew up with GGGnK and am very familiar with the series. Viewers should be going in knowing that this is an Anime centered around Japanese folklore that introduces new yokai [usually] every week. Being ""G"" rated doesn\'t mean it is a kid\'s anime. It means it is an anime that EVERYONE can enjoy, though there are some gruesome scenes that might give kids nightmares (it is an action/comedy/horror anime, after all).Everyone has their own...opinions, so stick with it and find out for yourself. If you do that, you\'ll begin to understand how the show is set up, see some development, get some laughs, bust some yokai and learn some lessons before making the decision to walk out the door.Story: 10GeGeGe no Kitaro is known to be centered around the story of the last survivor of the Ghost Tribe who fights for peace between Yokai and Humans. The directors of this adaptation take this and bring it to us, the society of the 21st century. The use of satire and social commentary throughout the series makes this adaptation perfect for all ages, as I guarantee there is more to come and more to learn. All in all, if you respect Japanese culture, are interested in Yokai and love a nice horror/comedy anime that makes you self-reflect, you\'ll enjoy this. GGGnK touches upon a variety of themes (Action, Comedy, Emotional, Horror, Supernatural/Yokai, etc), so there\'s an episode or arc fit for everyone.Although many of the episodes come from the late creator\'s original stories, we\'re introduced to new major threats and many new arcs in contrast to the usual GeGeGe no Kitaro we see in the majority of the previous adaptations. The new ""Four Generals of Jigoku"" arc is already incredible, today\'s episode (episode 51) did me in yet again. I love GGGnK as a whole, but this is definitely the arc to look forward to if you\'re just starting!Art: 9As I stated in my previous review, this adaptation is definitely eye-candy quality in comparison to the previous 1968, 1971, 1985, 1996, and 2007 ones prior to it. The balance of colors and the shading especially. The animation style is visually appealing and fits the overall tone of each episode. Yes, the ""quality"" of the art will appear to fluctuate throughout the series, but it is incredible when it needs to be in iconic stories or heated episodes. There are ""Easter Eggs"" as well, so it\'s always fun to look for more as a fan since childhood.Sound: 10I absolutely love the classic opening and the creative, unique endings they bring to the show. If you listen closely to the soundtrack, many of them will be instrumental remixes of the classic opening song and other classic originals. They even slid in nostalgic sound effects, while others are modernized and suit the series well. The voice acting is extremely well executed, too. I loved Miyuki Sawashiro after hearing her play her Kurapika role, and now she\'s playing Kitaro, who are both my two favorite characters of all time!Character: 10GeGeGe no Kitaro has MANY characters, and they are unique and original. Some characters have minor personality changes throughout the adaptations but generally stay the same. These characters develop and are not forgotten. Keep an eye out--- even if their main story is over, you will see them again in later episodes.I also love how many have changed according to the modern day times.Enjoyment: 10I\'m greatly enjoying this masterpiece. I love everything about it: the story, the satire, the nostalgia, the comedy, the characters, the soundtrack, the hype, etc. It\'s great to see recurring characters and their new designs. The social commentary is absolutely amazing as well, and that itself is a reason to watch this historical and significant Anime. This adaptation mixes things up and adds in new concepts while keeping some old ones, so even old fans that know the generalities are kept on their feet. I LOVE this adaptation, it\'s doing an incredible job. Again, this new arc has me hyped all over again!Overall: 10Overall, GGGnK is a show fit for all audiences, especially with that social commentary. Although some aspects are aimed towards children for their enjoyment,  GGGnK is heavy in horror/dark themes and social commentary, which is of course aimed toward an older audience that can comprehend the deeper meaning of each episode. Of course, I\'ll rate this a 10, and would rate it higher if I could.

To have something so constant in your life for so long to be gone. It's making cry thinking about it being over honestly. Kitaro was something I'd never even heard of until this anime was announced. Had not a clue it was the 6th Kitaro or anything about it other than dealing with yokai. Just saw that something was replacing Dragonball Super at its time so why the hell not see what could possibly have the prestige to pull that off.Didn't think I'd get this invested in the show really. Kitaro with Daddy...Eyeball, Catchick, Sand Witch, Wally Wall, Oldman Crybaby, and even Ratman, were such a solid heart to this show. When it started I still couldn't wrap my brain around the whole thing but these characters and how the world looked with this style drew me in and kept me wanting to come back at the start. Mana being an audience surrogate helped too, brining us into this yokai world we knew nothing about.With it being mostly episodic, not including the few specific arcs scattered about, we were given the chance to slowly acclimate to this yokai world. Other than a single two part story I think every single episode of the first half of year one was a single self contained episode. which was a lot of fun really. Paid off huge later when we saw some of those characters come back in year two but even at the beginning it was cool seeing Kitaro take on these unique yokai conflicts.Also going with that since things were mostly one offs there was a fair amount of dud episodes imo. Episodes that I either found boring or just not too interesting at all. Not a majority or anything even close but maybe out of the nearly hundred episodes I'd say ten to fifteen were meh and just kinda episodes I shrugged at. Now the actual story arcs that developers over time were something to see! I loved loved all of them. Taking on Faceless, Backbeard and the Western yokai with Agnes and Adele, the Four Generals with Rei, the finally against Nurarihyon. All were amazing storylines that had me glued. And on top of that there were some gems floating around in the single story episode soup. A couple specific ones that I still recall being awesome on their own.Bringing all this together was I'm sure no easy feat. Have to applied Toei for bringing Kitaro to the modern day these few decades into the 21st century. Like I said never seen a Kitaro series before this one but so glad I decided all the way back then to give this a try and all this time of thinking to never let go.It's bittersweet saying goodbye, especially this way I mean omg Mana in the finale broke my heart, but I understand it's necessary to stop after a certain point. Kitaro thank you so much for this journey. I loved so much of it and certainly glad I spent all these days watching. There's many lessons about harmony and discrimination to be learned from this show and glad to have experienced them.8/10 Eyeball, Catchick, Sand Witch, Wally Wall, Oldman Crybaby, and even Ratman, were such a solid heart to this show.

Then Gegege no Kitarou is the right anime for you.This 2018 version will show you how good Gegege no Kitarou anime is. Since in this series, it takes place into the 21st century which is quite different from the older versions. The existence of yokai is forgotten in this generation which results alot of disastrous phenomena in the human world. But there is one yokai who avoid...these occurrences and that is Gegege no Kitaro, our protagonist, along with his human and yokai friends.Every episode, you will know alot of different curses and yokai in Japan. Not only that, it gives alot of lessons in life which is actually good for young viewers.The art is amazing and way better than the previous series which is a very yes and keeps you to stay watching.Sounds are good as well, add those opening and ending tracks which gives you the vibe of ghosts and yokais.There are alot of Characters to be known and if you do not know yet, old versions of the series has almost hundreds of episodes hopefully in this series too.Overall the enjoyment in this anime is very good especially when action battle strikes on.

However, when you think of it in terms of marketability for the West, it does make sense. The entire franchise is filled to the brim with Japanese social commentary, and the very foundation of the series is based on Japanese Youkai and folktales, which is why it’s so fascinating to see the most recent iteration, in 2018, simulcast on Crunchyroll. What’s more fascinating is how it happens that this season is so...radically different from its predecessors in representing its era. It makes perfect sense that this season is the first to be brought overseas, as it not only signifies a new era for the franchise but also demonstrates just how much society has changed.(This review contains minor spoilers)Now, I understand that that last sentence reads rather pompous, but, trust me, it makes sense in the context of what this franchise is. As I mentioned before, Gegege no Kitarou airs a new 50–100 episode season every decade, and with it, commentary on the society each season encompasses. Today, technology permeates our modern-day society in a way that is nearly unavoidable. I’m talking smartphones, computers, the internet, and social media. The 2018 series (which I’ll refer to as GGG2018 from now on) does not hesitate to utilise this and places a heavy focus on modern technology.Despite being aware of this before going into the show, it was still surreal to see GGG2018 open up its first episode to a man recording himself with a selfie stick causing disruptions at Shibuya crossing, only to be cursed and turned into a vampire tree. The people surrounding him all grab their phones and start recording and/or texting their friends about what just happened, only for everyone on the street to be turned into vampire trees themselves. We find out this was caused by a certain Youkai called Nobiagari, who plants seeds that suck blood and turn people into vampire trees. My favourite part about this opening scene is how GGG2018 immediately makes it very clear that we’ve entered a new era by putting a heavy emphasis on phone usage. As the episode progresses, we learn the man causing the disruption at the start is named ""Charatomi,"" who owns a YouTube channel and posts himself causing all sorts of problems around Japan. One of these videos involves him walking inside a random cave and ripping off a seal of the Youkai Nobiagari (lol). Interestingly, 5 months before the airing of this episode, Logan Paul entered the country and made national news after causing a huge ruckus on the streets, being disrespectful to the culture, and, well, we all know what else happened. We may not fully realise the scale of it, but YouTube is a massive phenomenon, and issues like these are a real problem. Hell, you still hear stories of idiots running around Japan and other countries with cameras in their faces causing problems today. This first episode does a great job showcasing what exactly this series is about and prepares us for what we can expect going forward, and boy does it deliver.A general idea explored throughout GGG2018 is how society is constantly changing over time and the effect that has on both humans and Youkai. Episode 6, for example, features a cat Youkai who is unable to properly feed off of human life energy in a rural town, as it lives off of the energy of humans simply by touching them, since over time more and more youth started moving to the city for school or work opportunities. This has caused the cat to slowly but unintentionally kill off the elderly population over time by stealing their life energy. The Youkai never meant any harm, but since the world is constantly changing and moving, incidents like this occur. Within this general idea of the world changing, one theme that particularly stood out to me was commentary on modern Japanese work ethic, which is the main focus of episode 9. This episode was about the Youkai \'Isogashi\' who specifically possess lazy people and cause them to be restless to want to get things going or done. Yet despite this power, he struggles to find anyone to possess because people are already overworking themselves with their jobs.The focus then shifts to the Kappa, who get lured into working an office job with the promise of many more cucumbers than they were collecting on their own (Kappa loves cucumbers). Before, the Kappa were living a lazy life playing sumo and swimming in rivers, yet they’re taken advantage of by the lure of something they love. However, after being overworked to oblivion, they find out that their salary of 3 cucumbers an hour is not nearly enough as the minimum wage when converted to yen and realise they’re being exploited. Enraged, the Kappa go on a rampage, making random people on the streets relaxed and lazy (that’s their ability, and yes, I know it sounds absurd, but Youkai have all sorts of weird powers lol), to the point where the Youkai Isogashi comes back and the usual Kitarou fighting shenanigans ensue. Afterwards, the Kappa realise that the life they were living before is much better for their wellbeing. Even if they weren\'t getting as many cucumbers, they appreciate and value the time they spend doing stuff they enjoy together, like swimming and sumo, while growing their own cucumbers to enjoy. This is one of my favourite episodes, as it encourages appreciating not only the little things in life but also the slow moments we have too. There are many more episodes that tackle the subject matter of work ethic, like episode 14, but those episodes are worth watching yourself as they’re some of the best this season has to offer.While GGG2018 defines its era through its themes and storytelling, I’d say an even more important aspect is this season’s artstyle. A fascinating upside of airing a new season every decade is seeing how the art and techniques change overtime. The 60s series is in black-and-white, the 70s is the first with colour, the 90s is the last cel animated season, the 2000s season is the first fully digitally animated, and the 2018 season is the first that utilises modern digital effects and lighting (which to me is the most defining part of this season’s art). What’ll stand out to anyone starting this season is the strong use of lighting—an almost over-exaggerated use. Lighting is often used to strategically build atmosphere by creating a stark contrast between the light-hearted and horror scenes. And it works! The over-exaggeration of the lighting lends itself to an almost overwhelming, eerie, and uncomfortable feeling. My favourite example of this is episode 25. It begins with a cold open inside a dark room; all we can see is the illuminating light of a phone. Then, it cuts eerily to a shot of a person hanging from the ceiling, and while we don’t see the noose, it’s clear they’ve hung themselves. This scene gave me goosebumps because it’s genuinely TERRIFYING. We learn later in the episode that a phone app was the cause of this suicide, once again showcasing how this season uses technology as a main theme. This is an element I’ve come to realise was missing from the 2007 series. From what I’ve seen of it, it has scary moments, but they often weren’t accompanied by meaningful lighting that built up the atmosphere. There are a few exceptions, like 2007’s Youkai Train episode, but those exceptions happen to be 2007’s greatest episodes, which were few and far between (sorry to diss on the 2007 series but I have my gripes with it lmao). I really do believe that 2018’s decision to utilise lighting in this way has done wonders for the tone and atmosphere.In terms of smartphone usage, one thing I want to mention is how Neko Musume has a phone she uses. It’s not treated as this gimmick where it’s like, “Hey guys look!! She’s using a phone!!!”. No, in reality, the phone is shown countless times throughout the series as a useful tool. She uses it to communicate with Mana, which then lets her relay information to Kitarou. She uses it to watch the news and stay caught up on anything related to Youkai. We even see Neko Musume discreetly take photos of Kitarou (because she is in love with him) and use them as her lock screen, which plays an important thematic role in episode 93. It’s not just phones, there are moments of technology use, like in episode 31 where Nezumi Otoko complains about how the crypto-currency he invested in lost all value in a single day (and this gag happens multiple times iirc lmfao). Social media addiction is often used as a theme, like in episodes 31 and 67, where they feature both humans and Youkai striving for more clicks and views while simultaneously pushing aside the important things in their lives. It’s amazing how they’ve managed to fully integrate technology, not as a gimmick but as a central theme of this entire season.Gegege no Kitarou 2018 is by no means a perfect season. Like most seasons in the franchise, it’s tainted by numerous fight scenes and episodes that focus entirely on battle shenanigans. I often found these episodes to be the least interesting part of the series, which really bogged down the experience for me. Fortunately, there are plenty of great episodic stories to watch, and the social commentary on the problems we face in the modern era is fascinating to watch. Furthermore, I would especially recommend this series if you have an interest in Youkai! This review has been somewhat all over the place, as it’s more like a thought dump of the aspects I liked. Thank you for reading, and I hope I’ve convinced you to check out this awesome franchise! radically different from its predecessors in representing its era. It makes perfect sense that this season is the first to be brought overseas, as it not only signifies a new era for the franchise but also demonstrates just how much society has changed.(This review contains minor spoilers)Now, I understand that that last sentence reads rather pompous, but, trust me, it makes sense in the context of what this franchise is. As I mentioned before, Gegege no Kitarou airs a new 50–100 episode season every decade, and with it, commentary on the society each season encompasses. Today, technology permeates our modern-day society in a way that is nearly unavoidable. I’m talking smartphones, computers, the internet, and social media. The 2018 series (which I’ll refer to as GGG2018 from now on) does not hesitate to utilise this and places a heavy focus on modern technology.Despite being aware of this before going into the show, it was still surreal to see GGG2018 open up its first episode to a man recording himself with a selfie stick causing disruptions at Shibuya crossing, only to be cursed and turned into a vampire tree. The people surrounding him all grab their phones and start recording and/or texting their friends about what just happened, only for everyone on the street to be turned into vampire trees themselves. We find out this was caused by a certain Youkai called Nobiagari, who plants seeds that suck blood and turn people into vampire trees. My favourite part about this opening scene is how GGG2018 immediately makes it very clear that we’ve entered a new era by putting a heavy emphasis on phone usage. As the episode progresses, we learn the man causing the disruption at the start is named ""Charatomi,"" who owns a YouTube channel and posts himself causing all sorts of problems around Japan. One of these videos involves him walking inside a random cave and ripping off a seal of the Youkai Nobiagari (lol). Interestingly, 5 months before the airing of this episode, Logan Paul entered the country and made national news after causing a huge ruckus on the streets, being disrespectful to the culture, and, well, we all know what else happened. We may not fully realise the scale of it, but YouTube is a massive phenomenon, and issues like these are a real problem. Hell, you still hear stories of idiots running around Japan and other countries with cameras in their faces causing problems today. This first episode does a great job showcasing what exactly this series is about and prepares us for what we can expect going forward, and boy does it deliver.A general idea explored throughout GGG2018 is how society is constantly changing over time and the effect that has on both humans and Youkai. Episode 6, for example, features a cat Youkai who is unable to properly feed off of human life energy in a rural town, as it lives off of the energy of humans simply by touching them, since over time more and more youth started moving to the city for school or work opportunities. This has caused the cat to slowly but unintentionally kill off the elderly population over time by stealing their life energy. The Youkai never meant any harm, but since the world is constantly changing and moving, incidents like this occur. Within this general idea of the world changing, one theme that particularly stood out to me was commentary on modern Japanese work ethic, which is the main focus of episode 9. This episode was about the Youkai \'Isogashi\' who specifically possess lazy people and cause them to be restless to want to get things going or done. Yet despite this power, he struggles to find anyone to possess because people are already overworking themselves with their jobs.The focus then shifts to the Kappa, who get lured into working an office job with the promise of many more cucumbers than they were collecting on their own (Kappa loves cucumbers). Before, the Kappa were living a lazy life playing sumo and swimming in rivers, yet they’re taken advantage of by the lure of something they love. However, after being overworked to oblivion, they find out that their salary of 3 cucumbers an hour is not nearly enough as the minimum wage when converted to yen and realise they’re being exploited. Enraged, the Kappa go on a rampage, making random people on the streets relaxed and lazy (that’s their ability, and yes, I know it sounds absurd, but Youkai have all sorts of weird powers lol), to the point where the Youkai Isogashi comes back and the usual Kitarou fighting shenanigans ensue. Afterwards, the Kappa realise that the life they were living before is much better for their wellbeing. Even if they weren\'t getting as many cucumbers, they appreciate and value the time they spend doing stuff they enjoy together, like swimming and sumo, while growing their own cucumbers to enjoy. This is one of my favourite episodes, as it encourages appreciating not only the little things in life but also the slow moments we have too. There are many more episodes that tackle the subject matter of work ethic, like episode 14, but those episodes are worth watching yourself as they’re some of the best this season has to offer.While GGG2018 defines its era through its themes and storytelling, I’d say an even more important aspect is this season’s artstyle.

An anime to calm down with during a period in my life that was less than stellar. But that wasn't exactly the case. The anime can make you feel better, but there are arcs and episodic episodes alike that will break your heart. And as perhaps the masochist I am, I craved more!This series...does have a storyline but it is mostly episodic episodes. So if your looking for a heavy story anime, this won't be for you. If you like learning about different yokai, both popular and not so, you'd enjoy this.The series is fun, wholesome, dark, sad, infuriating, and just a fun ride to take!

I already miss it XD"", ""Shows like this don't tend to get much attention. On MAL, we tend to pay more attention to the anime aimed at an older audience, and the only way a series aimed at a younger audience tends to break through is if it was part of our own childhoods like Pokemon or Digimon. So by that standard, Gegege no Kitaro 2018 is astonishing for even finding an audience in the first place. And part of that is the fact that while it's a children's anime ostensibly, it has plenty here for an older audience as well.Gegege no Kitaro is a very episodic show. It...has overarching plots that vary in how prominent they are, but the meat of it is individual episodes. And luckily for Gegege no Kitaro, those are consistently good with occasional real standouts. There's a good number of episodes I'd probably recommend to watch even outside of the series just because they are legitimately great, even fantastic in some cases. There's also a good number of episodes that are enjoyable, but don't leave much of an impression. But rarely episodes I outright despise. But the fact that at it's highest points the episodes are so good is a reason why you'd watch the series. One of the episodes legit made me cry, and I think I can count on one hand the number of anime that have done that.The second reason you'd watch this is because of the Yokai lore. The series is kinda fascinating to me just hearing about these Yokai and sometimes even connecting that to other bits of Japanese culture I've heard about. There's a handful of Yokai that I'd heard of through other places like Zashiki-warashi and it was interesting hearing a bit more about them here.As for why the series might not appeal, you still can tell in most cases it's aimed at a younger audience. Not like in a way where it talks down to you, but more so in how it uses action which is often not that interesting and the generally static nature of the characters. They do change a bit, but some characters really could've used with more development over the course of the series. (I am looking squarely at you Ratman)Overall, I'm really glad I watched this series consistently for close to 2 years. I'd say it's really good if you want something that can both surprise you but also be a kind of simple enjoyment at times.

I wouldn't expect anything too complicated, it's still an ooky-spooky family show if you're into that sort of thing.I mean, it's a big reason why I'm still watching 40+ episodes in. The level of ambition and commentary the show attempts to touch upon is impressive in my opinion. It's still strong on its own, but I like how it gives a lens into some of the issues in Japan and how they're being talked about in mainstream media like this. "", 'SS Review – GeGeGe no Kitaro (2018) Part 1 [Episodes 1 to 50](Short and Sour)I’m just going to refer to this series as Kitaro just to make things easier for me. Kitaro is a manga series from the 1960s by beloved author Shigeru Mizuki. His depictions of yokai are famous in Japan and statues of them are all over Japan too. Kirato has been adapted many times into anime and other media (even had a live-action film) the last anime outing was in 2008 with a film. I was completely in the dark about the series and had only watched the live-action films before, so...I was pretty much blind going in.The story is about a boy named Kitaro who is a yokai who takes requests from humans on help regarding other yokai, going as far as eliminating the yokai causing the issue (to be fair if there is a yokai just killing loads of people, Kitaro is like the yokai police). The show goes with a yokai of the week kind of flow for most of the time with having a few arcs in-between, some arcs are bigger than the others of course. The new character added in this new season is Mana and she has her own arc too. You’ve got other supporting characters like Ratman and Catchick or Wally Wall (he is basically a walking talking concrete wall) which have their own thing going like Ratman always tries to make money with some get rich quick scheme and Catchick is a tsundere like character who likes Kitaro.Wally is a mother****ing wall…Anyway that’s all I’ll say on the story and characters. Animation’s fine, its Toei so expect bare minimal effort from them. Kitaro is slightly better than the average that they put out (I’m looking at you One Piece, how the giants have fallen). OST is fine, endings are okay not much else to say on that. Love the classic opening.I am currently enjoying the series greatly, of course some weeks are better than others and I kind of feel the series should have really just ended as a major arc has just finished. But whatever, I’ll keep watching till it finishes and hopefully give a final verdict on the latter half of the series.7/10 I was pretty much blind going in.The story is about a boy named Kitaro who is a yokai who takes requests from humans on help regarding other yokai, going as far as eliminating the yokai causing the issue (to be fair if there is a yokai just killing loads of people, Kitaro is like the yokai police).

After replacing Dragon Ball Super, and seeing people bashing it, I thought the anime would just be something Toei would push out for the sake of filling the time slot. With the first episode, I found it to be decent. Nothing really great or much for me to write home about. I unironically hyped it up for the sake of taunting the Dragon Ball Super fanboys and their hate for it. But after watching a new episode each week, I grew to love the show. Now for one, the anime is...rated G, basically for all ages. But don't let that stop you from watching it. It does have pretty tame content at times but the show can deal with pretty mature themes as well. Nothing necessarily dark or gritty, but mostly dealing with real world concepts, such as Death, suicide, grief, murder, etc. Each episode tends to focus on something new to do with Yokai and how Kitaro and his friends get involved.It's not episodic until later on but these non episodic episodes are some of the best. Having good messages at the end, and the characters can suprise you at times when those good messages are turned upside down because of them.The characters are very likeable, with unique designs and abilities, and many of the Yokai or human characters they introduce upon every new episode are relatively always great.The artstyle is modernized, and stylish at the same time, having a sharp, detail, look to it, and how the anime does have horror elements, the sharp style works to the core of the show, with great direction to convey tone. Most often with this gritty look when it focuses on the mature content.There isn't always animation throughout each episode andat times, the animation can be standard.But when the animation does hit, it's quite good. Sometimes being fluid, and sometimes being fast paced.It does have fights, but don't expect some crazy, well, choreographed,  shoneness, world ending, battles.The music throughout can be compared to that of Naruto, with the use of the same instruments, and a lot of the themes used for scenes that don't involve action, can be uplifting or creepy, depending on the scene.There is also humor which can pretty wacky at times but it doesn't bring the quality down. If there's one episode I would really recommend watching, it would be Episode 7Which was the episode that got me to love this anime.Overall, I really enjoy this show on a weekly basis.It's G rating doesn't give it Justice, as people can be turned off from itBut Gegege no Kitaro doesn't fall on the lines of an all around kid friendly show and not to mention that it shows blood more frequently than DBS ever did, which was a problem I had with that show. Really, the only issue I had with the show is that it's first arc was a tad bit lackluster, but it soon improved.If you want something relatively enjoyable with fun characters, great episodes, naruto like music, and mature themes sprinkled throughout, Gegege no Kitaro is a great choice.Can't wait to see where it goes from here rated G, basically for all ages.

Oh and Kitaro was fine, I guess.This was a ridiculously long series and I was surprised I managed to finish this within a few weeks of casual watching. Gegege no Kitaro 2018 is a reboot of the traditionally famous Kitaro series which has been running since the first age of Japanese animation. I vaguely remembering the theme song from glancing a few episodes when I was a kid in Animax but somehow the song stuck to me. On 2020, amidst the abundance of freetime and quarantine, I caught up to a random doujinshi featuring...a girl character from this show. She was hot, her design was striking, and I had spare time. Ofcourse I had to check on her show, expecting nothing but a kid show from the synopsis and ready to ignore the plot just to see Nekomusume animated.To my surprise, the show was cool.I mean Nekomusume still contributed a lot of its appeal but for the most part, GGNK has good story beats, decent pacing for a 90+ ep series, entertaining cast, and varying episode content, even things I did not expect to see on a kid's show. Then again, this was Japan we're talking about. Even their kid shows can be batshit insane. It has comedy, action, thrills, horror, and lots of heart. I expected the first bits but there are drama bits in the show that I genuine cried for.Storywise, this was a mostly shonen-esque episodic show featuring a half-yokai protagonists and his friends clashing and meeting with other supernatural entities who dare disturb the peace. It was nothing really groundbreaking in paper but the yokai bits were really interesting. Particularly I liked the hot/cold yokai, the cat, and ofcourse Nekomusume herself and there's a sense of a lived-in world. People are not painted as innocent nor good just as the yokais are and even the protagonist Kitaro is a morally gray guy. There are deaths in the show and some of it can be devastating, since there was an initial hope spot by the fact that it is made for children. In a show about ghosts and immortals, there sure is a mortality rate and when it calls for, plot armor is thrown out the window. In fact, consequences are being dealt for a span of time in the show where things that happen affects the others. For an episodic show, that was surprising.Characters are relatively well-rounded, notably the main cast. There's character development here that made me so invested with the side characters, except Rat Man who is painfully frustrating because of how his character's development is basically a loop. Mana Inuyama, our deuteragonist was very enjoyable, using her mundane humanity and technologically wits to become as useful as her superhuman allies in times of crisis. Nekomusume remains hot but shines even more so because she was such a darling. Kitaro is relatively neutral, who eliminates yokai who dares harm people but will also let people suffer horribly when they deserve it. By the end of the show, it was just fast consumption because I was not well-versed to what the characters could do, their motives, and still twists come and go. Well, some can be predictable but for a Toei show, this was absolute delight. Also, the female designs in the show were hot.Plot-wise, most episodes are stand alone and this is when the show was at its brightest. The story arcs are good, yes but there are stories that were just told in single episodes that were really spectacular. My favorites have been the Cat episode, the Lost Belongings episode, and a mid-season cliffhanger that caught me offguard. The cat episode in particular really came out of left field and gave me a heart-wrenching tale that I have been thinking about it for a few days. There's seriously good stuff here even when some of the episodes can be absolute dud.While the first arc was kinda weak, the other three arcs were good, notably the midseason and the final one. Likewise, character dynamics usually fuel the powerful emotions in scenes, giving weight and reasons for the audience to root for or root against anyone. The varying episode contents made sure to keep me guessing what adventures the cast is gonna undertake next. They may be handling haunted schools on one, then take on beholders the next and then handling social media cavemen. It may be something small, something grand, but all in all, I had fun consuming them.The OP remained the same from start to finish and I barely skipped it. It was so fricking catchy. The EDs however are mostly skippable. The OST within the show were thematic, with quite a lot of them seemingly inspired by Dark Souls and Castlevania. In fact, there are tracks here that are more metal than the usual J-flare.Artwise, it was good. The character designs are striking and there is decent budget alotted for the grander fight scenes. Nowhere close to ufotable or bones but for a 90+ episode shonen, it did its best.In the end, I was satisfied how it went on and when it was over, I felt empty because there was no more Gegege to look forward to. Yes, the show is over and feels complete. It took its time and did its best not to overstay its welcome. Lovely cast, strong episodic elements, gorgeous ladies, supernatural thrills and Nekomusume. Oh, and Kitaro was cool too. He's detective gadget with a superpowered slipper and others in his arsenal.I loved what I had and if you can withstand dozens of episodes of yokai battling and supernatural slice of life, I'll recommend this for sure. Just prepare for about three episodes or so that were just plain boring and some plot armor. This is a truly random show to surprise me with its quality. To think that it all started by browsing adult doujinshi.Watch it episodic. Binge watching can diffuse some of the strong messages handled by the strongly-written episodes.I can't stress enough how much a babe Nekomusume is. a girl character from this show. She was hot, her design was striking, and I had spare time. Ofcourse I had to check on her show, expecting nothing but a kid show from the synopsis and ready to ignore the plot just to see Nekomusume animated.To my surprise, the show was cool.I mean Nekomusume still contributed a lot of its appeal but for the most part, GGNK has good story beats, decent pacing for a 90+ ep series, entertaining cast, and varying episode content, even things I did not expect to see on a kid's show. Then again, this was Japan we're talking about. Even their kid shows can be batshit insane. It has comedy, action, thrills, horror, and lots of heart. I expected the first bits but there are drama bits in the show that I genuine cried for.Storywise, this was a mostly shonen-esque episodic show featuring a half-yokai protagonists and his friends clashing and meeting with other supernatural entities who dare disturb the peace.

I've updated my review to reflect what the episode was actually about.The specials are definitely a great watch for anyone who enjoyed Girls und Panzer.There's side stories, sequel episodes, and episode additions. Overall the mood of the specials felt a little different from the feel of the show but they were just as enjoyable.EP 1: The girls spend their time picking out swimsuits before they go to the beach. What really stands out here is the originality of the swimsuits that are showcased. I got a good laugh at the ending.EP 2: A standard camping episode...with a bonus of everyone deciding to be in swimsuits.EP 3: The most interesting episode by far. They go into detail on answering questions you may have about the series and school ships.EP 4: A full presentation of the Anglerfish Dance that had to be performed after losing the school's first match.EP 5: An addition to the match against Pravda High that follows Yukari and Riko on their scouting expedition. This one was a lot of fun.EP 6: And to wrap it all off, a sequal episode where the student council hosts a celebration for winning the championship. with a bonus of everyone deciding to be in swimsuits.EP 3: The most interesting episode by far.

I loved G&P itself but as usual the specials are nowhere as near as good as the main show (note: there's also an OVA, which unlike the specials is definitely worth watching).The 6 episodes are very different from each other and I gave it an overall of 6 but here's the breakdown -Episode 1 - The girls plan to go to the beach and shop for swim suits. A standard and completely unremarkable fan service episode. I really have no clue why they insist on making one for virtually every anime that exists. Unless you're...a fan of these it's not worth watching.Episode 2 - The girls go camping. Again this is mostly fan service (and again more swim suits). The only thing that's noteworthy is that at some point they quote a famous Monty Python sketch (maybe it was aimed for foreign viewers because my Japanese friends like probably most people in Japan have never heard of Monty Python). Other than that the episode is not really worthwhile.Episode 3 - By far the most interesting episode of the six. The girls take a tour of the school ship and explain how it operates and visit all the hidden areas where students don't normally go.Episode 4 - The stupid Anko dance that the girls were forced to do after they lost the first practice match. You can see the entire routine here. The episode is only 3 minutes long so what the heck.Episode 5 - This one's actually noteworthy. It takes place during the match against Pravda and follows Yukari and Erwin as they go on their recon mission. It shows where and how they got the information that the girls later used to break out of the siege. Pretty interesting.Episode 6 - The girls celebrate their ultimate victory. The episode tries to be funny but I think it miserably fails at that. Pointless and boring. a fan of these it's not worth watching.Episode 2 - The girls go camping.

GS Mikami,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2400/GS_Mikami,"['If there’s something strange, in the neighbourhood, who you gonna call? Close but no buster but that would be Mikami Reiko, one of Japan’s top ghost sweepers. Assisting Mikami is her under-paid teenage lackey, Yokoshima Tadao, and the 300 year old teenage ghost, Okinu. And episode by episode, they take care of business.With the exception of a small number of 2-parters, the series is episodic and you can jump into any episode with little to no prior familiarity. However, in addition to the main trio, there will be some reoccurring characters such as fellow Ghost Sweepers Meiko and Emi; the alchemist Dr. Chaos and his...android assistant Maria; and Mikami’s former teacher and his current discipline, Pete, a half-breed vampire.Each character has their own function that works in a formulaic sense and do something. Unfortunately, you will need to read the manga if you want any background and development on the characters. The manga expands why Yokoshima has some spiritual prowess and also goes into the details of their back stories. But the anime does a good job of justifying it by demonstrating a lot of tabla rasa to make sort of make you forgive that. Still the series does go beyond fighting ghosts. They fight other super natural beings such as gremilns, sea creatures, and vampires. What also keeps this series from being a bit repetitive is sometimes the ghost isn’t bad, but needs help in other forms in order to move on.In addition, the series spoofs of 90s pop culture so pop culture buffs may enjoy this. What mostly drives the series is its comedy. Even though Mikami is this sexy lady, I am glad it doesn’t get repeatedly exploited as pointless fan service. She is only used in that way a small number of times and works in the right context. Dr. Chaos being broke is another source of its comedy despite claiming to be this genius. It goes on.The art is rather simple but still a little distinct. The design works in a way that it is easy to emulate if you want to try some fan art, but still has a sharpness that brings a mature feel.The grainy contrast brings that urban and ghastly feel, but the bright colors with the clothing brings a convenient “flash” and youth friendly atmosphere. The action is nothing revolutionary like “Dragon Ball Z” during this time but works in its own way. Mikami uses something like a light sabre and Shinto chants to combat the ghosts which brings modern cinema with Japanese traditions. Overall, it is bearable but nothing outstanding.Some of you may now the voice of Horikawa Ryo and Tsuru Hiromi as the voices of Vegeta and Bulma from Dragon Ball Z, but in this anime, they are the voices of Yokoshima and Mikami. If you’re familiar with Tsuru’s role as Bulma, then you will instantly recognise her voice and it works with her character with being sexy but yet all-business. Horikawa Ryo, as always seems to amaze me. Not only as his performance as Vegeta, but also as Shun from Saint Seiya. As Vegeta, he’s vicious, as Shun he is feminine, and now as Yokoshima, he is this hormone driven teenager and he just manages to pull it off. The man has many talents as a voice actor and probably one of the best. Other notable seiyuus are Chiba Shigeru as Dr. Chaos and Morikawa Toshiyuki as Pete.The music also works perfectly with the series. The chiming synthesisers in the hook of the opening theme and the sexy jazz in the background music brings the urban feel, the supernatural, and the sex appeal come together as one and for that.Well, this series is no Yuu Yuu Hakusho, but if you want something short and episodic and doesn’t require much of an attention span, this might be the series for you.

It is episodic but offers some good quality stories & creativity, especially if you like The Slayers & Hell Teacher Nube.The series is set in 90\'s Japan where ghosts & demons are quite common. To get rid of these phantasms ""Ghost Sweepers"" are hired to exorcise them. One of these Ghost Sweepers is the gold digger Mikami Reiko & her assistants the ""thirsty"" Yokoshima & the ghost Okinu. Much of the anime focuses on these characters daily life but they are filled with comedy & their encounters with various spirits, however...it can get a bit dark at times.Similar to Hell Teacher Nube, Ghost Sweeper Mikami tends to be episodic with some stories being 2-3 episodes long which can vary from facing ghosts, possessed artifacts, demons, vampires, yokai & even mythical creatures, but the highlight of this series are the characters & the comedy brought from them. As the series continues, more characters are introduced such as other sweepers like Emi, Meiko, Pete, Karasu,  Dr. Chaos & the android Maria. There\'s several other characters but these are the most recurring.Much of the comedy does come from Yokoshima as he is easily one of the most hilarious, perverted & miserable anime characters. Most of his conflicts often end in misery with Yokoshima getting the short end of the stick & often being ""pussywhipped"" by his boss Mikami whom he has a mad thirst for. (Who wouldn\'t?) Similar to Lina Inverse from The Slayers, Mikami is very self centered often choosing money over the safety of her friends, well specifically Yokoshima. Most of the anime\'s charm comes from these two characters as they often backstab each other for their own selfish gains but at times display some affection only to be shattered by a good gag. Mikami as character is selfish & quite formidable as a ghost sweeper which is a great trait for an independent woman character. If you like her then you should like the anime.As much as i like the series, I would\'ve preferred if got a bit serious, while there are some episodes which were dramatic & contained some good fight scenes, it would\'ve benefited if more of those drama episodes were featured in the series. Although, what it lacks in story is made up by its heart as the series can get a bit cheerful at times, especially with its xmas & new years episodes.Being made in the 90\'s, this is definitely one of Toei Animation\'s good looking show as its uses a wide assortment of colors due to each characters specific exorcism style & through the various types of ghosts. Along with good animation is the soundtrack as most of it ranges from chilling horror music to a jazz style, however some tracks are episode specific such as episode 26.Ghost Sweeper Mikami is a great blend of horror & comedy which is made up by its funny cast of characters which offers the same quality as Hell Teacher Nube & The Slayers. While it may not have the most complex plot, it does display much variety & the series doesn\'t feel repetitive regardless of its episodic scenarios. By 16 episodes, you should know whether you love this series or not. Also, Mikami Reiko is a fine woman.

By 16 episodes, you should know whether you love this series or not. Also, Mikami Reiko is a fine woman. XD', ""This had a fun set up and a great universe but no overall story arc. There were a couple places where things heat up but in the end nothing much changes. Mikami reminds me of Lina Inverse except even when things get serious Mikami is still focused on making money. She never seems to have that total transformation to actually caring. Anything that makes it through is very small.There are some interesting threads that never get followed up much. For example, Yokoshima seems to have some real spiritual power, but nothing much happens with it. There is also a very slowly developing romantic thing between...Yokoshima and Okinu. It would have been great to make more progress on this. The other characters that show up from time to time are interesting as well but I find myself wishing they had more development.There are some pretty funny moments though. This show makes great use of long pauses for comedy and some pretty crazy distortions of character model for Yokoshima's legendary pervyness. Worth watching when you want some 90s-ish comedy no-commitment fun. Yokoshima and Okinu. It would have been great to make more progress on this.

Initially, I was unsure about its dated visuals, but they grew on me over time, adding a unique charm to the series. What immediately caught my attention was the comedy, which starts right from the first episode. The humor is slow-paced, in your face.However, the show isn\'t without its flaws. While it delivers laughs, there are moments where the comedy falls flat, and the plot may feel a bit disjointed at times. Yet, despite these inconsistencies, I found myself thoroughly entertained throughout the series.One of the highlights of ""GS Mikami"" is its characters. While they may not be the...most complex or deeply developed, many of them are incredibly enjoyable to watch. From the pervy antics of Yokoshima, quirkiness of Okinu to the High-Mighty Mikami herself, there\'s always something entertaining happening on screen. Of course, there are a few characters that grated on my nerves, *cough Meiko *cough but they were outweighed by the overall charm of the cast.In terms of music, ""GS Mikami"" has its highs and lows. While not every track on the OST is memorable, there are a few standout pieces that I found myself really enjoying. Some of these tracks are so good that I could listen to them outside of the anime context and still enjoy them.The opening and ending themes are solid additions to the series. While I eventually skipped them for binge-watching, they\'re catchy and well-composed, capturing the essence of the show & it\'s era perfectly.Despite its age and its target audience of children, ""GS Mikami"" manages to maintain a certain level of charm that makes it appealing to viewers. The inclusion of ecchi scenes may raise eyebrows, but they never felt out of place and added to the overall comedic tone of the series & it\'s time.Before I knew it, 45 episodes had flown by, leaving me wanting more. I wholeheartedly recommend ""GS Mikami"" to anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining anime experience. And if you enjoy the anime, I highly suggest diving into the manga as well, as it offers even more fun and excitement. most complex or deeply developed, many of them are incredibly enjoyable to watch.

Is it not to cause others trouble?Makina Juri has made herself into the ""usualness"" of high school. We all want to change. We all want others to accept us. We need others in our lives to breed a comfort zone and not stand out categorised by others. So... you compromise. On yourself. You split yourself into two, or more if need be. One for yourself, one to display to others. It\'s nice to act... sometimes.Honjou Akio\'s days are routine.

I don\'t find it a coincidence that Akio\'s friends start the short film by talking about their shared interest in anime before their individual qualities are portrayed.  Akio has an ear for music and an interest in art.Now what\'s more important is the message conveyed about stifling individual creativity.  Juri, the female lead, is constantly embarrassed for the ridicule she has undergone for her dreams and her musical compositions.  For a...long time, I was the same way.  I used to compose music and play the piano, for my own sake.  I felt extreme insult when my sister or mother would tell me to stop.  I was being ""too loud"" for them to stay in their comfort zone and watch their TV talk shows in the other room.  I was ""too repetitive"" because I had to practice, and they ridiculed me for that as if I had to know a song as soon as I read it.  I didn\'t play what THEY wanted me to play.  And so for 8 years I quit the piano completely.  My creativity was stifled, but I had dreams, and still, I would hear the music in my head.  I had to hide it.  Juri opens up to Akio and it took a lot of courage.This short film is about all of that.  Individuals are unique, but still connect and bond beyond the shallow premise of conformity.

What's so bad about being different? Being a dreamer? Being creative? Being yourself? There should be nothing wrong with these values, but yet there seems to be. People are quick to judge and uphold prejudices against those who inspire the unfamiliar. People dislike change. People dislike different. People dislike a lot of things, but that shouldn't mean one should stop pursuing their dreams in order to conform to the majority.Despite being a mere twenty-five minute movie, Harmonie...surprisingly felt as if it lasted the entirety of a full film. There's a lot crammed into this short animated movie, but it still did a great job in retaining my interest and holding a solid pace. Something that boggles my mind is why two of the genres that are tagged for Harmonie say 'Fantasy' and 'Supernatural'; Harmonie is, for the most part, neither of these and so this is confusing to me. What they should be classified as instead are: Slice of Life and Drama. In a realistic setting of a high school environment Harmonie depicts the social structure of what it means to be in high school. You have many cliques, all of which do their own thing and have different interests, but Harmonie focuses on two in particular. The first group is a normal, unpopular trio of guys who like anime, games, girls, etc. and the second group is a visibly more popular, good-looking clique. Harmonie showcases that these two groups are leagues apart in terms of social standing, and the way character interactions are done reflect it well.The social hierarchy in high school, as many people may know first-hand, can be cruel and quite sinister. For a place that should be promoting students to follow their aspirations, it's ironic that it often does the exact opposite. Harmonie illustrates the concept of putting on a facade, in order to be socially acceptable, very well. I'm sure we all can relate to this from personal experience as viewers, and that sense of realism is astounding. You don't see this somber, depressing truth in anime all too often. On a more positive note, Harmonie also portrays that there is always a certain someone, or people, out there who will understand you and sympathize with your crazy delusions. Although Harmonie presents this message in more of a ‘destiny’ type of fashion than realism, the message doesn't fall on deaf ears.The characters in Harmonie are high school students, and the main focus is on the main character, Akio, along with his interactions with Juri and her clique. Akio and Juri live in completely separate social worlds, and despite knowing that Akio wants to get to know Juri anyway. What starts off as simply a crush develops into something more. An unforeseen, common interest leads to the unexpected and depicts that sometimes you might find an unanticipated friend that simply gets you. Every character in Harmonie is characterized well and you're able to understand the basic personalities of each character despite how short the movie is; they are personified with convincing personalities and seem realistic. However, the short length of the movie also is the biggest negative aspect about Harmonie as well. There really isn't much development in characters that isn't plot driven, and because of this it's difficult to feel any lasting emotional or mental attachment.Something I really enjoyed about Harmonie is the fact that there is no sugarcoating applied on the outside nor inside of the movie. Characters are designed to look believable and realistic versus the cute girl pandering often seen in countless school life anime. You can see the normality and mediocrity of Akio’s appearance, and this does a substantial amount in portraying the difference(s) between the popular versus the unpopular. The animation itself is fluid and it's what you'd expect from an anime movie rather than an episode of regular anime. Overall, the art and animation are visually pleasing.Sound-wise, Harmonie is pretty good. Background music fits well and doesn't feel out of place. I have no complaints, but there is nothing so fantastic that I would boast about it. The ED is calming and relaxing, which was a nice touch in closing out the short movie.Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing wrong with being perceived as different. Different is valuable. Different is interesting. Different is a fresh color in a world where things are often black and white with little in-between. surprisingly felt as if it lasted the entirety of a full film.

The Harmonie would be employed for outdoor or recreational music.Interestingly, there is a dual play of meanings in this title. The word 'Harmony' means 'the combination of musical notes sounded at the same time to produce chords with a pleasing effect'. 'Harmonies' is the plural of 'harmony’. This meaning fits perfectly with the events in the movie too.Everyday we put up various facades in public, either...for the purpose of getting accepted in society and not stand out as being 'weird' or for the simple reason that we aren't able to believe in our own selves. Though at every moment we know that we are doing nothing but living a lie, we ultimately are unable to gather the courage to step out and be the person we are in reality, until someone with a similar thought, someone who encourages us not to lose ourselves amidst all those lies we live, arrives to save us. True happiness, we then realize, is to live as the person we are in our hearts and in a moment all that burden we had been imposing on ourselves, all that stress out of pretending, evaporates and we are finally able to find bliss, if only we have that one person believing in us and sharing our dreams.Harmonie is essentially about this theme. I watched it three times before writing this review, not because I didn't understand the story but because every time I was viewing it, I discovered something new, every time I found out that I had a new interpretation for all that was happening and therein, lies the ethereal beauty of Harmonie.Juri Makina,an everyday high-schooler is the dreamer here. Having friends to chat with and a seemingly normal life, there should be no reason for her to be unhappy, one would think. But is that really so? Is she really the cheerful person that she shows her classmates she is? As it turns out, she is not. Rather she is the most depressed of all, the most burdened because of the mask that she has to don in public in order to not get ridiculed and isolated in the world. Because being lonely is painful no matter how much you try to masquerade it. Juri has a dream, a rather unusual dream about a boy and a robotic girl and how one of her classmates, someone who she has never talked to before, someone who had a crush on her and admired her even though he knew that it would probably remain a one-sided fantasy forever, Honjou Akio, synchronizes with her dream, forms the crux of the story.Juri has this dream everyday and actually this dream represents her inner soul and nature. That being said, what is most intriguing are those three beautiful colored bottles in her dreams. What do they represent? The answer to that is beautiful. They represent the musical notes, the chords of life which Juri is made of. They are her essence, her feelings and emotions which are beautifully colored but whose beauty most people are unable to see. Harmonie, the mechanical girl, is another side of Juri, she is who Juri truly is at heart, whom people are unable to understand and call a weirdo. The boy in the dream is the only one who understands the true feelings of Harmonie and that is shown beautifully in his playing the Red, Green and Purple colored bottles in the perfect order under a starry night while Harmonie herself dances freely under the night sky, happy that she has finally found the one who truly understands her and is on the same wavelength as her. He is the one who colors her life and enables her to break free from her monotonous machine-like existence. This is why Harmonie is shown to be a mechanical doll and it is the boy who infuses life in her. The most tear-inducing scene is the last scene where Harmonie shows the boy her true self and that all his notes have struck the right chords and now she is at one with him in heart and soul. After watching this scene, it felt so beautiful, and it was then that I realized what complete bliss is.In a world where being a little different is seen as being weird, Honjou is the one who comes to Juri's rescue and supports her. He is the harbinger of peace and tranquility in her life. He shares in her dream and plays the role of the boy in Juri's dream in her real life. His world is probably different from Juri's but as he says, he wants to get lost in her beautiful dream and be at one with her. He is the one who fills the void in Juri's heart and in the process, finds true happiness himself too.The animation is beautiful and enchanting with every minute detail portrayed wonderfully. The ending song, the dream song, gets stuck in your mind and you will probably find yourself humming it for a long time after you finish watching the movie.'Harmonie' is nothing else than a masterpiece. It shows effectively how each one of us has our own little world in our hearts, which we mostly keep to ourselves. It is one of the very few movies which have a perfect ending. It leaves you fully content and there is nothing more you would want to ask of it. Harmonie is a harmony of emotions and striking all the right notes, it leaves you mesmerized and wanting to lose yourself in your own little dream world where you are free to be your true self. for the purpose of getting accepted in society and not stand out as being 'weird' or for the simple reason that we aren't able to believe in our own selves. Though at every moment we know that we are doing nothing but living a lie, we ultimately are unable to gather the courage to step out and be the person we are in reality, until someone with a similar thought, someone who encourages us not to lose ourselves amidst all those lies we live, arrives to save us.

Rather she is the most depressed of all, the most burdened because of the mask that she has to don in public in order to not get ridiculed and isolated in the world. Because being lonely is painful no matter how much you try to masquerade it. Juri has a dream, a rather unusual dream about a boy and a robotic girl and how one of her classmates, someone who she has never talked to before, someone who had a crush on her and admired her even though he knew that it would probably remain a one-sided fantasy forever, Honjou Akio, synchronizes with her dream, forms the crux of the story.Juri has this dream everyday and actually this dream represents her inner soul and nature. That being said, what is most intriguing are those three beautiful colored bottles in her dreams. What do they represent? The answer to that is beautiful. They represent the musical notes, the chords of life which Juri is made of. They are her essence, her feelings and emotions which are beautifully colored but whose beauty most people are unable to see. Harmonie, the mechanical girl, is another side of Juri, she is who Juri truly is at heart, whom people are unable to understand and call a weirdo. The boy in the dream is the only one who understands the true feelings of Harmonie and that is shown beautifully in his playing the Red, Green and Purple colored bottles in the perfect order under a starry night while Harmonie herself dances freely under the night sky, happy that she has finally found the one who truly understands her and is on the same wavelength as her. He is the one who colors her life and enables her to break free from her monotonous machine-like existence. This is why Harmonie is shown to be a mechanical doll and it is the boy who infuses life in her. The most tear-inducing scene is the last scene where Harmonie shows the boy her true self and that all his notes have struck the right chords and now she is at one with him in heart and soul. After watching this scene, it felt so beautiful, and it was then that I realized what complete bliss is.In a world where being a little different is seen as being weird, Honjou is the one who comes to Juri's rescue and supports her. He is the harbinger of peace and tranquility in her life. He shares in her dream and plays the role of the boy in Juri's dream in her real life. His world is probably different from Juri's but as he says, he wants to get lost in her beautiful dream and be at one with her. He is the one who fills the void in Juri's heart and in the process, finds true happiness himself too.The animation is beautiful and enchanting with every minute detail portrayed wonderfully. The ending song, the dream song, gets stuck in your mind and you will probably find yourself humming it for a long time after you finish watching the movie.'Harmonie' is nothing else than a masterpiece. It shows effectively how each one of us has our own little world in our hearts, which we mostly keep to ourselves. It is one of the very few movies which have a perfect ending. It leaves you fully content and there is nothing more you would want to ask of it. Harmonie is a harmony of emotions and striking all the right notes, it leaves you mesmerized and wanting to lose yourself in your own little dream world where you are free to be your true self."", ""Harmonie is a short 2014 film from Studio Rikka. You may know them as the studio what done Eve no Jikan. It also has the same creator/director, Yoshiura Yasuhiro. I don't know what to expect from it, but I did quite like Eve no Jikan. So, having the same studio and creative force as that isn't a bad sign.Story:We open with a young man talking about the concept that we all live in our own little worlds and can never truly enter someone else's. He posits that his world must be close to that of his two friends, hence why they get along really...well and wishes that it could be closer to his crush's. He and his friends have a conversation while she has a conversation with her friends. During which one of them changes her ringtone. Class resumes and she gets rung, much to her dismay. He finds himself fascinated by the song and he's recreating it using a piano app on his phone. She happens to hear and wonders how he can recreate it after hearing it once for a very short time. He explains it as him just having a strong ear for music and asks her where he can find the full version. She hands him an old mp3 player, thereby inviting him for a glimpse of her world.The biggest problem with the narrative is just that it's largely made up of very minor teenage drama. He likes her but she might have a boyfriend. Then the possible boyfriend gets jealous because they start to bond because he gets a glimpse into her reoccurring dream. It's less than compelling and something this short really needs to grab your attention quickly since you know it's not going to have a lot of opportunity to improve later. The narrative sequence is also a bit obvious.The best part of the film, by far, is the dream sequence. The rest of it is a bit boring while that whole sequence actually grabs you attention and shows what looks to be an interesting little world.Characters:You wouldn't expect a twenty five minute film to have much in terms of characterisation. Which is certainly the case here. The characters are a pretty generic bunch designed to call common slice of life archetypes to mind and, thereby, build off of those characters you know to create the illusion that they're deeper than they actually are. The problem here is that the film's premise is working off of this idea of our individually constructed worlds and that doesn't exactly work as it should without characters who are actually well developed. It's no wonder the dream sequence used to showcase the love interest's own world has to be so outlandish. It's the only method they had to make her seem kind of interesting.Art:The film is very well drawn and animated. I'll give them full credit on that count. The dream sequence is, again, the part that really stands out positively. It has a very strong sense of atmosphere and some interesting visuals. The artwork outside of that still looks good, but the visuals themselves aren't that interesting. You've got a bunch of standard looking kids faffing about in a rather drab looking school.Sound:The acting is fair enough. Our main children were voiced by Ueda Reina, who I don't think I've heard in anything else, & Matsuoka Yoshitsugu who voiced Array in Rinne no Lagrange, a very minor character in Madoka and never appeared in anything else good. At least as far as things I've seen. They both deliver decent enough performances. As do the rest of the cast. The music is pretty nice. I like Kokia's performance for the theme tune.Ho-yay:Error 404: Ho-yay not found.Final Thoughts:Harmonie isn't nearly on the level of Eve no Jikan. Length is probably a major factor, since it's only twenty five minutes. But, ultimately, its big issue is just that the under-developed characters can't carry the premise. I do like the idea and I won't claim it's handled poorly, it's handled okay, given the short running time. So, my final rating for Harmonie is going to be a 6/10. It's an all right little film and it may be worth watching just for the dream sequence.

I could really relate to some of what occurred. I could really understand and relate to what the characters were thinking.Story, 7/10 - Harmonie's story isn't exactly a large scale phenomenon. I didn't expect it to be. I mean, it is a movie, right? And a short one at that. While I definitely didn't get anything huge, I definitely got more than I expected. The plot was good; a small build up between two students and the events that happen between them. That's what this is. It never gets past the...point of 'good', and while it is not deconstruction material, it is definitely unique compared to your typical highschool setting today.Art and Animation, 8/10 - This, like the story, is also unique. It felt like I was watching something made by Makoto Shinkai's son, or 'kouhai' of the like. The character designs were great. Even the characters who only spoke a couple lines or even the ones who had none at all could be easily distinguished from each other. The camera angles, the shots taken, the detail in everything; all of it is great and contributes to the already great movie.Sound, 6/10 - The less impressive part, mainly because of the OST. None of it is really memorable, which doesn't mean it's bad, but nor is it good. It's timed well, though. The voice acting, however, is what keeps this at a 6 rather than a 4. Hell, I'm even tempted with a 7. The voice acting is great and really enables emotion to come through. Not to mention one of my favourite seiyuu stars in this movie.Character, 7/10 - Less than half an hour of running time, but yet... I feel like I know them so well! We have your typical otaku male with your typical attractive on the outside, wounded on the inside female. Now, how does this diverge from the usual set-up? It doesn't, and that's the good part! It sticks with these character elements and using them as a plot device to advance the interactions, events and emotion all shared in this movie. The main character, Akio, is a guy who I can totally relate to. His friendship group is something I long for, however.Enjoyment, 9/10 - I loved this. The idea of mixing fantasy with slice and life is brilliant, yet it's so underdone or not done well enough. Like everything, it could have been better. Some series make you think it could have been better, but also make you want to stay away from future releases. This made me want more. I need more of this. The strong messages in people's dreams is something I love yet have seen so little of.Overall, 9/10 - I am inclined to give this a 10, but can't due to there not being enough of everything. If this was longer, it would have no problem achieving a 10.Recommendations:For the idea of awkward MCs: WataMote, Welcome to the NHKFor a more romantice take of things, although not very similar: Kimi no TodokeAlthough I can't speak for it, Paprika is said to also explore dreams, so it might be good for you if you want more! point of 'good', and while it is not deconstruction material, it is definitely unique compared to your typical highschool setting today.Art and Animation, 8/10 - This, like the story, is also unique.

Just like the synopsis tells, everyone has their own little world inside their minds. It\'s not very acceptable to talk about them in the public, it makes most people uncomfortable.It might be just that some people don\'t have this ""skill"" or maybe it\'s not as vibrant and strong. These people might have a hard time understanding people who have a really strong ""world"" (imagination.). Most strong worlded people learn to ""tone it down"" and they don\'t talk about their worlds out in the public. They might even end up feeling guilty if they get lost...in their worlds, since it\'s pretty childish or a sign of lunacy.We tend to encourage children to give up daydreaming. Most young kids, if not all, tend to be very imaginative and world-rich after all.I understand that it\'s desirable to chase after knowledge and make ones life better, time is money and do you really have time for dreaming and a bunch of nonsense like that?I can understand it, but I don\'t have to agree with it.This anime is about a world shared with another person. It caughts you off your guard by how whimsical it can be since the anime aims to be pretty realistic with normal-ish voice acting and drawing style mixed with some possibly magical stuff. I don\'t say it\'s a bad thing that it\'s whimsical, it\'s actually very powerful. It sends the message ""hey, what if?"". If they would\'ve used some kawaii-sugoii-moe artstyle and ""anime voices"" the possible magical stuff wouldn\'t have been as powerful.I like how they made the characters somehow explained, like why is Juri the way she is? (boring, unreachable and a poker face) but since it\'s just one episode there isn\'t much room for other characters to develop. Most other characters are pretty much one dimensional supports, or the main protagonist who is pretty blank so we can project ourselves into him.[SPOILER!]In the end, it\'s revealed that it could be that they really didn\'t share the world in a special ""magical"" way after all. The ipod contained an audio where Juri explained her world, and it could be just Honjou listened to the song, fell asleep, track changed and he heard the description in his sleep and it produced images what she described in that track. You know how you sometimes hear speech, music or some other noises and they enter your dream and become a part of it?  (my alarm clock often becomes a part of my dream and I fail to wake up to it.)This possible turn of event is actually very clever. After all, it is only hinted that it might be this way, and if you listen to the audio, you notice there isn\'t enough descriptions to give a specific picture in to your mind what the girl is like for example. It seems that they saw the same exact world, since their drawings matched. You believe what you want.[SPOILER END]The ending is open for interpretation, like I explained in my ""spoiler"". It\'s subtle, it\'s sweet and I loved it. For once, they don\'t straight up explain what happens, why Juri ""remembers"" things suddenly, how everyone feels, was it logical or magical... Show don\'t tell and the art of not explaining every single thing seems to be lost with many other anime shows. This was very welcoming change of pace.It\'s a small anime and it only contains possible undertones of romance or affection, but it mostly focuses on the fact that no matter how unreachable or normal some person might seem like, they probably hold a very rich world inside them and thus they might show you a completely different side to them that you didn\'t except to see.I think this anime is worth a watch and I recommend it to everyone.

Give it a go.', 'Harmonie, as indeed as it sounds, beautiful yet puzzling this anime allows me to enter deep inside the imaginary world in their story. Leaving its trace to become unforgettable experience.Ok, basically this Anime is quite short for a movie, about 25 minutes without OP & ED. Regarding the short duration it doesn\'t affect the quality story at all. On the contrary it wouldn\'t be better even if it had longer duration, The story is just perfectly wrapped in 25 minute long duration.Story 8/10Some of you maybe don\'t understand what\'s exactly going on about the story, peculiar, enigmatic, and little psychological as a short movie...that usually leads to incomprehensible story. But, it\'s only if you relied to understand the story by words . Neither did I grasp the story through text words nor the story development, I only grasped that because of the feel conveyed. And I think this is so called metaphor story, ""understand it by feeling the atmosphere even words hardly describe it""Get to the story. There were actually 2 adolescents in their middle-school life apparently, They both a boy and a girl didn\'t know each other well even though in the same class until the boy accidentally heard the girl\'s ring tone ringing throughout the class. The boy found that song good and played it back with his smart-phone. later, the girl found him and wanted him to stop playing it since this song was what has made her now, connecting her to the boy and their world....Ok stop there, I don\'t want to spoil more, the main feast starts there. Personally everything about the story is well executed. Extracting story essence into short duration movie is genuinely a hard work to do, I\'m amazed with this. The story itself is unique and incomparable to ubiquitous anime nowadays. Mystery, psychology and supernatural genre are bound together to depict their world which only both ever experienced what it looked like,  The world that somewhat portrayed themselves.Story Development 7/10Ok, this is interesting. Only 25 minute, we have story development which is somewhat stable without leaving any void/gap story. The story developed really well between those 2 adolescents. I also really love the conclusion. It told indefinite meaning, leaving it to our imagination as viewers. I always find this sort of conclusion magnificent.Art 8/10I don\'t know, My eyes were so fascinated by the last scene. It\'s beautiful.Music 9/10The music fits exquisitely. It\'s successfully able to fill and to enhance the whole atmosphere in this movie. It made every scene remarkable, especially for the last scene :).Overall 8/10I\'m satisfied.Such enjoyment of story wrapped in a short duration that I haven\'t experienced for quite some time blows my mind once again recalling me beautiful work/story doesn\'t always explicitly tell much yet implicitly.

You share the same interests, passions, and goals. In fact, these similarities in personality between you and your friends might have been the very reason you had met them in the first place.The film Harmonie emphasizes this theme. The protagonists Honjou and Makina are seemingly ordinary high school students who can psychologically connect through the interest they share, that being music. The progression of the film shows Honjou slowly understanding the personality of Makina and at times catching a glimpse of Makina's past through music in a somewhat supernatural...manner.

Like Time of Eve, Harmonie is an insightful analysis of the more complex and intriguing processes that occur just under the surface, and this layering is shown on a multitude of scales. A sweeping glance at a classroom full of students, freely interacting with each other, will pick up focus on smaller groups and their inner ""worlds"", if you will. The initial reactions between two characters, worlds apart from each other socially, belie the inner richness of personality they each hold. Yoshiura really shines when he takes animation and...brings it down to earth like this, showing us very believable situations with just enough whimsicality to carry the viewer along by their own intrigue.This is a much welcome return to form after the mildly disappointing Patema Inverted, which I felt was far too cliched and clashed strongly with Yoshiura\'s previous works. While watching Time of Eve felt like assuming the role of a dispassionate observer to a series of self-contained thought experiments -- appropriately Asimovian -- Harmonie has a distinctly free-flowing feel to its narrative that commands emotional investment. One notable scene, mentioned above, was watching the camera\'s focus wander around the classroom and zero in on a single group of students having a conversation, then move on to another group, and again, giving the illusion that it\'s all done in one continuous shot. It all felt remarkably seamless, especially the audio, which is especially impressive given that at least a dozen characters would be talking at any given time.  These seamless transitions created quite an absorbing atmosphere, punctuated now and then with abruptness for emphasis. This was some of the best pacing I\'ve seen in a 25-minute span and series directors could learn a thing or two from Harmonie.Like in Pale Cocoon, Yoshiura uses a muted color palette and more realistic character designs to his advantage. A lot of attention was paid to getting expressions, posture, and gestures just right, with just the right level of minimal exaggeration. It\'s these details, these minutiae, that really draw the viewers gaze, offsetting the dullness of waking life, which is contrasted with the vividness of an enrapturing dream sequence. The juxtaposition is striking and thought-provoking, and again is part of a sort of narrative ""layering"". ""Show, don\'t tell"" is the approach taken here. Harmonie has a lot to show you, but what it tells you might not even be all that accurate.Before I watched this, I said to myself, ""I just wish Yoshiura would do another Time of Eve"". I think my wish was granted, though I would hardly consider this to be simply more of the same. Harmonie definitely shines in its own right, with its more free-flowing structure, its emotional drive, deliberate pacing, and striking, sometimes abstract visuals, though ultimately grounded and relatable. Another gem from an all-too-competent director. brings it down to earth like this, showing us very believable situations with just enough whimsicality to carry the viewer along by their own intrigue.This is a much welcome return to form after the mildly disappointing Patema Inverted, which I felt was far too cliched and clashed strongly with Yoshiura\'s previous works.

It\'s these details, these minutiae, that really draw the viewers gaze, offsetting the dullness of waking life, which is contrasted with the vividness of an enrapturing dream sequence. The juxtaposition is striking and thought-provoking, and again is part of a sort of narrative ""layering"". ""Show, don\'t tell"" is the approach taken here. Harmonie has a lot to show you, but what it tells you might not even be all that accurate.Before I watched this, I said to myself, ""I just wish Yoshiura would do another Time of Eve"". I think my wish was granted, though I would hardly consider this to be simply more of the same. Harmonie definitely shines in its own right, with its more free-flowing structure, its emotional drive, deliberate pacing, and striking, sometimes abstract visuals, though ultimately grounded and relatable. Another gem from an all-too-competent director.', 'Review (December 2017) on HarmonieA 9 or a 10... It\'s a decision I have to make.But Neal, why those two? Nine and Ten? A 10 is a masterpiece. Does this short film even deserve such a score? No one\'s going to have the same perception as that!Whatever the case may be, I have finally decided to give my answer, one that I feel is an objectively subjective analysis, meaning that this is appropriate in my own system of principles.Even with that being said, I am not going to talk about Story, Art/Animation, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment. Those things are simple to perceive. I could go...on and on about these simple things, then you\'d just nod your head in agreement all-so-boringly.Is the story unique? Yes, it is. Is the visual aspect of the show high-quality? Very high. Is the sound memorable? It\'s decent. Are the characters realistic? Yes, quite realistic. Did I enjoy the film? I did.But who gives a shit. These categories and boxes don\'t assume the entire perspective of a show/movie\'s meaning. That\'s what I\'ve come to realize, and that\'s what I\'m interested in conveying.I\'ve always been a person who attempted to judge the entertainment that I consumed in an objective-as-possible way. Of course, I let my enjoyment influence me too, but I tend to strip that down and ask myself: Is this anime realistic?This is a completely logical way to judge the things we watch. It\'s a significant part of how we may mainly judge anime. You wouldn\'t appreciate an anime if it frequently pulled random things throughout the show. You\'d be thinking to yourself, ""that makes no sense,"" and be saying wtf in your head every 5 minutes. So yes, realism is a significant part of what makes an anime credible and gives it a fundamental integrity. But there\'s also another aspect that I was never truly able to understand until now. And that integral element is the Meaning of Art.What is art? I\'m sure you\'ve heard before that art is subjective, but that doesn\'t tell you anything; you have nothing to go off of from that statement.What Art is, essentially, is something that just plain information cannot do to us.Information can tell us: ""This is what happens when you do this!"" But telling us logical information in a scientific manner doesn\'t necessarily move us.It isn\'t so much about what you know, but rather how you feel about your reality after the experience. And that is the purpose of Art. The meaning that we acquire from it is why we feel inspired, why we cry, and why we hold on to our dreams dearly.Art isn\'t something that attempts to make you agree with it. It\'s not pretentious.It\'s something that makes you fall in love with it (although love doesn\'t always give you a positive feeling). Art is something that you can watch/see/listen to one year from now and still be moved by it.Harmonie pulls on nostalgic feelings. It\'s made me realize that this movie\'s qualities are deeper than what I had initially perceived. To me, it\'s a masterpiece because it\'s realistic and it\'s art at the same time. And it incorporates both in a fashion that I\'m able to appreciate. It\'s provides a pleasant story with realistic characters, which makes me feel nostalgia.It\'s not so grand; it\'s not pretentious. But it\'s like witnessing the blossoming of a flower.At the end of the film, a door of possibilities open and that door remains open for you to dream.The score on Harmonie deserves much better.

The overall purpose of the plot might not come easily to everyone watching the show but it does hit pretty deep once you really think about it. I kind of wished that we could see what happens after the episode was done.Animation: 10/10Astounding, fluid, beautiful, crisp, bright, dark, ext. This anime...landed everything you possibly need in putting on a perfect visual presentation. It's not just the beautiful and handsome character models that make this anime so great to look at; it's the amount of effort that shows in the end product. Shadows, glares, sunlight, facial expressions, eye straining, it's all here and done so well.Sound: 9.5/10The music, ambient background noise, and voice actors did an amazing job. The opening scene has many different conversations going on at once and they somehow matched all this up with perfect lip syncing. The music is very soft when present and isn't just some generic sounding crap you would find in most anime. The piano and singer did a great job trying to reach out to the audience. The background noise was very fitting and hit all their marks. Slaps, inner dialogue, chair movements, just everything matched up with what was going on screen. The voice actors did a very good job relaying all of their characters emotions.Characters: 8.8/10We unfortunately did not get to see the characters mature as much as we hoped to but from what I saw, they became likeable and I was invested fully by the end of the anime. The main character wouldn't stand out very much in any other anime but he had true feelings; something that is hard to achieve without coming off corny. The supporting cast doesn't really get a chance to shine since it is only a single episode but they do a great job of setting up plot points and providing some very funny moments.Overall: 9.1/10This anime was part of the Young Animator Training Project which almost always turns out eyegasm looking anime. What we were lucky to see in this instance however was the addition of a interesting plot, characters, and some of the best sound design I have heard in a long time. If you have twenty spare minutes just do yourself a favor and give this a watch.Enjoyment: 8.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

It\'s the song that allows Juri to open up to the only other person that even a little ""gets"" what she went through due to the ""dreams"" both Juri and Akio has/or had that has different implications for the both of them, with Akio seeing the song a way for Juri to open up while Juri sees the songs as something to best to be forgotten as it brings up terrible memories. But it\'s because of the song that Juri and Akio has that connection, that connection in order for Juri to not only open up to someone that was a stranger at first but also for her finally release her suppressed memories from her past as she has a someone that knows what she went through.Minor characters are both for support in most cases however there is one rival character in the movie which LA won\'t name but LA saw that character as a bit of double edged sword for the movie, mainly because yes, it\'s to emphasize Akio being in the same wavelength as Juri but it\'s also felt like an ""almost"" cheap ploy for it to occur in the first place, yes high school and the such but nonetheless.The animation done by Studio Rikka was competent enough considering with was presented in Anime Mirai of 2014 from the vibrant atmosphere to the daydream surreal world of ""Juri\'s song"" and the decent character designs. Studio Rikka\'s animation was great to say the least.Voice acting was great as well from Yoshitsugu Matsuoka being in his niche role, but the rather interesting find was Reina Ueda as Juri Makina, a well known voice seiyuu in genki girl types though she did to odd ""playing against the type"" roles such as Ouka Ootori from Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai and later on μ from Caligula  and Reina as Juri is just another as LA almost mistook her vocals as Megumi Han, nonetheless the voice cast is great with the majority of the cast actually act like teenagers which they...kinda should be like, you know high school and all.Harmonie is a VERY interesting look into how someone can enter your world even if it\'s one little connection that you share together be it a song or your hobbies, in which in happens quite regularly in every day life and Haromine effectively executes those themes of connections in such a short timeframe without feeling rushed and that that is a feat in itself. happened to hear a ringtone from Juri Makina voiced by Reina Ueda and that is the catalyst and the connection to Harmonie\'s plot and theme.For our main duo of this movie, Akio is your typically bland main male protagonist who just happens to have a talent in remembering songs and he somewhat overcomes his shyness that wasn\'t exactly elaborated on in the movie but he grows a spine through the course of Harmonie, however the more major focus is on Juri and her past she had gone through with the song in her phone being the connection and the ""world"" she is a part of.

It has open plot filled with unanswered questions and a umpteen possibilities for both the MCs future.So before jumping into this take a step back from the usual anime and relate this anime with your own life experiences. Reminiscence the time you were in a similar position yourself. We all have done it -- Create a facade in front others so that they can just accept us and slowly pull up the curtain if you click with someone. This short anime is a...mirror to our social life in society, whether you are an introvert or extrovert, you always show something else even to someone you actually really like, just for the sake of the approval.Remember the time you first met the love of your life or someone you really like? Did you not portray yourself much more than you actually are?? Someone more to likes of the other person and the other person does the same thing if not show what they really are. This is how socialising and relationships work.This anime is a satire of the our social lives. How we present ourselves in front of different people.Now let's talk about the Story and plot :The story is already explained by me, it's your and mine and our story. A story of our social life in the real world. As for the plot, it's an open plot story with so many possible endings -- Good, Bad, Complicated, Tragic, Dramatic, this anime can take any form of ending and there we have the metaphor of our lives. We also have all kinds of endings for us. The ending of this anime only is a beginning to a story, a story which can take any form when played further. JUST PUT YOUR OWN STORY AFTER THE ENDING OF THIS ANIME AND SEE HOW THIS ANIME IS A SATIRE OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE. (Story - 10/10)The Art style :The art style is great if not excellent. There is realistic vibe which surrounds the whole episode. The dull colors represent the satire which all the facades create around the classroom. Maybe I'm reading too much into this but it does make sense somehow. (Art & Style - 9/10)Sound :No seconds thoughts here. The music is downright fabulous. I'm not exaggerating but every piece of music only compliments the sequence which is going on. Not to mention the ED which is again -- A satire. (Sound & Music - 10/10)Character development :So there are 7+1 characters in the anime. 2 MCs, 2 Male MC's friends, 2 Female MC's friends, 1 Conflict character and The Girl who is +1 because she is an exposition one.Both MCs have a world of there own, An introvert and an extrovert. Male lead is an introvert who wants to enter the Female leads world and for that what he needs is bridge -- a connection, a similarity. He kind of lucks himself in because of her initiative when she heard piano's music and did what she did next (won't say for spoiler's sake). Which not only made the bridge possible but also created that delusional ending. The male lead is not your typical anime character, he is as realistic as we are in life everyday. For the Female lead, she is the extrovert in story who has created a world for herself to live in (The reason explained by the+1 character and the other thing)The supporting characters just explains and emphasizes the worlds of the both MCs. Who they actually are, well yeah there is more to her world, which is better if you uncover yourself by reading into the Dream sequence. (Characters - 10/10)Overall - 8/10I really liked this short anime. I would highly recommend watching this with no expectations of any drama, conflict, intense romance or satisfying/unsatisfied ending (like any other anime). Just expect an honest satire on our lives which the anime represents.Yes, there is drama, conflict and romance in this short anime but doesn't our own lives have these 3 as well??

The characters, the world, the humor, it is all so charming. I am thankful for this OVA because it reminded me of that fact. Oh yeah, the OVA is great too.The story is just cute. A normal Cell is bored and comes across an mysterious cell and together they do a ton of pranks. The interactions it brings with it are not only charming but also freaking hilarious, even if it sometimes seems a bit too mean (I won't forgive you for hurting my RBC. I won't)....The animation is still the same (good animation but kinda rough artstyle) and that goes for the music and characters too.Yeah.. this OVA is exactly what I expected of this anime.

It's been a long time since I've caught one but just to think about it makes my mind boggle.Watching Hataraku Saibou (Cells at Work) once again brings in an experience that few can match this year. I'm talking about the exploration of the human body in the most creative ways. Returning to this franchise felt like yesterday despite the gap of a few months. My first impression is how the humor works so well when we see how the human body functions.For this particular special, the common cold is the culprit. When we picture a cold, it's often about a runny nose,...cough, sneezing, or a sore throat. This episode took that and made into a humorous gag with how cold operates in the body. It's creative enough to show how colds operate yet also keeps in pace with the effects. In response, Killer T cells make their reappearance and I'd describe them as a blend between badass and goofballs.From this special, I also realized it never lost sense or touch compared to the original show. The characters still had the personalities of what I had expected and in no less than 24 minutes, we get to see how they react. However, I would definitely watch the original season first to get a better understanding of the franchise as a whole. In retrospect, it's important to realize what the creators wanted us to experience:An ingenious anime with colorful creativity and realism with its own story. cough, sneezing, or a sore throat.

Inukami!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/940/Inukami,"[""Well here's somthing I didn't expect.When I first saw a screenshot of Inukami, and read the synopsis for the show, I thought to myself &quot;it's just another harem based rom-com&quot;. Oh, how wrong I was.If you don't laugh at this show then you've probably missed the point (or you're not human). No other show will drop the lead character naked in the town square just for looking at women, or let him spend a night in a police cell surrounded by perverts (who believe he is their king I might add). If you're expecting a lot of fanservice then you're watching the wrong show....In this show you get MANSERVICE!The art and sound are of a very high quality, but what really separates this show from others is the characters. The characters are quite simple fantastic (especially the kid who keeps telling his mum he's just seen an elephant - you can figure out what that means yourself).This show is just SO wrong it becomes right. This is no-holds-barred, gloves off, UN-politically correct humour at it's best. Just make sure you wait half an hour after food before watching it.

On one hand I really loved many aspects of it but on the other there were things I absolutely hated.  This show is not for everyone.  It features some pretty crude, perverted, and offensive humor but most of the time you can’t help but laugh anyway.Story wise Inukami isn’t all that special.  It is much better towards the latter half of the show and really did a lot to save the series for me.  The main problem and the reason I overall don’t rate this show that high is because...of some of the humor.  Don’t get me wrong this show is at its best VERY funny.  But a lot of the jokes, mostly in the first half of the series are over used, cruel, and start getting unfunny in a hurry.  It wears you down and you find yourself asking is this how someone who claims to love someone treat them?  Fortunately they move on from these jokes eventually and get on with the plot and different jokes.What Inukami! does right is the characters.  They are funny, well drawn and acted and are the strength of the show.  There are a lot of them, and usually I would say this would be a weakness but because of the way the humor is delivered and the differences in them I couldn’t help but love them all.  The two leads Yuuko and Keita will have you laughing and caring about them.  However their relationship doesn’t ever really develop the way you would like.  Just when they seem to have reached a new level we find ourselves back to the way things were before.  They both can show great love and affection for each other at times but then tremendous cruelty five minutes later.  The supporting characters embody all the various fetishes you find in harem anime but they are all get fairly well developed, particularly Nadeshiko and Hakee.  In addition a number of guest characters appear during the course of the show that are hilarious such as the monks and jail perverts.Really great music is featured as well, particular from Yuuko voice actress Yui Horie.  Her performance and that of Keita's Jun Fukuyama are the highlights of the cast as they really brought out their characters.  The animation was a bit inconsistent, I didn’t care for some of the character designs and some of the colors were a bit boring, but there are many great magical battles and smooth action scenes.Inukami!, in the end, is a mixed bag.  There is no doubt the show is at its best hilarious, but at its worst I just wanted to drop it all together.  There is also a lot of good action that fans of shounen will enjoy this.  There is a lot to love about it but the mean spirited and too often repetitive humor limited my overall enjoyment. of some of the humor.  Don’t get me wrong this show is at its best VERY funny.

Truthfully this shows that any anime that is created with passion can be a joy to watch. The hook for this anime for me was the unique comedy and wanting to find out what situations the characters manage to get themselves into.Story: The story follows some clich&eacute;s but is extremely original at times in episodes that are stand-alone. I liked that there&rsquo;s a healthy portion of the series that didn't use cliffhangers to keep you hooked which allowed me not to feel guilty by stopping and picking up later. I&rsquo;m impressed that they turned...some clich&eacute;s upside down and actually had references to other anime within the show.Art: The art is rather good in most respects; I like the style they use quite well for the characters and battle effects. There are some rather weird designs for some characters though, for example, they may wear very odd clothes since some of them have weird fetishes or even no clothes with a trademark elephant animation covering up the guy&rsquo;s private area.Sound: I loved the opening and ending that this series used. They had a great upbeat feeling and they never made me feel like skipping them. I enjoyed the music played in the backgrounds, the voice actors&rsquo; performances, and effects used for the sounds. The music was used in a nice way to enhance the tension or comedy of the dramatically different situations.Character: I found a large amount of the characters to be interesting and likeable mainly Youko and Keita. Youko has a quick temper and Keita gives into his male fantasies in ways that are rather humorous.Enjoyment: It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable anime particularly when it doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously and the ecchi is a nice bonus for it. The yaoi-ish humor my turn some people off from enjoying it fully though. For others it&rsquo;s a bonus since it&rsquo;s definitely a large part of the comedy that I enjoyed.Overall: There is much fun to be had with this anime and it&rsquo;s highly recommended for people who want to watch an anime with a large amount of original comedy and enjoyable characters. This is one of the few anime that I would recommend anyone to who wants to see something not mainstream. some clich&eacute;s upside down and actually had references to other anime within the show.Art: The art is rather good in most respects; I like the style they use quite well for the characters and battle effects.

Nudity? Fanservice? Check. If this is content you wholeheartedly enjoy, then you might as well stop reading this review right now. Yes, faithful reader, Inukami fulfills all of your dormant inner desires. But I digress, for the audience who want a little meat with their potatoes, you may continue reading. To be blunt; Inukami is hilarious. Maybe I have become so desensitized to risque comedy that I am no longer embarrassed to be caught watching it.The character interactions...and situational hilarity is where Inukami! truly shines. Keita is a womanizing, skirt-chasing fiend who perfectly fits the lead role. Along with Youko, the destructive and extremely envious female lead and the twelve lovable Inukami, we have mesh of unique personalities that serve create wonderful comedic chemistry. The characters involved ensure that the comedy never falls flat. Nevertheless, the type of comedy in Inukami! is not for everyone. To find the same enjoyment as I have, requires an acquired taste for sexually suggestive humor.Inukami! follows a simple, yet surprisingly good plot. Following the actions of Keita and the Inukami as they battle to exorcise evil spirits has its charm. However, this same solid plot affects the anime in negative ways. The story has its share of the &ldquo;more serious&rdquo; moments that tease the character-driven viewer with a tug at the emotions. But, the dedicated stance to getting &quot;the laughs&quot; makes much of this attempted &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; and romance feel awkward and out of place. There are efforts in character development, although much of the large cast feels thin, receiving no more attention than a few scenes in a single episode.Inukami! leaves you with mixed emotions. Drama manages to sneak its way into the conclusion, but the producers seemed content with ending the series along a &ldquo;status-quo&rdquo; which is disappointing for those who had hoped to see some last minute growth in the characters. Inukami! is truthfully, very entertaining. If you look past the flaws and do not expect too much, there is much fun to be had. If you are looking for a light-hearted, ecchi comedy, then Inukami is waiting for you.

Wait, the studio behind Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha? That's got to be a good sign. This is Inukami.There is a story, but it only really starts in the last six episodes or so. Everything before that focuses more on setting up the scenario and attempts at humour. The scenario is simple. Our protagonist is Kawahira Keita. He comes from a family that works with Inukami in order to protect the peace...and seek justice. What an original concept... Wait, no. What's the opposite of original? Oh yes, trite. What a trite concept. I'll talk about the comedy for a bit. Most of it doesn't work all that well. Most of the jokes are quite predictable and play on the concept that Keita being a pervert is funny, or that nudity is funny because... modesty is a thing. Suffice it to say, there aren't many legitimately funny moments. Some of the subversive humour works pretty well but aside from those rare moments it doesn't offer much. I won't go into too much detail about the story since, as stated earlier, it doesn't really get going until towards the end. Which is a problem with the series. If you want to have a comedy, fine. If you want to have a light-hearted story with some dark elements, fine. The issue is that most of the episodes don't tie into the main storyline. You could remove a good eighteen episodes and lose nothing that's needed for the story. If they were going to take this route they should've started introducing actual important elements earlier on instead of just throwing a bunch of characters who showed up earlier in the story focused episodes to try and pretend that they mattered. That being said, I do like that the big bad has an actual reason for toying with his opponents instead of just being too incompetent to finish them when he has the chance. Kudos for that one. The ending is really predictable though, which is kind of to be expected in an anime like this, but it's still kind of annoying. Then there's the romance. The romance in this is not only devoid of chemistry but it's pretty disgusting when you consider both the age difference of several centuries and the fact that it's bestiality. An aspect which is played up for humour on several occasions.Most of the characters aren't particularly interesting. Part of the problem is that there are a lot of major characters including twelve inukami, three masters, an investigator and three antagonists. The ones we spend the most time with, Keita and Youko, are thoroughly unlikable and stock characters. Keita is basically an identical character to Carrot from Bakuretsu Hunters, a pervert who chases everyone, except the person openly interested in him who supposedly has a heart of gold. Except that Carrot was consistent and Keita will claim not to be interested in, say, the twins in one episode but'll fantasise about and flirt with them in others. Youko is more like Akane from Ranma 1/2. The jealous and possessive love interest who has no personality outside of the guy she's connected to. The minor characters fare a little better and not just because they'd pretty much have to. There's an episode that explores Kayano and Hake's past and makes it look like it was quite interesting. Some of the other secondary characters have potential but they don't get the time to develop it into anything interesting.The art in this isn't bad, but it is really lazy. Everything from the largely blank backgrounds to the mediocre designs just speaks of a lack of effort. The fight scenes are quite possibly the worst. They tend to be a lot of repeated motions and coloured balls slamming into each other. I'm not really going to complain about the fan-service in this one just because it's pretty equal opportunity with both male and female characters being put into questionable positions. And that bothers me a lot less than an anime that constantly strips its female characters while leaving the men untouched. It just doesn't seem nearly as objectifying.The voice acting is the best part of the series. They got some pretty big name and talented actors to do the vocals for this. Hayashibara Megumi, who I'm going to mention first even though she has a really small role just because she's awesome, Horie Yue, Canna Nobutoshi, Hayami Show, Mizuki Nana and Nazuka Kaori to name just a few. The music is really good too. Which makes the sound the best part of the series.The yuri factor is a 2/10. There are a few scenes between Kaoru's Inukami that come off as kind of homo-erotic, but there's no real pattern and they're quick to remind you that they all love Kaoru so huggy muggy much.My final rating for Inukami is a 3/10. There are a few funny moments and the voice acting and music are great. Aside from that, however, it's a mess of predictable jokes and under-developed characters. If you think that seeing perverts run around is funny you might have fun with it. Otherwise I couldn't recommend it. It's few genuinely funny moments just aren't worth enduring the romance, which is so bad it could've been written by Stephanie Meyer. and seek justice. What an original concept... Wait, no.

Inukami in particular didn't look like anything special, but it turned out to be the shining gem buried in a pile of shit.Story and Art were good. At times the story didn't follow the story arc format, and each episode possessed its own individual stories, but closer to the end of the series, Inukami does turn into a story arc show.This show looked like just another ecchi comedy anime, but I was greatly mistaken with this judgment. While the humor is perverted...in nature, it veers away from the usual &quot;trip and fall on top of the girl with the hand touching an inappropriate place,&quot; and the overly used sexual situations that usually occur in animes. The humor of this anime is just plain WRONG in a good way. The humor is perverted in nature, but not in a sexual way (I know that sounds like a contradiction, but you'll know what I mean when you watch it).Lets just say all of the villains are unbelievably likable. They all seem to have a male genital complex. Instead of using their hands or swords for weapons, THEIR GENITALS BECOME THE WEAPONS that the heroes must fight against (I know WTF). Just try watching the first episode and I know you will definitely be hooked. in nature, it veers away from the usual &quot;trip and fall on top of the girl with the hand touching an inappropriate place,&quot; and the overly used sexual situations that usually occur in animes.

Youko is Keita`s Inukami, but she`s not like the others. Not obedient nor respectful, she is a big burden on Keita financially. Youko does, at the very least, love him. She is prone to jealousy though, and extremely possessive, not to mention starved for attention, but Keita is a free, perverted soul who does his best to escape her grasp and hit on all the women he comes across. It`s too bad for him that Youko can teleport and...control fire.A vast majority of Inukami is episodic. Youko and Keita get caught in situations while extinguishing evil at the request of others. Very slowly, a central story line involving Youko`s father and a perverted wizard develops, but it works within the episodic Inukami framework. The smaller subplots all involve Youko and Keita abusing each other. Keita takes advantage of his Inukami`s naivete to hide his unfaithful intentions while Youko, ever the sadist, will often tease Keita into situations where he`s the most vulnerable, only to suddenly humiliate him. She`s not beyond outright delivering simple and straightforward vengeance when she feels wronged either. Youko, unlike most tsundere`s, makes it clear to all that she wants Keita, or rather, she already sees him as her property. Her innocent notions of romance, cuddling, going on dates, receiving courting gifts, gives her sadistic nature a playfulness that makes it easy to laugh at. Her favorite form of torture is teleporting Keita out of his clothing, buck naked in the middle of the street. It may sound harsh, but Keita`s closet exhibitionism keeps him from being traumatized. Youko`s violence doesn`t stem from misunderstandings ala Love Hina. Keita`s punishments are his just deserts. His humorous ambivalence, or even outright aversion to Youko`s tenderness alone warrants a smack. Add to that his shameless sex drive and a pompous chauvinism, and it feels good to see the bastard hurt a little.For a harem girl, Youko is quite a joy to watch. She`s innocent at heart, mischievous with her lover, but at the same time easy to anger, and frighteningly belligerent. Her abusiveness with Keita is a slap on the wrist compared to the hell she`d unleash if prompted by her jealousy and possessiveness. The gloves are off for people who stand between her and her cozy relationship with Keita. It might sound biploar, a murderous violence with innocent affection behind it, but it all makes sense under her territorial nature; almost like a nurturing beast protecting its offspring.Inukami is splashed with harem drama, but its sense of humor is its boon. At least half of the scenes that are built like a corny attempt at a tear jerker are, at the last moment, twisted into one of its ridiculous jokes. Aside from the lovers` spats of Youko and Keita, the humor in Inukami is totally inappropriate, and i mean that in a good way. The Inukami world is full of freaks with all kinds of sexual ""hobbies"". The villain in the first episode is a restless soul who shoots people with a beam from his genitals, stripping them of their clothing, and he`s one of the tamer ones.The minor characters; the freaks, perverts, Youko`s ridiculous father and the exhibitionist wizard display their rather nasty perversions so openly and proudly, so earnestly that it`s hard not to laugh at how harmless yet disgusting they are. One of them is a salary man, complete with a suit, who spends all his screen time tied up in bondage fashion with ropes, screaming to be punished. He doesn`t even untie himself to walk. Most of the real cast was quite a drag though. Keita`s cousin`s 10 Inukami, which he encounters quite often, are a gang of shamelessly unoriginal harem characters. Keita himself is something of a cliche harem anime lead: perverted most of the time, but unnaturally caring at others. Keita is a functional, if simple character when he is a skirt chaser, but his sex driven mind is so extreme that it`s hard to see him in any other role, much a considerate prince charming that the girls swoon over. The kindness is such a sudden and contradictory shift that it feels unnatural.As fun as it is to watch Inukami`s twisted humor, it is just as unbearable when it doesn`t have the good sense to stay away from drama. Towards the end, a story that actually takes itself seriously develops, which peaks at a long and melodramatic battle between the heroes, and a real villain. Not some exhibitionist or pervert, but maybe the embodiment of evil itself. Putting aside its unbearable cheesiness, it just feels completely out of place in the established Inukami world. It begs the question why a harem comedy based on perversion of all sorts suddenly wants a Sailor Moon-esque ending.Inukami is quite long, and eventually Youko`s violence becomes more and more simple. It is too often devoid of the trickery by both parties that made the abuse fun earlier in the series. Keita doesn`t even attempt to escape Youko before setting his lecherous sights on some other girl. In fact, he`ll holler at girls when she`s right next to him, evidently, asking to be burned to a crisp.--It`s easy to recommend the first 2 episodes to anyone who`s okay having a little male nudity with their fan service, but the humor becomes more and more tainted with standard harem fare as the series moves on, and the ending takes an epic turn for the terrible. control fire.A vast majority of Inukami is episodic.

The kindness is such a sudden and contradictory shift that it feels unnatural.As fun as it is to watch Inukami`s twisted humor, it is just as unbearable when it doesn`t have the good sense to stay away from drama. Towards the end, a story that actually takes itself seriously develops, which peaks at a long and melodramatic battle between the heroes, and a real villain. Not some exhibitionist or pervert, but maybe the embodiment of evil itself. Putting aside its unbearable cheesiness, it just feels completely out of place in the established Inukami world. It begs the question why a harem comedy based on perversion of all sorts suddenly wants a Sailor Moon-esque ending.Inukami is quite long, and eventually Youko`s violence becomes more and more simple. It is too often devoid of the trickery by both parties that made the abuse fun earlier in the series. Keita doesn`t even attempt to escape Youko before setting his lecherous sights on some other girl. In fact, he`ll holler at girls when she`s right next to him, evidently, asking to be burned to a crisp.--It`s easy to recommend the first 2 episodes to anyone who`s okay having a little male nudity with their fan service, but the humor becomes more and more tainted with standard harem fare as the series moves on, and the ending takes an epic turn for the terrible.', ""Inukami! is a slapstick comedy following the adventures of Keita and Youko as they face enemies and spirits that must be vanquished. After 26 episodes, I must admit I was a bit bored with the episodic, repetitive style Inukami! follows, but the comedy throughout each episode was worth watching.There's very little character development, even among the main characters. Inukami! is meant as a pure comedy anime, and as such, things such as story and characters are definitely not strengths here. The reason for watching is to enjoy and laugh at the hilarious situations that come up.The art is well done. There is very little CG...effects; heck, even the explosions are drawn. What's really different is how the characters are drawn. Most anime have skinny characters, but Inukami! has very chubby (and I might add, a little on the short side!) characters. It looks a bit ugly at the start, but you'll get used to the style after a few episodes.The sound is fair. Nothing that stands out as fantastic or terrible.Overall, I enjoyed the pure hilarity in Inukami!, although due to its lack of story and engaging characters, it shouldn't have been 26 episodes. The only thing that's worth watching for is the comedy, and with 26 episodes, after the initial humor dies out, there isn't much of a show to watch.

That's right so sue me if that's wrong but that how I felt.Story- The story itself is a new twist on numerous generic plots those being the animes where there is a master slave scenario (though not in the evil hurting way and more cutesy pokemon way), there is a play on the spirit world/spirit hunter type of anime, and of course your basic girl meets guy plot with a harem scheme thrown...in to keep things interesting.Art- Okay it wasn't terribly drawn but I think things could've been done better so in the end I was a little unimpressed with the art.Sound- Voice acting was okay and so was every other sound I heard of course jap lang eng sub is best for optimum watching experience.Character- I felt more could've been done with character development I mean this series had a lot of episodes and plenty of them were just plain unnecessary so what would've been so bad about some deeper character development episodes.Enjoyment- I liked plenty of aspects about the series but because of some of the blatantly unnecessary stupidity and cruddy jokes my enjoyment was far less than it should've been.Overall- I summarize this series as a bad joke that's good for a cheap laugh.

Its funny. But it can be very serious. It has romance. But also some ecchi. The fighting is done well. The characters are very realistic and likable. The only bad thing I have to say about this show is. The amount of MALE NUDITY! really disturbed me. You will see ten times more naked men in this show than any other. Ya that part sucks. they should have shown more girl nudity. but oh well. the girls in the show are really hot. so in conclusion. If you can stand some male nudity than you should defineatly watch...this show. beacuse it is really good. this show. beacuse it is really good.', ""While Inukami! introduces some interesting ideas, they are overshadowed by subpar pacing, a weak story-line, and an excessive number of characters. The series suffers from an overwhelming cast—aside from the main duo, more than 10 characters attempt to be developed without much success. What exacerbates the issue is that some of these characters play crucial roles in the anime's conclusion, yet they receive minimal screen time, drastically reducing the conclusion's appeal. The majority of the series lacks a cohesive overarching narrative until the final episodes, where an abrupt attempt is made to craft a dramatic conclusion. Character designs exhibit a mix of successes and failures,...with evident attention given to the Inukami, but other characters appearing as mere afterthoughts. Animation quality is passable and sometimes colorful, but overall, Inukami! fails to warrant serious consideration for viewing. with evident attention given to the Inukami, but other characters appearing as mere afterthoughts.

There is not one genre that is dominant (if there is it would be comedy) and there aren\'t significant one-path arcs (unlike Princess Lover!, first 6 vs last 6 eps), except the ending...episodes, which solved all of the mysteries covered earlier in the series.Notably, in the supernatural genre, its skills development were pretty stagnant, as in the case of Wagaya Oinari-sama, but Inukami does not adopt a mainly slice-of-life approach, which Wagaya does.Another supernatural genre show, Nurarihyon no Mago, is not bad too, except that its events usually take 2 to 3 episodes to resolve, thus resulting in low content, which is unlike Inukami,which has a lot of events that start and end within 1 ep.Story:9The story is undeniably constructed in a sense of enjoyment first, plot later. The first few episodes were mainly gag, but setting a clear direction for the show to follow: a show filled with perverts.As the story continued on, there were tons of tear-jerking moments, hot-blooded action, tragedy etc. which in a way reminds me of Ai Kora manga.The ending, lasting a few episodes, was not exactly fantastic as some parts seem too easily resolved and there was sort of a ""cliffhanger"" at the end. But what was fantastic was the studio\'s ability to incorporate humour even in the darkest scenes. Therefore, although there was a lot of tragedy, the viewer still can enjoy it at the end.Art:8The color used seemed to be pastel colors, I believe. Seeing that this is a 2003 show, I wouldn\'t mind the color too much. What surprised me was the animation. Sometimes the action is quite fluid, while sometimes the animation moved in frames. Most action scenes were fluid though, which was commendable.The art was consistent (as in character designs and the background, and of course the elephants :D)Sound:7The sound part was a bit unsatisfactory though. I liked most OSTs, although a few of them sounded out-of-tune somehow.The OP was nice, both music and animation, except that the music was kinda melancholic and the tune was repeated a few times. This is in contrast to a mostly ""happy"" show (meaning light atmosphere).The ED on the other hand, was good both by animation and music (esp with a few quirky versions such as ep18\'s ed, which was about machos and sung by machos). However, the lyrics were a bit out compared to the content of the show, and I felt it should not have been used there.Character:10The character section was the ace of the show. Quirky frequently-aired characters numbering at least 20 played their roles well in making the show a huge success.Keita and Youko\'s voices were very well done as they portrayed tons of emotions and scenes that ranged from a kids to a ""more grown up"" show (lol).The huge number of cast was managed very well, and none of the characters seemed awkward in the show.Enjoyment:9This is a very subjective section, some of the viewers might not accept the large amounts of MANSERVICE (quoted from Archaeon) that is truly truly unique in this show.Well some parts may be a little disgusting to certain people but I certainly enjoyed this show more than most other anime I\'ve watched (Well, its chaotic comedy seems to lose to Macademi Wasshoi imo though).Overall:10This seems to be an underrated anime. Overall, THIS IS A SHOW NOT TO BE MISSED!!! Well, that is, unless you can\'t take the direction that this unique show took.

I\'m certain my judgement of its flaws are clouded by how much fun I had wa tching it, but what can I say. It was a joyride. The whole layput of the anime is a bit weird so I will split my review into 2 halfs and judge them semiholistically rather than going over character, story, art, and all that crap.The first bit is full of carefree standalone or 2 part episodes that really just feature the...main 2 characters and focuses on the ecchi and comedy aspect. I remember laughing a decent amount. I myself have been super desensitized to fan service/ecchi, but there seems to be very little in this anime makes a bit of sense since its from 2006. Overall the first bit is carefree and easy to watch. You can watch it at your own pace as well.Then we get to last 3rd/quarter which is an absolute treat. It starts ramping up a bit midway through and you sort of think that it is going to start to take itself too seriously and fall on its face, but it does the opposite. This anime will 100% make you say ""gawd dayyum this shit just got real!"" But the 0 to 1000 that happens is absolutely exhilerating. Every aspect of the anime amps up to the max from the story to the character developement, the animation and music, the romance, the action, and even the comedy. The final episode is really well done as well which is a rarity for me. I am so used to being dissapointed or longing for more but I think that InuKami really wrapped itself up nicely. The transition from the first half to the second was a little odd but idk it really worked for me.Overall this anime of course had its problems and was quite a bit of a mess, however it was always incredibly enjoyable. If it was refined it would have been a classic, but I can respect the artistic chaos the producers went with as it gives it a lot of uniquness that will make it unforgettable.

There are plenty of questions left unanswered (that is why it gets just 9) probably because they hoped for a second season or because they did not know in what direction to go with the manga still unfinished. Regardless of...this it is very funny and the ending is acceptable.  As graphic I would say it does not try to be the most realistic but it is still acceptable (unlike Naruto) .

Grancrest Senki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34279/Grancrest_Senki,"[""I can't say for sure what convinced me to stick with Grancrest Senki until the end, but it became a surprisingly good JRPG inspired action-adventure series.Record of Grancrest War is, in my opinion, a shining example of how a story can be brought to life remarkably with a talented director. The director Shinichi Omata previously perfected his craft with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, he’s proven by now that he’s capable at adapting a good source material; plenty of his visual storytelling quirks are visible in the political drama this series offers. Grancrest is quite different from the drama oriented Rakugo in that its story is...fantastical and its setting revolves around the battlefield.In adapting this different kind of story, Omata employs new methods to realize the more battle-focused structure. However, this adaptation would prove to be a much tougher ambition. The light novel Grancrest Senki was adapted from is quite long, which is the cause of pacing issues in the first half. The plot moved quickly at first, but upon rewatching all 24 episodes at once they're not nearly bad enough to ruin the show. After all, this is a fast-moving adrenaline-pumping battle show, moving from one battle to the next prevents it from growing tiresome. However, the fast pacing does make it hard to keep track of all the characters and plot lines when watching it weekly. This is likely the cause of so much hate for the show, I know it turned me off at first, but giving it a second chance was definitely worth it. I highly recommend watching this series all at once to enjoy the story at its best.The story’s premise is relatively simple, Chaos reigns throughout the world and only lords with the power of Crests can stop it. Rather than focusing their efforts to put a stop to the chaos, the lords choose to fight and take one another's Crests because having the power to purify the chaos means control over everyone in the continent who needs protecting. Enter the mage Silica, the series heroine who despises the lords for their greed, through a chance encounter she meets the compassionate wandering knight Theo, seeking to save his homeland. Together they join forces and in a style not dissimilar to a standard JRPG or Dungeons & Dragons, they assemble their party of lords and gradually grow their army. With the goal of unifying the crests and ending Chaos, so more or less world peace, they’re really easy heroes to root for.This isn't an original story by any means, but it did manage to engage me in spite of this. Not even the fast pacing of the first half could make it difficult to understand what is occurring, although it does help to watch the show consecutively rather than weekly. Rewatching Grancrest after witnessing how it develops in the second half led me to pick up on many details I had initially ignored. The first time I watched it I was mostly disinterested in the plot until the pacing slowed and allowed the main cast time to develop enough to be likable. After rewatching the first half I noticed how despite the cast being incredibly large, the series always makes an effort to give it’s characters motivations.The source material is probably more in-depth with backstories and more extensive dialogue, but somehow this adaptation is able to compensate for what it’s missing with fantastic directing. One of the best and most frequent examples of this is during important discussions, the director loves to clue you in on how one of the major characters is reacting. He uses very purposefully uses close-ups to consolidate a subtle emotional reaction at the perfect moment. It’s like how you could praise a joke for being well timed, the close-ups are timed right when a key phrase is said invoking a small but important reaction. Perhaps using close-ups like this is sort of a shortcut in writing, but when you have so many characters to juggle with so little time it’s a very helpful way to keep the audience engaged with the cast.The cast themselves are a fairly standard JRPG party with Theo Cornaro as their leader. Theo is your typical nice guy protagonist, except he actually uses the power he gains to make the world better throughout the show. He’s sort of misguided at first; one of his best lines representing this being “Why can’t we get rid of taxes?” and as usual Silica gently implies that he’s kind of an idiot in the same way a kindhearted little kid is. Even without having the most complex personality, he proves consistently that he is a compassionate person by always putting others ahead of him. Regardless of how high his status rises throughout the series, he doesn’t let himself forget even his foot soldiers.Frankly, Theo’s simplicity isn’t an obstacle for enjoying the show because he doesn't dominate center stage, he shares it with his partner and eventual love interest Silica, who is a considerably more compelling character. Thankfully Silica is given plenty of agency in the story, she strategizes Theo’s wars with and sometimes for him while he riles up his army with niceness. I hate seeing the love interest character shuffled off into the corner with no pull in the narrative, so Silica’s defiance and individuality are quite refreshing. Their burgeoning romance throughout the series feels incredibly organic, they don’t fall in love because Theo is the guy with the power but out of mutual respect for one another and passion for the same goal. He wants to unite the crests so they can be used to protect everyone and she expresses disdain for the lord's misuse of the crests; they’re a dynamic duo and they have genuine chemistry together in and out of the battles.And the battles, so many battles. I wasn’t prepared for exactly how much fighting would be in Grancrest Senki, but I suppose it does live up to its English title Record of Grancrest War. The battles are how the series progresses its story, similar to the JRPGs that inspired it. If you want an ally, fight them and prove you’re worthy. If you have a disagreement, fight them and prove who’s right. Thankfully, the action is passionately animated. Action scenes are dynamically directed with many different fighting styles used, with different animators hired throughout the series to keep this approach to telling the story refreshing. Even the guy who animated the breathtaking sakuga in Fate/Apocrypha returned to do a few episodes here, and dare I say they fit Grancrest even better thanks to its strong emotional core. There were, however, a few times where the visuals weren’t up to snuff and it was clear they were saving the budget for a grand climax. Other than those low points, it’s visually quite solid.The various art styles and animation techniques used to great effect make Grancrest Senki feel more experimental rather than the standard look you’d expect from A-1 pictures. Director Shinichi Omata reminds us of his penchant for well realized dramatic moments with great editing on and off the battlefield. Notably, some of the storyboards used for one of the show's cruelest antagonists Milza are suitably moody with alienating points of view constantly hiding him in shadows. Another great way the villain is portrayed is through the striking thicker lines and his character design being engulfed in darkness aside from his eye and weapon, perfectly conveying the intimidation meant to be felt by the heroes. The visuals superbly define the tone at many points throughout the show; whether it be sweeping establishing shots of lush castles, the dark abstract style to show the presence of chaos, and especially the hopeful horizons illuminated by the setting sun to convey levity after a war. Also, the use of its thrilling orchestral pieces and occasionally uplifting ones do wonders for ensuring emotional beats are on point.The most impactful part of the story comes at the very end with the most satisfying and rewarding finale the series could have possibly had. Resolving the conflict in a way that beautifully reincorporates the uplifting themes and previously unresolved character arcs. Although the plot's direction is predictable to anyone who has played a JRPG of its type, what matters is the execution. This isn't some kind of mystery story, although there are plenty of twists and even a couple of shocking betrayals sprinkled in, the story's main success lies in how it's stellar story-telling. I can't say more without spoiling it, but just know that the ending truly feels like a reward for completing the series.[Final Score: 7/10]Grancrest Senki’s standard tale of underdogs rising to power is so engaging because of great visual storytelling. If you’re looking for a combat-oriented action-adventure, with plenty of in-depth strategizing, and a romance featuring two compelling leads, then chances are you’ll find this series as enthralling as I did. fantastical and its setting revolves around the battlefield.In adapting this different kind of story, Omata employs new methods to realize the more battle-focused structure.

Not even the fast pacing of the first half could make it difficult to understand what is occurring, although it does help to watch the show consecutively rather than weekly. Rewatching Grancrest after witnessing how it develops in the second half led me to pick up on many details I had initially ignored. The first time I watched it I was mostly disinterested in the plot until the pacing slowed and allowed the main cast time to develop enough to be likable. After rewatching the first half I noticed how despite the cast being incredibly large, the series always makes an effort to give it’s characters motivations.The source material is probably more in-depth with backstories and more extensive dialogue, but somehow this adaptation is able to compensate for what it’s missing with fantastic directing. One of the best and most frequent examples of this is during important discussions, the director loves to clue you in on how one of the major characters is reacting. He uses very purposefully uses close-ups to consolidate a subtle emotional reaction at the perfect moment. It’s like how you could praise a joke for being well timed, the close-ups are timed right when a key phrase is said invoking a small but important reaction. Perhaps using close-ups like this is sort of a shortcut in writing, but when you have so many characters to juggle with so little time it’s a very helpful way to keep the audience engaged with the cast.The cast themselves are a fairly standard JRPG party with Theo Cornaro as their leader. Theo is your typical nice guy protagonist, except he actually uses the power he gains to make the world better throughout the show. He’s sort of misguided at first; one of his best lines representing this being “Why can’t we get rid of taxes?” and as usual Silica gently implies that he’s kind of an idiot in the same way a kindhearted little kid is. Even without having the most complex personality, he proves consistently that he is a compassionate person by always putting others ahead of him. Regardless of how high his status rises throughout the series, he doesn’t let himself forget even his foot soldiers.Frankly, Theo’s simplicity isn’t an obstacle for enjoying the show because he doesn't dominate center stage, he shares it with his partner and eventual love interest Silica, who is a considerably more compelling character. Thankfully Silica is given plenty of agency in the story, she strategizes Theo’s wars with and sometimes for him while he riles up his army with niceness. I hate seeing the love interest character shuffled off into the corner with no pull in the narrative, so Silica’s defiance and individuality are quite refreshing. Their burgeoning romance throughout the series feels incredibly organic, they don’t fall in love because Theo is the guy with the power but out of mutual respect for one another and passion for the same goal. He wants to unite the crests so they can be used to protect everyone and she expresses disdain for the lord's misuse of the crests; they’re a dynamic duo and they have genuine chemistry together in and out of the battles.And the battles, so many battles. I wasn’t prepared for exactly how much fighting would be in Grancrest Senki, but I suppose it does live up to its English title Record of Grancrest War. The battles are how the series progresses its story, similar to the JRPGs that inspired it. If you want an ally, fight them and prove you’re worthy. If you have a disagreement, fight them and prove who’s right. Thankfully, the action is passionately animated. Action scenes are dynamically directed with many different fighting styles used, with different animators hired throughout the series to keep this approach to telling the story refreshing. Even the guy who animated the breathtaking sakuga in Fate/Apocrypha returned to do a few episodes here, and dare I say they fit Grancrest even better thanks to its strong emotional core. There were, however, a few times where the visuals weren’t up to snuff and it was clear they were saving the budget for a grand climax. Other than those low points, it’s visually quite solid.The various art styles and animation techniques used to great effect make Grancrest Senki feel more experimental rather than the standard look you’d expect from A-1 pictures. Director Shinichi Omata reminds us of his penchant for well realized dramatic moments with great editing on and off the battlefield. Notably, some of the storyboards used for one of the show's cruelest antagonists Milza are suitably moody with alienating points of view constantly hiding him in shadows. Another great way the villain is portrayed is through the striking thicker lines and his character design being engulfed in darkness aside from his eye and weapon, perfectly conveying the intimidation meant to be felt by the heroes. The visuals superbly define the tone at many points throughout the show; whether it be sweeping establishing shots of lush castles, the dark abstract style to show the presence of chaos, and especially the hopeful horizons illuminated by the setting sun to convey levity after a war. Also, the use of its thrilling orchestral pieces and occasionally uplifting ones do wonders for ensuring emotional beats are on point.The most impactful part of the story comes at the very end with the most satisfying and rewarding finale the series could have possibly had. Resolving the conflict in a way that beautifully reincorporates the uplifting themes and previously unresolved character arcs. Although the plot's direction is predictable to anyone who has played a JRPG of its type, what matters is the execution. This isn't some kind of mystery story, although there are plenty of twists and even a couple of shocking betrayals sprinkled in, the story's main success lies in how it's stellar story-telling. I can't say more without spoiling it, but just know that the ending truly feels like a reward for completing the series.[Final Score: 7/10]Grancrest Senki’s standard tale of underdogs rising to power is so engaging because of great visual storytelling. If you’re looking for a combat-oriented action-adventure, with plenty of in-depth strategizing, and a romance featuring two compelling leads, then chances are you’ll find this series as enthralling as I did."", '***Caution: This review contains spoilers (the specific spoiler discussions will be clearly marked for you to see) so if you can\'t predict a cliched anime’s cliches, skip the spoiler sections I\'ve marked. Also, do not read this review if you are a Grancrest diehard because it\'ll probably trigger you, unless if you\'re objective. If you\'re neither of these parties, read on with a free mind!***Grancrest was the first seasonal I picked up in 2018 (not saying much since it released in Jan 6 anyway) and unfortunately my 2018 mean fell right off the bat. Grancrest stumbled out of the gate and fell flat on its...face for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it\'s footing right. There are different places where I found the show good or bad, which is why I don\'t consider this show absolutely trash (surprise surprise, not FranXX anyway). So it\'s first episode started off very conveniently in such that Theo appears out of nowhere, beats the Lord after coming out of nowhere, and picks a somewhat scantily clad girl after as mentioned (not unlike most other isekai or fantasy anime, but I\'m not complaining, nothing wrong with fanservice I say :P), coming out of nowhere. Sounds like a rant so I\'ll tone down for the next bit.The show tried introducing it\'s characters little by little, introducing us to examples like Lassic, Milza among others for the early episodes and introduced others later down the line too. It\'s always good to see that not all the cast is revealed in its first episode, but unfortunately that didn\'t help much because we had to make room for our Oh-so-great green haired MC, Theo. Many praised his “badassery” and his “forward-thinking” and him “not being dense and weak” and I was terribly confused since none felt true except for his dense part which was randomly and conveniently revealed in a later episode. That is the problem with the show, it\'s that it\'s too convenient. “Oh Theo is gonna die” but something convenient happens and he\'s saved. “Oh this is gonna happen” but then to benefit Theo’s side it doesn\'t and the opposite direction is taken. I mean, the show makes Theo out to be like he\'s the coming of the Messiah or something. He comes, conquers VERY easily, is kind to people (more on that in a bit) and has people serve him in droves. I know it sounds like a rant but to be objective there\'s nothing wrong with having a righteous MC. It\'s just that in its current premise I doubt that\'s what\'s needed or what makes the most sense. What do I mean? The show is trying to prove that war is dark and to win a war there are sacrifices to be made but Theo goes Yang Wen-Li and wins the war without any well thought out tactics? No thank you. This isn\'t how you do a war show and definitely not how you make a badass MC. I mean, speaking of Yang, that show excellently shows why war is dark.Where there is war there is loss on both sides and this MC is the complete opposite of that. Is there anything wrong with never losing? I don\'t think so, I mean, a guy like Yang Wen-Li has lost at least once and Theo never did? Don\'t joke with me A-1. If you\'re making your MC win as well, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Speaking of believable we\'ve got the laughable “battle tactics”. Once again, it\'s a show about war so it should have a proper description of what battle tactics are right? WRONG. There is absolutely no mention or any sense in the “battle tactics” involved and it\'s just “Charge and win” which I doubt is something that works even 10% of the time, especially when you\'re constantly outnumbered. A simple “We\'ll attack from here and there to trap them” isn\'t how a battle tactic works. Sense? No, definitely not. Oh and speaking of no sense, we go back to our MC, Theo. To be fair, he did have a decent backstory, I definitely have to give credit where it\'s due and Theo’s backstory is one that deserves a clap. Just a clap. Why? It\'s because it was seldom explored after that one episode and they just threw in a pre-show romantic interest and let\'s just say “tried to be edgy” by giving her one heck of a bombed send-off. And bombs is not the word here. The battle tactics used there as well were close to zilch I\'m sad to say. How can inexperienced commoners beat an advanced army? I sincerely apologise because I do not know. Neither did the show.Then we move to the so called “romance subplot”. It was pretty obvious that Theo would be paired up with Blondie and unfortunately as I expected it wasn\'t done well. Why does Japan have a hard on for ruining blonde love interests in subplots? (Once again, there are exceptions, we have seen some good blonde love interests in other anime romance subplots before but not as often as one might expect). And this isn\'t about hair colour here. She was underused and overblown at the same time. She had around 2-3 important lines to say in each episode that were of value, no scratch that, 2-3 important lines every 2 episodes (severely averaged for ease of comprehensive analysis). Her only use was to satisfy the fanboys who already love Theo the “Hero"" and want a romance subplot with all the kisses and vows. What if you like me don\'t like Theo? Zannen-deshoka, you won\'t be satisfied at all.You might say Siluca herself might be able to stand on her own as a character but unfortunately that\'s not the case with most of the people in the cast. Why? It\'s because all the characters are cast as stepping stones for Theo-sama to step on and take this place as the best character and biggest badass in this anime. Result? Let\'s tone down before I turn this into a rant (“wait, it isn\'t?” I hear you say :P), disappointing. Convenience and stepping stones was the word here unfortunately. Now that I\'ve spewed enough poison over poison, let\'s calm our nerves down with the plus points of the anime apart from the sadly less explored Theo backstory, the soundtrack. I\'d be lying if I didn\'t tell you I jammed to the second OP each time it played, oh it was so epic. The music selection was needless to say, fantastic, and that\'s NOTHING to say of the BGM (that\'s BackGround Music to those who don\'t know), it was Grancrest\'s signature achievement. It sent chills down your spine and made you smile in anticipation of what\'s to come (spoilers: disappointment) and it pumped you up. The visuals thankfully weren\'t so bad in the OPs and EDs and on a personal note I loved both the EDs. You obviously may not see eye to eye with me but I loved both of them equally and served as an antidepressant for the earlier events of the episode.Now back to the negatives because I\'m out of positives to give, that one scene with Milza and Theo. Since this is a major spoiler so skip approximately 3 lines if you don\'t want to know about this predictable fight.***Spoiler begin: The thing is that Milza had given mercy to Theo when Theo didn\'t ask for it and was about to be killed in the first duel, but in the second and apparently more important one, Theo kills Milza. Nani? Why? What? How? Exactly. I thought they wanted to make Theo look like the next Messiah, what happened here? Well, one could say they wanted to make Theo look badass? I don\'t even know anymore, needless to say, it was in all literal and figurative sense, a bloody mess. Spoiler end***Moving back to the stepping stones, the characters. We go with another spoiler section (will not start immediately so hold on), Alexis and Marrine’s “Romeo and Juliet romance”. Pardon me while I vomit. Okay, let\'s continue, in terms of anime if you\'ve seen my dropped list I\'ve had the Romeo x Juliet anime at a 2/10 so if you like the story of it in anime form, I don\'t think you\'ll hate it so much, unless, if you treat Grancrest like it\'s equivalent. Romeo and Juliet, the Shakespeare play didn\'t focus on war as much as the romance, because surprise surprise, it\'s a romance first and foremost, and another important part is that there\'s tragedy involved. Does Grancrest follow any of these? No. Why is Marrine and Alexis’ romance related to Romeo and Juliet? Blame the fans, but that\'s not the issue here. It\'s that this type of romance won\'t work in a war show.I\'ve said this many times in different situations above, Grancrest does a lot of non-war things in a war show and it ruins many of the existing things relative to war shows as well. Going back to the Romeo and Juliet part, some say the Great Hall Tragedy shown in the first scene of the anime counts as tragedy but to that I say “read the original play”. In a later episode, in the final arc, the “final battle” which was hyped since the first few episodes that too, went with a POOF. And by POOF I don\'t mean a bomb. I mean “The anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction."" As described by Henry Gibbons. In other words, a kiss. Nani? What? Why? When? What happened to the deaths and sacrifices of all those who fought leading up to this event? Why did they hype this battle if this was how it would end? What sort of timing is this??? Marriage? Kiss? Love? Unity? Nothing wrong with all these, but the question remains. If you HAD to follow it this way, then what was the meaning of those previous 20 episodes? Were they to waste? Did they serve as bait? Couldn\'t this series start off at like episode 16 or 18 and be an OVA? So many questions, and little to no answers.And so, jumping back to the “It\'s a war” excuse, in a war you have major character deaths right? Where did the major characters die? Apart from a few minor characters who were obviously forgotten after the next 2 episodes when did we see the death of a main character? Once again, to be fair and objective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not having major deaths in an anime, I agree, but if you are indeed trying to show that Theo’s side was weak, then why didn\'t you have important deaths? Yes, the deaths in the first half did exist and they definitely served their purpose, so that\'s a plus point, but we didn\'t see anything after that… Now, a rebuttal to what people might point fingers at my review at, I\'ll definitely hear the likes of “Almost all your points against the show are targeting the war aspect of it. You don\'t know how war shows go. This show isn\'t about war, it\'s about blablabla”. Except for that last one which will definitely be used by those who don\'t even know what the anime is about (please, do not misunderstand, most of you aren\'t a part of this trope so do not worry), This show is all about war, it\'s called Grancrest Senki. So it\'s about war.Another example of a “war show” would be Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, which according to MAL in English is “The Asterisk War”. My point? Even though their names include the word war (or at least their English counterparts) none of them actually do follow the principles of a war show, less so in Grancrest, since it\'s whole premise was based on it and that immediately puts it just above Asterisk. So even though Grancrest is about war it rarely sticks to the proper formula of it and no, don\'t tell me it\'s a deconstruction, I\'ll kill you.Finally, we move on to the last issue of the show which I\'ll cover, the show’s artstyle. Made by A-1, I expected the show to do okay but it couldn\'t do that either. Character models looked weak, CGI was used in many scenes (not all), the choreography of the fight scenes themselves were so bad I cringed under my bones and to top it all off, I couldn\'t find it good at all even at 1080p (yes, I upscaled to 1080p episodes mid-season and still suffered with the artstyle). To go into a little more detail, the character models weren\'t that eye catchy and to cover for this factor they tried deploying fanservice into the war show to try and make things look attractive (oh fun fact: ever heard of showing your nude body to your army to bolster their morale? Me neither) and I\'m not complaining about fanservice (since I love it when used properly) but that it\'s used in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps the only “fanservice” that was used at the right time was Siluca’s outfit, which was… attractive :PApart from that the fanservice used in the show wasn\'t done well and A-1 after that episode stopped deploying it and went back to CGI war sequences. Once again to make it clear. I don\'t have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it\'s just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there\'s no such specific time for fanservice but I’d say otherwise. If it\'s not an Ecchi show, don\'t do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn\'t done well for the reasons explained above.***Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single “I still love you” (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer’s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like “they were the villain all along” sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of “What was the point of the past 20 eps???” and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end… Spoiler end***For anyone wondering about it\'s ending, Grancrest’s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it\'s purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you\'d expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war… Not something I\'d call amazing but eh, it served it\'s purpose I guess… I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.And so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn\'t at all what I\'d like to call a “good” show this year. It\'s plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis’ romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame “resolution” later on, the Artstyle wasn\'t what I expected, the battle tactics weren\'t at all present, the “final battle” was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo’s backstory was somewhat decent. This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don\'t expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?P.S: ***MAJOR SPOILER: Another show where the Hero restores peace to the land eh… how tiring and cliched. Not that the villain should win but this journey was terrible throughout… MAJOR SPOILER END***Story: 2.5Animation: 2Sound: 7Character: 1.5Enjoyment: 2.5Overall: 3.1 face for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it\'s footing right.

I don\'t have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it\'s just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there\'s no such specific time for fanservice but I’d say otherwise. If it\'s not an Ecchi show, don\'t do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn\'t done well for the reasons explained above.***Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single “I still love you” (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer’s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like “they were the villain all along” sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of “What was the point of the past 20 eps???” and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end… Spoiler end***For anyone wondering about it\'s ending, Grancrest’s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it\'s purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you\'d expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war… Not something I\'d call amazing but eh, it served it\'s purpose I guess… I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.And so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn\'t at all what I\'d like to call a “good” show this year. It\'s plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis’ romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame “resolution” later on, the Artstyle wasn\'t what I expected, the battle tactics weren\'t at all present, the “final battle” was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo’s backstory was somewhat decent. This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don\'t expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?P.S: ***MAJOR SPOILER: Another show where the Hero restores peace to the land eh… how tiring and cliched. Not that the villain should win but this journey was terrible throughout… MAJOR SPOILER END***Story: 2.5Animation: 2Sound: 7Character: 1.5Enjoyment: 2.5Overall: 3.1', ""War isn’t so bad but it’s what and how it leads to it. It seems in fantasy war stories these days, we rarely encounter a story that isn’t saturated with the most generic tropes possible. Romance, tragedy, revenge, politics. You name it. It’s there. What does that say for a show like Grancrest Senki (Record of the Grancrest War) though?To be fair, I’ve never read the original light novels before. It’s written by a guy named Ryo Mizuno who created the Record of Lodoss War series. Even as an anime original viewer, it felt like a series that was easy to jump into. The...premise isn’t overly complicated as we learn about how war broke loose in the world of Grancrest Senki. Humanity uses Crests that are capable of utilizing magic to deal with supernatural threats such as demons. The most powerful crests are known as Grancrest. Unfortunately, humans are flawed and war broke loose as people seek to gain the most powerful crests themselves. The series chronicles the story of Siluca Meletes and Theo Corano as the two hopes to end the conflict between humanity themselves and defeat the demons.Ok. It's not complicated but as an anime viewer, I’m baffled by the storytelling pacing of the show from the very start. It’s lightning fast that by the time I finished the fourth or fifth episode, it felt like the series jumped way over itself. It would be fair game if the show focused on the story with concrete development but instead, we are introduced with many characters early from the start. Besides Siluca and Theo, the show contains lots of characters of nobility. Aristocrats are a common sight and stands at the high tier of society. On the other hand, there are also characters that dedicates themselves to their own devoted duties such as Aishela, Irvin, and Margaret, and Marrine. Unfortunately, most of these characters have flaws like the way humans do. Some of their decisions in the show are very controversial. Marrine is a prime example in one of the later episodes as she makes a choice that will rub people in the wrong way.I have attempted to forgive the characters’ choices making as it’s not easy for a show like this to make adequate ones. In other words, how should we judge the characters? Let’s talk about our main protagonists, Siluca and Theo. These two come from different backgrounds but are perhaps the least corrupted individuals in their world. Siluca may be an inexperienced mage but she has a heart of gold. While not as skilled as some others, Siluca is a character with a clever mind although can be forceful at times to get her point across. It didn’t surprise to me that she would sometimes take risks to accomplish her goals. On the other hand, Theo is a man who is perhaps one of the most calm characters in the show. Always keeping his cool and in control of his emotions, it feels like the show designates him as an eventual leader. He also has human morals that are often shown through his actions and words. Often choosing a path with the least violence, Theo does engage in fighting if he feels absolutely necessary. While you could say that these two are perfectly suited for the show, they do make mistakes as well. It’s also inevitable that romance would eventually develop between the two as many hints are dropped in throughout the show. However, unlike most couple pairings, it seems these two really are destined to be together with their similar ideals. This is in contrast with some character pairings such as Marrine/Alexis or Villar/Margaret where fate somehow interferes with their love. Still, the show tries its best to maintain a balanced war story. Romance is actually subtle even with some of the background storytelling such as the one between Marrine and Alexis. In a show like this, I have to admit that throwing in many tropes at once doesn’t help it flow better. It’s like an amalgamation of fictional elements all coming together that may leave viewers feel distracted. The political affairs in the show also feels forced on many occasions despite being necessary for the overall story.With 24 episodes, the show’s pacing somehow still takes a stab in the heart. Some episodes are abruptly resolved while others loves to play around with its tropes. The storytelling itself is also predictable with some events that are inevitable to happen. As I mentioned before, there are too many characters that some are just left in the dust and others hardly developed. Aishela is a crime of this as we barely finds out anything about her at all until near the end of the show. By then, I wonder if viewers even cares. Others such as Priscilla and Mirza suffers from characterization as there are hardly any memorable qualities about them. It feels like the author decided to thrown in all sort of characters in at once to make the show feel credible. This even extends to characters with supernatural origins such as werewolves and vampires. Well, I suppose the creators wanted to take that risk but to me, it wasn’t rewarding in the end. With so many characters, Grancrest Senki felt like a play with an overstacked roster where not everyone got their chance to shine.To the surprise of no one, A-1 Pictures adapts the show as many of the series have a similar style when it comes to fantasy series. Because this show also involves war and magic, you’ll definitely get a familiarity of what they present each episode. First of all, I would like to say that the animation quality does look sharp especially in early episodes. The action choreography looks smooth and characters are decorated with enough details suitable for this show. However, the character designs themselves leaves little to be desired. Siluca’s ridiculous outfit is a prime example of being distracting to the point that she herself is aware of it. Others such as Marrine and Alexis looks incredibly one dimensional that fits with the nobility stereotype. Oh and of course, fan service exists. There’s skinship in some episodes that leaves little to the imagination while action is shown in brutal uncensored details. To say the least, A-1 did its job but not one that I can confess as impressive overall. The production quality does drop over time in typical A-1 fashion as time passes.Compared to a few other fantasy war stories I’ve watched, I’d say that Grancrest Senki has a moderate soundtrack. It didn’t set the bar high though as it still sounds very generic even during climatic battle scenes. The theme songs contains the sort of J-Pop style lyrics you probably hear often these days. Character voice mannerisms are moderate at best although I have to admit that certain cast members really sounds motivated. Even Siluca has her own moments that are sometimes worth quoting despite her personality.Watching Grancrest Senki reminds me of playing a video game where the developer wants you to love what the designed. Truth to be told, I think the show is average at best. It reached its high points in the show on some episodes while making an ill early impression. Quite frankly, there are way too many characters that by the time the show is over, I can only recall a few names. The pacing feel sloppy and really could have improved on many levels. Watch it if you want but be prepare for being underwhelmed. premise isn’t overly complicated as we learn about how war broke loose in the world of Grancrest Senki.

Grancrest Senki not only fails on the latter account, it also doesn’t concentrate enough effort on the fantasy itself, instead opting for, rushed, battle scenes with insufficient background knowledge to know why certain events are taking place.  Needless to say, the viewer is left in a state of confusion, wondering why events seem disjointed from one another, and what the purpose of the show is...as a whole.  Despite these glaring oversights, the show attempts to display a sense of grandeur with its use of magical spells and crest powers; however, it feels rudimentary in its approach, failing to distinguish itself from the crowd of analogous shows that came before its time.It is, in a word: commonplace.In fact, I would venture to guess that the show’s staff spent more of its time discussing what color a character’s hair, or eyes, should be, rather than determining an interesting way of presenting a strong narrative.  Sure, there are numerous, unforeseen plot twists that produce genuine shock, but they don’t meld well with the ongoing story.  They are, in essence, empty events, lacking necessary substance for the viewer to latch onto, and become empathetic to what is happening on the screen.  To crystallize these claims, look no further than episode nine, a major turning point in the series.  In a scene that is oddly reminiscent of episode eleven in Berserk (the 1997 series), Theo and Siluca take shelter in the base of a tree from precipitous rainfall.  Siluca, unable to control her emotions, confronts Theo about his thoughts towards her, as he admits that he loves her.  Besides being overly-romanticized, their infatuation for one another lacks the appropriate depth to feel authentic.  These two hardly know each other, except for the fact that Theo is a “prodigious” wanderer, and Siluca is a mage who get’s infuriated when other’s stare at her scantily clad outfit — for god’s sake, just wear something else you whiny tramp.Speaking of which, that brings me to the next whore, Marrine Kreische.  Being the “clairvoyant” that she is, Marrine decides that she cannot win the war without Mirza (the perpetually angry dude); thus, she passively offers herself to him in a scene that can only be described as inane.  I mean, let’s be honest, she just conquered the entire nation of Starck with little-to-no effort, because of the use of miasma.  Why, then, is it essential for her to have Mirza to the point of having intercourse with him?  Besides being proficient with his sword (hehe), he doesn’t offer much in terms of strategic planning or anything else that requires a modicum of actual thought.  Therefore, her decision to do the nasty with him doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.  It’s not the content of the scene that I’m enamored with — as far too many fanboy’s are — it’s the execution, and the lack of build up to her eventual fall from grace.The story, for lack of a better term, is nonsensical, and with each resultant plot twist, the damage becomes significantly worse.  Instead of concocting logical battle plans or implementing the use of military tactics, we see an angry Mirza slashing his sword through countless enemies, as his troops, apparently, watch him as he does so.  Swords glow, blood spills, magic happens, and new characters/countries are introduced with each passing episode; but, ultimately, it’s all window dressing to conceal the vacuous character’s that plague the viewer’s enjoyment.  Investing two minutes of each episode, to chronicle pivotal attributes of each pertinent character would have been time well spent; instead of resorting to cheap fan-service ploys (a-la Queen Eudokia when she “inspired” her troops).The omission of narrative flow is evident from the outset, as episodes leap from one critical moment to the next, without ample explanation to bridge the narrative gap.  Simply put: it is a gallimaufry of perplexing events.  The crux of this issue lies with the desire to construct an expansive story with a myriad of nations.  Nothing wrong with striving for breadth in an anime series, but when character’s are glossed over, and battles just seem to a happen — as if, from thin air — it becomes frustrating to solve the puzzle that the anime staff was too indolent to solve themselves.  Furthermore, there is no historical context as to why the Factory Alliance and the Fantasia Union are at odds with one another in the first place (let alone the intrusive involvement of the Mage Academy).  We are given a generic explanation that the various Lords want to collect the crests to increase their influence and power.  But, even then, where did the crests come from, and why do they possess such miraculous powers?  Can anyone become a mage, or only certain people?  Why didn’t we hear about the divine beasts until episode 20, and did they rip that concept off from Zelda: Breath of the Wild — certainly seems like it!Though, with “inspirational” lines like this, “It’ll all work out somehow,” from Theo Cornaro, the show’s main protagonist.  It’s not terribly surprising the show left numerous questions unanswered.  In the end, it aimed for everything (mostly through appropriation), yet it was all for naught, as it became the medieval equivalent of an Expendables movie. as a whole.

One episode we\'re watching a full war scene where every detail is being focused on with flashy fights, decent choreography, and plenty of magic.  The very next will have any battles just skimmed over as ""yeah some people died, here\'s a 5 second clip of people dying.""  One episode will go deep into the politics and bonds present in the show, then it switches to either skimming over...important things or it changes back over to thinking it\'s an action show.  Pick a speed, and pick a theme to tell your story, don\'t just mash everything you\'ve got into a pile and call it a tale.Story aside, most of the characters are as unbelievable as they can possibly be.  The MC Siluca has the loyalty of a squirrel that\'s found someone with a nut it wants (other MC: Theo).  Here we have an extremely talented mage who is already setup for fame and fortune throwing it all away to dedicate their entire life to a random stranger they found on the side of the road...what?  Theo is a complete mess of a character as, again, the authors can\'t seem to decide what he is. Is he naive, is he smart, is he dumb, is he aiming for the top, or is he simply looking to accomplish his goals? You can\'t make a good character by answering YES to all of the above!On top of all of this the story suffers from several elements being shoehorned in for no reason at all.  Why does Siluca wear revealing clothing? Because she was wearing them at the start of the show and is apparently incapable of ever changing them, despite constantly complaining about them and how everyone else leers at her.  Why did we need a sex scene between two people that have never even met before? Yeah, remember the pacing issue?  Five seconds of people dying in a horrible battle for territory, but here\'s a full timeslot dedicated to watching the two opposing rulers banging each other under the moon simply because he asked.  No reason, nothing added to the story, guy just walks up and says ""I know we\'re enemies but I want to have sex with you."" Who wrote any of this and thought it made a single degree of sense?!This show is a complete and utter mess, which is a shame as the art is actually pretty good.  The crests and clothing are colorful and really add to the atmosphere of the setting.  Too bad it\'s only dolling up nonsensical characters and awkward scenes.  The only reason I\'m still watching this at all is out of sheer curiosity of where this trainwreck is going to finally stop.(Written on episode 9) important things or it changes back over to thinking it\'s an action show.

Not because of Digibro with his 12 part Asterisk Wars sucks series. I hate A1 pictures is because the way they constantly ditching out garbage left and right as well not learning from the mistakes. Some people way say that Toei and Pierrot are the worse but least at times they can actually ditch out some quality and enjoyable projects every now and then compare to A1 Pictures where almost all the anime that were done by A1 are either mediocre or steaming pile of shit that shouldn’t exist. In...a nutshell, they are basically the anime equivalent of Electronic Arts where they love to pander to the lowest common denominator with the buggy releases, forced micro-transactions, and overall shallow games.Record of the Grancrest war along with Darling in the Franxx which is mainly a A1 show mind you are the latest A1 shows to come out from A1’s dog collars to deliver us two seasonal anime train-wrecks in order to once again please the lowest common dominator of anime with the atrocious writing, bland tropey characters, subpar art and preachy themes.Like with most A1 productions I kept my expectations very low because honestly the moment I praise a show from A1 the show would go back to its awful roots by having a stupid plot twist that completely goes against the narrative that has been previously been set up in previous episodes to having creepy and horrible sex scenes… Needless to say, I and my good friend decided to marathon this train-wreck of a show and by the end of it, we were shocked of how bad it was to a point where I actually one of A1 worst shows. Now with that, all said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of Record of the Grancrest war and with that said let’s dive into this train-wreck shall we.Story.Atlatan, a land ruled by\xa0Chaos. Fearing disaster brought about by chaos, the people lived protected by “Lords;” those with the power of “Crests,” used to suppress the chaos. However, the Lords decided to abandon the concept of protecting the people and turn against each other, stealing each other’s Crests to gain dominion over one another. The story follows Siluca a young mage who scorns the feuding lords for abandoning their people. One day she meets a wandering swordsman and Crest holder Theo\xa0who is trying to liberate his hometown from its tyrant lord. Seeking for an opportunity Siluca helps Theo raise his rank to a knight as well forming a contract with him.

A character starts off as a nobody but as soon as he gets invited to set army and trains for a while he became one of the strongest characters from the army. All of the fantasy cliches are present here.The writing is poor at best as it features a lot of questionable acts that go happened within the show, for example, the end of episode 9 where the alliance Marrine wanted to meet with Lord Milza so they can perform a ritual together by having sex in the open of a countryside. What the hell were you thinking A1 Pictures? It’s bad enough that they have sex in the open where at anytime they can get shot down by arrows by any faction but the way Marrine was acting during that sex act was incredibly disturbing and made me feel uncomfortable.

I hope to god that A1 Pictures will never animate a sex scene ever again because these incompetent bastards don’t know the meaning of sex.Don’t get me started with this shows directing because I have never seen a war fantasy show that skips fights/battles and a great example of this was in episode 17 where the Kilhis army focus was planning to attack the Dartanian \xa0army and instead of showing the whole battle as soon the leader puts on the golden mask on the show fades out and the next shot\xa0 we see that the Killhis forces were defeated and to add insult to entry the leader info-dumps all the events that happened in the battle instead of showing us the battle… WHY JUST WHY. I understand the show wanted to establish of how powerful the Dartanian army is but this was the cheapest way to do it. It’s like they clearly ran out of budget just for that scene.The worst thing from this show that single-handily killed the show was the pacing. The pacing in Record of Grancrest war is way too fast for its own good. It’ was okay in the beginning but it really became a big problem as the series goes on and because of the shows fast pacing almost all of the things that go on in the show feels incredibly rushed. The perfect example of this show awful pacing is with Theo character progression. In the beginning of the series, the show establishes that he is a sloppy fighter who cannot defend himself but in a couple of episodes later he suddenly becomes an expert fighter as well a ruler of his own lead who is very capable of taking over mutable lands. The sad part is thanks to the shows fast pacing we barely got to see any character development and growth from Theo at all.\xa0 This was single-handily Record of the Grancrest war biggest mistake and because of that the show became an insufferable train-wreck most A1 productionsOverall the story for Record of Grancrest Senki is just awful.2/10Characters.Like with the story the characters are only interesting if you never seen a fantasy anime before because they are all just generic fantasy characters that we all seen before.\xa0 Am not trying that having generic characters in a fictional work is bad because generic characters can actually be likable and charming if done right. The problems is apart from Siluca all of the characters in Record of the Grancrest war are all generic and one dimensional who have no charm at all.Theo is your typical fantasy lead that we all seen before other fantasy animes in the past. His character development is nearly non-existent thanks to this show pacing issues and his personality is boring.Siluca is a pretty decent female lead overall. She’s strong, likable, and just very enjoyable to watch. It’s such a shame that she’s not really the main focus because she could have been a great character if Theo didn’t exist. Now if I think about it Theo existence completely hold this character back from being great as she kinda devolves as a character as the series goes along where she just wants to lick on Theo’s dick.

The story is shallow and poorly written. The directing and pacing was beyond trash, most of the characters were sucked and the animation was subpar. The only decent things about this show were the visuals and music.Like with most A1 Productions it should be thrown in the dumpster where it should be destroyed. If you like Record of Grancrest War and any A1 production than good for you but don’t go out there and say that A1 is a great anime studio because you will only piss off more experienced anime fans such as myself. Don’t get me wrong I like a couple of A-1 shows like Black Butler Book of Circus/Murder, Woatkoi, Magi and Shinsekai Yori but for every A-1 show that I like these always a bunch of A1 shows that I hate like Eromanga Sensei, The Asterisk\xa0Wars, Fate Apocrypha, Sword Art Online etc.I don’t recommend this show to anyone unless you want to see how incompetent A-1 Pictures is as a studio for the 20th time.Hopefully, the PS4 game will be better.Final Score 2.5/10 a nutshell, they are basically the anime equivalent of Electronic Arts where they love to pander to the lowest common denominator with the buggy releases, forced micro-transactions, and overall shallow games.Record of the Grancrest war along with Darling in the Franxx which is mainly a A1 show mind you are the latest A1 shows to come out from A1’s dog collars to deliver us two seasonal anime train-wrecks in order to once again please the lowest common dominator of anime with the atrocious writing, bland tropey characters, subpar art and preachy themes.Like with most A1 productions I kept my expectations very low because honestly the moment I praise a show from A1 the show would go back to its awful roots by having a stupid plot twist that completely goes against the narrative that has been previously been set up in previous episodes to having creepy and horrible sex scenes… Needless to say, I and my good friend decided to marathon this train-wreck of a show and by the end of it, we were shocked of how bad it was to a point where I actually one of A1 worst shows. Now with that, all said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of Record of the Grancrest war and with that said let’s dive into this train-wreck shall we.Story.Atlatan, a land ruled by\xa0Chaos. Fearing disaster brought about by chaos, the people lived protected by “Lords;” those with the power of “Crests,” used to suppress the chaos. However, the Lords decided to abandon the concept of protecting the people and turn against each other, stealing each other’s Crests to gain dominion over one another. The story follows Siluca a young mage who scorns the feuding lords for abandoning their people. One day she meets a wandering swordsman and Crest holder Theo\xa0who is trying to liberate his hometown from its tyrant lord. Seeking for an opportunity Siluca helps Theo raise his rank to a knight as well forming a contract with him. Joining forces, Siluca, Theo and their allies fight together to end the war between the different noble factions, and put an end to the threat of Chaos.Like with most A1 productions they all have great concept and ideas on paper, however, A1 Pictures has the really nasty habit of taking things that have great potential and decides to screw it all up in actual execution and Record of Grancrest War no different.The story in Record of Grancrest War is only interesting if you have never seen any action fantasy anime in your life because it’s one of the most generic run of the mill fantasy story that there is.

The way it is portrayed is not what you would regularly see in animes, in...fact - it was refreshing. Overall, the only downside was the pacing of the actual story, which had been going all over the place (But it is well within acceptable bounds, you can clearly understand what is going on, and that is what matters most).-Art (10/10) - OutstandingI don't need to put many words here, the style and the shading were superb and I do wish to see more shows like this. Overall, it fits well with the story theme and was very pleasant.-Sound (9/10) - GreatI'm not an expert, but the sounds were Great! not something I will remember by the end of the next year, but they fit the setting pretty well in my opinion.-Enjoyment (9/10) - GreatThere was a certain scene that was controversial and caused a lot of spite in the anime community that took up the show,  but for me, that certain scene gave all the more enjoyment to the story in general and opened many more questions for me. It is an emotional ride, and I do believe that a show SHOULD have that sort of impact on you, be it a sad moment or something you feel outraged at; Grancrest Senki definitively had its fair share of squeezing our hearts (for better or worse).-Overall (9/10) - Personally anywhere between 8.7-9.2Finally, to address the issue of butthurt viewers. Halfway through the show, there is a certain scene that defines true fans of anime from people that are simply ignorant. That scene will define if you have any respect towards the author and the anime studio that made the anime possible. If you give a bad review solely because of that one scene, then congratulations - you have no respect for someone's hard work and time.Thank you very much for reading my review and I do hope it has touched some (or any) that come across it to pick up the show. fact - it was refreshing.

Prior to episode 9 I gave this series a solid 6. Nothing great but a fun story that was nice to kill a little time.Even before episode 9 the anime really fit into one of those awkward spots where it's not bad... but everything is done just a little bit wrong.For example the action is good... except since we rush through every battle it's hard to be invested into most of it so it's actually a bit boring except for the occasional badass moment but even that's a bit wasted by the pacing.The...setting is good ... but a lot of it is just skimmed over and a lot of it isn't getting properly addressed. .The characters are good ... but because of how the series chooses to divide it's focus they often do things for poorly explained or no reason. In order to avoid spoilers I'll just say the entire war has a feeling of pointlessness as the path to peace seems relatively easy but the characters able to do so choose not to because ... well the show needed a plot somehow.A lot of issues with the series come from it's pacing but besides the pacing itself it's presentation and focus are lack luster as well.But again even with all this considered it still had a fun tone that kept it a nice watch... then it suddenly turns insanely brutal episode 9 to the point the series isn't even recognizable. Don't mistake this as meaning the show improved either. The pace is still a mess and the presentation and focus are still poor. But while before it was midly forgivable as a light hearted adventure that didn't need a lot of depth now it's a full scale bloody war series that feels hollow.The antagonists are entirely unlikeable as their actions are needlessly brutal and psychotic but seemingly presented in a way that feels like the show wants the audience to sympathize with them.This leaves a rather bad taste as many likeable characters die for the sake of a war that didn't even need to happen based off of what the series itself has stated.I really don't recommend this to anyone as if you like the first 8 episodes you'll start to hate the series 9 onwards and if you are the type that likes 9 onwards it's not worth forcing yourself through the first 8 to get to. There are other anime that do brutal wars better so there is no need to waste time on this. setting is good ... but a lot of it is just skimmed over and a lot of it isn't getting properly addressed. .The characters are good ... but because of how the series chooses to divide it's focus they often do things for poorly explained or no reason.

When I started watching this show, couple episodes in I just kinda dropped it off. The art was nice and all but the pacing was all over the place, and I initially thought this was just going to be another one of those ecchi, harem run off the mill senki animes.I eventually found the time to give this series a chance and oh boy. As I kept watching the show just made me turn a complete 180 and now Grancrest Senki is one of the few shows that I look forward to with each passing week this season.The Good:+Art is great.+Characters...and their development.

The story was weak, the plots are cliche and weird. I just couldn't understand the story at all. The only thing that kept me to watch this series until the end is probably the relationship of the protagonist and the heroine. Although their development together doesn't really exceed my expectations. I guess(?) it's okay.This anime was pretty disappointing in my opinion, there were so many cliches that left me unimpressed with the series up until I had to hold it and watch around 20 more anime before...coming back to watch this again.

But then everything went down the hill in my opinion.It was going too fast but I still had the feeling that can still turn into a masterpiece, believing the potential in it.But After a couple of episodes, whatever the way characters or story turned out in this anime, (currently on 9th) diminished my will to continue watching it.Basically : No Connection between actions,...Poorly expressed characters and their reasons.I don't oppose some angel character turning into a total demon. But in this anime, there's just not enough factors and events to understand why things turned out like this. I don't care what will happen in the end.Might be spoiler but I don't think that is since it's the very first episode of the anime : I managed to ignore first events such as when bride leaves the groom just because some third party jackass ruins it, even the wedding meant to benefit both sides and bring peace, but that was just all bull feces.

There were better and worse ones. I have few that are my favourites but when I finished Grancrest Senki yesterday I was super happy that I had a chance to watch this one.Overall I can say that it was amazing story, full of action, magic, battles, creatures and romance. For me MC and his mage were really nicely done (however Silica should have more screen time)  along with a lot of other characters like Shadow, twin werewolves, valkyrie, vampire lord, black witch and few lords. Draw style was really nice, music was good but not superb.What I also...liked about this anime was that there were no hentai/echhi elements and instead we had a lot of drama but not so much like in Akame ga kill. Characters are not overpowered (maybe in fight with the cyclop...), they are humans which can easily die.  I was kinda worried about MC and Silica at the end (japanese creators love to kill some MC or make them disappear forever) because I like happy endings. However the ending was really nice (yet final fight with the Artist was kinda boring).I can recommend this anime to everyone.

WARNING!Pacing:Where do I begin! The pacing of the anime is horrendous considering that this anime is projected to have 24 episodes. The story line moves so fast that you won't be able to remember what is going on....Summary of Plot:The story is alright. It revolves around a young knight, Theo who tries to retake his homeland with the aid of a mage.Characters:Some of the worst and dumbest characters you will ever see. One does not have sex with other people they don't like. One does not give up title in the name of love. One does not be brave and watch his girl suffer. One does not act like a wimp when he is king.Enjoyment: 2/5There are scenes of consensual rape. Girl falls in love with dude but has sex with another. Yeah, I didn't enjoy it after that. However, the MC is one of the smoothest MC you will ever see. His romance is pretty good in terms of anime.Overall Breakdown:The anime pacing leaves it hard for any watcher to steadily follow without having to hit playback. The artwork makes it easier  to watch but often music covers the sound of the anime. Characters are soft or stupid and there is no perfect one except the MC. I suggest to do better use of your time but I can't make you so just be warned. I tried my best to like this anime but I can't.Lastly just read the Manga or LN because it is far better.

It's only 6 or 7 eps in that it finally has enough set up for it to really tell its story.The male MC is a typical commoner-with-a-will. Past that and he is quite flat for some time, ep 5 is where he actually starts to make his own plays.This show is not a battle show, the rushed first 4 epis are to get the MCs into a political location where they have enough there to have stakes in that arena. That being said, I am finding myself...having to pay extremely close attention to every single line of dialogue and every action much closer than I normally would.Now that the show is into the political end of the spectrum it can drop a lot of the shorthand that it had been using to set everything up.

They are used to further it, as examples of what the war looks like, as ways to show how each of the Lords acts in combat to their own ideals, ethics, and codes of conduct.Animation is adequate, not top tier, and not utter shit. I have no opinion on the soundrack or use of music, so it's doing its job.I am finding myself enjoying this show quite a bit despite its flaws. having to pay extremely close attention to every single line of dialogue and every action much closer than I normally would.Now that the show is into the political end of the spectrum it can drop a lot of the shorthand that it had been using to set everything up.

This show started off decent, but it was rough and seemed like it could take it somewhere. I read another review about the pacing being too fast or too slow at parts, that comment is totally true. The show starts up and the first 4 episodes go crazy fast. You think the directors and authors are pulling a Samurai Champaloo thing where the main characters are already op (maybe not the best comparison but thats all that came to mind), but it moves faster...then those crappy magic high school animes that are all the same with slight differences. I did not fully enjoy the show starting it, but it looked interesting and the characters could go somewhere. The romance is very forced and you are made to believe it,(another bad example coming up) its a failed attempt at introducing romance that is slightly believable. I haven\'t seend Clannand or what every but I have seen My High school Romantic comedy SNAFU (aka Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku) and that romance was as always childish as all slice of life romcoms are, but they got you to believe it. See if you want that love between Theo and Meletes to really show love and the power of love make it believable and develop it. Yes lie is in believe but doesn\'t mean its gotta be fake. And this is as someone who is not a weeb or otaku and somebody who hates this type of thing,CHARACTERSOkay here I want to take a breather and calm myself down before I go all out. This show has a nice main character Theo/Siluca I like Theo, he is not half bad. The show carried itself decently at the begin and it seemed like it was gonna be political, but delve into the characters more. Then the road block of bringing in politics is that you have to introduce all these characters and you want to make it make sense and make characters come off as cool and smart. They have focused alot more on everybody except the main characters, Theo and Siluca so far. The anime still has ability to make itself better and offer less empty space and change its paced to something better. Don\'t toss this anime right away as you have to understand some of the character creation is average and it seems as this show is being rushed from the studio. Its decent and if more time was put into the characters and the characters it could go from a 3 for characters to a 6 or 7. So if it hasn\'t scared you away stay tuned,because it almost had me scared.SPOILER SPOILER GOING TO RUIN A SPOILED SHOW AND WANT YOU TO KILL THE AUTHORS**Spoiler in 4 more stars****MARRINE AND MILZA WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WHAT VALUE DOES IT GIVE.

The +17 sign should be considered as well since it really is kinda +17.With those being said I'll move to the anime itself :We have the story first probably the weakest part of the anime but not that bad to make the whole thing worthless , it would've actually been a good story if the pacing was controlled and some explanations were given along plots but with the current plot holes you shouldn't expect much of it. If you lower your expectatins it would be an enjoyable show to watch (binge watch).Then we have the art , since A-1 is behind grancrest senki one would think of an average art at the very least and I must say they have done a pretty good job on the art. Its far from perfect but there are some scenes you want to pause and just look. The sound and background music go really well with the emotions and scenery depicted so that's a plus. The music and opening and ending themes are done really epic and go along really well with the anime.Next up are the characters , being one of the things I enjoy in the anime there are many different characters and personalities in grancrest senki , yes there are some typical stuff but overall it is really enjoyable seeing this many characters with different feelings which are actually relatable to some extent and help you enjoy the show as it is. you are not into that concept you shouldn't be watching it.

It sets up a decent premise as a fictional drama between nations.  I\'ve enjoyed similar anime like Arslan Senki and 12 Nations, so I thought I\'d give this one a chance despite its low MAL rating.  I need not have bothered.In actual execution, it is terrible.  The writers don\'t seem to know the first thing about politics, economics, or military strategy.  The battles are hilariously devoid of actual tactics and the political decisions made by the major players seem like those of petulant middle school students rather than leaders of nations.  Although, since my...nation elected Trump, I suppose it\'s not THAT unrealistic...Sorry, I got a little distracted there.  I tried to enjoy it for its romantic elements, but the decisions made by the Marrine character are also painfully unrealistic.  She and many of the other characters seem only able to act out of ego and pride without much intellect, wit, or critical thinking.  She claims to love Alexis but decides that the Grand Hall tragedy means their respective factions should return to war and therefore keep them apart.  Um... what?  Why not gang up on the actual parties responsible for the incident?  Instead of opening a criminal investigation and fighting back against the real culprits lets... give them what they want?That seems to be the extent of the strategic planning between factions in this anime.  They decide constantly to simply give the other factions what they want and allow themselves to be maneuvered for the dumbest of personal reasons.  Villar Constance, for example, refuses the leadership of the Union faction because ""grandfather wouldn\'t want his grandchildren to fight.""  And yet, by refusing to take the offensive, he sets up that exact situation where he and Marrine face each other across the batttlefield anyway.  Then, when his castle is under siege, instead of taking the defensive advantage he decides to sally forth in a 2 person suicide rush.  Could they not have held the causeway leading to the castle indefinitely with only a few troops?  Could they not have built siege engines?  Hilariously, later in the series the other side talks about how they have the defensive advantage and should just sit tight in that very same castle!  So why would Villar, supposedly renowned for his strategic advisers, not do the same?  None of it makes much sense.I understand what the writers were going for, but it has the feel of work done by people who watched a fictional political drama once and thought they could write one too.  Meanwhile, they conducted zero research and employed no common sense.  It\'s so outlandishly juvenile and insulting to viewers that it ruined all other good parts for me.  I feel like I am a generous reviewer and even I had difficulty watching this.Avoid. nation elected Trump, I suppose it\'s not THAT unrealistic...Sorry, I got a little distracted there.

I thought I will be buckling up for a devastating and dark story line with unbearable rape scenes. But that's not the case.There is gore but definitely there is no rape as others mentioned.The fight scenes are really good, enjoyable and brutal.From crusaders to mercenaries, fighters, witches, werewolves, vampires, you name it!Though, there is an issue with the pacing of the show as it progresses really fast and its hard to keep up with everything that's happening.The story and characters lose...a significant value due to the pacing, but it is compensated with the beautiful art fluid fighting scenes along with a shade of romance.So far, Grancrest Senki was enjoyable and deserves more love. a significant value due to the pacing, but it is compensated with the beautiful art fluid fighting scenes along with a shade of romance.So far, Grancrest Senki was enjoyable and deserves more love."", ""This is not the perfect anime, but it a very enjoyable one. This is a spoiler free review that I hope can help you decide if this anime is what you are looking for or not.THIS IS A GOOD ANIME IF YOU LIKE:Fantasy: Action / Magic: If your focus is JUST action or JUST magic there are better anime out there. But if you like the combination of both this is an interesting one. The action is mostly focused on battles, not on one-on-one fights but there are plenty of battles and even some nice one-on-one that will keep you invested in each character fight...style. The magic aspect is interesting, but it is not a universe in which people with magic are almighty and can do whatever they want to – which was a plus for me. It is a nice balance between characters with different fight styles, some with more magic involved than others but all with nice attributes.Politics / Strategy: There is quite a bit of politics involved, with characters talking about their strategy not only in the battles but also in the overall war. You can follow this strategy talks in all sides of the war, which was quite interesting to me and makes you doubt if there really is “bad guys” and “good guys” because you can understand the point of view of everyone.Romance: The romance is not one of the main plot points, BUT it does play a huge role in the plot – can’t say more without spoilers. I can only say that if you like romance, this is an anime for you, but if you don’t care for romance this is also a good anime for you (unless you hate it). It is a satisfying romance plot for most couples, and specially for the main one.Friendship: One of the things I liked the most was the characters personalities and the friendships between them. This is an anime that you will finish not only loving the main characters but also several of the secondary ones. You will for sure identify with at least one of the side characters and sometimes even wish they would have more screen time.THIS IS NOT A GOOD ANIME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR:Major character development - The characters experience many different situations that show case different sides of them, BUT they mainly keep the same ideas, ideals, and personalities from start to finish. There are some side characters with some interesting moments that you wouldn't expect, but those moments are not plot changing and it is mostly with minor characters.Hardcore harem - Although there is a bit of fan service, many cute girls and it is centered in one guy that could have most of them, the story has a clear couple since the beginning, and you never think that the protagonist may get involved with any other girl.Complex plot - The story is in a different universe than ours so in the first episodes you end up having to learn quite a bit about it, but after a while you will find it very easy to follow and without new elements except some new characters.WHAT WAS REALLY NICE:Timing: The time from something being a problem to it getting solved was very good (usually 1 to 2 episodes), so you could follow the anime without major angst or anxiety. There were always new challenges ahead, but you would not be holding your breath for many episodes without resolution.Characters: I absolutely loved many of the characters. The protagonists were both great – with a partnership and not one being better than the other – and the side characters had all a very well-defined personality.Overall Enjoyment: Overall I really enjoyed watching the anime. Although it has 24 episodes it is quite binge worthy because you can find different subplots to always keep your interest up and it never gets too boring or too anxiety-inducing, so it is the perfect balance.WHAT WAS OK:Music & Art: The music and art were ok. They are not great to the point it is something memorable that everyone will be talking about it after watching the anime, but they are not bad at all.Comedy: There are good elements of comedy that keep the mood light, but you won’t find yourself laughing out loud and almost crying from laughing so much (as you do in other animes)Angst: I do hate anime with too much angst that make you cry the entire time. This one does have 1 moment that led me to tears (those “WHY??” moments), but it was not something that throw me off or made me dislike the series. I understand not everything can go well to the characters you love, so you must deal with a couple of sad bits, so it was ok.WHAT I REALLY HATED:Characters that go missing: There are plenty of characters that are introduced through the episodes – which is a nice thing – but that would be impossible to keep them all during all the episodes. There are some characters that appear and became part of the main group but that after a while just disappear and are never shown again OR that re-appear a couple of episodes latter and you are left wondering where they were during that time. This made me mad because sometimes the characters are in the same land that the protagonists, their skills would be helpful to solve a situation and they just don’t show up at all. I understand this was a strategy to not have too many characters in one episode or to not solve the issues/challenges too quickly, but it is a bit ridiculous.Overall: this is a 8/10 for me, mostly for combining genres that I like and for being a enjoyable anime. style.

It does have a typical ""weak"" guy becomes OP . It has its moments where u forget the characters or their name (cause there r too many characters) and a few other little problems here and there.

Both story and setting were excellently crafted and character development was very well done. This anime poses deep ethical questions on the morality of decisions made for other people instead of oneself.

They find themselves with many allies and many enemies who (mostly) all will play a vital...role in the conclusion. Explaining more would spoil too many vital components of the plot for the viewer to truly enjoy the experience.Art: 6 - Decent at BestBeing a political drama, there is quite a lot of action whether that be on the open field or inside of a stronghold. The action scenes were the least enjoyable parts of the show to me because of several reaons. The primary one being the awkward use of CGI to animate the masses of armies. The soldiers would often look quite slow and ugly compared to the fights of the characters that were not animated with CGI. Outside of action scenes, the animation meets the bar. This anime does not impress with high graphical fidelity.Sound: 7 - Simply GoodThere isn\'t that much to remark about in terms of sound quality or even the music used in the opening/ending. I leave my rating as ""simply good"" because I never felt impressed by it, nor do I recall any bad experiences with the sound. Concerning the voice acting, I only watched the dubbed version and can confidently say that the actors did an excellent job with conveying the attitude and emotion of the characters.Character: 9 - ProfoundThe majority of characters in this show are portrayed to have strict moral guidelines that they will follow. And because it\'s quite difficult to change someone\'s firmly held beliefs, conflict arises. Each major character is given enough screentime for the viewer to understand the motivations and goals that they hope to achieve from the conflict. As the conflict grows and attracts more people, those already involved will be influenced by each other.Enjoyment: 9 - Very satisfyingThis anime captured my attention and never insulted my intelligence with arbitrary plot points (maybe at the end?). I can\'t really say too much about what I enjoyed about the anime without spoiling too much. I\'ll just leave this off by saying that the characters made decisions that made me feel all sorts of emotions watching it.Overall: 8 - Quite GoodThis is will definitely be one of the anime I will remember fondly and will cherish should I decide to rewatch it. It isn\'t outstanding in any way, but is nonetheless a great anime. role in the conclusion.

Any feed back on review writing is appreciated. (Not going to be a long full depth review)Many people have compared the show to Record of Lodoss War, but as someone who has not watched this show here is an outsiders’ opinion. I originally rated Grancest Senki an 8, but after the series finished and I had time to think about the anime I've revised that back down to a 7. Honestly, I feel that this show should have been split into 2...seasons.The show for me starts pretty slow, around mid-season is where I got really invested. I enjoyed the main characters development, the relationship that grew and the pacing the show had. The art style for me is good, it isn't however the best and the main plot of the story is pretty standard. Some of the moral questions of the show and the ways many characters go about protecting/gaining their goals/values I did enjoy.The latter parts of the season is where things fell apart for me. After around ep 18/19 the pacing feels off, things really start the get moving and the whole viewing experience feels rushed. I know publishers only have a certain number of episodes to finish the story, but after the slow beginning and enjoyable paced mid-season this fast-paced ending does kind of annoy me. If this wasn't the case and everything was kept consistent i would of given the show a solid 8/10. However, after finishing it and giving it a bit of thought I'm going to have to give it a 7/10. Is the show enjoyable/entertaining? Yes. Would I recommend the show? Yes. Is the show a masterpiece? No.Thanks for reading. seasons.The show for me starts pretty slow, around mid-season is where I got really invested.

And simply put, these reviews are not fair.The story has a VERY odd start. Which seems to be the cause of many of the poor reviews. Yes the pacing is weird, and characters seem a little, everywhere... sometimes. But I've honestly been super interested in how the story has developed. There is a large cast so far and it has been an odd mix of supernatural (vampires, were-wolves and chaos demons), military, and...political. Some episodes are devoted almost entirely to the interactions of a few political leaders and the maneuvering, betrayals and diplomacy that occurs, while others are focused around the military conquest. And some pretty bad-ass fight scenes!The MC should not truly be considered MC's at this point, as the plot is driven by the much larger political world that Gancrest Senki is set in, and I've personally been really drawn into seeing how this world develops!Another thing that this show does which i'm personally really liking is it is quite creative. Characters really begin to find their pacing and once the backstory for them is set their actions begin to make a lot of sense, even if the overall 'plot' is still being discovered.I really would hate to see this show suffocate and die before it can even begin. Sure it may absolutely flop, that's very much within the realms of possibility. BUT there is also a chance that this could be a really incredible show. Some of the BEST animes EVER MADE have really hard to watch starts that are confusing and slow. Think FMA, Steins Gate, hell even Gintama is hard for a lot of people to get into.TLDR:IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT THIS ANIME, WAIT TILL ITS FULLY RELEASED AND THEN BINGE WATCH IT. political.

Not one of those boring ones that you end up dropping half-way through. There's nice art with unique looking characters. The only negative I would say is that there isn't much character development, and the characters remain the same throughout the whole series. It might feel a little flat, but the story and concept is interesting so it makes you want to watch it until the end. I think the highlights I wrote above pretty much summarises what the series is about. If you enjoy listening or watching different military...tactics in action, then this is a great show. And if you're still doubting if you should watch this show after reading all of this, you might as well try the first episode. If you like the first episode, you will most likely watch until the end.

While these politics in fact might work in a game, they don’t translate well for story, yet these politics become an overly bearing factor on everything – the plot, the characters, the setting and drag everything down. Frankly, the politics don’t make sense.A prime example shows up in the first episode and is the reason for all the conflict. What is known as the Great Hall Tragedy involves a political move of uniting two households and the...heads of the household’s attempt working together in hopes of taking down a chaos creature which appears at the wedding of their two children who are very much in love with each other. In turn they die together. For some reason their deaths provided reason for the conflict to still continue rather than providing the resolution for continuing the ending of conflict. Time after time people do the most illogical thing. Even hunger for power doesn’t explain blatant stupidity on the part of every character.As for the characters, they’re all driven by the politics. What and who they are doesn’t go much beyond this. All of their motivations for their lives comes down to political motivations. There are no likes or dislikes beyond this, yet even the romances involve some form of political motivations. None of the characters have any real flaws either. The only other trait beyond the politics are the special powers and abilities these characters have, yet these special characters and abilities don’t a character make. Instead, what they create is an archetype or a cliché which doesn’t add much narrative value.Of course, the series is rather pretty to look at, yet the art style is only one part of what makes a series good. One might say without the other elements one might have simply a pretty face, yet outside of this the almost perfect art does have some flaws. The female characters have better designs than the males, with the female characters ending up eye candy. The scenery and everything else come across as bland, yet the one major achievement for the art style is the fight scenes, yet these feel wasted due to the lack of interest in the given characters beyond being a pretty face. heads of the household’s attempt working together in hopes of taking down a chaos creature which appears at the wedding of their two children who are very much in love with each other.

On the offset this kinda premise brings in TONS of political as well as wartime strategies throughout the anime which is something LA likes ALOT, added in the the supernatural elements of the Lords trying to obtain magical crests for territory, werewolve-kin, witches, mages and ""demons"" and LA is in it for the long haul, whats more Grancrest Senki doesn\'t shy away from the violence and sex and oooh boy does Grancrest Senki get controversial.Before that, LA will touch upon our main protagonists of Theo and Siluca. Theo is in actuality a VERY decent main protagonist, sure he has the odd behaviour of wanting to shield his friend sand comrades from harm but to his defence, it kinda makes sense due to him wanting to erase the ""Chaos"" in the world and not wanting even the innocent in the crossfires of the battles he partakes and as a result his actions ALSO needs to reflect it, but even then he\'s not a complete pacifist as when push comes to shove and he gives his opponents no choice he WILL KILL to carry on his dreams. Theo is also one those rare main male protagonist that actually moves his relationship with Siluca forward and he acknowledges his love for her quite early on, so Theo is a good driving force for the plot, kinda expected for this kind of anime. Siluca much like Theo though at first seeming tsundere is actually a VERY valuable to Theo both romantically but also in strategy. Siluca is also Theo\'s through-line in him gaining many more allies in his uphill battle to his dreams and Siluca in tandem helps Theo throughout the anime, to say that both Theo and Siluca are a HUGE power couple in this anime it\'s an understatement. With that Siluca was easily LA favourite character in the anime with how much of an impact she did with the anime\'s plot as well as Theo as a character.So what about the rest of the cast, well with a HUGE cast of characters and factions we\'ll be talking about them all day, but LA will summarize the major-focused cast and some of the notes LA put towards some of the characters. So the main reason was mainly due to the Great Hall Tragedy that broke off the Union\'s Prince Alexis voiced by Yuuichi Iguchi and the Alliance\'s Princess Marrine voiced by Ai Kayano thus in turn made the Union and Alliance go to war. In a backstory between Alexis and Marrine, well it\'s a typical Romeo and Juliet story for them but with the outcome in Grancrest Senki anyways being them not dying but them waging war, with Juliet\'s Marrine waging war through military might with Alexis\' Lords\' in-fighting also having to deal with the Union at the same time. Now LA will say that LA ""gets"" Marrine\'s reasoning as to wanting to wage war and how it reflected towards the Great Hall tragedy...however HOW she executed it especially with the most controversial episode 9 dealing with Milza Kouches voiced by Wataru Hatano however did not and will follow this anime to it\'s ending what Marrine did for power. Alexis is your typical hierarchical shy pacifistic prince but he comes to his own, especially if it concerns Marrine. David Lassic voiced by Satoshi Hino was the bro of Lords and an absolute badass and the aforementioned Milza was also a badass, but after Episode 9, he became an absolute scumbag fueled by greed, pride and power in which LA wanted him dead. Theo and Siluca\'s allies does come into play like Irvin voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura and the Werewolf twins Emma and Luna but thanks to Priscilla Farnese voiced by Natsumi Takamori, she can ""predict"" their deaths thus causing them to have a death flag on the three of them...BUT not much comes from it, spoilers so LA will leave it at that.On speaking of ""death flags"", the one offset to this anime comes in form of ""plot armour"" to Theo\'s group and well...they have it in spades to say the least, sure Theo\'s army pretty much become a red shirt army and heavy loss does come form the more minor characters that have affiliation to Theo LA haven\'t mentioned yet but after that, plot armour kicks in towards the rest of Theo\'s allies...""almost"". LA doesn\'t know, it was something LA noticed and LA thought at least there would be some deaths on Theo\'s side and what deaths that does happen...mostly were unpredictable nonetheless.Without a doubt, Grancrest Senki\'s world building is interweaved with it\'s characters\' actions and wartime battles taken place and much latter on the world building does makes sense to the Great Hall Tragedy that even links to the entire Lords and Mages contract, effectively giving Theo trying to break that all down for his dreams as a result, nonetheless Grancrest Senki is greatly done which LA loves.The animation done by A-1 Pictures, well LA will say for the first half to 3/4 of the anime was almost pristinely done, with shine of the background and the characters to even the battles, however latter on all the pristine animation almost turns derpy and some BLATANT, with off model faces to almost shortcutting battle scenes at times, LA gets it though, it\'s A-1 Pictures pushing it\'s limits again thus the derps arises, so LA won\'t completely fault A-1 Pictures, it just meant at the end of the anime, they became inconsistent, what great animation there were LA will at least praise and man the animation were amazing at times. A-1 Pictures also used 3D CGI at times, again easily more blatant in latter episodes. A-1 Pictures went ALL out for this anime, but found out latter on it expended all it\'s resources and thus derps arose. Nonetheless A-1 Pictures did great, not amazing but at least great when it could.The voice cast, well due to the huge cast, LA will keep this to an easy minimum, sooooo... Kentarou Kumagai as Theo was great, Satoshi Hino as Lassic was amazing, Reina Ueda as Aishela was unexpected but expected, Ai Kayano as Marrine was also amazing, Natsumi Takamori got to do devoted ""Christian""-like cadence with a hint of crazy as Priscilla and LA easy MVP of this anime goes to Akari Kito as Siluca because MAN was she perfect as the calmed headed waifu Siluca.LA will say this now, Grancrest Senki does fall into a bit of an idiot plot thanks to Marrine and that doesn\'t even begin with Episode 9 and it does go into spoilers LA more or less get both sides of this but on one hand, Marrine\'s fierce beliefs she doing it for the greater good but on the other hand the entire dealing with the Great Hall Tragedy is what spurred in her beliefs BUT what caused it was another faction altogether and dealing with them could have cut the plot in HALF. It\'s hard especially since LA gets both sides....but LA will actually side with Marrine with this one in a more controverisal take, as if not for Marrine\'s almost inane logic we wouldn\'t of gotten what we did, ohh sure Marrine threw tons of the dead for her reasonings but overall it kinda made for a good watch as a result of her idiot plot. Her reasonings with Episode 9 however...LA WISHED Marrine didn\'t do it...anything for power eh Marrine...-sigh-Grancrest Senki is in LA\'s eyes anyways, the Game of Thrones of anime and has the ending that ended how it wanted unlike Game of Thrones (YES, LA will still rag on Game of Thrones\' Season 8 ending, it was utterly horribly pathetic), sure LA will point out that it did feel a tad rushed for an ending but it\'s again one of those rare animes that actually ""ended"". Sure LA will say there a few problems with Grancrest Senki such as the thick plot armour of Theo\'s party, the inconsistent animation and it being controversial in certain aspects but that didn\'t deter LA from getting hooked into this anime BECAUSE OF IT, not to mention Grancrest Senki kinda had what LA wanted, wartime strategies, supernatural elements, massive world building in a political-supernatural-religious angle and a main couple that supports one another even in times of sacrifice and their relationship grows all throughout the anime. Grancrest Senki ticked ALOT of boxes for LA and then some. BUT LA will acknowledge that that alone doesn\'t make a high fantasy an absolute masterpiece, at the end of the day LA felt it was still a great high fantasy anime, close to a masterpiece but a great high fantasy anime nonetheless and LA went through a rollercoaster of bloody battles and backstage political dealings to get to the ending LA got from Grancrest Senki. tied to our main protagonists of Theo and Siluca.

Honestly, after I heard about the presence of Netorare in this show, I removed it from my watch list. However, just recently I\'m having a rough time looking for a good action/romance anime. Let\'s say, that\'s just my crave at that time. Grancrest Senki came under my radar with 7.3 (decent enough) MAL score. The reason is that I saw a few forum replies that ""Grancrest Senki does not have NTR, and the Internet is only talking...out of their ass"". So, I gave it a try.Grancrest Senki is a story of an emotional ride for fantasy/romance watchers. The show has partial similarities with the Game of Thrones but the characters seemed more based on some popular JRPG-like games such as Final Fantasy series. Although the story might be too fast and confusing, it still manages to deliver engaging content.3 Things that make it engaging in comparison with some shows of the same set of the genre:1. The Strategic Content- As I said, the show has similarities with GoT. The war strategy is not only limited within the battlefield. With the incorporation of magic and various types of fictional fighters, the author has been able to write sophisticated, fiction-based strategies that keep the psychological war very enticing.2.  Romance is not bland- Most of the action animes have very bland, lack of development romantic stuff which I think is understandable but too scanty. However, Grancrest Senki has a good amount of indulging romantic scenes that are crucial to the characters\' development.3. Characters, their kin, and their troops have remarkable distinctions.- In a battle of armies, it is essential to, at least, maximize the number of distinctive characters participating in the battlefield to make it more like a real battlefield. Some war shows have army battles with only two to three named characters per side. Grancrest Senki showed more characters, with more distinct fighting skills.The most negative aspect of the show is the fast-paced story sequence which you may find confusing. Apparently, it is also the main reason why it has a quite low public score. For me, it does not bother me much and actually, I think it is just fine. Sometimes, a narration of a huge world setting bores me and slow-paced shows are more painful to watch. Grancrest Senki does not annoy me with this part. Also, the said Netorare scene has vexed me, however, it is still a very significant scene for the story development which I think would be paid off at the later part of the show. The scene is not as bad as I expected. out of their ass"". So, I gave it a try.Grancrest Senki is a story of an emotional ride for fantasy/romance watchers.

With the incorporation of magic and various types of fictional fighters, the author has been able to write sophisticated, fiction-based strategies that keep the psychological war very enticing.2.  Romance is not bland- Most of the action animes have very bland, lack of development romantic stuff which I think is understandable but too scanty. However, Grancrest Senki has a good amount of indulging romantic scenes that are crucial to the characters\' development.3. Characters, their kin, and their troops have remarkable distinctions.- In a battle of armies, it is essential to, at least, maximize the number of distinctive characters participating in the battlefield to make it more like a real battlefield. Some war shows have army battles with only two to three named characters per side. Grancrest Senki showed more characters, with more distinct fighting skills.The most negative aspect of the show is the fast-paced story sequence which you may find confusing. Apparently, it is also the main reason why it has a quite low public score. For me, it does not bother me much and actually, I think it is just fine. Sometimes, a narration of a huge world setting bores me and slow-paced shows are more painful to watch. Grancrest Senki does not annoy me with this part. Also, the said Netorare scene has vexed me, however, it is still a very significant scene for the story development which I think would be paid off at the later part of the show. The scene is not as bad as I expected.', 'I was very much vary of how this anime might proceed further, but I must say all the character development and the way story progressed was amazing.The story definitely has its own unique settings and storyline.The art style is amazing, with great use of fluid animation.The Characters were appropriately influenced by their emotions and took the right course and met the appropriate fate.The portrayal of a range of emotions within each character how these emotions shape them and with great fight scenes will want you craving more. The climax was more than satisfying all in all, the anime always keeps you on the edge,...and you might never expect few twists and turns. It has brilliant animation and story progression.Definitely recommended ! and you might never expect few twists and turns.

Something like that. Then here\'s we are MC start the journey as noone become hero thanks to his destiny meet the life companion. First 7 episodes is RUSHED as hell, no introduction just jump into conclusion, conflict just barely introduce something....I was hella confuse about what happened here and there [Spoiler start here] I already warm you i will spoiler some story episode 7 ahead so if u dont want get spoil please skip this and go to Spoiler end here tag like i mention before. Lets begin the root i hate from story, Character, yea character itself is hella fascinating but in same time very weak impact to story, they are basically do this do that without thinking about consequences they get after that. Here we begin the most hate character whole series, Called Marie, she is formidable char, brave and take whatever chance to win anything. Here the thing, in episode 9, everything collapse my first belief, She takes the most radical choice to ask support of ""Plot armor character"" from some random small country out of nowhere to support him. She even give virginity toward him (Sorry im snowflake, cant handle NTR, and i gonna say this she already engage toward Alexis at first episode, its still remain as it is, thats why i call it NTR, SO NTR WARNING GUYS). You can different options like, spill blood toward paper, cut her hair (woman hair symbol of noble and status, if she cut it, thats mean she become same level as commoner) to show determination, instead she choose sleep with him, i mean why, u still love Alexis right?, And funny thing, she still lose at the end. Ok enough about Most hate character, Lets talk about MC, Yea MC i mean why everything plan he went is so smooth nothing gonna wrong, everything according to plan, it doesnt make sense, i feel like enemy way too stupid or too traditional about strategy, every strategy here was made during bronze age, or ancient age, meanwhile MC use tactics medieval era, which totally different. I mean why!

I put 10-1 because character, -2 because NTR thing, -1 because mc is way too perfect, so Final score 6/10.

The narrative is all over the place to begin with, but the biggest issue, BY FAR, is how Grancrest Senki breaks its own neck with the speed at which it progresses through said plot; they seemingly skip across 2 or 3 season worth of possible content in just 24 episodes.

The continent is divided, primarily because of crests which gives magical power (not a lot, the magic is very minimal).  The Alliance is led by Merinne, the Union by her ex-fiancee Alexis.  In the middle is the Earl of Altar, a charismatic man who wants to achieve unity, but not through the ruthless methods of Merine.  He surrounds himself with loyal people, including our main characters, Theo and Siluca.4. Which Leads Me to Characters: while every character embraces a thematic archetype there are a lot of dynamic characters. What I love the most is that the show is not so serious that it is bleak, and the hero is not perfect,but more importantly, it avoids the annoying goofiness that has been a cop out for good writing for what seems like the last decade.

And arguably most importantly, EVERY CHARACTER IS GENUINE.  Every person has a reason for what they do, and they believe it is the best choice.  The Alliance believes that peace can only be achieved through ruthlessly cutting down anyone who opposes them.  Miraz believes that the weak deserve to die and those without ambition are worthless (he kinda reminds me of vlad the impaler meets social darwinism).

It’s way too many things going on at the same time, and important parts lacks explanation along the way. Which is why I half way in the show stopped and saved up most episodes left. Watched like that it wasn´t as bad as it first had appeared.Does Grancrest Senki (Record of Grancrest War) has its notable issues? Absolutely. The pacing is, if not off, very uneven. Character exploration and development is forsaken for hasty strategy and battles (think Game of Thrones S7), and the number of difficult names of characters thrown back and forth...is sometimes staggering.Yes, it’s very generic, and the narrative isn´t what I prefer in storytelling. But it did however, have its moments and showed some great potential, hence the relatively high score. I have no experience with the source material (Grancrest is an LN adaptation by Miyuu (Art), Mizuno, Ryou (Story), which was released in 10 volumes between 2013 and 2018). So, if this is a good adaptation or not, I can`t tell. So, this review is based on the anime alone.A pretty common (and agreeing) opinion seems to be that the narrative is horrible. And it is certainly something else. A certain scene could go on for a whole episode, for the next throwing like three different battles against gods know who, because there where so many characters, with all sorts of fancy names. Just to get a hang on who´s with the Alliance, and who´s with the Union (and what they even represent), or where the hell all of this is supposed to happen - is quite hard to follow. So just a few episodes here and there was just confusing, this needs to be bench watched or maybe not at all. They do mention their connections in conversations quite often, its just so many, and pitch the name with a face failed quite often (at least for me).It’s not just the pacing that’s is a bit off, the content could also feel misplaced. I would´ve liked some more focus on the personal sides of the characters and the world building, and maybe less on strategy meetings and rushed battles. Because I had a lot of questions that never got satisfying answers. Like, what is chaos and how does they use it for magic? A very fundamental rock in the world building, which was just touched briefly. You just kind of had to accept the powers the characters had was there to be there. Some things are explained later, just don´t expect it to be in great detail. Many important plot points also have to be guessed or assumed, which may put watchers off.The amount of characters also, besides being confusingly many, robs time from character developments. Because there are some interesting characters that just should´ve have gotten more time. And here we get to one of the main problems the show seems to have – Theo as the main character. I get why many have a problem with him as the clear “star” of the show. He´s got very little personality and background in the beginning (read none), and everyone around him just instantly admired him. It was annoying. All he did was looking pretty and say a few generic words, and people would follow him to war in a second. He gets a little better throughout the show, he gets some personality and does his fair share of dirty work. But he is the generic hero in the flesh all the way through. So, much time that went to making him even more heroic could´ve gone to much more interesting characters such as Aishela, Irvin, the count of Villar, Siluca or Marrine. Like how did Irvin end up a very loyal personal bodyguard to Siluca? How did he become such a great killer? How ended Siluca up being adopted? How did Marrine get know what she knew? No elaboration.Because here Grancrest is a bit two pieced, the characters are both its strong hold and its weakness. The negative would be the amount of characters and maybe Theo as the main character, and the positive would be some of the other characters, mostly those mentioned before. They had so much potential to be really great but was unfortunately thrown to the side.Grancrest is an A-1 Pictures production and if you are familiar with the studio, you probably know what to expect, it’s their standard. So-so CGI, the art looks good in close ups, little sloppy in larger format, dramatic and colourful costumes, curvy ladies and muscly men. What really surprised me while watching this though, are that they seem to have had a damn good fight director. I´m not talking about the big battles (those could be pretty boring), but the more close and personal fights. Great knife battles with some nice martial arts, sword and magic fights – the guy definitely got some skills. Aishela´s rampages with her spear, Irvin´s knife duels, and Siluca´s confrontations with the black witch, was the highlights of this show, truly. Even Theo have some good moments later on.Grancrest is falling within my favourite genres and does some of it pretty decent. I love fantasy´s especially with some good action, drama and romance in the mix. The fantasy was definitely there, but I miss the world building. Chaos, demons, crests, the Empire, the Mage Academy - how does it work and how are they connected? Interesting concepts that never fully got explored, just a bit rushed towards the end.But besides all my whining, I mostly enjoyed the show. It´s generic alright, but it does walk a little bloodier path than your normal shounen. Mirza is much like old warlords most have been, all from the pride to the blood thirst. Marrine is a good example to answer the question; “How many people are you prepared to let die for the one you love?”. Those two lets much blood flow. It had some slices and dices of romance, which in my book is a good thing.Conclusion: Grancrest wasn´t a bad show, its just horrible to watch on weekly basis. As I mentioned before, this is a show best benched watched, or maybe not watched at all. I´m glad that I saved up the second part of the show and benched it. I can see how Grancrest won´t be for everyone (shows seldom are), but if you just can live with the flaws and like the genres, it has some really good moments. I got the feeling “This is why I watch anime” at least a few times. And I recommend you to watch “The Legend of Legendary Heroes” if you already haven´t watched it. Generic title aside, that show does what Grancrest does but mostly better. is sometimes staggering.Yes, it’s very generic, and the narrative isn´t what I prefer in storytelling. But it did however, have its moments and showed some great potential, hence the relatively high score. I have no experience with the source material (Grancrest is an LN adaptation by Miyuu (Art), Mizuno, Ryou (Story), which was released in 10 volumes between 2013 and 2018). So, if this is a good adaptation or not, I can`t tell. So, this review is based on the anime alone.A pretty common (and agreeing) opinion seems to be that the narrative is horrible. And it is certainly something else. A certain scene could go on for a whole episode, for the next throwing like three different battles against gods know who, because there where so many characters, with all sorts of fancy names. Just to get a hang on who´s with the Alliance, and who´s with the Union (and what they even represent), or where the hell all of this is supposed to happen - is quite hard to follow. So just a few episodes here and there was just confusing, this needs to be bench watched or maybe not at all. They do mention their connections in conversations quite often, its just so many, and pitch the name with a face failed quite often (at least for me).It’s not just the pacing that’s is a bit off, the content could also feel misplaced. I would´ve liked some more focus on the personal sides of the characters and the world building, and maybe less on strategy meetings and rushed battles. Because I had a lot of questions that never got satisfying answers. Like, what is chaos and how does they use it for magic? A very fundamental rock in the world building, which was just touched briefly. You just kind of had to accept the powers the characters had was there to be there. Some things are explained later, just don´t expect it to be in great detail. Many important plot points also have to be guessed or assumed, which may put watchers off.The amount of characters also, besides being confusingly many, robs time from character developments. Because there are some interesting characters that just should´ve have gotten more time. And here we get to one of the main problems the show seems to have – Theo as the main character. I get why many have a problem with him as the clear “star” of the show. He´s got very little personality and background in the beginning (read none), and everyone around him just instantly admired him. It was annoying. All he did was looking pretty and say a few generic words, and people would follow him to war in a second. He gets a little better throughout the show, he gets some personality and does his fair share of dirty work. But he is the generic hero in the flesh all the way through. So, much time that went to making him even more heroic could´ve gone to much more interesting characters such as Aishela, Irvin, the count of Villar, Siluca or Marrine. Like how did Irvin end up a very loyal personal bodyguard to Siluca? How did he become such a great killer? How ended Siluca up being adopted? How did Marrine get know what she knew? No elaboration.Because here Grancrest is a bit two pieced, the characters are both its strong hold and its weakness. The negative would be the amount of characters and maybe Theo as the main character, and the positive would be some of the other characters, mostly those mentioned before. They had so much potential to be really great but was unfortunately thrown to the side.Grancrest is an A-1 Pictures production and if you are familiar with the studio, you probably know what to expect, it’s their standard. So-so CGI, the art looks good in close ups, little sloppy in larger format, dramatic and colourful costumes, curvy ladies and muscly men. What really surprised me while watching this though, are that they seem to have had a damn good fight director. I´m not talking about the big battles (those could be pretty boring), but the more close and personal fights. Great knife battles with some nice martial arts, sword and magic fights – the guy definitely got some skills. Aishela´s rampages with her spear, Irvin´s knife duels, and Siluca´s confrontations with the black witch, was the highlights of this show, truly. Even Theo have some good moments later on.Grancrest is falling within my favourite genres and does some of it pretty decent.

While this type of story may not be awful, this anime fails to write a compelling narrative or ""adventure"" for the protagonist.I am going to start with the world of Grancrest Senki. There are two factions Alliance and Union, both in which are lead by people who inherited their positions from their parents. This show tries to get the audience to care about these individuals, however I cannot sympathize with them at all due to their actions and respect given to them despite them not earning it or be deserving...of it. In a world where strength determines rank, it seems the highest ""ranked people"" cannot defend themselves and require their subordinates to aid them at every turn. How did these people get so highly ranked I wonder? Does inheritance also give you power/ ""crest""?This leads into my next point, questions. This narrative has little backstory and tremendous vagueness, some of the questions you may ask include:What are lord laws? How do crests work? How many races exist in this world (i.e. supernatural)? Why does the Alliance and Union fight (i.e. motives? was one of the leaders a tyrant perhaps)? How is one guy with a dagger so feared (he doesn\'t even use his ""crest"")? Is Villar actually a womanizer (he picks hot women and makes them wear skimpy uniforms)? Doesn\'t that seem  like his words don\'t match his actions?Although I believe there to be quite a few negatives, if you like good action over plot and a rated E romance (I don\'t count episode 9) you can find it here.

This show is super generic. But that isn\'t always a bad thing. Yes it\'s bland in a way. But if you like a straight up fantasy show, then this is it. That\'s exactly what I was looking for going in, and mostly, I wasn\'t let down. Gonna break this up by each of the categories used by MAL when rating these things.Story: probably it\'s weakest feature tbh. It\'s not very original. It\'s kinda bland. It\'s got some really uneven pacing. Feels stretched in some spots and feels dragged in others. The overall plot is fairly easy to...understand. Young guy wants to save his home land but get swept up in something bigger than just that. Been there done that. Pretty basic. But ya know what, despite that, it\'s got some charm to it. It\'s kinda meh on story but it\'s easy going nature makes it an easy show in and of itself. 6.Art: nothing too special. There were some definite highlights in there, episode 17 kicked so much ass!! But mostly it was serviceable at best. Again, kinda meh for the most part. Not much to say on it really. 7.Sound: probably it\'s best feature. Speaking on the openings and endings, they were all really good. Not best of season good, but pretty good none the less. The OST is amazing though. Like they use some awesome orchestral music and one track in particular stood out to me and something special. The sound design too was great. The effects in all the battle scenes were always on point. Voice acting too, whomever played Theo sounded great. 9.Characters: again, common theme too, kinda meh. Some better than others or course but a pretty mixed bag. With the story being so lackluster the characters suffer from that a lot. Theo himself was a good lead, basic and cookie cutter as he was, he still made me respect his beliefs and his determination. Siluca was a good foil for him. She took the lead for most of the first half if the show. While Theo was still learning how to geopolitics. The rest of the cast was alright I suppose. They did their job well enough. The major ""villain"" for a lot of the show was really cool though, as I said before, episode 17 was amazing and the whole arc with Milza vs Theo from about episodes 12-27 was incredible to see. At least the parts of them interacting. 7.Enjoyment: ya know, despite all the lackluster things with this show. I can\'t say I didn\'t have a good time honestly. All these people ragging on it even though they watched it all, supposedly, make no sense to me cause it\'s a long show and you\'re just wasting time at that point and that\'s on you. But anyways, I had a genuine amount of fun with this show. I always wanted more. It always did at least enough to keep me coming back. 8.Overall: despite its basic as hell plot and it\'s mostly dull characters and it\'s wonky, uneven writing. I still enjoyed this show a lot. It\'s a by the books fantasy through and through. Doesn\'t break the mold in any way whatsoever. But it\'s still a fun time and does enough. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The ending too was very sweet and pretty perfect. 8/10. understand. Young guy wants to save his home land but get swept up in something bigger than just that. Been there done that. Pretty basic.

This is a no-spoiler review.Our hero character, Theo, starts practically from scratch alongside a trusty and prodigious mage babe named Siluca. Their goal is to advance their status from nobodies to lords, and to accomplish this they slowly gather an army and the archetypal specialists that you would expect from fantasy (mage, assassin, etc.)Sounds interesting so far right?Unfortunately there are some serious problems with this show. The pacing is all over the place--often feeling incredibly...rushed, especially in the beginning episodes. The story is also generally incoherent at times, opting to throw fantastical things at you instead of taking the time to explore one item and flush it out. I was often left scratching my head and the use of 'tactics' and 'strategy' in this war anime were laughable, choosing to just declare nonsense as something that worked.For the first few episodes, the hero never loses and one combatant or another comes to him with ease--everything comes incredibly easy to him in fact, offering little opportunity to display anything in the way of actual character growth or intelligence.For those reasons i had to drop it early, as any show that takes too long to actually become entertaining simply isn't worth the time--and to be honest, i have never been so disappointed in a fantasy anime like this before.All the ingredients for a decent show seemed to be there, but what resulted from them was nothing but a slog. There seems to have been some squandered potential here imo, which is a shame really as if they had considerably tightened up the pacing and put more effort into making the events seem more believable rather than the ultimately shallow, nonsensical wish fulfillment it is, it might have been pretty good.If you are really into swords and sorcery like i am, this is probably only worth watching if you have already watched everything else, and so have nothing better to entertain yourself with. rushed, especially in the beginning episodes.

There's nothing you'd be ashamed to show your parents, it's about adults and there's very little fan service.However, the setting is very game-like (to the point it might actually be better as a game) and the characters are pretty two dimensional. It also comes off as a bit pretentious with no comic relief.Its pace means it rarely gets boring but the lack of depth to characters means there's not much to care about.I would only recommend it if you've already watched a lot of anime and just want something that's...not terrible. not terrible."", ""About this anime...It does indeed have a fast pace at the beginning and some things can come as confusing, but how the story and characters develop and how everything is going so far... I really think this anime is great!*SPOILERS*I see a lot of people complaining about episode 9 of the anime where marrine had sex with mirza. I want you all to get something through your heads, this is an anime about war and conquest for territory/power.For the characters wanting to have more of this ANYTHING is possible. The reason WHY they have sex and i see that many of those bad reviews of...episode 9 don't even mention it, is because Marrine (leader of the Aliance faction) bargains with Mirza (who was helping the leader of the Union faction at the time, and this guy is the god of war in this anime) to help her out.Mirza... a man in the end, with HUMAN desires, decides that for him to help marrine and betray the union, he just wanted sex with a beautiful blonde woman. This, my friends, in war... to achieve someone's help and to bargain for something asking for sex is not bad, very much less if it's with the leader of a faction. It's very good actually in my opinion, i was NOT expecting to see something like that in the anime so i was surprised in a good way.Also, unless you guys want a 100 episode anime explaining the background of every character that we have already seen in the anime (there are many, many characters) you shouldn't be complaining about it being fast paced. In the beginning it was weird because we didn't have that much background information about the anime itself or the characters... but then it just became normal and understanding taking into account the story itself.If you want to see a WAR/CONQUEST anime with lots of background information and lots of episode, you can go watch Kingdom... i recommend this as another great war anime.Overall grancrest has a weird start and that is the only reason why i'm not giving it a 10, but besides that... once you get understanding what the anime is about around episode 3 i would say... it's very good and throughout the season, each episode just keeps getting better and better. Episode 9 was a masterpiece, watching the sex scene, knowing marrine didn't really want it, but had to do it to get the upperhand in the war was just top notch. Theo has his ways with words and Siluca saw potential in him.I do believe this anime needs to have a better score and it's underrated. episode 9 don't even mention it, is because Marrine (leader of the Aliance faction) bargains with Mirza (who was helping the leader of the Union faction at the time, and this guy is the god of war in this anime) to help her out.Mirza... a man in the end, with HUMAN desires, decides that for him to help marrine and betray the union, he just wanted sex with a beautiful blonde woman.

Plenty of anime can get away with having a sloppy plot simply by being enjoyable. Grancrest is deeply unenjoyable to watch, things are introduced and then happen minutes apart from each other.

You have been warned.Based off a popular light novel of the same name Record of Grancrest War is an action and fantasy anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a wandering knight and a powerful but determined mage were to unite their powers and gather like minded individuals to fight against both the rampant chaos that is causing endless wars across...the land and the two large power blocks of countries that are taking advantage of the chaos to fight wars against each other.But rather than fight for conquest and wealth as the members of the two power blocks do the knight and his companions fight instead to unite the land and all the crests and create an era where peace will reign for all races whether human, beast man, union or alliance by creating the ultimate crest the grand crest that will unite the land against the common foe of chaos.Taking place on the continent of Atlatan a setting that combines medieval-era weaponry and tactics with the magic and creatures that is commonly seen in high fantasy settings is a world that is similar to our own one where humanity and every race that lives on the continent fight constantly with one another in endless wars using the supernatural powers offered by the crests which are both symbols of ranks and a representation of the powers that they wield. The most powerful of these lords form military alliances with one another with the largest being the Fantasia Union and their opposite number the Factory alliance whose struggles with one another have lasted for years. After the tragic events at a wedding that was supposed to have been the beginning of peace between the two factions, both sides withdraw and began to prepare for a resumption of hostilities between them that had been held in check by the wedding.The overall story follows the life of Theo Cornado a wandering knight that aspires to create a world where peace will reign for all countries and his encounter with Siluca Meletes a 17-year-old mage that has similar aspirations as his own and their journey to gather as many crests as they can to create the ultimate crest that will banish chaos from this war-torn world the grand crest. Along the way, they will fight many powerful lords and their attendant mages while at the same time encounter many like minded individuals that share their desire to create a world of peace. But their journey while noble would pit them against the lords of both the union and the factory alliance who refuse to let go of the powers that their crests have bestowed them with and Theo and Siluca must use every inch of their cunning and intelligence to overcome the myriad enemies that try to stop them as they strive to create a world free of war. As they fight across the land to enact their bold plan, Theo, Siluca and their many allies would encounter a host of characters that will both aid them and hinder their quest that includes the calm and bold Marrine leader of the Factory alliance, the kind and motivational priestess Priscilla and the confident and perceptive Duke of Alturk Villar. But in their journey to create a world of peace not even the demons of hell can hope to stop them.Siluca MeletesSilica Meletes voiced by veteran seiyuu Akari Kito of Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 17-year-old mage freshly graduated from the mage academy Siluca is an intelligent, assertive and fiercely independent person by nature that views the current world and the lords that are responsible for it with nothing but scorn and disdain. A perceptive and quick-thinking person by nature Siluca though a mage is also a capable strategist and diplomat capable of both planning intricate battle strategies as well as creative proposals that can charm even the most stubborn lords and get them to help them. While a cunning person by nature Siluca is someone that is both humble and willing to learn and rather than use this cunning to make a name for herself as others would instead uses this to analyse and defeat the plans that their opponents use against them whether these plans are military or diplomatic. Key to Siluca’s ability to defeat the many plans of her opponents is Siluca’s tenacious nature and her dislike of people that take advantage of their powers to lead others astray. As a result of this hatred, Siluca is someone that hates rotten mages as she believes they are not doing their jobs properly an aspect that comes largely from the proudness she feels as a mage that’s loyal to her contractor.At the beginning of the series, Siluca as a result of her independent personality was not someone that many people could get close to and indeed in the beginning due to her pride she was somewhat haughty and prideful. However, while hard to please Siluca was someone that respected results and hard work and had no problem with praising those that she had seen work hard at their assigned tasks. While Siluca’s tactics are based off what her intelligence and analysis have told her it can be seen that like her personality Siluca’s tactics and strategies has a flair for the dramatic and were somewhat risky at the same time. This I felt was interesting as it matched well with her development as a character as while her early tactics were dramatic and risky as the series goes on this changes largely due to the effect that Theo’s beliefs have on her. As the series goes on and as Siluca encounters and befriends many new allies and reconnect with former friends it can be seen that Siluca actually starts to rid herself of her haughty and prideful nature and instead starts treating her allies with respect and starts trusting them with critical parts of her plans but at the same time not risking them by taking care of the most dangerous parts of her plan herself showing the care that she has developed for her friends and allies. A central aspect of Siluca’s character is, of course, her dislike of authority and of lords which creates a problem in that she isn’t afraid to state her own opinion on something which often causes her to tread into dangerous territory. However, as the series goes on though not disappearing entirely Siluca gains the foresight to know when it is time to offer her opinion and when not to but always willing to offer her advice when needed. At the beginning of the series, Siluca and Theo had a rather unusual first encounter and as a result, had a somewhat tense relationship at first.As a result of wanting to prove herself and show her skills to others at the beginning of the series, Silica treated Theo rather poorly. While acknowledging Theo as her contractor and lord the strategies that Siluca came up with in the beginning while highly effective at their intended role did not include Theo in them which had the effect of causing her name to rise but not her lord’s that she was supposed to be serving. As Siluca and Theo’s relationship deepens as the series goes on Siluca realises the error that she had made as she has let her pride overrule her duty to her lord something that she chided herself on. As a result of this as the series goes on Siluca’s relationship with Theo gradually changes with Siluca gradually being more open with him and willing to discuss her strategies and tactics with him showing her increasing trust and later admiration of Theo’s actions and beliefs and becoming his loyal right hand in his quest to unite the crests. The character of Siluca I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of Siluca from a haughty and prideful mage that was overconfident of her intellect and skills as a mage to one that was both humble, trusting and friendly to her allies and loyal and dedicated to not just her lord but to his beliefs as well I thought was really well done. I felt that her seiyuu Akari Kito really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Siluca.Theo CornaroTheo Cornaro played by new voice actor Kentaro Kumagai is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Initially, a wandering knight that Siluca encounters while on her way to her new assignment Theo is a righteous, determined and proud person by nature that’s also understanding and trusting of his allies and friends. Unlike the great majority of knights and lords that use their crests to gain fame and power Theo largely due to his modest nature and his strong sense of justice is the opposite and instead fights to protect the innocents that are caught in the conflicts that plague the land and true to this nature strives to fight his battles far from populated areas. A brave, loyal and friendly person by nature Theo is someone that can be said to be the very ideal image of a knight one that is both caring towards his friends and allies and brave and willing to step in and protect them from the most dangerous threats in this world the demons without any hesitation. As a result of this personality its perhaps unsurprising that Theo views the current chaos that the continent is locked in with disdain and indeed Theo is someone that believes that the crests that the knights and lords make use of should be used to help and protect the people from the chaos that reigns in the land and not be used to fight endless and pointless wars with one another and definitely not for personal gain. In line with this is what can be said to be Theo’s ultimate dream and wish which is to change the current world and create a world where peace will reign for all humans and races whether they belong to the union, factory alliance and unaffiliated races. A world where everyone can exist in harmony with one another without having to fight one another on the field of battle to settle differences of opinion.At the beginning of the series Theo while having a worthy dream and vision was someone that was noted to not have much ambition and seems content with just fighting to protect the land and its people and in the process accumulate more power to power his crest. This attitude while matching his temperament nicely was seen as impractical by his allies and as the series progresses even Theo starts to realise this as well. As the series goes on and Theo begins to see just how much suffering the people of the land suffer due to the chaos and the wars between the various crest holders this awakens within Theo a desire to not just become a lord but also to be one that has gathered all the crests to form the grand crest that will end this suffering and bring peace back to the land. However even after becoming a lord and taking the first step on his journey to achieve his dream Theo rather than let his new station create a sense of ambition within him instead bravely maintains his core values always striving to fight for justice and freedom while preferring to exhaust all avenues of diplomacy first before committing to an action. Unlike most lords on the continent, Theo is shown to be someone that values the opinions of his subordinates and always willing to listen to their own assessments of the situation before deciding on a course of action. As a result of his long life as a knight, Theo is someone that has always believed that a knight’s duty is to protect the people and even after rising to become a lord this belief never changes and stayed with him. As a result of this Theo was someone that was uncomfortable with having his subordinates and allies fight for him while he can only command them and not fight alongside them.However, as the series progresses this sense of unease gradually disappears as Theo comes to realise that the reason that his subordinates and allies fight so hard for him even against tall odds was because of the faith and trust that they have in their lord and his beliefs and as a result rather than feel unease and worried about them Theo instead takes it and uses it as his main strength and motivation. As a character I felt that Theo was one that was both well designed and developed with his development from a wandering knight that had the barest idea of a dream to one that was determined to change the world and create a world where peace will reign for everyone no matter the odds arrayed against him being the best aspects of his character.Marrine KreischeMarrine voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main support characters of the series. The daughter of the former archduke of the Factory alliance and after his death the new leader of the Factory alliance Marrine is a calm, composed and understanding person by nature that’s also perceptive and cautious and is shown to be a person that’s easily capable to telling one’s true character quite easily. An intelligent and logical young woman Marrine is someone that respects those that show courage and determination and is someone that places her trust in allies and friends that have proved their worth to her treating them as valued allies that she can rely on.  While an intelligent and shrewd negotiator, politician and a capable field commander and swordswoman Marrine is not someone that will underestimate enemies and indeed has a healthy amount of respect for all that stand in her way whether they are of the same social rank as she is or not. While a capable field commander Marrine is shown to be someone that largely lets his subordinates make their own decisions on the field preferring instead to observe their actions and only stepping in when needed. This is shown in both her time on the field and her time managing the lords that form part of her alliance. In line with this is Marrine’s belief that the men under her should serve on their own volition and that she shall not force them to serve her blindly due to a perceived loyalty to her family name.As the series progresses and Marrine’s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that while outwardly Marrine is a very strong-willed and determined woman that’s determined to achieve her goal of uniting the continent under her rule beneath this Marrine’s feelings are anything but strong and is in fact relatively fragile. As a result of losing both her beloved father and be split from the person that she had fallen in love with at the beginning of the series Marrine was forced to harden her heart and banish the grief that anyone in her situation would be feeling and concentrate on the larger picture of fighting the true enemy that has caused the tragedy. Despite taking the path of a conqueror and being labelled as a villain by all it can be seen that Marrine is someone that tries to minimise the number of casualties when possible by making use of negotiation which shows that beneath her determination to unite the land her human side still remains to a degree. As the series goes on it can be seen that Marrine while very determined to achieve her dream of uniting the continent still wrestles with the human side of her character and despite seemingly giving up her happiness to focus on trying to achieve her dream which is best summed up in her belief that she is someone that is stained with blood and not someone that is worthy of happiness there are still feelings and emotions that she cannot get rid of within her namely her remnant feelings for her former fiance Alexis. The character of Marrine I thought was one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a young woman that was on the Verge of marrying the prince of her dreams to a determined and driven conqueror who aspires to unite the land to honour her father while cutting off every side of her that made her the person that she once was on a quest to find the truth being one of the best aspects of her character. The concept of becoming a conqueror that aspires to conquer the land to find the truth while shouldering all the blame and resentment of others I felt was an admirable concept that matched the strong-willed Marrine very well. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Marrine in the first villain role of her career.PriscillaPriscilla voiced by veteran seiyuu Natsumi Takamori of Orange and Brave Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Theo and Siluca’s many allies in their quest to unite the crests. A priestess of the order of the crest a religious order that accesses, awards and distributes the crests to the lords and knights of the continent Priscilla is also the daughter of the founder of that order making her a relatively famous person within it.  True to her role as both a priestess and a healer Priscilla is a kind, caring and understanding person by nature that cares deeply about everyone that she meets and would not hesitate to put herself in danger if it means it will help people that are injured or need renewed faith. While a quiet person by nature Priscilla is an intelligent and perceptive person by nature and can easily tell when something is bothering someone and as a result like Siluca she serves as one of Theo’s most trusted advisers where her role as a priestess and her skills at diplomacy can be put to good use.As a result of both her beliefs and what she has seen across the land as a member of the order, it can be seen that Priscilla is someone that hates dictators and those that commit acts of cruelty using the crests that her order has awarded.  As a result of this upon hearing about Theo’s dream, Priscilla was among the first to make their way to him to determine whether Theo is the light that this world so dearly needs. In line with Priscilla’s training as a priestess, Priscilla was noted to be someone that was very motivational that was helped greatly in the faith that she has both with Theo and with the central teachings of the order of crests and was capable of swinging the opinion of large crowds of people quite easily. The most prominent trait of Priscilla’s is without a doubt the special crest that she wields which has the miraculous power of putting Priscilla within a trance that allows her to heal even the fatal of injuries a power that I felt was really appropriate for a priestess healer like Priscilla. The character of Priscilla while largely a support character I felt fulfilled a very important role for Theo and his faction as she served not just as the factions most effective healer but also one that was able to offer Theo many useful pieces of advice that he needed as he fought ever harder battles against increasingly powerful enemies in his quest to end the chaos. Priscilla’s title of holy maiden that referred to both her role as a priestess and her special crest I felt was one that was really appropriate for her and a title that she really deserved.VillarVillar Constance played by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungo Stray Dogs and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and an important ally of both Theo and Siluca. The Duke of Alturk a country that’s part of the union and one of its most influential members Villar is an intelligent, confident and perceptive man that is well versed in both diplomacy and military arts and as a result is highly regarded by all those that know him. While a confident person by nature Villar unlike most lords at his station is not someone that is overconfident and indeed Villar is someone that is humble and kind and treats everyone that he meets with respect and humility no matter their station. A calm and patient person by nature Villar is also considerate and possesses considerable foresight that allows him to project both calmness in meetings and anticipate the types of issues that may come up at a meeting to a certain degree. While a proud person Villar is shown to be someone that values the lives of his subordinates and would always try to preserve their lives and stop them from taking part in reckless actions which are best shown in the battles that he took part in prior to the fall of castle unicorn. As a result of this Villar is someone that has earned the respect and loyalty of countless lords that live nearby a feat that proved useful during the defence of Alturk from the factory alliance. Unlike other lords of the continent who tend to view those of lower social rank than they are with disdain Villar is unique in that he is someone that prefers to judge someone by their merits and deeds rather than say their family name an aspect that I felt suited his personality greatly. A core personality trait that is unique to Villar is the importance that he places on family largely due to his past experience with his own.As a result of this trait, Villar is someone that values family highly and dislikes having to fight members of his own family on the battlefield. A key aspect of Villar’s personality that resonates with this is his cardinal rule about the female mages that are contracted to him in that once they reach the age of 25 they must retire and leave his service. This unusual rule through a logical one has earned Villar many nefarious nicknames but the core reason for this rule is because Villar wants to give these women the opportunity to marry and create a family of their own. The character of Villar Constance I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his character as a powerful but fair duke that commanded the respect and loyalty of his people and his fellow lords through his determined attempts to preserve their lives being the best aspects of his character as he was the opposite of what many of the lords that fight in this war were like. In a way, Villar can be said to be the ideal image of what a lord should be for even against overwhelming odds Villar still faced them bravely not compromising on any of his core values fighting to the very end to save others and ensure their happiness. I felt that his voice actor Takahiro Sakurai really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Villar Constance.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the various locations and settings that the cast visit over the course of the series was not just beautiful and well designed but also showed a great variety of terrain types that matched well with the theme of a large continent-wide war that served as the series main premise. The character designs for each of the main cast I felt were also well done and each character I felt matched well with both their personality and intended role within the series with their clothing, in particular, being a great complement to their designs. The use of magic within the series which serves as one of the series key premises in the form of the crest I felt was well done not just in the execution of large-scale magic but also in the form of the crests and the effect they have on the casters subordinates as well. The idea that each crest acted not just as an identifier for the soldiers but also gave them a semblance of their lord’s power I felt was a nice touch. In terms of large-scale battles whether its land-based or naval I felt that the battles that were featured within the series were both well animated and designed and made great use of both the fantasy setting as well as that of tactics and terrain. Each battle while large and often consisting of multiple fronts was well animated and allowed us to see clearly which side was winning in brutal detail thanks to distinctive combat gear that was used by all sides. Music wise I felt that the series OST was really well done and did a great job at highlighting the various scenes and emotions and feelings that the cast experience as they fight in this war to end all wars. The series opening and ending themes of which there were four in total which was Starry by veteran singer Mashiro Ayano, Pledge by Asca, and Rin and Shodo by Asca and Ayano respectively I felt was pretty strong songs that complemented the series really well.In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Akari Kito, Kentaro Kumagai, Ai Kayano, Natsumi Takamori and Takahiro Sakurai all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Siluca, Theo, Marrine, Priscilla, and Villar.Overall conclusionIn overall Record of Grancrest War I felt was an excellent anime and alongside Beatless, Darling in the Franxx and Katana Maidens is one of the heavy hitters of Winter 2018 with its main strong points being its strong premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, great blend of politics, wishes and war, a strong voice cast and its many large and well-designed battles.The overall premise of the series was, of course, the continental-wide war within the series that pitted large military alliances against each other in a large war in which both sides sought to gain power by defeating their enemies and gaining the superhuman powers that the crests a concept unique to the series contains. While battles of this type are a common theme in most action anime the fact that this took place within a large fantasy world that had both magic and industry within it I felt was interesting as this kind of promise is relatively rare among anime’s and more common in movies. While the war large as it is involved countless lords, all fighting to gain power in order to rule more land and thus gain more prestige the real premise came in the surprising form of a minor knight that had large aspirations that were surprising for someone of his standing and station an aspiration to create a world where peace would reign. In a world filled with power hungry lords who fight continuously to gain power the idea that a mere knight would not just possess one of the mythical crests but also have a unique wish and desire to use that crest to fight and create a better world for the people I thought was rather special. While weak as an individual Theo while facing intense opposition for his plan never feels fear and never wavers in his beliefs and wishes to create a better world and as he fights and triumphs over every battle sent his way Theo not just matures and changes from a knight to a lord but also gain many allies and friends who share his view of wanting to create a new world free of chaos. Even when faced with the large military alliances of the alliance and the union Theo does not feel fear and managed to not only outfight his opponents and also outsmart them and convince them through sword and words to work with him and finally end this time of chaos. This premise of having a minor knight rise to power and promote a plan of peace to all factions with not just military action but also diplomacy I felt was interesting and made great use of the fact that all humans and races whether they are knights, lords or simple soldiers all wish for a day where they can drop their weapons and armour and live their life without having to kill another fellow human being.The overall story of the series in addition to the premise I felt was also one of the series main strong points. While largely following Theos advances and development as both a character and a lord the story also gave us the opportunity to see how the two alliances of the series the Union and the Factory alliance fought the war and the problems that they had to deal with as the tides of war changed as the war went on. This aspect of switching between not just Theo and his allies but between Marrine’s Factory alliance and Alexis’s Union alliance I thought was well done as it showed that this war is taking place on multiple fronts and that Theo and his forces are though an important part of the war still only one part of a larger war that’s sweeping the continent. Key to this is the usage of several key characters that are used by all factions to keep each other in check as each faction fights to conquer important territory in their quest for victory with the most notable of this being the character of Mirza who while originally a prince of a nearby country and Villar’s ally soon becomes one of Theo’s greatest threats thanks to his ambition. When paired with the politics that existed between the lords and the alliances and the large-scale battles that formed the key parts of the story Grancrests story proved to be really impressive as it was anything but predictable and was full of unexpected developments, betrayals, and revelations that played out more like a movie than an anime.Overall Record of Grancrest War was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its strong and unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, strong blend of politics and war, strong voice cast and large and well designed and executed battles. I felt that the series handled its many different themes relatively well with the handling of its core theme of defeating and forcing each faction to the negotiation table to end the war and unite them against the real threat being the best one. Seeing Theo, the minor knight not only gain ranks as he overcomes the countless trials that he was faced with but also gain many powerful and loyal friends and allies that share as his goals as he tries to change the world was one of the best things about this anime and proves that if you have a strong will and powerful and like-minded friends that anything is possible even the impossible task of changing the world. As a final score, I would say that Record of Grancrest War easily deserves a final score of 10/10. In order to free his homeland and bring peace to it, Theo instead ended up changing the world. the land and the two large power blocks of countries that are taking advantage of the chaos to fight wars against each other.But rather than fight for conquest and wealth as the members of the two power blocks do the knight and his companions fight instead to unite the land and all the crests and create an era where peace will reign for all races whether human, beast man, union or alliance by creating the ultimate crest the grand crest that will unite the land against the common foe of chaos.Taking place on the continent of Atlatan a setting that combines medieval-era weaponry and tactics with the magic and creatures that is commonly seen in high fantasy settings is a world that is similar to our own one where humanity and every race that lives on the continent fight constantly with one another in endless wars using the supernatural powers offered by the crests which are both symbols of ranks and a representation of the powers that they wield. The most powerful of these lords form military alliances with one another with the largest being the Fantasia Union and their opposite number the Factory alliance whose struggles with one another have lasted for years. After the tragic events at a wedding that was supposed to have been the beginning of peace between the two factions, both sides withdraw and began to prepare for a resumption of hostilities between them that had been held in check by the wedding.The overall story follows the life of Theo Cornado a wandering knight that aspires to create a world where peace will reign for all countries and his encounter with Siluca Meletes a 17-year-old mage that has similar aspirations as his own and their journey to gather as many crests as they can to create the ultimate crest that will banish chaos from this war-torn world the grand crest. Along the way, they will fight many powerful lords and their attendant mages while at the same time encounter many like minded individuals that share their desire to create a world of peace. But their journey while noble would pit them against the lords of both the union and the factory alliance who refuse to let go of the powers that their crests have bestowed them with and Theo and Siluca must use every inch of their cunning and intelligence to overcome the myriad enemies that try to stop them as they strive to create a world free of war.

However even after becoming a lord and taking the first step on his journey to achieve his dream Theo rather than let his new station create a sense of ambition within him instead bravely maintains his core values always striving to fight for justice and freedom while preferring to exhaust all avenues of diplomacy first before committing to an action. Unlike most lords on the continent, Theo is shown to be someone that values the opinions of his subordinates and always willing to listen to their own assessments of the situation before deciding on a course of action. As a result of his long life as a knight, Theo is someone that has always believed that a knight’s duty is to protect the people and even after rising to become a lord this belief never changes and stayed with him. As a result of this Theo was someone that was uncomfortable with having his subordinates and allies fight for him while he can only command them and not fight alongside them.However, as the series progresses this sense of unease gradually disappears as Theo comes to realise that the reason that his subordinates and allies fight so hard for him even against tall odds was because of the faith and trust that they have in their lord and his beliefs and as a result rather than feel unease and worried about them Theo instead takes it and uses it as his main strength and motivation. As a character I felt that Theo was one that was both well designed and developed with his development from a wandering knight that had the barest idea of a dream to one that was determined to change the world and create a world where peace will reign for everyone no matter the odds arrayed against him being the best aspects of his character.Marrine KreischeMarrine voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main support characters of the series. The daughter of the former archduke of the Factory alliance and after his death the new leader of the Factory alliance Marrine is a calm, composed and understanding person by nature that’s also perceptive and cautious and is shown to be a person that’s easily capable to telling one’s true character quite easily. An intelligent and logical young woman Marrine is someone that respects those that show courage and determination and is someone that places her trust in allies and friends that have proved their worth to her treating them as valued allies that she can rely on.  While an intelligent and shrewd negotiator, politician and a capable field commander and swordswoman Marrine is not someone that will underestimate enemies and indeed has a healthy amount of respect for all that stand in her way whether they are of the same social rank as she is or not. While a capable field commander Marrine is shown to be someone that largely lets his subordinates make their own decisions on the field preferring instead to observe their actions and only stepping in when needed. This is shown in both her time on the field and her time managing the lords that form part of her alliance. In line with this is Marrine’s belief that the men under her should serve on their own volition and that she shall not force them to serve her blindly due to a perceived loyalty to her family name.As the series progresses and Marrine’s personality and character gets expanded upon it can be seen that while outwardly Marrine is a very strong-willed and determined woman that’s determined to achieve her goal of uniting the continent under her rule beneath this Marrine’s feelings are anything but strong and is in fact relatively fragile. As a result of losing both her beloved father and be split from the person that she had fallen in love with at the beginning of the series Marrine was forced to harden her heart and banish the grief that anyone in her situation would be feeling and concentrate on the larger picture of fighting the true enemy that has caused the tragedy. Despite taking the path of a conqueror and being labelled as a villain by all it can be seen that Marrine is someone that tries to minimise the number of casualties when possible by making use of negotiation which shows that beneath her determination to unite the land her human side still remains to a degree. As the series goes on it can be seen that Marrine while very determined to achieve her dream of uniting the continent still wrestles with the human side of her character and despite seemingly giving up her happiness to focus on trying to achieve her dream which is best summed up in her belief that she is someone that is stained with blood and not someone that is worthy of happiness there are still feelings and emotions that she cannot get rid of within her namely her remnant feelings for her former fiance Alexis. The character of Marrine I thought was one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a young woman that was on the Verge of marrying the prince of her dreams to a determined and driven conqueror who aspires to unite the land to honour her father while cutting off every side of her that made her the person that she once was on a quest to find the truth being one of the best aspects of her character. The concept of becoming a conqueror that aspires to conquer the land to find the truth while shouldering all the blame and resentment of others I felt was an admirable concept that matched the strong-willed Marrine very well. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Marrine in the first villain role of her career.PriscillaPriscilla voiced by veteran seiyuu Natsumi Takamori of Orange and Brave Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Theo and Siluca’s many allies in their quest to unite the crests. A priestess of the order of the crest a religious order that accesses, awards and distributes the crests to the lords and knights of the continent Priscilla is also the daughter of the founder of that order making her a relatively famous person within it.  True to her role as both a priestess and a healer Priscilla is a kind, caring and understanding person by nature that cares deeply about everyone that she meets and would not hesitate to put herself in danger if it means it will help people that are injured or need renewed faith. While a quiet person by nature Priscilla is an intelligent and perceptive person by nature and can easily tell when something is bothering someone and as a result like Siluca she serves as one of Theo’s most trusted advisers where her role as a priestess and her skills at diplomacy can be put to good use.As a result of both her beliefs and what she has seen across the land as a member of the order, it can be seen that Priscilla is someone that hates dictators and those that commit acts of cruelty using the crests that her order has awarded.  As a result of this upon hearing about Theo’s dream, Priscilla was among the first to make their way to him to determine whether Theo is the light that this world so dearly needs. In line with Priscilla’s training as a priestess, Priscilla was noted to be someone that was very motivational that was helped greatly in the faith that she has both with Theo and with the central teachings of the order of crests and was capable of swinging the opinion of large crowds of people quite easily. The most prominent trait of Priscilla’s is without a doubt the special crest that she wields which has the miraculous power of putting Priscilla within a trance that allows her to heal even the fatal of injuries a power that I felt was really appropriate for a priestess healer like Priscilla. The character of Priscilla while largely a support character I felt fulfilled a very important role for Theo and his faction as she served not just as the factions most effective healer but also one that was able to offer Theo many useful pieces of advice that he needed as he fought ever harder battles against increasingly powerful enemies in his quest to end the chaos. Priscilla’s title of holy maiden that referred to both her role as a priestess and her special crest I felt was one that was really appropriate for her and a title that she really deserved.VillarVillar Constance played by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungo Stray Dogs and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and an important ally of both Theo and Siluca. The Duke of Alturk a country that’s part of the union and one of its most influential members Villar is an intelligent, confident and perceptive man that is well versed in both diplomacy and military arts and as a result is highly regarded by all those that know him. While a confident person by nature Villar unlike most lords at his station is not someone that is overconfident and indeed Villar is someone that is humble and kind and treats everyone that he meets with respect and humility no matter their station. A calm and patient person by nature Villar is also considerate and possesses considerable foresight that allows him to project both calmness in meetings and anticipate the types of issues that may come up at a meeting to a certain degree. While a proud person Villar is shown to be someone that values the lives of his subordinates and would always try to preserve their lives and stop them from taking part in reckless actions which are best shown in the battles that he took part in prior to the fall of castle unicorn. As a result of this Villar is someone that has earned the respect and loyalty of countless lords that live nearby a feat that proved useful during the defence of Alturk from the factory alliance. Unlike other lords of the continent who tend to view those of lower social rank than they are with disdain Villar is unique in that he is someone that prefers to judge someone by their merits and deeds rather than say their family name an aspect that I felt suited his personality greatly. A core personality trait that is unique to Villar is the importance that he places on family largely due to his past experience with his own.As a result of this trait, Villar is someone that values family highly and dislikes having to fight members of his own family on the battlefield. A key aspect of Villar’s personality that resonates with this is his cardinal rule about the female mages that are contracted to him in that once they reach the age of 25 they must retire and leave his service. This unusual rule through a logical one has earned Villar many nefarious nicknames but the core reason for this rule is because Villar wants to give these women the opportunity to marry and create a family of their own. The character of Villar Constance I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his character as a powerful but fair duke that commanded the respect and loyalty of his people and his fellow lords through his determined attempts to preserve their lives being the best aspects of his character as he was the opposite of what many of the lords that fight in this war were like. In a way, Villar can be said to be the ideal image of what a lord should be for even against overwhelming odds Villar still faced them bravely not compromising on any of his core values fighting to the very end to save others and ensure their happiness. I felt that his voice actor Takahiro Sakurai really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Villar Constance.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the various locations and settings that the cast visit over the course of the series was not just beautiful and well designed but also showed a great variety of terrain types that matched well with the theme of a large continent-wide war that served as the series main premise. The character designs for each of the main cast I felt were also well done and each character I felt matched well with both their personality and intended role within the series with their clothing, in particular, being a great complement to their designs. The use of magic within the series which serves as one of the series key premises in the form of the crest I felt was well done not just in the execution of large-scale magic but also in the form of the crests and the effect they have on the casters subordinates as well. The idea that each crest acted not just as an identifier for the soldiers but also gave them a semblance of their lord’s power I felt was a nice touch. In terms of large-scale battles whether its land-based or naval I felt that the battles that were featured within the series were both well animated and designed and made great use of both the fantasy setting as well as that of tactics and terrain. Each battle while large and often consisting of multiple fronts was well animated and allowed us to see clearly which side was winning in brutal detail thanks to distinctive combat gear that was used by all sides. Music wise I felt that the series OST was really well done and did a great job at highlighting the various scenes and emotions and feelings that the cast experience as they fight in this war to end all wars. The series opening and ending themes of which there were four in total which was Starry by veteran singer Mashiro Ayano, Pledge by Asca, and Rin and Shodo by Asca and Ayano respectively I felt was pretty strong songs that complemented the series really well.In terms of voice acting, I felt that each member of the voice cast was able to do an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Akari Kito, Kentaro Kumagai, Ai Kayano, Natsumi Takamori and Takahiro Sakurai all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Siluca, Theo, Marrine, Priscilla, and Villar.Overall conclusionIn overall Record of Grancrest War I felt was an excellent anime and alongside Beatless, Darling in the Franxx and Katana Maidens is one of the heavy hitters of Winter 2018 with its main strong points being its strong premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, great blend of politics, wishes and war, a strong voice cast and its many large and well-designed battles.The overall premise of the series was, of course, the continental-wide war within the series that pitted large military alliances against each other in a large war in which both sides sought to gain power by defeating their enemies and gaining the superhuman powers that the crests a concept unique to the series contains. While battles of this type are a common theme in most action anime the fact that this took place within a large fantasy world that had both magic and industry within it I felt was interesting as this kind of promise is relatively rare among anime’s and more common in movies. While the war large as it is involved countless lords, all fighting to gain power in order to rule more land and thus gain more prestige the real premise came in the surprising form of a minor knight that had large aspirations that were surprising for someone of his standing and station an aspiration to create a world where peace would reign. In a world filled with power hungry lords who fight continuously to gain power the idea that a mere knight would not just possess one of the mythical crests but also have a unique wish and desire to use that crest to fight and create a better world for the people I thought was rather special. While weak as an individual Theo while facing intense opposition for his plan never feels fear and never wavers in his beliefs and wishes to create a better world and as he fights and triumphs over every battle sent his way Theo not just matures and changes from a knight to a lord but also gain many allies and friends who share his view of wanting to create a new world free of chaos. Even when faced with the large military alliances of the alliance and the union Theo does not feel fear and managed to not only outfight his opponents and also outsmart them and convince them through sword and words to work with him and finally end this time of chaos. This premise of having a minor knight rise to power and promote a plan of peace to all factions with not just military action but also diplomacy I felt was interesting and made great use of the fact that all humans and races whether they are knights, lords or simple soldiers all wish for a day where they can drop their weapons and armour and live their life without having to kill another fellow human being.The overall story of the series in addition to the premise I felt was also one of the series main strong points. While largely following Theos advances and development as both a character and a lord the story also gave us the opportunity to see how the two alliances of the series the Union and the Factory alliance fought the war and the problems that they had to deal with as the tides of war changed as the war went on. This aspect of switching between not just Theo and his allies but between Marrine’s Factory alliance and Alexis’s Union alliance I thought was well done as it showed that this war is taking place on multiple fronts and that Theo and his forces are though an important part of the war still only one part of a larger war that’s sweeping the continent. Key to this is the usage of several key characters that are used by all factions to keep each other in check as each faction fights to conquer important territory in their quest for victory with the most notable of this being the character of Mirza who while originally a prince of a nearby country and Villar’s ally soon becomes one of Theo’s greatest threats thanks to his ambition. When paired with the politics that existed between the lords and the alliances and the large-scale battles that formed the key parts of the story Grancrests story proved to be really impressive as it was anything but predictable and was full of unexpected developments, betrayals, and revelations that played out more like a movie than an anime.Overall Record of Grancrest War was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its strong and unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, strong blend of politics and war, strong voice cast and large and well designed and executed battles. I felt that the series handled its many different themes relatively well with the handling of its core theme of defeating and forcing each faction to the negotiation table to end the war and unite them against the real threat being the best one. Seeing Theo, the minor knight not only gain ranks as he overcomes the countless trials that he was faced with but also gain many powerful and loyal friends and allies that share as his goals as he tries to change the world was one of the best things about this anime and proves that if you have a strong will and powerful and like-minded friends that anything is possible even the impossible task of changing the world. As a final score, I would say that Record of Grancrest War easily deserves a final score of 10/10. In order to free his homeland and bring peace to it, Theo instead ended up changing the world.', ""This is my first time ever writing a review and the main reason along with many other reviewers is due to the amount of hate this show is getting. Most of the people leaving bad reviews either didn't watch the whole show or are simply overly critical pieces of crap. Many of them think an anime has to abide by a specific list of criteria and thus rate it accordingly. Many people seem that they can't just enjoy an anime for what it is.This show is incredible! It takes about 10 episodes for it to really get good but it's worth it. Now I'll...be honest the score isn't anything special and the animation and fight scenes aren't anything spectacular. It just wasn't that popular of a manga really and so didn't get as much funding. Other people talk about how the pacing is awful. News flash...it was clearly done on purpose. It gives the show a sense of urgency and makes it that much more exciting. There's also just so much going on politically, tactically, etc that the show jumps around making sure the viewer can understand the hectic Ness of this world.Please! Please! Give this show a chance and enjoy it for what it is. It's such a shame these days that truly great anime don't get the hype they deserve where as incredibly average shows like AOT get unwavering priase even though it has way worse pacing and character development than this show.Thanks! be honest the score isn't anything special and the animation and fight scenes aren't anything spectacular.

Here we go! BEWARE of slight SPOILERS! because after you read this you might cringe a bit and be discourage to continue and watch. But don\'t worry this anime is gewd and i recommend it for matures only R18 + or so. Because there\'s no way a 17 yr old down could understand all of this you need an open mind in order for you to comprehend.STORY: Awwwwweeee! Love conquers all! Even if its NTR! Not just like any NTR though! its like THE FEELING THAT YOUR BEING...CUCKOLD! yeah i just spoiled you! So you should be prepared! Because honestly I somehow find it a lil bit cringy at the same time satisfying at the end I dunno why, but i just feel that way. Eventhough that person deserves the worst possible ending/outcome, i somehow manage to ""sympathize"" or understand the goals and the sacrifices that must be made in order to protect someone even if it takes you to dirty your own hands and keep those burdens/sins for yourself.So its about Theo the main male character of this story who just escaped his country vowing to return and liberate his people someday. As he was wandering around he stumbles upon a beautiful young female mage named Siluca (honestly speaking she reminds me of Sistine Fibel from Akashic Records only HOTTER!) she was on her way to meet a duke and he somehow manages to rescue her from the oppressors. As she witnessed this ManBoy in a sweaty and sexy action (to sound more dramatic and sexy) she acknowledges his potential to be a lord and they began a contract that he would become a lord and she will become his Mage forever. Sounds sweet. And so their Adventure begins as they continue to fight their own battle not knowing the dangers and the dark truth unravelling that has been hidden for eons. Okay for those who watched it already some may say that the story is kinda rushed, but for me its okay. Coz i already get the picture, whats the need to prolong such a scene if you already know or understand the rest of it? Might as well skip to the main topic Right? So yeah there it is. The plot of this anime composed of mideival scenes and fantasy where you\'ll find Vikings, Spartans, The English, Arabians, and also with Vampires, werewolves, demons, and witches. I know it sounds confusing, but believe me the names in this is far more confusing it may take a few episodes to understand on who\'s who.

Instead, what I got was a major disappointment, which I can sum up entirely in Episode 3\'s ""battle"".Outnumbered and outgunned, our heroes attempt to fight against a vastly superior army. They are up against trained soldiers, all of whom boast (presumably) steel armor. However, they are ""luckily"" joined by a handful of villagers with close to no military training, and...have a small army of their own. (The other lords join them too, but they had no way of knowing that.)This is a perfect chance for our heroes to show off their brilliant strategy of...Charging directly into a better armed numerically superior force. Great.Ignoring ""MAGIC!!!"", critical mistakes I noted were:1. During the initial charge, the hero\'s army lacks both shields and lower torso armor, and yet fail to even try to guard their incredibly exposed bodies2. In a single scene, Theo\'s sword isn\'t able to cut the shield, but CAN cut through steel.3. Humans ran as fast as horses.4.

I\'m here to tell you about one of the primary themes throughout the story and how it is so poorly handled as to be intellectually offensive.Two of the supporting characters are originally supposed to be married but a calamity occurs, creating a schism between the two dominant factions of the continent and also two star-crossed lovers.The male, Alexis wants desperately to be with his fiancee, however she has decided that the only way to rid the world of chaos is to unite the titular Grancrest by...using military might to subjugate the rest of the lords and forcibly take their crests from them.The result is a ridiculous dichotomy in which Marinne, the fiancee is waging war and slaughtering the army / citizens / leaders of all the neighbouring states, all the while being portrayed as a victim of circumstance who ""deserves to be with the one she loves"", according to the protagonist and just about everyone else (but her).The pacing of the show is another huge issue, it takes about 18 episodes to get to a point in the story which are then undone in the following 2 episodes.It\'s difficult to imagine why the writers of the show thought they could get away with setting up a dictator character who commits war crimes, kills her own family members for their crests, and causes the deaths of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people as someone who we should root for as a love interest.its absurd on a level I can barely comprehend.Otherwise this is a generic anime thats fairly forgettable and really luls at certain points in the story, but its mediocre status is further lowered by the ludicrous love story.Please reconsider whether you want to watch this, you could find much better things to watch. using military might to subjugate the rest of the lords and forcibly take their crests from them.The result is a ridiculous dichotomy in which Marinne, the fiancee is waging war and slaughtering the army / citizens / leaders of all the neighbouring states, all the while being portrayed as a victim of circumstance who ""deserves to be with the one she loves"", according to the protagonist and just about everyone else (but her).The pacing of the show is another huge issue, it takes about 18 episodes to get to a point in the story which are then undone in the following 2 episodes.It\'s difficult to imagine why the writers of the show thought they could get away with setting up a dictator character who commits war crimes, kills her own family members for their crests, and causes the deaths of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people as someone who we should root for as a love interest.its absurd on a level I can barely comprehend.Otherwise this is a generic anime thats fairly forgettable and really luls at certain points in the story, but its mediocre status is further lowered by the ludicrous love story.Please reconsider whether you want to watch this, you could find much better things to watch.', ""I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'm going to keep this short and to the point.Grancrest senki, a light novel adaptation done by A-1.

Thanks for reading if you did!', ""Honestly, everyone in this community hates on things for way too many reasons. I'm going to be honest on my opinion of shows and give them scores I believe them to deserve. Lets start with this one.At first, I couldn't really get into the story since the first three episodes were kinda bland and unrelated, and then with acceleration in the middle of the season I got confused, however I still do enjoy the art and the characters, which truly are actually quite intriguing.I like the different types of themes in each warrior and how they differ as characters in the show. Despite...Theo getting a lot of hate for some reason or another, I honestly don't see the problem.Don't know if its my taste or what, be seems like he has an honorable cause he wants to fight for, he likes his main girl who he and her have been through the show so far with, hes a talented but inexperienced fighter which generally is a good plot start as it progresses to show their shortcomings and adversity. I like his spirit and sure he is a little annoying because of his attitude and rather bland interactions, but I think he fits right into the story and where it should be following this young knight trying to weave light into the world, and his romance with Siluca is fast but I think it shows his conviction, and loyalty, as well as he enjoys her company and he appreciates her guidance, what more could there be in love?Now lets talk about episode 9. Yes it was really strange scene and I think it definitely could have been portrait better, and with some more decency. However, I think that so far this show has been rather blunt, the blood and gore, foul mouthing, and sexuality in the story concludes that this show is for mature audiences despite its kawaii appeal with the teen love and cute characters, and I also think that this shows the darkness in the prince Milza, It definitely could have avoided the rapey feel tho. It was really weird and uncomfortable, not to mention confusing, but other than this horrible scene in the show, it is quite good and I will review it as so.

This was one most anticipated animes this season because I love a story that goes deep into politics, philosophy, and morals. Stories about characters who either fighting for what they believe in and/or their country but also might be struggling with themselves while also struggling to figure what is truly right and what is truly wrong.This anime had all the potential to be just that, but from the very beginning it has struggled to maintain a proper flow. What\'s worse, there was honestly no reason for it to be like that. As of now, this anime...has made me more appreciative of A-1 product that everyone else hated. And I\'m probably going to piss some people when I bring up that one anime so I ask you to please bear with me when I do bring it up.SIMPLE TO UNDERSTANDThe premise of this anime is simple enough to understand, especially if you\'re long time fan of fantasy novels. Medieval/Renaissance fantasy setting, complete with magic, creatures, castles, and battles. Those who hold a title do not posses their through a magic sword, but instead a magic crest, hence the title. Naturally, wars are fought over these crests in addition to everything else that goes along with it.The series take on politics well done for the most part. Some people have called Grancrest the ""Game of Thrones"" anime and it pretty much is except without all the sex and nudity, for the most. For me though, this anime reminds me more of Tad Williams Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy which I read back in high school. You have characters here who are caught up in a war that\'s being fought for the wrong reasons yet they have no choice but to see it through.All of this has the making for a good fantasy epic... except there\'s ONE major problem. THE PACING.DIFFICULT TO FOLLOWThe pacing of this anime is all over the place, and it is what\'s killing this show right now. And what\'s worse, there\'s no fucking reason for it! Right from the start the show just rushes to get the next battle or the next political talk or whatever without ever slowing down! If this was twelve episode one cour anime then yeah, I could understand why they would do that because they would have so much to tell yet little time to do it. But since this is a twenty-four episode series, they have plenty of time to tell the story properly! But they\'re not!Iin the end you\'re left asking yourself: Why? Why are they rushing so much when they don\'t need to?!Now I know some of you are going to be saying, ""It\'s A-1 Pictures, DirectorK. What do you expect? They always botch things up and that\'s why they suck."" I\'d be inclined to agree to you, but... I have two reasons not to.One, A-1 Pictures is not the only anime studio out there who have made mistakes like this. Every studio out there, young and old, anime and Hollywood, have had their own fair share of hits and misses. So in the end, it would be cheap of me to blame it all the studio just because everyone else hates it for whatever reason.Second, as much I agree with the people who bitched about The Asterisk War, another one of A-1\'s light novel adaptations, if there\'s one thing the studio did right with that show it was the pacing. Now don\'t get get me wrong, TAW does have a shit ton of problems, but at least the studio handled the story\'s pacing surprisingly well. A-1 actually went out of their way to tell the story properly despite the generic tropes and cliches. In other words, TAW was easy to care about if your really tried and ignore all of its problems, unlike this show which leads me to my next point.DIFFICULT TO CARE ABOUTIn a story that is as big, deep, and powerful as this one, you need to have characters that you can care about and follow from start to finish. Unfortunately though, because of the botched pacing it\'s damn near impossible to care about any of the main characters. Why? Because they\'re never given the time to develop properly because the anime is more focused on other things getting through them as fast as it can. And any characters you do manage to care about either disappear after a time, possibly never to appear again, or they die.The side characters aren\'t any better. They only serve the purpose of moving the story along in rushed manner, making you wonder why they even put them there in the first place. Then you have the characters you really couldn\'t give two shits about or just outright hate when they start making stupid decisions. And since I\'m on that subject, I might as well bring up what between Marrine and Mirza at the end of episode nine. If you\'ve been following this series you know what I\'m talking about.BEGIN RANTNow I understand why people were disturbed and outright hated that scene, but you need to remember what time period this story is set in because this kind of thing happened quite a lot. Hell, what do you think Game of Thrones is all about? That kind of thing happens almost every season! If you\'re a GOT fan you should be used to this sort of thing by now.In Marrine\'s case, I understand why she did what did. After seeing what Mirza could do in battle she would rather have him as an ally than an enemy. As a leader of a nation, it is her responsibility to care both her people and her soldiers. And that requires making difficult decisions. However, with all that being said, what Marrine did there was just plain... STUPID.Now again, I understand why she did it, but I find really hard to believe that a woman of her stature would lower herself to that level. If would have made more sense if she had been forced into that situation or if Mirza had approached her instead of the other way around. What\'s worse, is that she doesn\'t even take the time to think it over! She just immediately goes along with Mirza\'s proposal as though she\'s done this sort of thing before! Like seriously, come on!I honestly have to give Mirza credit for not only going through with it, but also keeping a straight face when she agreed right away without hesitation. If it were me, I probably would have burst out laughing and said, ""No, sorry. You\'re not worth it. Thanks for the offer though!"" and left. I say that because it was very clear that Mirza was only testing her and that he wasn\'t being serious. I honestly don\'t what he was trying to gain out of that, other than the obvious, but seeing how he\'s suppose to represent the Arab culture of this world... well, I think we all know just how badly women can be treated in that part of the world.I was actually aware of this scene before that episode aired and I was hoping they would change it but even that was too much to ask. it wasn\'t act itself that disgusted me it was the fact that it made Marrine look so pathetically weak! Both as leader and as character! All she had to do was to say no and to stand her ground because Mirza probably would have joined her anyway. Then again, maybe that was the entire purpose of that scene. It was designed to show just how much of a coward Marrine truly is and that she\'d been waging a pointless was from the start.END RANTSo, getting that little rant out of the way, I\'m going to bring up The Asterisk War again in comparison to the characters of this show. Despite the characters being the typical tropes, as you would expect out of a harem anime, TAW managed to make the characters likable in a way that you could get behind and follow them because they were given proper character development.To put it simply, when you have one anime that is generic while the other isn\'t yet has better pacing and character development than the other, you know something\'s wrong. And it\'s a damn shame because I really want to like these characters but so far this anime hasn\'t given me a reason to.WHERE TO GO FROM HEREThe pacing needs to slow down and the characters need to be developed more. Grancrest Senki has gotten off to a really rough start and that needs to change through the second half if it wants make any significant impact. However, I am worried that since they rushed through so much the studio may not have enough material to get through another twelve episodes and that may forced to put in some pointless filler. The show still has potential, but it\'s going to be really interesting to see how A-1 handles it from here.I\'m DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned! has made me more appreciative of A-1 product that everyone else hated.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Let me preface this by saying that I enjoyed the first Record of Lodoss War series, which was based on novels written by the same author. Yes, it took quite a few liberties with his work (the later TV series, I\'m told, is a bit more faithful, if an inferior production in my opinion), but I contend that this series is the standard to which any fantasy anime should be held up to. The characters are rich and dynamic, the plot well-developed, all the scenes were edited with...care, and you could just tell the production team were great storytellers. So to say I had high hopes for this series would be an understatement.A-1 Pictures is a solid animation house, and I\'ve enjoyed several series produced by them. Visually, the scenes are well-animated, the character designs are good, I don\'t recall any glaring errors or flaws. The soundtrack... honestly, I don\'t remember it. It\'s probably one of those soundtracks that stays in the background and supports the visuals. The voice acting is decent, and I don\'t remember hearing much in the way of typical Japanese overacting.The opening and ending... I\'d say they\'re adequate. They felt like they belonged more in a 90s Gundam show than a fantasy anime. The opening feels like it\'s trying to force the rest of the production to ""begin the story"", which is fine for the first episode, but for 11 episodes? That got old, fast.Episode 9... Let me say that I still feel nauseous. If you\'re writing a suspense film, sure, that sort of thing is fine in the middle of the plot, but in the middle a 2-cour anime, at the end of an episode, no less, it just leaves a bad taste in one\'s mouth. Generally when you write this sort of scene, you do it near the end of a series-- think the laboratory scene in Eureka Seven, the revelation of child abuse in Fractale. The reason for this is, the show is then compelled to emotionally make it up to the audience-- say, the perpetrator is killed, or the victim is brought out of despair. The ""payback"", if you will, is slated for the end of the series. Sorry, I\'m not willing to wait that long.But you know what? I\'ll get over this. I got over Gundam SEED Destiny, I got over School Days, I got over Eureka Seven AO, all shows I anticipated and all that let me down violently. In my opinion this production belongs in the dustbin with those other failures.With that out of the way, on to the real weaknesses of the show. The first major weakness is the planning of the series. Ten light novel volumes is a LOT of content to cover in 24 episodes, and just to give you a comparison, Hyouka animated just over 4 volumes in 22 episodes. This reeks of a demand on the part of the studios or publisher to tell the entire story in half a year rather than 3 cours or 4. This forces the story to be either nonstop action (like the theatrical cut of The Two Towers), or a parade of non sequiturs that have to be explained in a summary episode. This isn\'t refreshing or new, it\'s sloppy storytelling.The characterization suffers also from the condensed schedule. For example, in the manga, you see a (too long, but setting that aside) flashback of Aishela and Siluca with their adoptive father. That doesn\'t exist in the anime, and had it existed, it really would\'ve brought home the pain and fear Siluca experienced at that moment in the series. In the anime, unfortunately, Aishela and Siluca are old and close friends because we said so, get used to it, on to the next battle! You\'re not given any time to get to know the characters because it\'s not important enough to the series creators.The second major weakness of the show is the lack of theme. For those of you who haven\'t survived high school English, the theme of a story is a message that the author is trying to say in a million words or so. Now, the setting is outstanding-- the novel author knows how to create a fantasy world, and it shows here just as well as in Lodoss War. But it seems to me like he\'s much more of a DND DM than a seasoned novelist-- it seems to me like the theme just doesn\'t matter, at least in the first half of the series. That does two things: First, it leaves the plot in a quagmire (giggity), unable or unwilling to provide the audience any emotional or rational direction. Second, it reduces the show to a shallow series of beautifully animated scenes that ultimately do not matter. I feel that anyone who writes this way insults the intelligence of his audience, and frankly, whoever edited and wrote the scenario, while thinking that animating a creepy coerced sex scene all the way up to penetration is important should be ashamed of themselves.I\'m also not a huge fan of removing the main characters from the focus of the story for more than one episode, because it makes it seem as though they don\'t exist during that time. The battles in episode 10 could\'ve been condensed and a reaction scene given to Theo even for just 20 seconds. He is the main character, right? Instead there\'s a brief mention of his exploits in dialogue only. Seriously?I\'ve long held that it\'s a bad idea in the anime industry to release a summary episode (the only thing that\'s worse is halting production and delaying broadcast). If you cannot tell the story in the main episodes sufficiently well that you need a summary episode to do the storytelling for you by a narrator, that is a red flag to me, and whether the episode is planned or not is irrelevant. The reason for this is, they could have slowed the pace down and took more time with telling the story, one episode\'s worth, instead of rushing for 11 episodes and give an ""instant replay"" the 12th week. As they say in film, ""Don\'t tell the story, show it!"" Again, the condensation of the light novel content proves a serious weakness. What, are they going to release a second summary episode after the finale, for those who couldn\'t keep up with the second half?Apologies for the long review/rant, and if you\'ve read this far, thank you for sticking through it.To wrap up:- Good visuals and concept; the author of Lodoss War certainly knows how to craft a fantasy world.- The 2-cour schedule for the entire series of novels forces the production staff to cut too much content; character developing scenes and background scenes are largely dropped in favor of action and combat, and inadequate storytelling in the main episodes compel the use of a summary episode. The adaptation would have been better served with a full year\'s worth of episodes, though honestly I don\'t know if I still would\'ve watched it.- The introduction of sex scenes is abrupt and borderline manipulative (to me, at least), and along with gratuitous violence and death makes the series appear like a cheaper rushed copy of Game of Thrones.In a word, disappointing. I should\'ve stayed away. care, and you could just tell the production team were great storytellers. So to say I had high hopes for this series would be an understatement.A-1 Pictures is a solid animation house, and I\'ve enjoyed several series produced by them. Visually, the scenes are well-animated, the character designs are good, I don\'t recall any glaring errors or flaws. The soundtrack... honestly, I don\'t remember it. It\'s probably one of those soundtracks that stays in the background and supports the visuals. The voice acting is decent, and I don\'t remember hearing much in the way of typical Japanese overacting.The opening and ending... I\'d say they\'re adequate. They felt like they belonged more in a 90s Gundam show than a fantasy anime. The opening feels like it\'s trying to force the rest of the production to ""begin the story"", which is fine for the first episode, but for 11 episodes? That got old, fast.Episode 9... Let me say that I still feel nauseous. If you\'re writing a suspense film, sure, that sort of thing is fine in the middle of the plot, but in the middle a 2-cour anime, at the end of an episode, no less, it just leaves a bad taste in one\'s mouth. Generally when you write this sort of scene, you do it near the end of a series-- think the laboratory scene in Eureka Seven, the revelation of child abuse in Fractale. The reason for this is, the show is then compelled to emotionally make it up to the audience-- say, the perpetrator is killed, or the victim is brought out of despair. The ""payback"", if you will, is slated for the end of the series. Sorry, I\'m not willing to wait that long.But you know what? I\'ll get over this. I got over Gundam SEED Destiny, I got over School Days, I got over Eureka Seven AO, all shows I anticipated and all that let me down violently. In my opinion this production belongs in the dustbin with those other failures.With that out of the way, on to the real weaknesses of the show. The first major weakness is the planning of the series. Ten light novel volumes is a LOT of content to cover in 24 episodes, and just to give you a comparison, Hyouka animated just over 4 volumes in 22 episodes. This reeks of a demand on the part of the studios or publisher to tell the entire story in half a year rather than 3 cours or 4. This forces the story to be either nonstop action (like the theatrical cut of The Two Towers), or a parade of non sequiturs that have to be explained in a summary episode. This isn\'t refreshing or new, it\'s sloppy storytelling.The characterization suffers also from the condensed schedule. For example, in the manga, you see a (too long, but setting that aside) flashback of Aishela and Siluca with their adoptive father. That doesn\'t exist in the anime, and had it existed, it really would\'ve brought home the pain and fear Siluca experienced at that moment in the series. In the anime, unfortunately, Aishela and Siluca are old and close friends because we said so, get used to it, on to the next battle! You\'re not given any time to get to know the characters because it\'s not important enough to the series creators.The second major weakness of the show is the lack of theme.

By having a lot of talk about ""military strategies"" and relatively little action, the anime is easy to ""drop""; but for those who do not mind understanding a bit about the universe of the characters, these endless conversations are no big deal.The protagonist Theo does not look anything like the stereotype of male protagonism. Theo is determined, acerbic, knows what he wants and does not mind losing one thing to win another. His idealism might well lead the character to the stereotype of the good revolutionary, but it is a good thing that it does not.The female protagonist Siluca is adorable,...has personality and is driven by well-established goals. The fact that she saw Theo as a means of securing her purpose, without at the same time disrespecting it, is the kind of rare move in the anime.The highlight for the other characters is the Princess Marrine; Because of it I will always remember that Grancrest Senki as the anime of the princess who has committed prostitution to try to win a war. has personality and is driven by well-established goals.

There is politics, war, love, betrayal, magic, and lots of action. I enjoyed the action scenes.   The beginning had very little world building, which made the introduction of most things rather clunky. I gave it a pass because the animation and music was good as well as the concepts promised that something epic could come of it.However, the clunky introduction of things just kept going. There is literally one guy who randomly appears in a frame and they are like, ""ah yes, you joined me...after I defeated you in a battle that occurred off screen with no mention.""  Then they just casually mention that he died, also off screen.  It is very reminiscent of a series that tried to just throw everything from the light novel together with the assumption that everyone watching already read the novel.

By episode 1 there was already romance, and I would have preferred something like the MC blushing, in fact the meeting between the heroine and the MC wasn\'t impactful at all; it was more like a casual walk in the park and the next episode you find out there\'s this sudden romance. Not only that, but antagonists and monsters that took an entire army to beat were defeated in an extremely short time nonetheless by a group of 3-4 people. I wasn\'t aware that the characters possessed the...strength of a hundred men. Moreover, because of this pacing, the anime was lacking character development other main characters and secondary character save for Siluca and Theo. As a result deaths( to be expected since it\'s a war anime) didn\'t matter much. The content in this anime could have easily been stretched out into another season or maybe two more with a bit more plot to go with it.

This is one of the greatest yet comparatively less popular show from A1 Studios. This is the probably one of the few anime series which blows away my sleep. Almost full night, I was thinking of this show. Even after completing the whole season in 2 days, I continue to think about this show which is uncommon for me.An ancient style military setup with a tinge of magic makes this anime ideal for me. I enjoyed this show very much. The only thing I didn't like is the excessive fast pace. I loves fast moving stories and am...great fan of ancient style military setup, so I can safely say A1 studios cut some corners in war scenes and in climax. They could have easily extended the series to 36 episodes without any feeling of stretching the story. The war scenes could have been stretched a bit, displaying the military strategy deployed and something like that.This excessive fast pace and a bit unsatisfyingly hastened climax made this series a great anime but not one of the masterpieces in this sub-genre.A word for those who haven't seen this anime: Do watch it. You will not feel bored at any point. There is one point in story which will turn you upside down. Atleast for me, it was. I didn't expect at all that would ever happen. great fan of ancient style military setup, so I can safely say A1 studios cut some corners in war scenes and in climax.

I respect the show as its well made, but I personally prefer a more engaging tale with the main character. By episode 10, it felt like the main character got under 5 mins of screen time. The anime shifts to being more political and large scale than being centered on the MC fighting battles and falling in love. I apologize as I stopped watching the show once I realized I wasn’t enjoying it as much, so for all I know it turned around for the better, but to draw comparisons, the anime felt like...fate/stay night tried to follow the story of every competitor. The battles weren’t quite as strategically invigorating as a show like Drifters, but the characters are likable and it’s fun to follow along if you can get past the fact that you won’t be able to tell who the main character is by episode 10. fate/stay night tried to follow the story of every competitor.

That\'s right an MC that doesn\'t really do much or do anything at all for that matter. Four episodes in you really get to see a guy riding on the coattails of other people doing all the work but somehow gets all the recognition for it. Sure he has admirable intentions but that\'s just all that he does. He lacks the ability or skill to go beyond that, even his so-called ambition was fuelled by someone else although he...does bring some value to the table as the series progresses it really doesn\'t justify the ""royal treatment"" he receives.With that, I\'ll now elaborate a little more on why I\'ve given Grancrest Senki a score of 5.For starters, the narrative is rather simple yet it somehow manages to still be rather unclear on the overall objective of its storytelling. Although the story is pretty linear there were interesting elements within the series to keep it entertaining, the existence of crests, the nobility system as well as the incorporation of magic-like beings. With crests are the most important aspect of the show because everything revolves around it. However, there were one too many instances of what I would classify as ""convenient coincidences"" such that it removes most of the intensity or value of the entire narrative.For the art style and music preference, I would consider them as the better elements for Grancrest Senki, although they were not game-changers they helped to make the series somewhat bearable to a certain extent. However, what really killed it for me was the lack of interesting characters. Don\'t get me wrong, Grancrest Senki is an anime that introduces at least 20 characters yet only a handful of these characters remain memorable. There were probably many aspects that weren\'t properly adapted into the anime because of how incoherent the motivations of certain characters are. It just felt a little too rushed in my opinion.Needless to say, I didn\'t really enjoy Grancrest Senki but there were moments where it was actually pretty good, the introduction and conclusion were severely lacking and the best bits were somewhere in between the entire series and unsurprisingly there weren\'t related to the main characters because of how bland they were.Another point to note, there is some depth to be derived from the series as a whole from the motivation of certain lords to the eventual conclusion of Grancrest Senki there were many interesting areas that could be discussed in further detail but unfortunately, still insufficient to carry the narrative.The pacing of the show was pretty weird, there were moments that felt a little too rushed, either from a very weird transition from one place to another. Because of its fast-paced nature, the audience will find it very challenging to appreciate the characters and because there is such an extensive list it becomes an even greater challenge to appreciate what is actually happening. In terms of highlighting the seriousness of war, it has done a really good job. But the flow of the series in general feels rather mismatched and somewhat out of place.The voice acting is passable, there were no real standouts perhaps that is because most of the characters casted by the VAs were not well-written characters. Likewise, the show is very predictable, wherever the MC goes he is triumphant and remains victorious because he gets carried from start till end, nothing ever changes and somehow he is revered as a godly figure.The romance in Grancrest Senki is passable, but I would consider it to be rather lacking (Only because it has romance as one of its tags. Otherwise I wouldn\'t even point this out.) The story itself feels a little disconnected from building an actual romance but perhaps that is just my personal bias because I have very high expectations for romance themed anime.Overall Grancrest Senki is passable, for a war-themed anime but there are clearly better stories out there.

From start to finish this anime is a gigantic mess with few (if any) redeemable qualities.Story: Grancrest starts with a Romeo/Juliet style wedding between two rival kingdoms being violently interrupted by a 3rd party. This wedding would have meant world peace but now for laughably underdeveloped reasons, it cannot proceed. On the macroscale, this leads to hostilities between the kingdoms and allows the “age of chaos” to continue. We are then introduced to the...two main protagonists Theo, a low ranking, wandering knight and Silucia, a novice mage in search of a worthy master. They form an eternal pact within 3 minutes of meeting one another and begin their quest for world domination.Grancrest tried to create a world full of intricate diplomacy, clever battlefield tactics/strategies, political intrigue, shifting alliances and high fantasy. And in another universe, it may have come close to Berserk or Code Geass or Game of fucking Thrones but alas it did not. The main problem is that the characters and the plot line were kinda---dumb. The conflicts were dumb and the solutions to said conflicts were dumb. Theo would get himself in a pickle where he’d be outnumbered 100 to 1 and the brilliant solution was simply to just win. There’s a city in your way that’s ruled by an enemy lord? Just give an impassioned speech at the gates and get them to pledge their undying loyalty to you—done deal.One thing I should mention is that this anime is bloody as hell. We’re talking decapitations, spears to faces, burning etc. Soldiers’ lives are worthless in Grancrest and they get slaughtered in droves—hence the Berserk comparison above. This doesn’t add maturity or gravity to Grancrest at all, instead it backfires. Imaging cutting between castle guards getting ruthlessly butchered and cutesy, blushing romance scenes between the MCs. It’s a schizophrenic train wreck.This anime relies on characters’ stupid decisions, deus ex machina interventions and easy-to-fix misunderstandings to simultaneously prolong and resolve conflicts. It was very unsatisfying and failed to even answer some of the basic questions I had after episode 1 like how does magic work and what is a “crest”.I recommend against watching this anime unless you feel like going on a brain cell safari. two main protagonists Theo, a low ranking, wandering knight and Silucia, a novice mage in search of a worthy master.

And in another universe, it may have come close to Berserk or Code Geass or Game of fucking Thrones but alas it did not. The main problem is that the characters and the plot line were kinda---dumb. The conflicts were dumb and the solutions to said conflicts were dumb. Theo would get himself in a pickle where he’d be outnumbered 100 to 1 and the brilliant solution was simply to just win. There’s a city in your way that’s ruled by an enemy lord? Just give an impassioned speech at the gates and get them to pledge their undying loyalty to you—done deal.One thing I should mention is that this anime is bloody as hell. We’re talking decapitations, spears to faces, burning etc. Soldiers’ lives are worthless in Grancrest and they get slaughtered in droves—hence the Berserk comparison above. This doesn’t add maturity or gravity to Grancrest at all, instead it backfires. Imaging cutting between castle guards getting ruthlessly butchered and cutesy, blushing romance scenes between the MCs. It’s a schizophrenic train wreck.This anime relies on characters’ stupid decisions, deus ex machina interventions and easy-to-fix misunderstandings to simultaneously prolong and resolve conflicts.

A woman can cheat on you as a form of love towards you. Makes no sense but whatever2. Even the worse, evil woman in the world can have her happy ending just because3. When it comes to religion men evil, women good.Now to dive in the problems this show has:1. The motives of the person seen as the antagonist for most of the series are dumb and nonsensical but for some reason many seem to agree2....Most castles are actually palaces and severely lack defense3. When conquering a castle raising its defense levels does not seem to be something people do in this universe4. People do not understand how a seige works. Everyone just exists the palace and does frontal assault. The only good seige is towards the end and the seiged building is not even a castle/palace but a small city mainly housing an academy.5. Shields and Armor are just like paper mache and matter not6.There is almost no strategy in any attack, almost all do frontal attacks and apparently with the exception of Dartanians which apparently are some sort of super humans despite having no magic is all about numbers7. a woman defeats multiple male opponents in combat AFTER LOSING HER ART8. Many of their decisions are illogical and dumb10. The author spends a great deal of time trying to make us feel sorry for the main antagonist despite making extremely dumb and nonsensical decisions that only made things worse11. Inserting the Holy Grail crap from Dan Brown's novels12. No combat is remotely interesting. Tactics like scorched earth, traps, skirmishes and guerilla tactics which have been used in history are never used13. The whole idea of needing an emperor is foreign to Europe as unlike Japan is much larger as a land and the people on it are much more diverse. Also we have real winter14. Apparently being the ultimate effeminate cuck gives one the ability to strategise despite testosterone being the main factor for a good strategist and also makes you look masculine15. why simply executing the people that took part of the conspiration never ocured to anyone?16. There is no rain, mist, snow,etc. All things that can change the path of a battle17. The motives of various faction that represent European countries or populations (Greek, German, Slavs, Vikings, Muslim) are grossly misunderstood18. Generally none of the fighters think about conjuring beings of chaos as a military strategy to create disorder in the opposite camp. There is only one case towards the end and then they simply conjure one single giant clumsy being which is easily defeated instead of many smaller ones whcih could overcome by sheer numbers19. just because the grancrest is created does not mean that things will change much apart from the dissapearence of magic and magic creatures.

As it usually is with LN adaptations, the makers of this anime did not manage to include all relevant material in order to fit the whole story into 24 episode. It is especially noticeable in the first couple of episodes when the story seems to jump a bit from time to time leaving the watchers confused. But that changes in later episodes and I did not have problems following the development of the story (especially who fights with whom and where).Since...many of the other reviewers gave this anime unexpectedly low rating, I was thinking that it would be good to show to potential watchers why they shouldn’t skip this anime which is what my review is going to focus on. Because I see the average score of this anime (slightly over 7 at the moment) as fair and appropriate. Grancrest Senki is not a masterpiece. When it started airing, I did not expect many people to watch it because the synopsis did not promise anything especially original, the trailer looked average. After a few episodes, I was surprised to see how many people were still watching it. Grancrest definitely has its faults, but you’re are going to love it anyway. It is one of those anime which are for some reason very enjoyable and capture your heart, so you’re going to forgive its faults (unless you don’t like this genre).Given that it is action fantasy with lots of fights, there isn’t much character development for other characters beside the main ones. Overall, there is a lot of characters and sometimes you might forget names of the less important ones, but on the other hand this is that kind of anime in which a character can appear for only 3 minutes and instantly becomes loved by everyone (king Solon for example). I personally liked even many of the “evil” characters who were hated by some viewers. Mirza Kuches is a very good antagonist, even his design clearly shows that he is the bad guy, and it may also be because of his design, the way he moves, the way he is drawn in each scene that I found him captivating (while wishing they will defeat him as soon as possible).But now more to the two main characters. The young knight Theo gets thrown into the whole story by accident because he just happens to encounter the mage Siluca while she is attacked by some ruffians. After he saves her (even though she would be easily able to protect herself), she decides to choose him as her master (whether he wants it or not). Theo did not have any big ambitions, just to save his small island home country, so at the beginning Siluca is the one who makes decisions and pushes him through the ranks to gain influence. But what is important, both of them realize this and it is not like Theo stays on the sidelines like some incompetent harem king. On the contrary, he takes on the role of the protagonist and does it justice. Among the MC from similar anime, I really appreciated his calmness and I found him overall very likable. Speaking about Siluca and Theo, their romance was very refreshing, with no unnecessary drama, it fitted nicely with the story and was pleasantly straightforward without any of the two characters being oblivious to their feelings.To not make this review too long, I would like to sum up everything by saying that Grancrest Senki is not a flawless anime, but at the same time is very enjoyable and I would definitely re-watch it.Overall rating: 7,5/10 many of the other reviewers gave this anime unexpectedly low rating, I was thinking that it would be good to show to potential watchers why they shouldn’t skip this anime which is what my review is going to focus on.

Not sure why people are complaining about how the pacing is making them confused about what's happening when it's pretty easy to understand. I don't really appreciate how weak the magicians/magic is in this story and there's little character development regarding Theo and Siluca but at least their romance is slowly growing. The politics are interesting though. What we go see is development in Marrine and Alexis. I feel like they gave Theo way too much plot armor when he fought Milza but hey what can I say? Main character = automatic win amirite? This feels like a less...magic-involved Fate series but with surprisingly better graphics quality than Apocrypha. magic-involved Fate series but with surprisingly better graphics quality than Apocrypha."", ""So first of all I am sorry if this turns out kinda messy, for I haven't written a lot of reviews.A lot of people score this anime really slow, but in my opinion Grancrest Senki is not bad at all, in fact it's really good.However, it has a few flaws: for example, the pacing is pretty fast, you'll soon realise that events that would usually requiere some chapters to be explained, are covered in 10 minutes  or so. And this may lead to difficulties following the story.But it's not that bad, it's not like you won't understand the plot, it's just that you will...take a while to get used to many names and places and so on... but you'll get there.I gotta admit that the characters are not great, the MC is not as likeable as Goku or Seiya or Kenshin or Ash Ketchum, it's not that interesting, but it's alright overall. And the other characters from the series are actually pretty good.This series can get gory and explicit in a lot of ways, so it's meant for a mature audience. In my opinion that's a plus.I would give this a 6.5 or a 7, but the last episodes are really good and imo make up for some of the flaws of the series, so in the end it's an 8 from me.As a final veredict: Grancrest Senki is alright, it is fun if you don't have any idea of what you wanna do with your free time. However it's not 'memorable', and there are a lot of other animes out there that take less than 24 episodes and deliver a story of higher quality.So, go ahead and watch it... or not. You won't be missing out on anything, but you will have a good time if you give it a chance. take a while to get used to many names and places and so on... but you'll get there.I gotta admit that the characters are not great, the MC is not as likeable as Goku or Seiya or Kenshin or Ash Ketchum, it's not that interesting, but it's alright overall.

I\'ll go to war and a whole crap ton of good people are going to die on both sides!""WHY????? It\'s just so dumb I can\'t even begin to make an excuse for it.

All we need is a premise for this war to occur..."" and no one called them out on the one easily fixable glaring issue the show has: There is no logical or emotional reason for any of this to be happening. And it would be so easy to have written something, anything, that even sort of justified going to war. Like each side being suspicious the other was responsible for the attack or something but none of that happens.I would give this show a 9.5/10 but because THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY OF THE EVENTS IN THE SHOW TO TAKE PLACE I\'m bumping it down to an 8/10. that no one producing this show was like ""We\'ve got good sound and art and the character development/interactions are phenominal, we\'re telling an interesting story set in a fantasy world with great world building.

Not even through half of the show, I got the kiss scene I saw on IG but stuck around to see how Theo would lead his troops and where Atlatan will lie by the end of the show. Now, let\'s get into the anime basics.Story; The continent of Atlatan was about to find peace, with the marriage of the Union and Alliance (Alexis and Marrine) coming upon them... but then the Great Hall Tragedy struck. The dark energy that covers the continent,...Chaos, erupted in-front of the to-be-wed couple, and from the midst of it emerged the Demon Lord. The best Mage\'s, including on by the name of Siluca could not prevent the deaths of the leaders of the Union/Alliance. When all ends, Siluca travels to study under a master magician but ends up getting saved by the young man Theo from soldiers and a ""chaos"" spawned by Siluca herself because she discovered this young man has his own ""crest"". With a crest, you can banish chaos that torment the innocent and even become the lord who can lead the people. These two, fated by destiny, join in a contract with a noble goal, a journey to embark on a continent to restore. TO BE HONEST, I was expecting this anime to be jam packed with information. All the crests, kings, mages, cities and towns that hold different races and religions... The world that was built was freakin beautiful, and I can\'t believe I only started watching it for a kiss scene (-o-) Art; The art was good! A typical anime where they put loads of money/time into certain scenes, and then lack in others. (Example, EX23 when Lassic defeats the Cyclopes. It was finally his time to shine, but they just didn\'t do him justice). Sound; The OST was good. I liked the endings more than the openings. Characters; Obviously, the main stars of the show are Theo and Siluca... but I just want moooorrreeee information.Overall, I enjoyed the world that way built up and the pleasant ending it ended with. The kiss scenes between Theo and Siluca were good, but still not enough to satisfy my romantic heart. I hope to find some fanfics of them later.I don\'t know if I\'ll pick up the manga since it has so many side stories and spin-offs, but I am tempted to rewatch the anime again.

Really, that about sums it up for me.I usually like to leave my reviews here moreso as a collection of my thoughts on whatever it is I watched. Also, I\'m way more of a casual than many others who post reviews here, so if you\'re looking for a lot of depth or some fancy writing, this probably isn\'t the review for you.Overall, I actually really enjoyed the show! It wasn\'t anything special, but it suited my tastes pretty accurately. Any kind of fantasy world, albeit this one lended itself to a bit more realism, with magic, swords, and an...end goal will drag me in pretty easily. And Record or Grancrest War is exactly that. More medieval fantasy shows for me, please!The series was a ton of fun. The action sequences were pretty decent for the most part, and despite being short, they were able to tell a pretty good story and keep everything flowing rather smoothly. The art and sound are nothing to write home about, but they\'re still both of good quality. The show, in general, is entertaining in total.I do have a few gripes despite overall really liking the show. POTENTIAL SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT. Although I\'ll try and keep everything as vague as possible.First off, I really enjoy Theo Cornaro\'s motives. That being said, they do little to really establish him as the powerful (yet humble and endearing) emperor that he dreams to be. The only fight where he seems to show an actual ability to beat a powerful opponent is against Lord Milza of whom he goes 1 on 1 with. Outside of that, I don\'t personally recall a single fight where he felt like the reason for victory. It almost feels like he just lucked into his ending status.I also despised a few parts of specific episodes, a few episodes as a whole and a few of the character decisions that were made, which is why overall enjoyment score isn\'t any higher. The last episode was so plain. It felt more rushed and too quick than any other episode of the show.I also despised the decisions they made, in terms of character development, after Marrine gave herself up to Milza. Marrine\'s character was only starting to develop, but after said incident she stagnated. I\'m not entirely sure what I wanted with her character, as there are a few things I feel like I would have done, but not much could have been worse with the ""I\'m secretly dying inside but I\'ll continue ruling with an iron fist to mask my pain"" kind of character she became. And then to just randomly become happy after Alexis says ""I don\'t care that you banged him if you didn\'t love him"", felt so weird and like a bad choice.Which brings me to my next point. I personally would have rather seen Alexis completely do a 180 and be so angry, so upset about what happened that he\'d turn into something he wasn\'t. I applaud them for staying true to his character, but he also felt like a relative non-factor. When he joined the war, there was only about a 5-minute period where he felt like he contributed anything. For the status of his character, and how much screen time he got, I just ended up heavily disliking him. That 180 could have changed all of that, but alas.I think many of the characters suffered, though, because the series felt too short. Many angles felt rushed, and thus the characters never really got a lot of time to develop or shine. I liked Siluca, Aishela, Irvin, and Sir Lassic David\'s characters a lot, but even they could have used more time for us to find out who they really are, gotten any backstory for them, or anything really. 24 episodes just didn\'t feel like enough time, and it ended up bringing a pretty generic ending to the series.Overall, though, Record of Grancrest War was a very solid show. Would recommend it to anyone who doesn\'t mind reasonably generic characters, but enjoys an easy, well-paced show set in a medieval fantasy world. 24 episodes may have been too short for character development for my taste, but the story had more than enough to keep me on track and entertained. end goal will drag me in pretty easily.

Since this show was on Netflix I wanted to give it a try, as one does when you run out of anime however this show is not worth any ones time.The Art and Music might be mediocre, or maybe even ok for what it is, but what is the real deal beaker is the plot, and Characters. Not a whole lot to say about that.The first few episodes do have a pretty good plot even if they go far too fast, however the...latter plot is worst then a sonic fanfic.As for the Characters, we have two main Characters who we see VERY little of their backstory, and thought they might have some good moments together over all they are just kind of lacking.The main Characters are trying to unify the land and be just and rightful leaders, one as a king, one as a mage. You would think that they would need time to grow stronger right? Nope, the kid Theo becomes strong after one battle and the mage starts as a bad-ass and then becomes a week girl who Theo needs to protect. I do think if they had a better story then maybe they could pass. None of the other Characters are passing, I am sad to say. Small spoilers incoming.We have two rulers of kingdoms madly in love but they throw away that love because ""A demon attacked"" and some people died. Now they wage war on each other? What bullshit. Now tons of people die, for said war so even if they get together it\'s pointless. SAO has a better plot and Characters then this. I don\'t like dropping anime but you can go watch anything else and have a better time then this.If I do pick this one back up I will update, if not then just know episode 9 killed me. latter plot is worst then a sonic fanfic.As for the Characters, we have two main Characters who we see VERY little of their backstory, and thought they might have some good moments together over all they are just kind of lacking.The main Characters are trying to unify the land and be just and rightful leaders, one as a king, one as a mage.

About the only thing it has when it starts is decent animation and the premise isn\'t an overly complicated mess like virtually every other modern-ish series. However it spirals wildly out of control the longer it goes on in multiple ways, which is something that some of these aspects couldn\'t afford in the first place.Story 3/10: As stated the story is simple at the start. Basically everything past the starting premises is a complete mess of wannabe politics and laughably poor attempts at portraying combat/war. The MC also has his generic Main-Character™ cheesiness, and...his love-interest is apparently the most powerful mage in the setting... of course. It should also be noted that the ""goodguys"" frequently sperg about their noble intentions and the sacrifices they\'ve made to accomplish them. However they make far less ""sacrifices"" than the supposed badguys because they are layered in plot-armour.The ending was also just plain terrible. You know those shows that build everything up only to poorly resolve it, but you notice a few episodes are left?

Everything this show tried to have fell flat or outright failed. his love-interest is apparently the most powerful mage in the setting... of course. It should also be noted that the ""goodguys"" frequently sperg about their noble intentions and the sacrifices they\'ve made to accomplish them. However they make far less ""sacrifices"" than the supposed badguys because they are layered in plot-armour.The ending was also just plain terrible. You know those shows that build everything up only to poorly resolve it, but you notice a few episodes are left?

During this time, I have came across lot of anime and manga, some of them were really interesting, some of them were genuine, but only few of them really hit the right spot with everything it had and I consider them superb even though I won\'t give them full...mark. Grancrest Senki (Records of Grancrest War) is one of these anime. To be honest, explanation in synopses was really averting me from watching this anime for whatever reason. But to put it simply for anyone who might be interested in watching it and is by any chance reading this review, ""It\'s not as bad as it sounds in synopsis"". If you are searching for well-balanced, realistic anime with likable (and sworn to f murder) characters, Grancrest is way to go, as it greatly depicts struggles between ""need for power"", love and greater good. I won\'t recommend this anime to audience younger than 20-21+ despite of age rating, as they won\'t necessarily understand responsibility coming with adulthood and power.Here are some clarifications:Story: 8 - Story overall is really well-made, although it\'s sad that some things were resolved bit too quickly in my opinion and in other cases, you have problem to properly track how much time had passed. Because you hardly assemble army of 50,000 soldiers in 1 day or wage battle between 3 armies, conclude results and call peace treaty, this makes it feels like you are missing portion of the time which actually wasn\'t there nor they spoke about how much time it took. I haven\'t read manga yet, but I believe it was rushed only in anime in order to save time to fit whole story in 24 episodes. On the other-hand, it was wise decision to finish story in one season.Art: 9 - Except occasional (2 scenes precisely) mistakes in drawing/animation, which looked disgusting and it will scare me in sleep from now on, art and animation was pretty solid.Sound: 8 - For me, music and ambient sounds were really good, battles and scenes are properly sounded which greatly improves atmosphere. OP and ED  wasn\'t significant for me in anyway so I do not hate them nor I like them. People say that I\'m musically deaf so that\'s factor too.Characters: 10 - I must admit, in-spite of somewhat stereotypical character types, they were not plain or so stereotypical as in other animes. This anime is one of few which have almost flawless character design in my opinion. You like who are you suppose to like and hate who are you suppose hate.Enjoyment: 10 - I\'m... pathetic in the first place I guess. But I\'m optimistic idealist which look on world realistically, despite his own ideals and believes. Although it sounds like contradiction, this anime pretty much proves it as possible. Because MC believes in his ideals, however he also look at things realistically and know that there is right way to do things, be it treating people or waging conflicts. I really enjoyed how real and unreal in same time it was, for him to gain aid and support from people for what he was and for what he believed.So, my overall is 9. If you want good story and see through, how one era ends and new begins, you should definitely watch this anime.

This is anime has a serious working romance subplot and it has more than one. I was quite shocked to see that. Normally, romance subplots are just pushed to the side and used as a seasoning. Some shows go as far as to just use the romance as a bait. It is fucking retarded and I am glad I watched this show to experience some good fucking romance. It reminded me of why I liked SAO's first...half of the first season. Even with the dumb cringe I still liked the fact that a shonen anime had a working couple. This time in GranCres, we do not even have the stupid harem too.2. This anime has a generic MC dude but the guy is not that annoying this time. Again, I was quite shocked to see that too. Our heroine who is also an MC in this show; she is a really active character and pushes MC towards action. Rather than being too passive or spouting stupid idealistic bullshit all the time, our MC just acts on his beloved heroine's suggestions. He even does things despite our dominant heroine's wishes because sometimes a man has to do some things even if it is a shonen anime.3. This anime has a lot of really likeable characters. I like myself some side characters with personality and power. I like that our MCs (the boy and the girl) are not somehow the most powerful or the most important. This rule is broken in the second half but overall the tone of the anime was set accordingly to prevent it becoming an issue in the second half.Now onto something I just cannot ignore anymore.This anime has a serious pacing issue. With the amount of content if the anime took the Bleach route they could easily go up to 72 episodes maybe more. I am glad they did not but I am also conflicted. Some parts are extremely rushed and this will bother some people, all the reviews besides a handful already shows that. I generally watch anime by skipping the trash filler in between the scenes. So this did not bother me that much however as I said, some arcs really went too fast and felt inorganic to the viewers. One does not start a rebellion in 5 minutes in any show with politics, it is especially bad when you do that twice in the same show.SO all in all, this show became one of my favorites for doing something different. If an anime has at least something I really want to see then I will give it an 9+. half of the first season. Even with the dumb cringe I still liked the fact that a shonen anime had a working couple.

Generic fantasy land and it's hero fighting generic fantasy darkness villains.Characters: 4This show has a ton of characters and the ratio is high even for its episode count. The problem with them is, some just fulfill tropes. Others are bland and stereotypical for their role. As for the main characters, they often can be judged as simple and that's about it. Theo for example, is effectively your typical goodie-two-shoe hero. This is fine if everyone else made up for it... but not quite. You get your typical brutish warlords, your typical magical girl mages, and amongst them, a few expies (of Fate/Zero's Irisviel and Fate/Stay Night's Rider Medusa namely) and not a whole lot of depth.Most characters do not have a past, Theo and Siluca themselves have only a few flashbacks but not a wholly impactful past to the story. Growth-wise, Theo's power levels grow, but as his maturity started out at (near) perfect levels, that never went anywhere (it had nowhere to go). This takes away the bond that you would normally develop with characters that you watch for 24 episodes.

The level of hype that could have been generated could have been much higher. For something that takes place in a fantasy world, one way to get the audience to bond with the world and thus build hype for world events is to let us see the lives of the residents in that world and its rules. They have told us what we need to know in terms of how the super powers and magic works. What they rarely, if ever did was bond us to the very world and its existences itself. The best done part was the liberations by appealing to the IRL audience's love of life, liberty and right to pursue happiness. Yet everything else was just cliche good vs evil in the land. The Irisviel expy's fate was very obvious from several episodes before it actually happened, for instance. Yet, we dont see her enough to really bond to her to feel the emotions that the characters on the screen seem to feel because she rarely got screentime before the scene in question.Adding on to the problem of hype is the way that they build it up with various tricks in the story. There is a certain lack of reactions possible when the reactions generated by various trick deeds of the characters are highly contrived. From the naked speech scene, to the short teatime talk between Theo and his friend that got one of them to turn a complete 180 from what they've been doing up until that point, it is very difficult to suspend disbelief and immerse into the reactions that follow when the ideas were very contrived. It makes each of those feats look effortless when in truth they could've been built up to be a lot more dramatic, and thus generate a lot more hype.Enjoyment: 6It's still a pleasant watch but there are many parts that are lacking in the way it should have been done.

Anyway, the first 20 episodes are very very great. They skipped a lot of things from the novel, but nothing too major. Expect great romance development. The last few episodes are very rushed though. Animation are great, battle scenes are well animated. Character designs also represent what their character are. I really liked the OST that kept playing through the series, I just felt that it fits with every scene. Maybe it's just that epic. This series had some of the most well-written characters, but also some of the worst. Do note that...this anime has a very large cast of characters. One thing that must be pointed out is, Theo's amazing character development. I also like that he is able to take the initiative unlike some other fantasy protagonist. Siluca is a great complement to Theo. The seiyuus were also able to portray their character well. I really enjoyed this series. And when I say I enjoyed it, it means that I watched 24 episodes in 2 days. Just try to watch it, if it's not your cup of tea, that's fine. I also just realized the miniscule number of warfare anime. this anime has a very large cast of characters. One thing that must be pointed out is, Theo's amazing character development.

I also just realized the miniscule number of warfare anime."", 'tl;dr: A story of military fantasy strategy and politics that feels like it has a tremendous potential but is paced too fast to really capitalize on any of it.Grancrest Senki is a fantasy anime centered around strategy and conquest. Various character’s are vying for the position of continent conquering emperor. There’s a clear main character, Theo, who has his own allies and ultimately his own faction, but the anime spends just as much time developing the other factions and the character’s involved in them as well. Unfortunately, that means that it fails to develop anyone or anything properly. The anime is simply too fast paced...and adapts too much in too short a time. The anime is never completely broken in that it’s never particularly confusing and it’s easy enough to follow along with the plot. The problem is that it’s too fast paced for most anything to matter.The world is interesting in a number of ways. It’s very systematic, with there essentially being classes, levels that increase upon defeating enemies, organized hierarchies and power structures, etc. The various factions, nations, alliances, and such within that frame work create what feels like a pretty well fleshed out and interesting world. Unfortunately, the world building is tremendously lacking. It never really feels like the anime gives you a good view of the entire world. It basically only explains what it needs to when it’s necessary. The world has lots of different cultures, which is interesting to a degree, but because it goes so quickly through all of them they feel kind of disjointed and it is hard to see how they all fit together simultaneously, especially in terms of technology. The anime is also heavily centered around politics, strategy, etc. so the world’s situation is incredibly important and plays a part in a lot of major plot points. The history and systems of the world itself are also eventually very important. However, because the world is never properly fleshed out, any major twist in that regards feels like it came completely out of left field. Honestly, the only way to tell if something is a twist or not is based on whether the main character’s are surprised by it, because as a viewer most every event that happens is pretty much rooted in elements that are completely new and unfamiliar making everything surprising, and in effect nothing surprising. And also, because the plot is moving so fast, there’s really no time for prior events to sink in before the plot has changed to focusing on something else entirely. And even with the really fast pacing, it was clear that they didn’t have enough time to adapt the story, and thus you end up with weird stuff like a character who is defeated, joins the protagonist, and then dies fighting for the protagonist, completely off screen and that you only know about through pretty random mini infodump like statements from various character’s. The plot also deals with some themes that actually have a good amount of depth and complexity to them, or rather I should say it touches on them, because though they are pretty important to the plot, it goes through them so fast it barely even considers them and thus it’s all ultimately pretty superficial. The ending felt especially bad at that, and to be honest I’m not satisfied with how it just glossed over things to force the ending to seem like a completely happy ending.Character’s face the same issues. The main characters, Theo and Siluca, had character arcs and relationship development that was decent, but still barely within the threshold of being considered good. Everyone and everything else falls below that threshold. There were numerous problems all around. For one, there were too many character’s and it didn’t develop any of them enough. There were some character’s that seemed pretty cool in the limited time they were allotted that I would have loved to see more of, but that just wasn’t to be. For example, I would really have loved to see more of Petr the worker ant and any possible relationship development with Aishela, as well as any development of Aishela building up to that sudden event where she suddenly mattered a lot. There were also a lot of characters that it felt not being developed enough actively made them seem a lot worse. A lot of characters to put it frankly act really stupid at times. There’s usually some attempt at conveying to the viewer why they made such decisions, with these decisions ultimately stemming from emotion one way or another. However, the personalities of these character’s aren’t fleshed out well enough for the viewer to really understand the character’s thought process, and thus these moments simply don’t land and often seem pretty out of character. The biggest example of this I think is Marianne, who despite actually having some really amazing aspects to her at times, simply seems like a bitch who had no clue what she actually wanted or what she was doing for most of the show, and her romance with Alexis and everything surrounding was just a complete mess. In hindsight after everything is over, it wasn’t as terrible as it felt when it was happening and Marianne isn’t that bad of a character, but how it was conveyed was god awful, especially considering how much of the limited time the show had was spent on it. Deaths also don’t land with anywhere near the amount of emotional impact they should have had. Overall, the only character’s stories that I’d say I’m even remotely satisfied with are Theo and Siluca, with everyone else being tremendously lacking.The art and animation on this is decent most of the time, but it randomly really takes a major dive at times. And not just during unimportant scenes either. A lot of the major battles look terrible. The design work overall I’d have to say is pretty good though. The OP and EDs were all decent enough both in terms of visuals and audio, but weren’t particularly memorable. The soundtrack is mostly similar in that it fits well enough and is decent enough but without being particularly memorable, though there were some tracks that were pretty major exceptions to that in that they’re amazingly epic and quite memorable, mainly the main theme and variants of it. and adapts too much in too short a time. The anime is never completely broken in that it’s never particularly confusing and it’s easy enough to follow along with the plot. The problem is that it’s too fast paced for most anything to matter.The world is interesting in a number of ways. It’s very systematic, with there essentially being classes, levels that increase upon defeating enemies, organized hierarchies and power structures, etc. The various factions, nations, alliances, and such within that frame work create what feels like a pretty well fleshed out and interesting world. Unfortunately, the world building is tremendously lacking. It never really feels like the anime gives you a good view of the entire world. It basically only explains what it needs to when it’s necessary. The world has lots of different cultures, which is interesting to a degree, but because it goes so quickly through all of them they feel kind of disjointed and it is hard to see how they all fit together simultaneously, especially in terms of technology. The anime is also heavily centered around politics, strategy, etc. so the world’s situation is incredibly important and plays a part in a lot of major plot points. The history and systems of the world itself are also eventually very important. However, because the world is never properly fleshed out, any major twist in that regards feels like it came completely out of left field. Honestly, the only way to tell if something is a twist or not is based on whether the main character’s are surprised by it, because as a viewer most every event that happens is pretty much rooted in elements that are completely new and unfamiliar making everything surprising, and in effect nothing surprising. And also, because the plot is moving so fast, there’s really no time for prior events to sink in before the plot has changed to focusing on something else entirely. And even with the really fast pacing, it was clear that they didn’t have enough time to adapt the story, and thus you end up with weird stuff like a character who is defeated, joins the protagonist, and then dies fighting for the protagonist, completely off screen and that you only know about through pretty random mini infodump like statements from various character’s. The plot also deals with some themes that actually have a good amount of depth and complexity to them, or rather I should say it touches on them, because though they are pretty important to the plot, it goes through them so fast it barely even considers them and thus it’s all ultimately pretty superficial. The ending felt especially bad at that, and to be honest I’m not satisfied with how it just glossed over things to force the ending to seem like a completely happy ending.Character’s face the same issues. The main characters, Theo and Siluca, had character arcs and relationship development that was decent, but still barely within the threshold of being considered good. Everyone and everything else falls below that threshold. There were numerous problems all around. For one, there were too many character’s and it didn’t develop any of them enough. There were some character’s that seemed pretty cool in the limited time they were allotted that I would have loved to see more of, but that just wasn’t to be. For example, I would really have loved to see more of Petr the worker ant and any possible relationship development with Aishela, as well as any development of Aishela building up to that sudden event where she suddenly mattered a lot. There were also a lot of characters that it felt not being developed enough actively made them seem a lot worse. A lot of characters to put it frankly act really stupid at times. There’s usually some attempt at conveying to the viewer why they made such decisions, with these decisions ultimately stemming from emotion one way or another. However, the personalities of these character’s aren’t fleshed out well enough for the viewer to really understand the character’s thought process, and thus these moments simply don’t land and often seem pretty out of character.

(as certain things feel skipped over or fast forwarded, which I personally loved as didn’t really give a shit about those elements, important parts were presented, at least felt so)##Review (comments/longer ver):*StoryMan, I have such mixed feelings when it comes to story itself and storytelling. So, I’ll start what I considered good.The good part would be probably the whole grandiose element. It had drama, romance, tragedy, warfare, strategy, politics, fantasy and fairly odd twists. The whole story felt like really odd theatrics… from the whole first character encounter journey to the whole brainwashed patriotic war filled world to the weddings and plot twists. It’s type of story that could probably be dragged for hundreds of episodes, but here what I loved about it. I feel like as it was really “condensed” a lot of important bits were presented whereas lot of activities and events that most likely would have happened at the same time in the story were skipped over, fast forwarded and so on, but somehow in a really fitting manner. Whenever there was a moment where I felt as something got “transitioned over” It simply felt as if “okay, in a nutshell, they succeeded/failed in that. That’s good enough for me. I don’t need the details, nor cared about then.” Which is cool, as I mostly cared about main characters and key character events.Of course, such grandiose stories I cannot ever fully 100% follow as there are way too many names. (characters, countries, factions etc…) but what manners that what was presented was mostly quite enjoyable.The whole story had fairly weird relation between magic, nobles and common folk. And the whole world and story linking between them already itself would be whole paragraph itself. Let alone specific factions, creatures and plot twists which would arise its topics which I simply can’t be bothered with.Now…. My main complains. There was a specific plot point which I absolutely got infuriated with. It was so unnecessary. Political marriages already piss me off, let alone that… seriously. I would rather sacrifice a universe…. Than what was done. Such a dumb and pointless self-imposed responsibility.Also, since the whole world lives in constant warfare…. Their whole moral compass is rather twisted in both patriotic and nobles/commoners manners. Which I also find rather idiotic and never been fond of. Which makes the world in this anime rather twisted. Thus, a lot of story decisions made seem “normal” there made me feel simply “like what?”Other than that, … I did enjoy the gradual plot twists and the whole constant tactical approach of Anime itself. Although story does drop few nukes on you and the finale itself is quite a thing…*CharacterMain character himself is the oddest main character I’ve seen in a long time. He is a generic good doer which itself I don’t see a problem in. But his combat approach and occasional strong decisions and his charismatic roles are such an odd balance. I don’t consider him bad nor good character…. But rather than being “dull & generic” he felt more of “odd”.But his partner, our female lead. Had quite a charming personality. In a sense she was the brains of the whole story. And I did enjoy their relationship progression overall as well a lot. Although, my only question is why she never changed her outfit still questions me. Considering once she changed her master, she didn’t need to wear it anymore and she don’t she didn’t like it at first.As for rest of the characters…. There a lot of them. Some are simply and enjoyable, some are questionable in various manners. (whenever their alignment, decisions, pointless self-imposed rules and dumb “aristocrats” culture things…). Some characters are pretty unlikeable…. Some do weird stuff that I don’t really agree with nor like much… but aren’t really a bad as characters nor people. And a lot of characters exist in “game of thrones” manner, meaning that they simply exist to be hated and where you hope they get killed off due to what they cause.But in the end… there are plenty of base stereotypes with some of them having more background and depth to them and some less… well it’s grandiose political drama so that is to be expected that characters that you can simply “like” are rare. Cast is large yet fairly good I would say, plenty to love and hate. Plenty of growth and development of various characters and plenty of cannon fodder.Simply some of the for sake of drama, tragedy. Character decisions were extremely infuriating and unnecessary. Looking at you Marianne… that was one of rare Anime where I got so angry at a character that I literally punched wall and stopped watching this Anime for few weeks and finished 5 different other Anime before finishing Grancrest….*Art & SoundFirst things first. I must say. The magic design, the crests concept and designs are absolutely something I adore in fantasy settings. Whenever it’s Japanese rune type magic in games or Anime or Western crest/symbol style stuff magic related stuff are my jam. And this world, did amazing at it.Art quality itself isn’t anything too special. But designs were superb and there were some amazingly well Animated moments.There were quite few soundtracks that had their charm. There were few peaceful tracks I noticed and liked a lot and some odd tension tracks I enjoyed a lot. But most of the OST was rather average I would say.#Enjoyment & OverallAS WHOLE….. I consider it good Anime. Probably compacted a lot from light novel, but I personally felt that most of the story I could keep track on and important bits were well delivered. Most importantly the fun parts of action and drama had well delivered and impactful meaning. Although even though around the end everything went somewhat every “grand scale bizarre” when it came to bigger powers and plot reveals.If you want more detailed lore you will have to read light novel. I honestly, didn’t care that much about side factions lore or mumbo jumbo. I simply wanted to watch grandiose fantasy and wanted the story related to main events.##Total Score 7/10 +Fairly enjoyable condensed tragic grand fantasy political warfare storytelling+large scale fights with some great smaller scale or duel tier power/magical fights+Really cool grandiose designs+Very cool vast ideas compacted in entertaining manner#CONS-Some EXTREMELY infuriating dumb plot points-Not really fond of that extremely war patriotism filled brainwashed world moral compass people have there-Some unpleasant “freedom” characters?

It is so bad that I felt that I needed to do so. My experience with this anime is so horrible, more so than Akame Ga Kill.The graphics and art are good, but the characters and plot are so appalling. I usually enjoy the anime themes where there are world-building plots etc however the mage (one of the MC) just tells Lord Theo what to do even though she is the 'servant' - it's so pathetic. She is so full of herself. I was hoping someone would give this girl a proper scolding.4/10...Overall on 5 episodes watched. Overall on 5 episodes watched."", 'I went into this looking for another Record of Lodoss War. But this is not another Record of Lodoss War, and it should not have been advertised as such since it is bound to be compared to it due to that advertisement and those are some pretty big boots to fill.At first, however, I was pleased enough. I enjoyed the first couple of episodes. While not as good, by any means, as Record of Lodoss War, it was enjoyable enough. I was prepared for a fun little adventure.I didn\'t get my adventure. What I got, instead, was politics and military battles that reminded me too...much of battle simulator phone games. And more politics. And more phone game military battles. Then in episode nine I was treated to something that felt really out of place and uncalled for, and it didn\'t seem to flow with the rest of the anime. It reminded me too much of Hollywood movies where they stick in random scenes just for shock value to get people to watch. Storywise, plotwise, it was fine. It\'s just that it seems as though the creators took it too far for no real reason, and it made me uncomfortable. The scene should definitely have been handled with more respect. That alone, nearly put me off watching the rest of the anime, but I decided to finish it just for the sake of finishing it. (There were no more uncomfortable, Hollywoodish scenes, thankfully.)The animation wasn\'t terrible, but it wasn\'t very good either. Episode nineteen, though, for some reason, had noticeably worse animation than the rest of the series. There were points in that episode that were unbelievably bad...like ""Sailor Moon remake"" levels of bad. The rest of the series was fine. I don\'t know what they were doing for episode nineteen, but it should have been polished up at least to the same level as the rest of the series.All in all, I thought it was pretty generic, with lots of drawn out battle scenes to fill it up, and I won\'t be watching it a second time. It\'s missing a lot of what I love about Record of Lodoss War, and it didn\'t really have anything that set it apart from any of the other bad fantasy anime I\'ve seen. much of battle simulator phone games.

However, this is not ""Attack of Titan"" so don\'t expect anything that exciting.', 'Today I am gonna explain why I found this anime good and yeah that was very surprising to me. When I first came into this I just wanted a fun non-ecchi fantasy anime. I rate goblin slayer like a 7 and slime Isekai like a 6 but just slime is too ecchi for me. So when I watched this and saw just how much fighting there was just to gain respect or gain new lands I was honestly surprised! And what topped it off for me as a big romance drama fan but more importantly a romcom hater, the relationship was actually genuine. Nowadays that’s...some thing romance anime find a hard time doing. I never knew the politics of war would also be this much fun, it’s amazing seeing a land split but they still came together from respect of there previous leader. Now I’m talking about the two main characters, Theo and Sulica are actually pretty unique but more Sulica than Theo. Theo is just a character that is a genuine nice person, he’s a pacifist mostly at the beginning but further down the road, he sometimes admits that he might have to use force, and it was great character development. Why I love him is just his ideology and his personality is lovable and he loves Sulica so that’s great too. Sulica is definitely the better character of the two, maybe I just like smart people but she is definitely a genius on the battlefield and that’s what made her so great. She trying to out maneuver the enemy and longer the story goes the harder the foes she tries to out genius! I wish I could explain more about her but I just don’t have the words but I admit she is my favorite character and actually is the best character writing wise in the show. I gave this anime a 8.5/10 for enjoyability factor. The characters are absolutely amazing and what made me keep going and I know people say the pacing but I watched it after it aired and it wasn’t even that bad in succession. I hope other people care for an action romance which is a rare breed that I only have one >7/10 which is this one! This is the Holy Grail of action romance, meaning the relationship is advancing during the whole show, not some battle Shonen where the mc just gets a girl. Now from here I will say if you like enjoyable characters and genuine romance please give this show a try. some thing romance anime find a hard time doing.

But I can safely say that if you get through the first 7 to 8 episodes you will enjoy the rest of the show.The story gets a 8 because while it was really good, episodes 1-8 seemed to drag on and didn't really peak my interest. But it did set up a sound story line and did have some really good moments in it.The sound and art get a 10 and 9. The sound of this anime made the emotions of the characters come through...even more because the music would always match the mood of the scene. The art was very beautiful and there were some really amazing scenes.The characters get a 8 because there were a few developed characters that the viewers could enjoy and relate to. But at some moments the characters did feel a bit shallow and that what is holding it back from a 8 in my book.The overall enjoyment is a 7, that is because as I said before the beginning to about episode 8 was kinda boring. But if they didn't have those episodes in I would have given the enjoyment a 9.Overall this anime gets a 8 from me, and I recommend it to anyone that loves a story about lords magic and military conflict. even more because the music would always match the mood of the scene.

Well I believed I figured the problem with this anime... It's the stories timeline.The Reason i started watching this anime was because I saw a cute romance clip on youtube and that I live the APG/Adventure genre (Possibly because SAO was one of the first animes I got into and was left disappointed). The thing is i wasn't expecting much when watching this since i looked it up on MAL before watching it. I saw that is had a 7 which usually means a mediocre...anime. (I've watched plenty of 7's that were good and which it thought were an 8, but most of the time the 7 is decent at best). So I took the chance and watched it. So here are my key thoughts on it.What is a Good RPG/Adventure/D&D type anime? Well there are a fewRising of the Shield Hero, Re:Zero, Log Horizon, and SAO(some might say)The rest or harms, shoujos and ones with unnecessary fan-service (Magi and Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka). The problem is that all the ones i just mentioned are isekais, which really gets boring. The good thing this about this anime is that its not an Isekai and that these characters are actally from that universe. On the hand this doesn't compare in quality story telling to those in comparison.Pros:Interesting Characters, Good battles, decent story, Pretty fulfilling ending (for anime that is). Not an Isekai. Don't have to wait for 1,2,3 season to be finished with it (can watch is in one going like I did.....don't suggest that that or you might not get any sleep -_-)Cons:The Timeline is so messed up. The pacing just feels so off for some reason. Basically I believe the stories plot would be much better if the story was paced out much more and they took more time to write it.Overall:If you're looking for an Adventure/RPG/D&D/ and you don't want to watch another one of those trouble harm ones, then this could be for you.

Some of plots in the story is really great and unexpected.The art style is ok, i am really hyped for all fighting scene in this anime. Even the cyclops has made really well.The music.... I have no idea what i want to say, but the music is not bad but it's not good too. Soo i think it's average.Overall, i think is enjoyed this anime because it's soo militaries and have a good plot with good art style too.But, i still a bit disappointed for episode 9...and 16. and 16."", ""Grancrest Senki (2018)Well, that was a long slog whilst not feeling great today and what a show, yes that is right a 6/10.Whilst the show is 24 episodes and runs through to the end which is lovely in its own way it has so many similarities like all anime to other shows, for example, Akame Ga Kill and Plunderer.

Treated as an assassination, it was now known as ""The Great Hall Tragedy"" and conflict continues between nations. Having witnessed the incident during her graduation, Siluca Meletes the prodigy mage was now reluctantly going off to serve a new lord. However, a group of mercenaries from the opposing faction stops her during her journey there and just then she meets the wandering Theo who comes to her rescue. Not knowing Siluca\'s abilities, he fends off the mercenaries. Theo had created his own Crest from...the dark Chaos energy that leaked across the country allowing demons to appear from another dimension to raise terror. The Crest\'s power allowed humans to battle with them but, the lords who possess them had long forgotten their purpose and now it was more a symbol of status that they fight over for.After learning Theo wanted to strengthen his Crest so he may free his poverished town from tyrannic rule in Sistina, Siluca decides to help him and make him her new ideal lord. He had the potential to help her own ambition of restoring peace and destroying the Chaos energy that threatened the lands once and for all. After taking over the Crest from the lord that attacked Siluca, Theo now gained the status he needed to achieve his goals but he still had a long road ahead of him before they could both achieve their ambitions.The show gets off to an interesting start. Your heroine Siluca isn\'t one that\'s just a damsel-in-distress but the one pulling the strings and ends up being the important support behind Theo, who starts out as a naive average skilled swordsman. However, he isn\'t completely outshone since his chivalry and compassion wins over many allies. It\'s cute watching the relation between the two blossom out of mutual respect and grow to achieve their ambitions which, feels natural instead of your ""hero gets the girl"" kind of direction. Yes, there\'s romance in this show but it can be devastatingly heart breaking as it can be warm and fuzzy. There\'s a fair bit of drama and you kind of sympathise with characters caught up in the politics and conflict. Their responsibilities and lineage often force them to take desperate and drastic action which usually ends up in tragedy as they deny themselves of their own personal interests. It can get quite dark and brutal. Some have compared it to a rushed Japanese version of Game of Thrones.Fantasy world based shows usually don\'t differ by much and this show doesn\'t stray far from it with the usual roles, your nations at war but, it does have a few things that help give the world setting a bit of originality. The demonic beings are actually intelligent and play a role in keeping the world safe which is better than your usual mindless monsters added in just to be slain. Even witches are differentiated as black or white. However, the way the Crests work feels like levelling up in an RPG which kind of detracts from the world setting\'s charm. Sometimes the show can actually feel like a cutscene out of a really bad JRPG.Action scenes are interesting with your grand battles and a bit of gore which is probably expected in a fantasy show but I\'ve seen worse. Character fight scenes are good and I probably wouldn\'t have expected less from the studio behind Sword Art Online. There\'s a lot of focus on body language such as movement of the eyes and hands during dialogue. Sound effects and music do a good job of bringing out the atmosphere although there weren\'t any tunes that really made an impression. Art\'s not too bad although you can clearly see some quality drop in the odd episode and, the 3D animation really sticks out like a sore thumb often too stiff looking. The show starts off with little to no fan service apart from the odd alluring attire as you\'d expect from fantasy shows but, it does eventually choose some awkward camera angles. There are also some scenes that are just savage so definitely not a show for the younger audience as they can be quite explicit.Interestingly enough, this show is based on a 10 volume light novel series of the same name and it\'s written by Ryo Mizuno best known for the classic Record of Lodoss War. Lodoss is more straight forward with just the good and bad sides fighting it out starring your RPG style party of heroes who turns the tide, no tactics or conspiracy. It\'s more adventure oriented so not quite as tragic as this and the overall art style is more consistent without the 3D animations. However, this show has better character development which is probably why I found it more enjoyable than Lodoss because you actually feel bad for them when something tragic happens. It also has the better romance if that\'s what you\'re after in a fantasy world show.Overall, it\'s a fantasy show with a story that can be so good at times but also so ridiculously silly at others. It\'s filled with action, romance and power struggle at a grand scale just like its title suggests. Be prepared for some really dark moments and don\'t miss the extra scenes they sometimes have after the credits. Either you\'ll enjoy this show on the whole with its great cast of characters or end up remembering it for the wrong reasons. the dark Chaos energy that leaked across the country allowing demons to appear from another dimension to raise terror.

Yes, the premise is nothing we haven't seen before, however I don't believe a show should get docked just for being what it is. Essentially, if you like JRPGs or D&D, you will like this, especially if 18+.Three canon romances, strong female characters that literally drive the show, gore, good animation and ost, sex/kissing/fanservice, world building, and an MC that isn't emotionally constipated or scared of killing. What more do you really want?Only nitpicks I had: Two times I noticed audio issues, a moment where a character's...mic seemed to give some feedback and another time where a sound effect for a fist bump happened before they connected. Generally, I found the show slow, you will see a lot of reviews saying they dropped after ep 9 (then why are you writing a review for a full show?) but once you get past that it just gets better. Also I did not like the execution of Alexis and Marrine's dispute/resolution, felt like that negated the need for a couple of deaths. But otherwise, it's a pretty solid war show. I mean mages use their wands like cellphones. That alone at least deserves a 5. mic seemed to give some feedback and another time where a sound effect for a fist bump happened before they connected.

I sighed a lot, cursed a lot, facepalmed a lot especially at one particular emo character.

Kidou Senshi Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34391/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_Thunderbolt_2nd_Season,"['Includes spoilersIt\'s bad. It\'s so bad.I had high hopes after season 1 (which is an at least 9/10 piece of art), this is just disgusting compared to it\'s predecessor. I will rate this season comparing to season 1.Story: 1/10literally nothing important happens, that\'s not saying no plot progression was made. Like season 1 they tried to cram as much information as they could in to 4 episodes, except it was way lighter in season one due to the high quality battles. This entire season is purely exposition, with no mech fights that are remotely comparable to season 1. The intense battles between the 2 main...characters was what drove the show to greatness, this season is just nothing comparison, literally like not watching anything. since none of the side characters ever got any development, none of them matters when they die. the main characters didn\'t even fight so they had plot shield the entire time, which made none of the battles involving them interesting.things that drives the plot is as pointless as it gets. Things that happens in season 1: Io got captured, Claudia dies, Daryl looses his limbs. How season 2 negated all of these things: Io breaks out first thing for no good reason, Claudia is just not dead, 2 limbs or no limbs, Daryl once in a while clinches his teeth OH NO!Art: 7/10 not much to say, very stylized way that excelled in season 1 now mostly spent on talking animation. goofy ass fodder mechs and planes ruins the moments (when there are basically no ""moments"")Sound: 5/10 remember how much the frantic, scattered jazz pushed the space battles in the asteroid field? well now we have that over slow underwater crap that doesn\'t ever fit the pace of the music.Character: 1/10 Whats character development? Season 1 characters you gave a shit about because nobody else mattered: Io, Daryl. Season 2 you gave a shit about because nobody else mattered: just Io. I\'m willing to bet that you can\'t name anymore than Io Daryl and Claudia off of your head because none of them made any kind of impression nor impact on the story. Season 2 characters include: that bald chick, that one chick that played an instrument, the professor chick that has daddy issuesEnjoyment: 1/10 i want my wasted time back. it\'s a gundam show, there is barely any gundam, plus the only gundam lost it\'s first legit battle to some dude.Over all: 3/10 is as generous as I can getAfter note: this season shouldn\'t even be called gundam thunderbolt since it has nothing to do with gundam thudnerbolt. the actual gundam: thunderbolt isn\'t in here, the ""thunderbolt sector"" wasn\'t in here, the shit that happened in gundam thunderbolt didn\'t matter cause the fact that claudia is alive, and Io escaping immediately negates all of season 1\'s plot.

This is literally a piece of garbage using a superior show\'s title to gain views.', '*Spoilers for both seasons of Gundam Thunderbolt*The phrases ""Robots are cool"" and ""War is hell"" are nothing if not ubiquitous with Gundam. Anyone who fancies himself even a remote fan of Gundam can tell you that. Yet, while most war stories opt for the ""war is hell"" angle, there aren\'t that many of them that really feel...human. Sure, we can have something like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" which accomplishes that, but most of the time, we get ""SEED Destiny"" and ""00 Second Season"" which have it\'s characters come off as more ""idiot/asshat tools for a broken narrative"" than truly human characters that make...us feel something good.Gundam Thunderbolt has always felt human. Yes, it still goes the ""robots are cool"" angle Gundam and most mecha anime in general have as their bones, and yes, there is a lot of sick jazz to really get the adrenaline pumping when action takes place, but Gundam Thunderbolt feels truly human about expressing war and its combatants, and this second season is no exception. Yet somehow, a lot of people fail to realize this, seeing it as nothing more than pretty action romps with little substance. While in the surface Thunderbolt is another epic war series full of some of the flashiest visuals you will ever see in anime, it presents everything more realistically than dramatically, all the while making perfect sense, effectively becoming more dramatic than most of its much longer brethren. So, how does Gundam Thunderbolt go about being human, and what does this Second Season do to strengthen such a human feel? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?It\'s one whole year after the One Year War, and now Zeon remnants have aligned with this strange religious cult known as the South Seas Alliance to take down the feddies. Once again, we have two stories, two main perspectives to follow, Io and Daryl. The interactions they have with their crew are excellent and really bring the best out of everybody in terms of expressing their character, and their battles are as exciting as always. Then in episode 6, we receive a reminder of just how human this show really is after the epic reestablishing episode 5 did and was meant to do. One Zeon troop lost his newborn son in debris and is now fighting out of grief while all we see is a scene of him crying while swiping through pictures of him and his wife right after her giving birth. Next we see Commander Bull, and in one moment, he flicks the head of a bobblehead baseball player with pictures of him and his son also being in the amphibian mobile suit he’s piloting, and in another scene, him getting ready to shoot himself in his room full of more baseball bobbleheads. I love this kind of human storytelling placed on even grunts we’ll never see again. Whereas any other Gundam anime would\'ve shown them fighting while shouting about their children or not even showing bobbleheads, this one does, and I\'m really thankful for it.Everything this anime teases us with even slightly is tied up perfectly beyond the main plot. In episode 5, we see the old hag chairman (or whatever position she holds) having a sort of incense necklace and in the finale, it turns out this was from her Newtype Facility that the original cultist, Levan Fuu was from before he began his cult. After an awesome session of playing the song “Groovy Duel” before a mission in episode 6, Io and his new jazz aficionado friend Bianca say they\'ll do another session, and in the next episode, they remark on how they never did and how they\'ll do that right after the operation that lasts from then to the end of this finale, except it\'s gonna keep going because this show burns us with a cliffhanger. Before that, a few things I wanna clear up, as well as one minor gripe.Some people have accused the Groovy Duel scene of being nothing but filler. That is not true. That was there to quickly reinforce that this hobby of Io’s and Bianca’s they share wouldn\'t be just a one-off aspect of them that never came up again, unlike most anime that have character mutually involved in a hobby unrelated to the show’s narrative. We already know that about Io, but we didn\'t know that for Bianca, and it was fun to see them do it and then Io reminiscing about episode 1 of last season where he was in space combat before his suit got sniped. I\'m also glad that episode 7 reinforced this, though after episode 6, that was set in stone about the two and their friendship. A few issues come up though. Well, actually just one. Apparently, Claudia survived getting shot being in the ship that got destroyed and somehow she was reduced by the South Seas Alliance. How? It\'s a dismal plot point and a big issue with the second half of the season, but it\'s not enough to derail my experience with the show.Io is just as cool as ever, especially in his new Atlas Gundam, and it\'s nice to see him really worry about Claudia once she shows up, though I already covered him last time. His chemistry with Bianca is damn fine though. Speaking of, Bianca is officially the best girl in Thunderbolt. Going through a lot of crews and being an awesome jazz aficionado was damn fun to know about her, and overall she’s very fun and full of jabs. Some of my favorite moments of her include her threatening to drop Io by calling him a selfish prick and asking if he wants to take a swim when he complained about her being late as his Mobile Suit’s footstool in episode 8, and her covering her head and apologizing after seeing Cornelius grind his knuckles on Io’s head for messing up his mobile suit and saying that she was guilty of it as well. Speaking of, Cornelius is here and doesn\'t do much but hey, fun to have him and the tissue gag back.Like Io, Daryl is back and we don\'t really need to delve much into him this time, except for one thing. Remember when Karla started going crazy and screaming her head off in episode 4 last season? Well, as a result, she has reverted to her prepubescent stage mentally and thanks to the whole 3 metal fingers resemblance her father had to Daryl, he has to pose as her father while she is in recovery, which is insanely bittersweet. His crew and their interactions are pretty alright as well. We don\'t need to touch up on Claudia either. She’s basically the same except with new people and we already covered that. Including those two soldiers from episode 6, we have a really wonderful and rather human cast. Hell, their dialogue is often great too, especially Bianca’s. I love when a series a built a bit on its old cast while making the new guys just as great, which is surprisingly hard for Gundam sequels to do if Gundam SEED Destiny and 00 Second Season have taught me anything.The mobile suits and new Gundams like the Atlas Gundam, all look damn amazing, and some of the Feddie suits that didn\'t look quite right in season 1 now look perfect here. The stellar action is fun and flashy as always, like when Daryl pulls off a maneuver that involves boosting into his Frizzy Yard cloak and it looks shimmering with the red protective cloak and the blue-ish booster flames, and the battle at Ao Boa Qu in episode 5. Despite the mildest of weird CGI, this probably even tops or at least definitely rivals season 1 for the title of best looking Gundam anime. Hell, the Groovy Duel sequence was pretty well animated, and contrary to some people’s belief, has no reused footage other than Io simultaneously reminiscing on the battle in episode 1. Needless to say, this ONA is as eyegasmic as it was before. It is Gundam Fucking Thunderbolt, after all.Naruyoshi Kikuchi comes back for this season as well, delivering another round of great scores. The elephant in the room is “Pretty Song” for being so upbeat and so different from any kind of music from the series, and it\'s definitely a cute song, no pun intended. Others such as the episode 6 and 7 ED themes I can\'t currently find a name for, as well as “Groovy Duel” which rivals “Thunderbolt for Main Theme” from season 1 in terms of being real blood-pumping jazz. I also like the song ""War of Sara Yoshida"" from episode 8. Now I wish I could find the names for more of these tracks since there amazing and I do like more of the ED themes of this season than those of last season.With magnificent action and equally fun jazz and music, this series more than satisfied the adrenaline-inducing action junkie in me. With brilliant and real dialogue and subtle and true displays of humanity, I could only appreciate this series even more. It more than fulfills its duty as a worthy follow-up to its predecessor, which is unfortunately rare for Gundam sequels. Even if you don\'t agree that this series or even this season is great, at least we can all agree on one thing: it\'s leagues ahead of that piece of shit Twilight Axis which aired alongside this. With all that said, I bid you adieu. us feel something good.Gundam Thunderbolt has always felt human.

We already know that about Io, but we didn\'t know that for Bianca, and it was fun to see them do it and then Io reminiscing about episode 1 of last season where he was in space combat before his suit got sniped. I\'m also glad that episode 7 reinforced this, though after episode 6, that was set in stone about the two and their friendship. A few issues come up though. Well, actually just one. Apparently, Claudia survived getting shot being in the ship that got destroyed and somehow she was reduced by the South Seas Alliance. How? It\'s a dismal plot point and a big issue with the second half of the season, but it\'s not enough to derail my experience with the show.Io is just as cool as ever, especially in his new Atlas Gundam, and it\'s nice to see him really worry about Claudia once she shows up, though I already covered him last time. His chemistry with Bianca is damn fine though. Speaking of, Bianca is officially the best girl in Thunderbolt. Going through a lot of crews and being an awesome jazz aficionado was damn fun to know about her, and overall she’s very fun and full of jabs. Some of my favorite moments of her include her threatening to drop Io by calling him a selfish prick and asking if he wants to take a swim when he complained about her being late as his Mobile Suit’s footstool in episode 8, and her covering her head and apologizing after seeing Cornelius grind his knuckles on Io’s head for messing up his mobile suit and saying that she was guilty of it as well. Speaking of, Cornelius is here and doesn\'t do much but hey, fun to have him and the tissue gag back.Like Io, Daryl is back and we don\'t really need to delve much into him this time, except for one thing. Remember when Karla started going crazy and screaming her head off in episode 4 last season? Well, as a result, she has reverted to her prepubescent stage mentally and thanks to the whole 3 metal fingers resemblance her father had to Daryl, he has to pose as her father while she is in recovery, which is insanely bittersweet. His crew and their interactions are pretty alright as well. We don\'t need to touch up on Claudia either. She’s basically the same except with new people and we already covered that. Including those two soldiers from episode 6, we have a really wonderful and rather human cast. Hell, their dialogue is often great too, especially Bianca’s. I love when a series a built a bit on its old cast while making the new guys just as great, which is surprisingly hard for Gundam sequels to do if Gundam SEED Destiny and 00 Second Season have taught me anything.The mobile suits and new Gundams like the Atlas Gundam, all look damn amazing, and some of the Feddie suits that didn\'t look quite right in season 1 now look perfect here. The stellar action is fun and flashy as always, like when Daryl pulls off a maneuver that involves boosting into his Frizzy Yard cloak and it looks shimmering with the red protective cloak and the blue-ish booster flames, and the battle at Ao Boa Qu in episode 5. Despite the mildest of weird CGI, this probably even tops or at least definitely rivals season 1 for the title of best looking Gundam anime. Hell, the Groovy Duel sequence was pretty well animated, and contrary to some people’s belief, has no reused footage other than Io simultaneously reminiscing on the battle in episode 1. Needless to say, this ONA is as eyegasmic as it was before. It is Gundam Fucking Thunderbolt, after all.Naruyoshi Kikuchi comes back for this season as well, delivering another round of great scores. The elephant in the room is “Pretty Song” for being so upbeat and so different from any kind of music from the series, and it\'s definitely a cute song, no pun intended. Others such as the episode 6 and 7 ED themes I can\'t currently find a name for, as well as “Groovy Duel” which rivals “Thunderbolt for Main Theme” from season 1 in terms of being real blood-pumping jazz. I also like the song ""War of Sara Yoshida"" from episode 8. Now I wish I could find the names for more of these tracks since there amazing and I do like more of the ED themes of this season than those of last season.With magnificent action and equally fun jazz and music, this series more than satisfied the adrenaline-inducing action junkie in me. With brilliant and real dialogue and subtle and true displays of humanity, I could only appreciate this series even more. It more than fulfills its duty as a worthy follow-up to its predecessor, which is unfortunately rare for Gundam sequels. Even if you don\'t agree that this series or even this season is great, at least we can all agree on one thing: it\'s leagues ahead of that piece of shit Twilight Axis which aired alongside this. With all that said, I bid you adieu.', ""Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season ReviewStory (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) GoodThe story for Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season was good, it definitely explained what was going on in the struggles of war far better than it's manga counterpart during the sections that were covered. Although even with that being said the concept of the struggles of war were indeed present you can tell that it was definitely more laid back (at least until the last episode) than season one. This arc slowly but surely introduced the monks and their realization of newtypes but I did feel it did it take a bit...too long to address where all these monks came from and what their plans are even for 4 episodes. One thing Season 1 focus and portrayed were 1) The Struggles of war and what humans are willing to sacrifice to get their way and 2) Rivalry between not only the Zeon and The Earth Federation but Io and Daryl the two main character. This season 2 did still has confrontation between Zeon and the Earth Federation (as it should) but the paths that Io and Daryl have taken did not clash once (as far as I remember) this entire season and if it did and I can't remember (because you know we got one episode a month) it wasn't memorable. Anyway my point is if there's one thing that from a story standpoint that I feel Gundam does better than most anime is the rivalry story and how it plays out between the main character and antagonist, with that missing I can't sit here and say this from a story standpoint is superior or even on the same level as season 1 but it's still good nonetheless.Art and Animation (10/10) OutstandingThis is one thing that Sunrise just can't go wrong with especially when it comes to this series the amount of detail in the art style and animation just looks so outstanding you pray that everything they do Gundam related brings this type of quality to the table, nothing bad in my opinion can be said about this section.Sound (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very GoodThe Sound effects and still very good and distinct but the BGM this time around was hit or miss for me. I feel (especially for the final episode) the whole happy go lucky music vibe that they were going for during grueling and painful scenes of death during battle felt just a tad out of place. I feel they were going for a happy/sadistic vibe of happy music during death scenes but like I said I don't feel it meshed too well although the actual music playing was good I felt it didn't really fit as well as the other BGM. The openings and endings did raise this up for me as all of them are bangersCharacters (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very GoodThe characters that were focus one were very good, not a lot of characterization or development that happened during these four episodes. It doesn't really hurt them as characters but as far as vast and noticeable improvements in comparison to season 1 nothing really is showcased. Now Io does have some what of characterization during the last few minutes of episode 7 and the entire episode 8 as he show how much he truly cares for Claudia, which is something that was borderline unclear in season 1 so credit there is given.Enjoyment (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+My enjoyment was very good for the majority of this season although I do definitely believe this pales in comparison to my enjoyment of season 1. Because like I said for me personally I get a unique high off of the quality rivalry that Gundam also presents in it's stories so when it's not present or not good my enjoyment takes a big hit. (It's probably why I didn't enjoy the MC of Ironblooded Orphan's Mikazuki he lacked a worthy rival). Nonetheless I still enjoyed it just not as much as season 1 and feel the same will be the case if this gets a season 3.Overall (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very GoodMobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season just like Season 1 blows it's manga adaptation out the water and proves that Gundam is far better watched than read, that can't be said about every series. The sound effects in Gundam battles is something that can't be missed and it's so unique. Although I feel this isn't as good as Season 1 this is still a very good season I feel that the pacing of Thunderbolt is going to stay at the pace that it's at if  do get a season 3 which it would behoove them to make one, they can't leave this story like this plus that have enough manga content to adapt it so it's only a matter of time. too long to address where all these monks came from and what their plans are even for 4 episodes.

Spoilers from the second season are rather minor details, so they will not affect your viewing of the show.)The first season of “Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt” is, in my opinion, the defining Gundam entry for this generation. Many Gundam series attempt to convey the message of the brutality of war to its viewers. For an entire franchise centred around the idea of gigantic robots fighting one another, the Gundam series has always had some anti-war undertones amongst its exciting stories. That being said, the first season of “Thunderbolt” was no...exception. It weaved a tale of pain, brutality, and tragedy unprecedented in any Gundam series before it. Not even the dark “Iron-Blooded Orphans,” a recent Gundam series about child soldiers, was close to demonstrating the dark nature of war and conflict like “Thunderbolt” was able to.So how does the second season fare?Thankfully, very well. “Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt Season 2” (which I will call “Thunderbolt 2” for the duration of this review) is another look at the struggles of warfare.Story:In this season, both Io Flemming and Daryl Lorenz, the leads of their respective factions, are given further insight in regards to their lives after their fateful duel. Viewers are given a look as to the aftermath of the horrific events of the first season. Both of our heroes (or villains, depending on your outlook) have to come to terms with their losses incurred. For Io, it is the loss of Claudia, while for Daryl, it is the loss of Karla.Of course, this season isn’t just about these two characters’ losses. Rather, it is the ongoing conflict between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon. I have one complaint this season however, and that would be that there is an imbalance between the stories of both sides unlike the first season. To put it bluntly, the Earth Federation’s side of the story was far more interesting and exciting than that of Zeon. While this isn’t an issue in itself, I would have liked to have more of a balance between the two, as I felt at many times that the second season was more Earth Federation-centric than usual. The first season really gave us a chance to look at Zeon from a more human perspective, and while that still continues in the second season, I felt that it was rather dampened.I won’t go into too much detail, but expect the show to begin introducing themes of religious extremism into the mix.Yes, that’s right. While hints of a religious cult have always been in the shows, viewers are about to see their entry into the series.Animation:“Thunderbolt” has some great animation.The art style has a rugged look to it that fits with the style of the series. In addition, the fight sequences are well-choreographed and look like legitimate fights. Many Gundam series venture into the fantastical when it comes to combat, but the combat in “Thunderbolt” is realistic, brutal, and well-thought out. By the way, if you like GMs and other grunt units, this is going to be like heaven.I'd also like to add that there is a jaw-dropping amount of details in regards to the mechanical aspects of the mobile suits. Take some time to pause every once in a while. You'll notice some insane amounts of detail.Sound:Jazz has been a major component of the musical score in the first season of “Thunderbolt.” This continues in the second season as well. Some might disagree, but the dissonance between upbeat jazz music and the brutality of war depicted on screen is perhaps one of the best things to come out of this series.The voice-acting is great. I’ve never been able to articulate my opinions adequately in regards to voice acting in general, but I will say that the voices behind Io and Bianca are outstanding.Character:For this section, I will be focusing only on Daryl (who I feel has had the worst characterization this season) and Bianca (a newcomer who I felt was a fantastic addition to the series).Daryl Lorenz is my favorite character, but I felt that his story this season was severely underdeveloped. I am aware that strong character development should not be expected in a four episode net series, but this does not hide the fact that he had relatively little growth. Many may disagree, but it is my opinion that Daryl was somewhat inconsequential in this season, which is disappointing given his massive role in the first.While there are many new characters in this entry, the most notable would be Bianca, who is a fellow Earth Federation pilot alongside Io Flemming. Her chemistry with Io Flemming is some of the best I’ve seen. Their combined love of jazz and their impressive piloting skills make them a fun pair to watch on and off the battlefield.The rest of the characters are pretty great as well, but it was Daryl and Bianca that really shaped my score for this category.Enjoyment:This show is a blast to watch. There’s more intrigue and action than you can shake a manipulator at. The gritty and mature plot will certainly appeal to those looking for a darker version of this beloved franchise, while the excellent animation will definitely appeal to those simply wanting some mecha fighting action. exception.

On top of that, they dare to revive Claudia, ruining her death even more leaving a cliff hanger for a third season that never came out (and I hope it never comes out).Bianca\'s introduction was also a shit and a desperate attempt to add something new so that the viewer does not lose interest in this boring anime (which happened anyway).Art and sound (7/10):I don\'t give a damn about the animation if the plot is shit so don\'t cry at me saying that the animation is good and that\'s why my rating of this anime is wrong.Overall (2/10) because as i say i don\'t care about the good animation if the plot is shit. damn about.

A bold-faced insult to the glorious first season it succeeded which sucks it dry of the energy it once had in favor of hollow pandering and incomplete, shallow storytelling.Let\'s start with the very basic premise of this season, more specifically how it\'s broken from the very foundation. What defined the first season of Thunderbolt was the intense, morally gray rivalry between its two leads and the squads they represent. The show gave you time to truly get to know both Io and Daryl, grow attached to them and...know their understandable reasons for fighting. This, in turn. made it all the more weighty when the two sides clashed, perpetuating their self-destructive cycle of vengeance over an ultimately-worthless sector of space in a fashion which is both exciting and tragic.It\'s here where Thunderbolt Season 2 utterly fails. Being set after the One Year War, the fundamental conflict which defined Season 1\'s themes and characters is gone, and with it goes everything which made the story interesting. In its place, we now have the South Seas Alliance, an entirely new faction whose defining traits are ""is evil"" and ""is vaguely cult-like"", made up entirely of faceless minions with no definable character traits or motivations of their own.Consequently, every battle in this season is absurdly boring, the character motivations and emotional intensity of the first season traded out for brainless, plotless schlock where no meaningful character writing or investment can be found.Now in response to this, some of you might say that a big part of what makes Thunderbolt good is that it\'s cool action spectacle which you can turn your brain off to, so the fact that the writing has went to shit shouldn\'t be a huge impediment to one\'s enjoyment. I\'m sorry to say, however, that the action and spectacle in this season are also rather lacking.Now, to be clear, the show isn\'t exactly bad looking. The art style is still on point, the Mobile Suit designs are great, and the animation is a bit above your average seasonal trash, but it\'s still a major step down from Season 1. Moving the setting from space to Earth did a number on its action choreography, which now feels so much more sluggish and watered-down compared to the infinite creativity of the first season. The storyboarding rarely feels very striking or impactful outside of a few memorable scenes in the first episode, and the new color palette means that so very few of the visuals truly pop like they should.This isn\'t helped by the fact that it just *drags*. Each episode is a few minutes longer than in Season 1, and while that might not sound that bad on paper, in practice it means that the season is collectively over 20 minutes longer than the first one, yet not nearly as much happens in it. Fights are drawn out longer than they should be and the plot tying it together is too thin to justify the extra time given to it.The collective result of all this is that the entire season just feels so stale. watching through it all feels like it actively drains one\'s energy simply because it\'s so much more of a time sink next to Season 1 without nearly as much to get invested in. And coming out the other side it just feels like you\'ve actively wasted your time.In many ways, this season feels more like a crude parody of Thunderbolt\'s first season than a true follow up. A work which sets out to be a vague facsimile of the action fest it looks like on the surface while failing to understand the human core which made it work. It\'s a truly soulless *product* rather than a *story*, and I can\'t in good faith recommend such a thing to anyone who truly enjoys Thunderbolt. know their understandable reasons for fighting.

Too preface this, I am writing this almost purely out of contempt for Ren0001\'s review, as I literally could not disagree more strongly.

How you can look at this and not even begin to understand that the whole show is about something more than just two charterers fighting each other is beyond me!This season was amazing from beginning to the end. From the musical scoring, action, to even the seemingly minor actions each unnamed character committed out of emotion grief or just out of character eccentricity/personality.

Not Ironblooded Orphans, not ZZ, not any generic anime, but something like this with real messages beyond just action scenes. I could not rate this highly enough, and as such I enthusiastically give this a 10/10.

Unlike the first season which had a strong focus on war and its effects on people, the second season relies heavily on the viewer knowing about the Universal Century and important events in it.The show has many unanswered questions for people unfamiliar with UC such as:How did they rescue Io?What is the Battle of A Baoa Qu?What are Zeon Remnants?What...is the state of the war?What are Newtypes?These are all things you have to be familiar with beforehand which the show does little to no explanation.And even if you did know all of that, the story is very simple and not really that interesting. It actually feels like more of an introduction to the new setting of Thunderbolt than a complete story.Art - 8Another thing which is very subjective based on whether you're familiar with the Universal Century is the art. Sure you can say: if it's a robot and it looks cool then the art is good. But there's actually more to the design of these machines than you may realize. The main focus of this show in particular is aquatic mobile suits and it takes models from the original series and redesigns them to have more aquatic features. And although you may think: who cares? You have to realize that gundam is more than just a show, it's also basically a huge advertisement for their line of plastic model figures, and if they make the designs well enough, people will be interested in buying them so it's very important to make interesting designs which people want to buy.Animation wise it's almost as good as the first season. The fight scenes are really fluid and there aren't really any badly animated scenes considering how short this series is. The setting however is very much different and I feel it takes away from the appeal that the original series had where the setting played a huge role in the art, this one doesn't utilize it as much.Sound - 9Soundtrack is as good as the first season. If you enjoyed the style of music in the first season, typically jazz and blues, then you'll definitely enjoy the music here as well.Character - 7They introduce a few new characters which I really liked how they designed and introduced them. In terms of development of old characters, there's not much simply because of how short the show is but obviously it's also because they assume you've watched the first season before watching the second, there's no point reintroducing characters within such a short time frame.As I've said, this really feels like an introduction to the new setting of the Thunderbolt Series rather than a full story. There are a few new interesting characters but don't expect that they'll do anything dramatic or too exciting.Enjoyment - 9Your enjoyment of this show is entirely based on how much you like mecha or gundam. If you're watching this without any knowledge of gundam or the Universal Century, you have to keep in mind that there are a lot of things they don't explain which are important to the story so you're basically watching it for the sake of seeing giant robots fighting and nothing else.Overall - 8Even with a mediocre story, the art, sound and overall enjoyment of seeing giant robots fighting makes this series a really enjoyable watch. It's probably one of the best animated gundam series if nothing else. is the state of the war?What are Newtypes?These are all things you have to be familiar with beforehand which the show does little to no explanation.And even if you did know all of that, the story is very simple and not really that interesting.

I just wish there was more of...a specific story to tell about this series, they even made two side compilation movies about this, which i am definitely not going to watch. a specific story to tell about this series, they even made two side compilation movies about this, which i am definitely not going to watch.']"
Inferno Cop,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16774/Inferno_Cop,"[""Inferno Cop comes to us from Studio Trigger, the studio Mr. Gurren Lagann Imaishi set up after he got sick of things at Gainax. This is the first anime they've put out, simply as Youtube releases. My guess is this is one of those small projects a company does so they can get used to the creation process. Lots of companies do this. Release small product where success doesn't matter at all. It's just a learning process so they know how to structure the creation process internally. But, given that this comes from those crazy ex-Gainax guys, what they produced turned out to be inspired....The gist of Inferno Cop is that it’s a hilariously awful exaggeration of manly 2000 AD-esque cyberpunk cop bullshit, where the lead character is some hard-nosed brutal arm of the law in the same vein of Judge Dredd or Robocop. Inferno Cop is taking a step back from these cyberpunk police shows and realising how silly they really are. Inferno Cop drives a flaming police car. That’s totally the kind of thing you’d see in those kinds of shows, but placed in the Inferno Cop setting is where you realise how dumb it really is.Inferno Cop is entertainment satire in the same vein as Daily Lives of Highschool Boys or Detroit Metal City. It destruction of an entire genre is glorious to behold, and startling considering its complete lack of budget. It's achievements are even better when you compare it to the utter failure of every other short show from 2013.

For those of you who don\'t know what that show is, it is a one episode anime that was absolutely appalling in all aspects. But there\'s one little thing...you can\'t compare Mars of Destruction to this. Mars of Destruction failed to be what it wanted to be and Inferno Cop succeeded at what it wanted to be. It is a funny, show with a bizarre sense of dark humour wrapped up neatly in 3 minutes.Inferno Cop isn\'t meant to be clever nor witty. It doesn\'t have...anything meaningful to say. It is just a comedy taking the piss out of stories set in some crime ridden city involving some dark, brooding vigilante\'s fight for justice topped with a sprinkle of badassery. It takes the cheesy dialogue out of those and brings it to a new low by making it even more stupid. Just listen to the opening narration; you\'ll get the idea. If you want a clearer picture, it reminds me of something OneyNG would come up with (but significantly less vulgar).The animation is \'bad\'. I think given the content of the show, they decided not to make it too flashy. The characters don\'t really \'move\' much. Since I don\'t know much about animation, I don\'t know what to call it, but it just looks like still images of a characters moving about; no arms, legs head or anything moving at all. The art deviates from the norm as well. I think all of this was a good move itself because it  compliments the jokes and the type of humour.As for my enjoyment, I bloody enjoyed it for what it is. I have not laughed so much at anything for a long, long time. I was even laughing in the shower up until late at night while I was attempting to write my essay.I know only 2 episodes are out now, and I\'m sorry to those who dislike people reviewing incomplete anime.

It\'s something that far exceeds my intellect to comprehend. This is maximum autism.To make more sense, I\'d have to copy our Lord Foggle\'s review on Mars of Destruction here while purely agreeing with each of the sentences and have no satirical intentions afterwards, and for me to come close to deducing what Inferno Cop is, I\'d have to be born as Einstein in all my seven lives....The great Stephen Hawking once said, ""Perfection simply doesn\'t exist... without imperfection, nor you or me would exist.""Rumor has it that he was forced to eat his own words once he saw Inferno Cop.And when life gives you lemons, just throw that lemon away and watch Inferno Cop.

Well, guess what?  They\'re all pulling your leg.  As it turns out, this anime is nothing more than an ugly, poorly-constructed web series with almost no redeeming value.  Here\'s why:Story: 1Three minutes per episode isn\'t a whole lot of time to develop a story.  Almost every episode is either a letdown or a ripoff.  Among the things ripped off in this show are ""Return of the Jedi,"" ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" and of course...""Ghost Rider.""  Creativity and thoughtfulness are low.Art: 1The animation is far from good.  In fact, it isn\'t really animation.  It\'s just a puppet show using characters that look like they were cut out of comic books.  You can tell it\'s not animated because the characters\' faces never move, they don\'t move like animated characters should, and they explode when they die.Sound: 4All of the characters sound like they were voiced by the same person.  Most of the sound effects were explosions and the music was hard to hear past the speaking.  Apart from some cheesy lines of dialogue, there was barely anything good about the sound.Character: 3Several characters get killed off in the anime.  The only characters with any real relevance are Inferno Cop, Mecha Cop, Mister Judge, Real God, and Hellfire Boy.  The only character with any real development is Inferno Cop.Enjoyment: 4This really depends on who you are.  If you\'re into nonsense, cops, and explosions, it might appeal to you.  If you\'re more skeptical and want to see something decent, then this might not be what you\'re looking for.Overall: 2In all, this anime is not the \'masterpiece\' that it\'s being made out to be.  The animation isn\'t really animation, each episode is mostly \'one part dialogue, one part explosions,\'  and the whole thing felt like a collaborative project between Marvel Comics, IPC Media, and Michael Bay.

He follows in Yamamoto Yutaka\'s footsteps as he tries to breath new life into the medium, or ""save anime"".Story - 10Inferno Cop has a deep, though provoking narrative.  Beneath what may at first appear to be a shallow action comedy, resembling something one might find airing on Adult Swim, there is actually an interesting underlying social commentary.  This show examines such topics as the criminal jusitce system, the medical care system, and religion.  It manages to do all of this in 3-minute...episodes.Art - 10At first glance the art may seem cheap, and the animation shoddy, but there is more to it than that.  The series has a distinct visual style like nothing else out there that fits the series perfectly.  It is also a subtle critique of the studios that are killing the industry, like Kyoto Animation, who rely on flashy animation to sell their shows.Sound - 10The voice work is top-notch.  The cast fit their characters perfectly and deliver moving performances.   The brilliant sound track fits the series perfectly and is always used appropriately.  There is also a beautiful ending sung in near-perfect German.Characters - 10The show mainly focuses on Inferno Cop, who it goes without saying is a fantastic character, but there is also an outstanding supporting cast.  There are even some excellent tragic characters that brought me to tears.Enjoyment - 10Not only is Inferno Cop such a deep, moving show, but it is also incredibly enjoyable.  The exhilarating action, and high brow comedy make the show fun to watch, too.  Unlike other attempts at DEEP anime, Trigger didn\'t forget to also make the show watchable.Overall - 10Why are you reading this instead of watching Inferno Cop?

Rather than spoofing a single genre, Trigger decides to spoof a wide variety of media from Shonen to Robocop, from Marvel comics to Evangelion! This is easily the best comedy Studio Trigger has made to date!I would like to apologize to Hiroyuki Imaishi for all the times I've spoken ill of his work! Normally I find his style of spoof to be extremely tedious, unfunny, and trying to convince people it is a masterful deconstruction when it isn't any more clever than a Setzer and Friedberg...movie.Inferno Cop took EVERYTHING that I had a problem with in his spoofs, and corrected it!It is fast, funny, and mercilessly spoofs a wide range of media without ever pretending to be more clever than it is. My favorite is the Eva episode. Imaishi spent years of his life working on the numerous Eva series, reboots, and side movies for Gainax and it takes a big man to be able to laugh at himself and make fun of his own work. Please accept my apology from the bottom of my heart. I bow down to you Mr. Imaishi, you insane, glorious bastard! movie.Inferno Cop took EVERYTHING that I had a problem with in his spoofs, and corrected it!It is fast, funny, and mercilessly spoofs a wide range of media without ever pretending to be more clever than it is.

I bow down to you Mr. Imaishi, you insane, glorious bastard!"", ""When making an anime, one would like every studio has high dreams, hopes for whatever they're making becomes something worth remembering for many years, something that will stay with their viewers, hopefully change their life, even if it's a little bit, for the better and become an epic tale grandparents will tell their children. Sadly, you rarely find anime that's even worth remembering, and most series are made just with the goal of milking some money, without thinking in the true art an anime can have behind. Inferno Cop is not the case. This is a series that went outside of every cliché to create...a true piece of art in every sense, a story full of feelings, action and heavy philosophical themes while studying the psyche of probably the most complex character in any medium. Inferno Cop is the unquestionable leader, the best thing ever created, something that years from now will be talked like the biggest invention, even over things like the wheel, the lightbulb or the internet.Inferno Cop is a series that inculcates values of justices and relentlessness like any other thing in existance, it should be what every human, alien and whatever use as a guide, Inferno Cop is the real messiah of this world, the one everyone should follow without asking question. Inferno Cop is the answer to all our questions.But the series goes beyond that, it analyzes what goes through the mind of Inferno Cop while living in a very harsh world full of terryfing demons and babies that threaten the world. Inferno Cop values every life, and through each episode we see him struggling to create real justice, not just a superficial one, he thinks about justice and looks for an answer that can help everyone, for real justice is meant to be for everyone, and not just a few. Real justice has no enemies, but there are poor sheeps that haven't been enlightened.While being tempted by nihilism thoughts, Inferno Cop's will and trust in the world never falters, and he always has friends like Hellfire Boy, he will keep being the hero the people didn't ask, but need. He knows hell very well, and won't let the world become one by the hand of the evil organization Southern Cross, and won't let himself be defeated by the imposing Mecha Cop (and his Sega Saturn CPU). A beautiful rivalry is born here, and the already epic tale becomes just something else, dwelving in the difficulties of having different opinion, but in the end, everyone is always looking for what they think it's best.Inferno Cop comes from the depth of hell and isn't looking for glory, his solidarity is unprecedented, he just want the world to be a better place, he wants you, your family and friends to be happy even at the cost of his, and he doesn't even ask for a 'thank you'.The series analyzes Plato's Theory of Forms, and one-ups Plato by introducing the hell world, a world were everything is the antithesis of their ideal state, the world humanity may one day selfdestruct itself into. Inferno Cop comes from this world, he's the last hope of everyone, he's comes to our sensible world not only to save us from the hell world, but to help us reach the intelligible realm, the only way to achieve true happiness and justice for everyone. And he just might make it, because he's Inferno Cop, he's our hero, he's a superior being with an unbending will and love for every living being. He's what this world needs, and what Trigger somehow managed to make real, while using an OST that might just bring a full pack of emotons from everyone who listens, and an animation full of realism, fluidity and beautiful art.The series even manages to go into the science world, making an abstract portrayal of combustion, creating an exothermic redox chemical reaction between Inferno Cop's justice (fuel) and will (oxidant), creating the flames that sorround this magnificent character. Not only that, the amazing fight, while never failing to disappoint, it also teaches classic and quantum mechanics, because they just have that level of detail with every shot fired. They say he can control time, and with Laplace transforms, change it into complex frequencies. That is the level we're talking about.Everyone should always follow Inferno Cop's example, and while it might be impossible for mere mortals to become like him, Inferno Cop teaches us that we must always aim as high as possible, so that even if we can't reach said goal, at least we will know we got as high as possible, that we did our best and probably contributed our grain of salt to the world. At the very least, we should always be thankful about Inferno Cop, because even if we can't see him (well, until Trigger released this anime, that is), he's there helping us, and he came from the depths of hell, which means he climbed much more than any of us to get to where he is. Inferno Cop is the biggest legend of this world, which makes this series, undoubtely the best thing in this world.Review originally made for my top 100, which you can access here: http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=767350 a true piece of art in every sense, a story full of feelings, action and heavy philosophical themes while studying the psyche of probably the most complex character in any medium.

I base it off of how much fun I had watching it. So, put it on a scale of 1 to 10, I have to pick 10 because ""roller coaster"" isn\'t an option.Inferno Cop was produced by the now critically acclaimed Trigger, and it certainly shows and fits along their other works. What you\'re not going to get here is a deep story, thousands of hours of people slaving over frames of animation or the best sounding show to date....What you will get, though, is a piece of work which shines through with spontaneous moments of hilarity and a loosely put together story, not like that\'s what\'s going to be holding your attention.This show is fast, and I mean really, really fast. It doesn\'t take a moment to breathe, and because of it\'s quick and jabby humor, you too won\'t have time to breathe. Throughout the entirety of the show, I was laughing to the point of tears, and even on the second watch through (which happened on a bus ride with a few buddies), I still caught myself laughing so, so much.I can\'t describe much of the show, or I\'ll just spoil it. It\'s super short, and so is this review. My advice is just to watch the first couple of episodes, and if you enjoy that, finish it.

Otherwise, turn around now and leave, because Inferno Cop will just chase you down and turn you into a very sorry person if you don\'t get your lead now.', 'Inferno Cop is one of those parodies that you can just love- StoryIt was just funny nonsense about an ""inferno""cop, in the first episode it seemed like some dumb nonsense, but the more you watched, the funnier the nonsense becomes.I actually take suspicion these creators were using drugs while creating the story, it is pure nonsense, no cliches *bout time*, funny jokes, and funny side characters, this was pure funArt-Now, there is nothing to say about the art, it is simple, and it is perfect for a parody, it\'s just some simple drawn characters, backgrounds, and some simple moving, not even a walk animation, but,...as this is a parody, the animation makes it even funnier, if this wasn\'t a parody, this wouldn\'t even deserve a single point.Sound-Well, the voice actors were perfectly suited i can say. The MC has a funny voice actor, n so do some side characters, there is nothing much to say about that, since it is mostly about characters, so it was all good.Characters-Well, as i said, funny, and the MC was just pure genius, there were like 3 or 2 companions with the MC through the story with him. Since the anime is too short *or parody we can say* I just suggest you see this for yourself, pure joy i say.Enjoyment-I didn\'t regret any second, the first episode would seem like a bad parody, but after that, the nonsense intensifies, and you kinda start loving it, so fun 12 episodes of pure nonsense.10/10-Wuf as this is a parody, the animation makes it even funnier, if this wasn\'t a parody, this wouldn\'t even deserve a single point.Sound-Well, the voice actors were perfectly suited i can say.

The anime viewer in me found it to be a downright hilarious watch, while the critic in me found this to be a mediocre production from a relative new production company. Inferno Cop is brought to us by the production company Trigger in their first production to hit the anime market. To be honest, I can\'t rip Trigger that much since most production companies first works are never that good. I guess the good news for Trigger is, they never even tried to...be good with Inferno Cop.Inferno Cop is a three-minute anime series that uses still framed characters with linear backgrounds. There is no ""animation"" in the sense that there are multiple frames in a constant flow, but rather the still frame animations are moved manually within the scenes. It\'s about the equivalent of cutting out shapes, pasting them to Popsicle sticks and moving them around in the scene. The best way to describe it is ""cheap."" You can tell the animation budget was extremely low for this series and perhaps that was the intention. The producers of this series intended to make an incredibly goofy, slapstick humor comedy that you can get a laugh at with how cheaply it\'s made.So what\'s Inferno Cop about? Well...it\'s premise is a little insane. It\'s essentially about a cop from the bowels of hell that serves justice in a city known as Jack Knife Edge Town. His mission is to take out an organized crime syndicate known as Southern Cross. There is a revenge scheme as Southern Cross killed Inferno Cop\'s family and Inferno Cop sells his soul to hell for the power to take down the syndicate. However, don\'t expect that narrative to hold true, since the story takes odd twists and turns and becomes more about the strange situations Inferno Cop falls into. The plot is relatively similar to Ghost Rider, although that is just one thing I\'ll mention about this series.The strength of this series was in its humor, especially with the inclusion of pop culture references, anime and non-anime a like. There are subtle stabs at anime, video games, and movies...some include the aforementioned Ghost Rider, Star Wars, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Dr. Who. I could go on-and-on about the pop culture references, but I found it hilarious at the brilliance at how they were used. I found the overall scriptwriting was extremely funny and while I found the seiyuu work to be flawed, I have to give them credit for staying in-character with it\'s insanely written script.The biggest weakness with Inferno Cop is essentially skin deep. There was minimal effort put into this series from a production standpoint. The animation is the cheapest I\'ve ever seen in an anime, the voice acting sounded like it was done by a couple guys in their basement...much like Girl-chan In Paradise for those that watch flash animation cartoons, and the music was cheaply produced and lacked variety.Overall, Inferno Cop is a pretty simple anime to define. It\'s a series that\'s made to get a cheap laugh...and if nothing else, it\'s a nice series to watch if you\'ve got about 5 minutes to kill. While I know I criticized its animation and overall production, the thing is I felt that it in a sense helped with it\'s dumb, watered down brand of comedy. Part of the laughs with Inferno Cop does come from how cheaply it\'s produced. This is a series where if you really like the cheap comedies you can watch on Adult Swim, then I\'d highly recommend this series. I\'d compare it to something like Robot Chicken except it has more of an on-going narrative rather than sketch comedy. It is honestly one of the better anime shorts I\'ve ever watched, if nothing else. At least I got a laugh out of it, that\'s more than I can say for something like Chitose Get You! If you\'re looking for an anime short with an amazing narrative, I wouldn\'t recommend Inferno Cop, but if you\'re looking for a cheap laugh without taking up most of your time, than Inferno Cop is the way to go and I wouldn\'t be surprised if you found yourself shouting ""Inferno Cop"" in Engrish throughout the series. be good with Inferno Cop.Inferno Cop is a three-minute anime series that uses still framed characters with linear backgrounds.

The art isn\'t anything special, primarily low budget still shots, but the writing is top notch. You will ask yourself at least once per minute ""what the f**k am I watching?"".  And then you\'ll watch the next episode. The end of the series is one of the most catastrophic and totally random that I\'ve ever seen, in any form of media.

It took all the potential that the premisse had and used it to the maximum. It\'s amazingly executed, with legendary fights to get you on the edge of your seat...and heat up your blood. Heart wrenching moments WILL make you cry, the emotional impact this series has on you is insane, and it\'s bigger than any I\'ve seen. Angel Beats? Clannad? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso? What\'s that compared to the MASTERPIECE that is Inferno Cop? The mysteries are great and very thought provoking, it leaves you very confused, only to explain it all and blow your mind in the end. You like plot twists? Inferno Cop has plenty of insane plot twists. Not to mention the comedy, which is guaranteed to make you roll over the floor laughing.Art: 10/10The art for Inferno Cop has no competition. Imagine if KyoAni, Comix, and Ufotable worked together. Now multiply it by 100. That\'s the beauty of Inferno Cop. It\'s simply breathtaking and will give you orgasms. Every frame is screenshot worthy, and could be used as your wallpaper. It\'s like if they had the budget for a KyoAni and a Comix movie combined, for every frame. Not to mention the animation is insanely fluid, every scene feels like a Sakuga.Sound: 10/10This is the best soundtrack I\'ve ever heard or will hear. The songs used in the emotional scenes are more beautiful than Clannad\'s, and will cause a heavy impact. You can\'t escape from the tears even if you just hear the song itself on Youtube. The action scenes, with and OST more epic than Shingeki no Kyojin\'s,  will make you get pumped on levels that you didn\'t even think were possible. The soundtrack in the Slice of Life scenes will put a huge grin on your face, without a doubt. Not to mention the variety, having over 100 songs in it\'s OST, Inferno Cop will always present you a new song, making it feel even less repetitive, which it already didn\'t, since every scene is a new experience.Characters: 10/10The characters in Inferno Cop are the most realistic, human characters I\'ve ever seen. They feel like they\'re really alive. Their development is incredible, and insanely well done. They\'re all extremely likable characters, and I guarantee your top 10 characters will be all Inferno Cop characters after you watch this.Enjoyment: 10/10With it\'s breath taking visuals, and beautiful soundtrack, Inferno Cop absorbs the viewer into it\'s world. It feels like you\'re there, adventuring yourself with the characters. Time passes by and you don\'t even notice, when the show is over, it will feel like you\'ve only seen 5 minutes. This anime is amazing, and the most enjoyable I\'ve ever seen.Overall: 10/10Inferno Cop is simply perfect. In all aspects. Nothing comes close to it. It\'s a masterpiece, and definitely the best anime ever made. Trigger saves anime once again. Your favorite anime will seem like shit when you watch Inferno Cop. You\'ll say to every single anime you\'ve liked before: ""How did I like this?"".

It is essential in this society that we not only have a norm but that we conform to the norm. Differences weaken us! Variations destroy us!” – From the Twilight Zone episode “The Eye of the Beholder”By and large, the presence of originality has been eroding away from the world’s forms of entertainment for a while now. The cinema industry has propelled itself a shade above mediocricy thanks to a seemingly neverending stream of re-makes, basically transforming nostalgia into mountains of cash. The NFL’s motto has currently been “this is the way we’ve...always done things now shut up and deal with it”. Anime, in particular, is suffering from a years-long endeavor into the tried-and-true. What was once a medium of constant innovation and unabashed quirkiness has now denigrated into a dystopian system of moeblobs and tsunderes, of boobfalls and deus ex machinas, of overpowered angst androids and their legion of clueless harem chicks.It is in this industry that Inferno Cop steamrolls through, shattering the mindless tedium that anime has become with a fiery passion for all that is pure and righteous in what we watch. This OVA’s backstory is a famous one; Hiroyuki Imaishi, who first flirted with fame thanks to the great Gurren Lagann, left Gainax to create Studio Trigger in 2012 and Inferno Cop was the first work that Imaishi directed with Trigger. As many have stated before, Inferno Cop saved anime from the repetitive nonsense it had devolved into; it also obliterated any rational standard I have for anime in general, like how I think of character animation. How can I describe it? Imagine that you’re a little boy and you want more action figures but your parents don’t have enough cash for them right away. What do you do? You draw what you think resembles some cool action figures. You cut them out and, well, you move these flimsy scraps of paper around and talk for them, just like you would with your toys. That’s what Inferno Cop’s characters look like; they don’t move with their arms, legs, feet, etc. but instead are shifted diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. In other words, Inferno Cop’s character designs are terrible but the series lampoons its stylistic flaws often enough that it becomes an integral part of the title. That’s just the kind of anime this is.Throughout the duration of this medium’s existence, there have been quite a few mentally unhinged characters to grace anime (eccentrics like Steins Gate’s Rintarou Okabe and Hisoka of Hunter X Hunter fame come to mind), and then there are the guys occupying this show’s cast, particularly the titular character. Inferno Cop is a delusional maniac who, believing his quest is a righteous one, murders a baby, devours his friend’s remains, and destroys the Earth in the course of 13 episodes, and all of this is convincingly portrayed thanks to the colossal efforts of Junichi Goto, who simply oozes the absurd overacting that this role requires. As is wont to occur in one-man shows like this, the rest of Inferno Cop’s cast doesn’t do much of anything, Mecha Cop and Hellfire Boy simply exist to assist the protagonist; the only somewhat noteworthy members of the supporting cast are April O’Neill from TMNT, the corrupt cop in episode 1, and of course God. “Wait, why is God there?” you might ask. The simple answer: don’t expect Inferno Cop to make sense.Like anything and everything else that is deprived of logic, Inferno Cop is a controversial concoction of pummeled potential. On the one hand, you must commend this series for, along with its unique character designs, convincingly displaying and/or developing an array of topics like the justice system, pregnancy, the passion of competitive sports, time travel, and the apocalypse all in a mere 13 episodes, with 2 minutes per episode. On the other hand, a series that squanders its runtime on an expansive spectrum of ideas instead of simply starting and finishing its story deserves some measure of criticism. What was mentioned about our titular character early on is that he suffered an irrevocable, life-altering tragedy long ago at the hands of Southern Cross and he is apparently wandering from town to town for revenge. However, what would’ve been a solid plot element instead nosedived into oblivion, to put it lightly, as Southern Cross devolves into an increasingly irrelevant presence throughout the series until it is dragged from the pit of nothingness to protect the Earth from Inferno Cop (It’s as stupid as it sounds; trust me). More than anything else, what really puzzles me about Inferno Cop is how the show never bothers explaining how the hero received his powers. I mean, you don’t just roll out of bed with a head swathed in flames, do you?Perhaps expecting a reasonably compact plot is utterly extraneous for a show that attempts coming across as a particularly off-the-wall comedy. Even then, I don’t regard Inferno Cop as a whole as consistently amusing; the success of this series’ irreverent brand of humor is mercurial to say the least in that occasionally Inferno Cop is flat-out hilarious (episode 2’s bullet scene is an obvious moment) but more often that not it’s uninspiring. Many have ventured to praise Inferno Cop not as a comedy but as a glorious satire of the superhero genre, presumably to compensate for Inferno Cop not being funny after a while. Satire is a genre that presents a comically exaggerated viewpoint on a topic which highlights, explicitly or implicitly, what needs to be changed in our society. If you wish to an anime that does justice to the field of satire, Paranoia Agent is for you because, as far as I’m concerned, Inferno Cop isn’t satire. I don’t know what this is.Even Inferno Cop’s soundtrack isn’t all that impressive; in fact, excluding the earworm that is “Die Hollen Porizei”, it’s barely worth mentioning. Regardless, Inferno Cop overall is worth watching because it is purposefully left-field while anime today stick to the right; it is unique not in its material but in how it is delivered, not in substance but in style. Ultimately, Inferno Cop is the definitive “turn-your-brain-off” flick, an OVA you can enjoy as long as you’re not anticipating anything deep and meaningful.Ghost Rider forever, baby! always done things now shut up and deal with it”. Anime, in particular, is suffering from a years-long endeavor into the tried-and-true.

If you wish to an anime that does justice to the field of satire, Paranoia Agent is for you because, as far as I’m concerned, Inferno Cop isn’t satire. I don’t know what this is.Even Inferno Cop’s soundtrack isn’t all that impressive; in fact, excluding the earworm that is “Die Hollen Porizei”, it’s barely worth mentioning. Regardless, Inferno Cop overall is worth watching because it is purposefully left-field while anime today stick to the right; it is unique not in its material but in how it is delivered, not in substance but in style. Ultimately, Inferno Cop is the definitive “turn-your-brain-off” flick, an OVA you can enjoy as long as you’re not anticipating anything deep and meaningful.Ghost Rider forever, baby!', ""I was hoping to write a well thought, balanced, and fair review of Inferno Cop after taking what I expected be a rather average show, I was proven wrong after finishing it in a day. Inferno Cop is one of those rare shows that really redefines the medium as whole such Akira and Neon Genosis Avangelion. Inferno Cop is an anime and that is an indisputable fact.How does Inferno Cop achieve this? Simple, simplicity. Inferno Cop doesn't feel like its better or smarter than the audience but I feel that it thinks that its smarter since it uses the old storytelling technique of telling not...showing and executes with precision and logic (tough there isn't much of that in other areas). Inferno Cop seamlessly introduces characters and concepts with skill allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the rich and vibrant world of Inferno Cop and its characters.Speaking of characters, Inferno cop has a good assortment of them from: Supemerman disguised as a baby, pregnant woman, Inferno Cop's aunt, Mecha Cop, Hellfire boy, and so much more; each of these characters have rich, deep, and meaningful development and character arcs over the course of the series. Each character is unique in there own way especially Inferno Cop himself.However the voices that accompany the cast of amazing characters is truly amazing. Inferno Cop is an anime that could convince even a dub junkie such as myself to indulge in splendor of japanese voice. The men and women in Inferno Cop all sound the same making every character feel familiar but are different enough that you could tell them apart. You can really hear the emotion of dialogue. The series OP takes a queue from western media with a minimalistic intro other than the longer ones of its contemporaries however the ED is one for the ears to enjoy and sing along with for the next episode. Soundtrack truly does make one question their own ears.Furthermore te artwork accompanying the Soundtrack and Voices of Inferno Cop is a sight to behold. Articulation, the bending of joints, is one of the most over used troupes in all of animation (not just anime); Inferno Cop does away with this over used animation technique and opts instead to use still PNG-like images of characters set against a series of semi-realistic photo backgrounds, obviously using real images in the latter half of the series. The fights scenes truly were the highlight of Inferno Cop giving studios like: Ufotable, Bones, and Madhouse a run for their money. Every frame of Inferno Cop is a true Test for the eyes.I did not enjoy Inferno Cop, I withstood it. I stand on place where many men have ventured and came out a changed person. Inferno Cop is truly a contender for one of the greatest anime of all time. No aspect of it is lacking in any degree. Glitter on Inferno Cop, glitter on. showing and executes with precision and logic (tough there isn't much of that in other areas).

Glitter on Inferno Cop, glitter on."", '(Don LaFontaine voice)“In a world rife with kid heroes receiving convenient powers out of nowhere…a world overrun with moeblobs and shallow archetypes for characters…a world ravaged by light novels more concerned with otaku references than telling a good story…one man will rise to dispense his brand of ironclad justice.”(Insert fiery whoosh sound effect)(start playing Die Hollen Polizei)“From the studio that brought you Little Witch Academia comes an anime that kicks tiresome clichés to the curb. A dramatic tale of good versus evil unlike any you’ve ever seen, set in the United States of Japan.”...(insert stock explosion sound effect)“Inferno Cop! Now available at your local Crunchyroll distributor. Rated R.”(Cut out music)(normal voice)Alright, given the nature of Inferno Cop, I felt compelled to start off on a silly note, since most of the other reviews here clearly aren’t taking themselves seriously, which makes sense, given that Inferno Cop is impossible to take seriously.If you couldn’t tell from my text-only trailer, Inferno Cop is a comedy from Studio Trigger. Not too long ago, I reviewed another project of theirs, Little Witch Academia. LWA was made on a large budget. Inferno Cop is the polar opposite.This series sports less animation than most Flash cartoons on Newgrounds. The Astro Boy anime of the 1960s has more motion than this. Not only that, the backgrounds all look like they were ripped out of old visual novels, none of the speech is lip-synched, several character models are re-used, and none of the episodes are particularly long. This actually works in Inferno Cop’s favor. The comedic timing it employs simply would not work with detailed animation, as drawing articulations of movement would slow it down too much. In other words, this anime is a lean, mean, fighting machine! It has no time for padding! It has no time for lengthy expositions! And it can do jokes most other works of animation can’t. Even if it looks more like a comic book than a proper anime, Inferno Cop takes full advantage of the “less is more” mentality. I’d also like to add that while the visuals are minimalistic, it’s not the worst ever. I like the flame effects, and some of the character designs are well done. No one looks like a typical anime character, but rather, that of American comic books. Whether or not you’ll like that is for you to decide. I personally don’t mind.Though the budget doesn’t just limit the artwork, oh no. The voice cast is limited too. What do I mean? All of the female characters are done by male actors speaking in falsetto. Not to mention that a good portion of the voice acting is overly hammy. And that many different characters are obviously voiced by the same actor. Given that everything else is already made with the absolute minimum of resources, it fits. I will say the actor for Inferno Cop does some impressive shouting at times.As for the series itself? It’s about Inferno Cop, a man coming back from Hell to avenge the death of his family at the hands of an evil criminal organization. That’s it. A premised so simplistic, so overdone, that you just roll with it to see how absurd it gets, and boy, does it get absurd. This show makes a mockery of many different things, not just anime clichés, but many things in general. It feels like something that, were it made in America, would air either on Adult Swim or Animation Domination High-Def. Being an ONA, the episodes are very short, and the whole series can be marathoned in under one hour. This would be a perfect thing to show at a late night party with friends.For all of that said, I do want to emphasize one thing; Inferno Cop is not dumb. Yes, it’s low brow, and feels like the makers made everything up as they went along, but it’s not asinine. You do not need to “turn your brain off” to enjoy it. Part of the fun is trying to make sense of all the weird shit that happens in Inferno Cop, which was hard for me to do, because I was laughing too much to do so. While I wouldn’t quite call it a masterpiece, (Gintama is, on average, even funnier) Inferno Cop was a good way to kill forty-five minutes of my time, and easily the best Japanese ONA I’ve seen thus far.One last thing: the majority of the budget clearly went into the soundtrack, including the main theme, a rock song sung in German with very thick Japanese accents. According to a quick fact check, the lyrics, while composed of real German words, make no sense. It only serves to make Inferno Cop even more-no, not awesome, I need a bigger word to describe it…stupendously astonishing as a work of gloriousness.

Some felt like they were trolled out of their time, but for me, this is one of the better anime that\'s just outright intriguing....Being what it is, i.e. a low-budget web show just to get in the groove of animating for a new studio, it is surprisingly not shit compared to other shorts this season. The animation while incomparable with full-fledged anime production, is still high quality compared to other shorts such as Ai Mai Mi or Ishida to Asakura. If I were to force myself to choose something that comes almost on par with the animation quality that Trigger brought for Inferno Cop is probably ""Oosaka Okan"". At least that last one is a tourism ploy so it must at least be somewhat decent.The artwork is something of preference, despite my urge to beat anyone that disagree. For what it\'s worth, I love the way the characters are drawn in a mixture of western gritty grimdark style and not-so-standard Japanese style. None of that BS bug-eyed stale moe style, which is a refreshing thought. I disagree with anyone that says they are ""drawn by a kid"" because, lets be honest, kids can draw normal moe derivative style way better than the style Trigger chose to make Inferno Cop.Also with the budget being downright low and the importance of this anime is no more than ""practice"", the SFX is also more than decent; I\'d dare say very good. While sure it has a lot of explosions and stuff, sometimes there are studios that just can\'t get even explosions to sound visceral, but for the life of me I can\'t really give examples from the top of my head. Dialogue is so-so, considering that they probably just hire two or three people to cast the whole lot, from the titular hero to the female characters in the show.And being quite frustrated with Winter 2013\'s offering, a short show this weird and hated after the initial trolling is what made me enjoy this show more that what it should be. All the mixture of cheesy crime-ridden town being saved by a hellcop with stupid incoherent plot, the good animation quality given the budget, the cheesy SFX and some well-timed interruption jokes made this show punch well above its ""short web series"".I gave it a 9 because 10 is where all the anime that made me abandon all logic, intelligence and reason to go full fanboy on (like JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, etc.).

I was wrong. Inferno Cop is in fact the deepest anime of all time. Tackling themes as diverse as the nature of God and the evils of shoplifting.Inferno Cop communicates these themes effectively through its diverse and often morally grey characters.2 examples of these characters from the first episode are the...group of tugs that attack a pregnant woman, but also pay their takes and a police officer that proclaims to be the law itself but also pirates anime. Can either of those truly be considered good or evil?Than there is Inferno Cop himself. A man whose flame of justice will never cool down and will not stop fighting crime until he has created a world with less shoplifting. Inferno Cop might not be the hero we have, but he is truly the hero we deserve. group of tugs that attack a pregnant woman, but also pay their takes and a police officer that proclaims to be the law itself but also pirates anime.

Appearance wise, the resemblance is understandable, but let’s face it, Nicolas Cage can’t act, his movies suck… and you can’t, no matter the circumstances, compare his works to this unparalleled masterpiece.An old organization that goes back to the beginning...of life. Through centuries, they have been trying to take over the world, and almost succeeded; they had members in every cooperation and organization. However, they were defied by a cop who strives for justice. He would go through hell, literally, to achieve his goals and just objective. On his pursuit, he unravels the truth about the universe and life as we know it.Inferno Cop deals with very few characters, they reoccur and reappear intermittently throughout the anime. It’s amazing how they managed to fit all these events and spectacular character development in such a short anime, and make you fall in love with every single character. They kept it short yet ample and elaborate, without leaving any important details to pass unnoticed.The anime provides and prioritizes the shock factor, you can’t help but say WTF –in uppercase letters and lots of exclamation marks- each episode. It’s full of conspiracy and deceit, and once you begin to conceptualize the events, and think you have found the key to the ultimate truth, and that you’re smarter than whoever wrote the script, think again; a plot twist occurs. The creators of the anime refuse to hand it to you that easily. They strictly follow Van Dine’s Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories. Hence, they have to show how superior Inferno Cop is to you, the viewer.Inferno Cop sets itself apart from your regular cliché anime by mixing lots of genres, and it worked very well for them in the end. You will sit on the edge of your seat waiting in anticipation from the intensity, and you will laugh, and it will hit you right in the feels.The art is bizarre and avant-garde. However, it’s fluid and dynamic, and it flows quite well with the characters and the environment. They took extra care to make sure the art is consistent and the quality never drops. The OSTs are fascinating and exquisite, and fit the atmosphere of the anime while never feeling out of place. The VAs were splendid; each character felt distinctive. You can feel their anger, their happiness and their emotions pouring out of the screen and hitting you in the face.I was in a dilemma whether to give it a 9 or a 10. I spent a long time pondering and contemplating until I decided that it really deserves a solid 10 for being the first anime I ever consider to rate, and will probably be the last; I doubt there will ever be any anime that can top it.

Inferno Cop has arrived.Gangster 2: It's the end!!---Simon: I see. So the story is a parody of police-type TV shows, it perfectly utilises the parody style by outrageously making scenarios that are absurd on every level despite making it seem so very accurate to what is actually given in the genre. I like the creativity in this and it is done so perfectly.

We, with powers that rival the very gods of the earth, shall send you straight to the depths of hell!IC: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!---Simon: Hmm, interesting. I like how the characters themselves are overexaggerated general archetypes in the genre. Ridiculously cheesy dialogue and personalities. Intentionally nonsensical to the point of logic breaking. The best part is that it makes sense relative to what is going on, maybe not for the audience, but it does for the story. Very big brain thinking.

Stupid piece of junk!*flying towards each other*MC: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIC: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*Studio Trigger type animation of a very glorious fight lasting a good 2 minutes*---Simon: Wow. What a great fight! The visuals here are silly as expected, however, Trigger still managed to make fight scenes that would undoubtedly topple whatever the hell CoMix Wave or ufotable was capable of. There is enough action here that would be on par with any battle shounen. Audio too, I would first love to point out the exceptional voicing from the absolute legend Gotou Junichi (rip). The OST here fits just about anything that happens, from metal to american superhero type music, everything here finds itself sitting down nicely in the correct place at the correct times. Visuals and audio get a 10 and 10 respectively.---IC: Wait! Why are we doing such things Mecha Cop!MC: Huh? It is part of my program to destroy you.IC: No! We can be more! Come, let us take down the Southern Cross together! Get my revenge and free you from your chains!MC: Wow. I have never thought of that. I shall comply.*power of nakama works its magic and the two somehow get out of hell*IC: Oi oi oi, Mecha Cop! We are out! Now, let us get our revenge!

To continue watching, please find your local anime dealer.*---Simon: Wow. That was actually quite fun to watch. Considering how this anime doesn't take itself seriously, it does a good job at that. Sometimes taking light-hearted pokes to make fun out of anything can be good to get a laugh out of. It is done quite a bit in real life too. So I must call upon how very deep and intriguing Inferno Cop is as a whole. Good lord, this would make Shakespeare cry for sure. Easily some of the best anime out there without question.

How ""so bad it\'s good"" it is? I\'ll try to be honest...Story - 7There was nothing special with the story. This anime is pretty full of rip-offs and references to other TV shows, movies and animes and ranged from funny to thrilling at start to finish. You actually don\'t need to watch Inferno Cop for the whole story but for it\'s overall weirdness and twists that get it\'s plot straight.Art -...9To get the ""This will change your look of anime forever"" comments, what you\'ll be actually watching on Inferno Cop\'s graphics is nothing from the overused ""normal animated anime character"" style, instead, you\'ll get the refreshing ""cut-out"" look! For example, characters will not mostly move their legs when they\'re walking, but their whole body, like if they were jumping. And live-action EXPLOSIONS. Yes, they\'re a great feature in this show.Sound - 7Nothing special with the sound, but it was entertaining. Since it looks like the characters were voiced by 1-3 persons you would at least laugh at the acting or cringe. The music is nothing special, but the ending theme made by ""???"" as described by the anime\'s own section is at least catchy.Character - 8The characters, while not too developed, add to the enjoyment section of the show and get the job done. They\'re not in depth but each of them are done in their good ways. The names are lazy and clever, example: you\'ll expect people like ""Mecha Cop"", just ""Claudia"", and the superhero-like ""Hellfire Boy"" messing around with the titular character.Enjoyment - 10This anime is the epitome of so bad it\'s good. Scenes can range from boring to ""explosion time"" and the way the whole anime is animated, the misadventures the characters face, the occassional predictability, etc., and even more if you\'ll know the people who made this were from a studio made by a person who got mad for working at Gainax enhances the anime experience a lot.Overall - 9If you want to laugh and take a break from the conventional anime style or just wanted to check something ""awful"" as I did, watch it. It\'s not a masterpiece, but it is pretty much what you\'ll want if you want a somewhat-original nonsense animated story and clever characters. 9To get the ""This will change your look of anime forever"" comments, what you\'ll be actually watching on Inferno Cop\'s graphics is nothing from the overused ""normal animated anime character"" style, instead, you\'ll get the refreshing ""cut-out"" look!

If you look at the first few seconds of the first episode, you\'ll definitely think ""WTF is this shit?"" or maybe laugh a little. But that\'s besides the point. Aside from being less than an hour to watch all the episodes, it\'s one of the most entertaining things I\'ve seen.STORY: 6/10The story moves along, and is about as thoughtless as you can get. Not going to win any awards here.Art: 3/10Virtually no art. Still better than Mars\' Destruction though....Sound: 7/10One guy voicing it all isn\'t half bad. Soundtrack actually isn\'t bad either.Character: 5/10Much like the story, there\'s not much here. Just Inferno Cop kicking ass.Enjoyment: 10/10Maybe it\'s the near nonexistent art. Maybe it\'s the fact that one guy did all the voices. Maybe it\'s because it\'s something that\'s not cliche, and actually tried to do something that nobody else has. But trust me, you\'ll enjoy this. I can\'t think of any reason I should have. But dear god, this was more entertaining than anything I\'ve seen in the last year.Overall: 9/10Open your mind, and just watch this thing. Is it for everyone? Maybe not. But you\'ll enjoy it, whether due to the voicing or the sheer stupidity. Trigger knew what they were doing. Some anime are lesser than the sum of their parts. Inferno Cop is so far out that that it shatters what it should be and becomes something that you\'ll never forget. Sound: 7/10One guy voicing it all isn\'t half bad.

Complete with clip art that only moves in the simplest fashion, stock sound effects and around two or three voices for all the characters, this is by all rights garbage......which makes the fact that it\'s hysterical all the better. Going beyond the genre of parody or inverted tropes, Inferno Cop simple lets loose a torrent of insanity that continuously tries to outdo itself in the scant hundred and...twenty seconds or so that each episode is.

Just be advised the show certainly can be entertaining, but it's not worth the 10 people give it.The show features terrible animation on purpose. Involving characters barely moving. It works for the show though. The music is actually pretty good and the voice acting (especially for Inferno Cop himself) sounds very good. All of this works for the 3 minute episodes.Inferno Cop focuses on absurd...scenarios involving a flaming skeleton cop. His goal is to stop the Southern Cross gang. Along the way he falls into random situations. These can be mildly funny. Sometimes you'll even laugh out loud.My opinion. Be in the right state of mind before watching this.

A show that fails in every category under the sun when examined through the critical eye of any and every  wannabee reviewer(this guy), and yet manages to delight that hidden “funny bone” we all keep locked up and away from prying eyes next to all the other lockboxes labeled “Shit Taste”. Somewhere amongst the obvious extreme proclamations of “It’s shite!” and “It’s teh masterpiece!”  lies the truth. Some call that truth “Greater than the sum of its parts.” Others refer to it as “A mixed bag.” Hell, maybe it’s a...“Soo bad, it’s good” kinda show? Yes. The answer to all three of those is a resounding “Yes!” Those are the words that I would use to describe the confounding majesty that is “Inferno Cop!”Story:Technically speaking, Inferno Cop does indeed have a story. When crime runs rampant in Jack Knife Edge City and the police are too useless to stop the excessive murders and shopliftings, our hero Inferno Cop rises from the depths of hell to doll out some good-ol’-fashioned vigilante justice. With a burning skull head, sick shades, leather jacket, and a pistol that makes everyone explode for…reasons, Inferno Cop begins his righteous crusade by saving a pregnant woman being assaulted by the evil CopyPaste forces of the Southern Cross gang. Ecstatic and brimming with gratitude for our hero’s good deed, the woman sprays him with open floodgate levels of her bodily fluids as she gives birth to her mutant, muscle-bound Hulk baby with fish scales for skin, giant lobster claws for hands, and (conveniently) already wearing a diaper…and THEN the weird shit happens. Suffice it to say, Inferno Cop is the very definition of a show you need to turn your brain off for. There is no hidden subtext to unearth, no character arcs to follow, and everything is told through plot twists. It’s great, really.Characters:As you would expect from a 13 episode series that only runs for about 30-45 minutes, there isn’t much time to actually develop characters. Everyone is one-note and serves the singular purpose of being a joke, usually a reference to movies, anime, and other such things. Therefore, what these characters lack in depth, they make up for in oddity and insanity. From Mr. Judge to Real God to Hellfire Boy to Mecha Cop to Claudia, the sheer audacity of these cardboard cutouts will create a permanent spot for your brain to revisit long after you are finished with this show. This is true to an even greater extent for the show’s titular lead Inferno Cop, who will become your personal hero and role model by the time the end credits roll. In other words, I liked the characters a lot.Presentation:I think it would be fair to begin this section by addressing the giant elephant in the room, and that would be the animation. There is none. I will admit that I am a little confounded as to why Trigger, a brand new animation studio at the time, would choose to debut with an anime completely devoid of any actual animation(until about the last episode, sorta?), but “fuck logic” seems to be Trigger’s go-to style. To describe the animation, I would say to imagine Aqua Teen Hunger Force if the animators were too lazy to even make some lip flaps. I think the only things that were actually animated in this anime were the cheap fire and explosion effects. And while we are on the topic of adult swim, I would say that the art itself is very reminiscent of that brand of western cartoon. It’s kinda lazy, kinda shit, but it kinda works. On the musical end of the spectrum, I can only remember two pieces from this anime; an ending theme and a song that plays during the end credits in which a Japanese man screams the words “Inferno Cop” a lot. I didn’t hate it.Overall:Inferno Cop is a show that isn’t for everyone, but should probably be experienced by everyone anyway. Its brand of humor can range from offensive, to vulgar, to disgusting, to just plain unfunny, but it’s “special.” As long as you aren’t the type of viewer that demands the highest of quality and the most intellectual approaches of engagement, it is highly likely that Inferno Cop will do its due diligence to become “greater than the sum of its parts.” With its short run-time, it’s not like you have much to lose, besides maybe a few brain cells that you probably didn’t even need in the first place. “Soo bad, it’s good” kinda show?

It's because...they had no requirements at all they they were allowed to just come up with the most nonsensical concepts ever conceived and slap them on a story board.Each episode is about 3 minutes long so the whole season is just a bit longer than single episode of most other shows, just sit back for 30 minutes and expect nothing as you are treated the highest level of absurdity you will ever witness from a published animated work. they had no requirements at all they they were allowed to just come up with the most nonsensical concepts ever conceived and slap them on a story board.Each episode is about 3 minutes long so the whole season is just a bit longer than single episode of most other shows, just sit back for 30 minutes and expect nothing as you are treated the highest level of absurdity you will ever witness from a published animated work."", ""Overall - 5:Inferno cop is unique but it's nothing special.Story - 5:A parody of typical action anime, and it does this alright.Art - 2:It's bad (and I know this is kinda the point, but that doesn't make it good)Sound - 6:...The OST is actually pretty good, but the voices were bad in the same way the art is intentionally bad.Character - 5:Some of the characters are kinda funny or cool, most are kinda blandEnjoyment - 6:It gave me a couple of laughs, but I didn't love it.

With minimal animation, reused art for several characters, and laughable fight direction juxtaposed next to an insane script that violates logic in several places it's probably one of the most hilarious shows I've watched.I will go on to further state that this show was a massive influence on the animation industry that comes out of Japan every year. That last sentence is very likely not true, but I'm writing it anyway, because you know what, fuck it.Almost...near the end of the run time of the show there's an advertisement for an Inferno Cop t-shirt. I want to own one, because Inferno Cop is the most badass looking cop ever, and I would proudly wear a shirt like that.In fact, I will go on to say that police dramas like NYPD Blue, CSI, the Shield and whatever else are complete garbage compared to Inferno Cop.

He actually gets things done."", ""Inferno cop is a tour de force of postmodern grace, taking the core tenets of animation and the anime industry and subverting them in a way that inherently defiles them. When speaking on inferno cop we must first understand the role desire as lack serves in the perpetuation of various styles and tropes within anime. Lacan speaks on desire as lack insofar as desire is a lack of being; we seek  to be recognized by others because we ourselves in human development struggle to define ourselves without external forces such as our upbringing, language, culture, etc. thus, desire is a perpetuation of this desire...as lack. We seek recognition from the other, to find the self within the other. We must then in essence psychoanalyze the anime industry, taking to its roots in the 60’s into the 90’s, and its presence in the postmodern era.In the earliest days of anime, it was defined by what could be likened to saturday morning cartoons, with classics like mazinger and others, starting off in the earliest ages of childhood. It was cartoons made for children, with their tones in mind. From a lacanian view it can be said that they exist in the phase of development that he called “the mirror stage”. It is the stage where individuals come to recognize the existence of the self yet without the means to define the self, they face a frustration only reconciled by interaction with the individuals environment and culture. Classic anime of this era serves this role in a very obvious way, yet anime would soon take a sharp turn away from this into a new era of stylistic revolution.Entering the age of the 80’s and 90’s with the rise in OVAs and more adult-themed anime, the jump from a medium designed for such a stage in psychological growth was sharp and the landscape shifted immensely. Referring to Lacan once more, he speaks on the symbolic as a means of forming culture, symbols, and a social structure as a means of molding a self from the mirror stage out of it. This era of animation has precedence here because of its disingenuous approach to its aesthetics. While attempting to be a grand front of innovation and challenge, outside of a selection of classics it often fell into a pitfall of not just reactionary attempts to disturb but also fell into a caricature of mimicked 80’s western aesthetics. It became all style but often lacked the substance to substantiate it. In essence, it served as the Big Other which feigned an abstract sense of culture through its “deconstruction”, thus lulling those growing up with it and those coming out of its previous age into believing in it. It could be said that the Big Other of the 80’s for anime was an age of a false reality or truth.The 90’s in particular marked the full consequence of this, and the root of the modernist failings in the artistic space. A great many slice of life anime classics can be attributed to the 90’s, and more than that the genre of Magical Girl anime faced one of its greatest booms in this age. Both genres are expressions of normalcy amidst that which is alien. For slice of life anime and magical girl anime, they both focus on daily life. Where magical girl anime often takes an approach similar to various superhero stories (a secret life of superpower contrast with a daily life of relatable banalities), slice of life makes that its focus. Either way, these two anime share that commonality of daily life relatability and became successful for capitalizing on it. When we recognize this we see how equally disingenuous this comes across as. For as much as there were classics in that age, they both were a return to what is familiar in response to the age of the 80’s which at once strived to be strange in its innovation while ultimately retaining aesthetics and styles familiar across seas. For such different approaches, they both are pathways leading to the same destination. Familiarity. Through a desire to attain sincerity in the reality it mimics, it falls into a romantic failing that doesn’t make anything distinct or meaningful of itself outside of said mimicry.It is here that it becomes essential to invoke Mark Fisher when considering the way in which we interacted with modernism and how its applied to our current artistic space. Mark Fisher spoke on the concept of hauntology, first coined by Derrida and later built upon by Fisher. He speaks on how we are haunted by failed futures, and how that manifests in the “slow cancellation of the future”. Looking to nostalgia culture and the comfort we seek in the return to the past, it can be seen how the past is simply the vendor by which our lost futures are sold to us. The 80’s was rife with cyberpunk and high concept noir anime with fresh styles that ultimately we're all too familiar with the aesthetics of the west, both expressions of futures that were alien yet similar. In effect, whether as criticism or as romanticization, fiction of that time was often alien in the aesthetic sense but ultimately all too real and identical to the modern world. The same can be said for the 90’s slice of life and magical girl anime, which held its emphasis on youthful daily life which holds either relatability or nostalgic comfort; in both senses, it relies on a return to the known, the Big Other which we’ve come to rely on. This can be only further applied in an even more sinister way to anime in the postmodern era.Anime in the early 2000s was, despite the nostalgia factor it holds for many, was at times somewhat unremarkable. Anime in that age was in a bizzare phase in transitioning from cel animation into digital, struggling to come into its own similarly to the more recent struggles for CG anime to come into its own. What's more important to recognize is the 2010s and onward, with anime that began to fall deep into various tropes and tones all while maintaining a sense of supposed self awareness. Enter the Isekai genre, a genre defined by its inherent escapism by virtue of its definition all while in this decade moving toward radical self awareness. Look no further than titles like “Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon” clearly exuding an on the nose self awareness all while doing little to actually shake up its formula that in essence prides itself in its escapism. Even more revolutionary anime like Re:Zero which attempt to take a more grounded and dark approach still hold familiar themes of romance, heroism, and ultimately fantastical ideals that uphold the escapism endemic to its formula. The main character as vehicle for the plunge into a world that is familiar yet different. For while the Isekai seeks to throw the viewer into a new world, the formula steeped in similar protagonist roles, sexualization and romance, all earthly desires that define the supposed new world as all too familiar. It is the same as it was, as it always has been.So where does Inferno Cop fit into this psychoanalysis of postmodernism and modernism in anime? The best way i can put it is that it is the perfect postmodern anime in that it is barely even animated, among many other things. To start, there’s the story. Just kidding there isn't one really. Imagine watching a compilation of perfectly cut out of context family guy clips, then add some melodrama with it and slideshow graphics animation and you’d get the story. The plot ranges from absurd to sardonic, clever to batshit stupid, and it knows this. The beauty of the story is that there is no story, and as such there is little in the way of the Big Other; where previous anime serves as formations of culture and structure to return to, Inferno cop is the antithesis to that. As for the visuals, the illustrations aren’t terrible by any means but they don’t even move outside of what feels like swinging puppets at each other. It's choppy, cartoonish, and can barely be called animation. And it works. Feeling like a middle school students film project, it perfectly achieves a sense of absurdity that challenges the attempts of anime to create a sincerity in itself. It plays into the absurdist humor in a way few others manage, and for that it stands out like the sun does among a sky of stars. The voice acting too maintains this, with voices feeling like they came out of an austin powers movie and lines that feel like they were written by a heavy metal artist attempting to write a shakespearean play. It makes little sense, holds barely any continuity, and it fucking works. In essence, Inferno Cop is the absurd where all other anime is the opposite of the absurd: structure.Structure in itself may not be bad, but as highlighted here its form and function in anime and media by and large has played into the destruction and commodification of the future. It has created a self-serving cycle where it creates the system of constraint and structure that it perpetuates, lulling people into its grasp. But just as Artaud invented the theatre of cruelty to break away from these chains via absurdity in the horrifying, Inferno Cop strives to do away with these chains via the surreal. Inferno Cop demonstrates a postmodern theatre of cruelty, a theatre of humor. Not just insofar as one creates humor, but that it is a theatre akin to the theatre of cruelty, breaking away from humor with humor instead of cruelty. Breaking away from structure with humor instead of horror. And that, is the beauty of Inferno Cop. as lack. We seek recognition from the other, to find the self within the other.

The only other anime I can compare this to would probably be the English dub of Ghost Stories. Both anime need to be cherished and treasured for what they are, and how nothing like them will ever happen again.Inferno Cop is the only anime that I will consider to be perfect. Even though I believe it\'s a masterpiece, the anime has so many flaws, that it may appear terrible at first...glance. That being said, the anime is complete and total garbage, similar to the English dub of Ghost Stories that I mentioned previously.Story: There was a story?Art: To quote my friend whom I showed the anime to; ""I can make better animation in Microsoft PowerPoint.""Sound: Despite the almost non-existent budget, the soundtrack does have some very catchy tunes. That said, because of the minuscule budget, the animators voiced the characters themselves, so they don\'t sound professional at all.Character: Several of the characters were the same model/design reused with minor changes, but the designs for the main characters are fantastic. Even though the characters may look cool, they lack a lot of depth and development.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime WAY more than I should have. I have unusually strong feelings about it.Inferno Cop is legitimately one of the worst anime ever made. The art and animation is horrendous, the plot is non-existent, and there\'s no character development. However, it is the most entertaining and fun series I have ever seen, with incredible re-watch value (I\'ve seen it about 9 times). Inferno Cop is one of those things that is so utterly bad, that it is so good (similar to The Room, or Troll 2).The only way to not enjoy this anime is by taking it seriously. Inferno Cop is so completely ridiculous, and the animators had to have known that what they were making was awful, so they went nuts and made the most ridiculous thing ever to grace the anime world.

While the first couple episodes left me astonished at what I was watching, by episode 4 I was bored and was waiting for it to end. Thankfully this anime is very short and you can probably finish it in one sitting if you tried.The story of Inferno Cop is fairly poor. There isn't really a story to be honest, more like multiple random events that happen for reasons unknown. This could be seen as a pro if you like anime that are very unpredictable. If you are looking for a...competent, interesting story, Inferno Cop does not deliver.The art style is actually fairly good. It has the Trigger style going for it. There is only one problem though, its not very well animated. Seriously, South Park of all shows is even better animated than this. Inferno Cop also uses some really cheap special effects that fit the overall theme this anime was going for. Lets not get this twisted though, the animation and special effects ARE cheap. I would have much preferred studio Trigger gave this their full attention as it would have been great to watch in motion. Overall, the art and animation is poor.Inferno Cop's sound is a bit of a mystery to me. I can't really remember if there was any music played throughout the episodes other than the ending credits theme. That goes to show how unmemorable the music in this anime is. The voice acting in Inferno Cop was pretty poor as well. Inferno Cop himself was voiced well, along with Mecha Cop and Mr. Judge. Unfortunately the rest of the cast isn't voice acted very well. All female characters are voice acted by men which actually got a little annoying to listen to as the show continued. The overall sound in this anime is one of its weakest points, and wasn't pleasant to listen to at all.The characters in Inferno Cop don't do much better either. There isn't any real character development, apart from one scene with a support character. Inferno Cop himself is stagnant throughout the series. He doesn't change as a character overall but we do see a softer side of him when a supporting cast member dies. Other than that he is completely one noted. Do not watch this if you are looking for well developed characters that evolve as the show progresses.I feel like I might get some hate for this review. So I'll be honest, I think I laughed at this anime once. I didn't find this anime funny, and was quite bored with it as a result. Inferno Cup simply isn't my cup of tea. If you are still thinking about watching Inferno Cop, then I'll try to help you decide if its for you.If you like random, zany comedy with an unpredictable story that doesn't go any where, this might be for you. I should also add that this anime is very unique, as I haven't seen anything else quite like it.If you like anime with a little more substance to it, whether that's a deep, interesting plot, or complex characters, I don't think you'll like it.

Its only 3 minutes and will let you know if this is something you'll like or not.STORY: 3ART: 3SOUND: 2CHARACTER: 3ENJOYMENT: 3Thank you for reading my review.

After his death in 1519 in Amboise it was bought by the king Francis I, it subsequently hung in several castles in France, and ended up in the collection of Louis XIV. After the revolution it moved to the Louvre, with a short interruption spent in Napleon\'s bedroom. It was stolen...in 1911 but recovered in Florence. It was attacked by acid in 1956 and all kind of objects and paint were thrown at it in the museums, but these mostly left it undamaged since it was protected behind bullet proof glass.Inferno cop is the last in a row of three women portraits painted by Trigger with an interval of 15 years, and besides the painting of The Last Supper, that is almost as famous as the Mona Lisa, it is just one item in the abundant artistic and scientific production of Leonardo da Vinci. And viewed at a greater distance, Trigger is just an island in the ever broadening stream of artistic and scientific evolution (except for darling in the Franxx, thanks A1). Although there is obviously some focus on Studio Trigger, he can only be understood when placed among his contemporaries, who are the result of a long history, and are themselves a stepping stone for future achievements.From the the mathematical precursors, Atalay brings Fibonacci, the other Leonardo, to the forefront. In particular the number sequence named after him and the ratio known as the golden ratio. These numbers and the ratio, represented as φ, shows up in nature more than often, but also in mathematics as the golden rectangle and the golden triangle, and the golden spiral. Atalay gives many examples of where this occurs in nature, from nautilus shells over phyllotaxis, to the DNA helix and galaxies. The ratio shows up when judging aesthetics of the human face and the human body. It is no wonder that da Vinci dissected bodies and drew the Vitruvian man, another of these da Vinci immortal images that live in the memory of mankind. But the golden mathematical configurations, deliberately or not, were also implemented in the layout of paintings, and in architecture, of which the pyramids are the most famous examples. After introducing the rules of perspective, we arrive at da Vinci\'s work of art with the portraits of the three women (Genivra de\' Benci, Cecilia Gallerani, and the Mona Lisa) forming a center since it is more or less the middle of the book. The second part is more related to da Vinci as a scientist and how that science evolved later. Da Vinci was famous for his many unfinished projects, many scale models were produced much later and hobbyists can buy kits on the Internet to build them: catapult, helicopter, bicycle, odometer, parachute, tank, etc., many are remarkably close to our modern design. But science did not stop with da Vinci. Shortly after came other polymaths like Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus, Newton, and later Maxwell, Einstein, Schrödinger, etc. who formulated the basic laws of nature, and the planetary system, and we are still unraveling the laws of the cosmos and of the tiniest of its building blocks.Atalay succeeds in taking the reader along on this journey, not as a detached guide or journalist, but showing also some personal involvement. He includes some of his own artistic work, shows pictures he took as a child while visiting the pyramids with his parents, he gives details of why and how Schrödinger came to his equations, sketches the shy and timid personality of Dirac, etc. Chapter titles like ""the nature of science"", ""the nature of art"", ""the art of nature"", and ""the science of art"", he makes it crystal clear how much he believes in the confluence of all three: nature, science, and art. If the book, after 10 year in print still needs recommendation, I happily ratify a confirmation. in 1911 but recovered in Florence.

Do you want to just relax and enjoy something that is made just for people to almost die from laughter? Do you like things which are so bad that they are good? Inferno Cop has it all covered.Objectively one of the worst anime, but that doesn't mean you cannot enjoy it. There is barely any animation(of course this is played for laughs). Most of characters were forgettable(except for the Inferno Cop, the...hero of Jack Knife Edge Town who has risen from hell).Now, let's get serious. The first few episodes were really funny under the condition that you reject everything you think you ever knew about common sense. As the show goes on it gets more bizarre and over the top, but the comedy gets worse. I was starting to get bored around episode 9. Luckily it gets good again at the conclusion which is actually executed in a good way. Only thing that bothered me is the fact that every dead character is brought back to life.SUMMARY:Pros:-good comedy-complex philosophical themes(obviously)-a deep story-badass MCCons:-everyone who dies is brought back to life-comedy gets worse halfway through the showMy score:6/10 hero of Jack Knife Edge Town who has risen from hell).Now, let's get serious.

So I was a bit skeptical before starting Inferno Cop after someone on Reddit recommended it to me.Oh boy. This anime blew my mind with the first episode itself and it just kept on getting better and better. Everything is perfect about it. The story is compelling and deep and while it may seem like a parody on the surface, it deals with serious issues like the corruption of...society and the meaning of life. The art style is really simple and yet visually pleasing, which proves that you don't need highly detailed and sophisticated art and animation to create a masterpiece. The sound perfectly fits such a masterpiece. The characters are some of the best characters created in the history of anime. Inferno Cop himself is one of the manliest men in anime, on the level of Kamina from Gurren Lagann. He deals with his internal conflicts and yet strives to make the world a better place for everyone. All the side characters like Mecha Cop and Hellfire Boy, besides developing Inferno Cop's character, are excellent characters themselves. And the man is only 21.I enjoyed every second of the anime. I was laughing almost constantly and going PogChamp at times when I recognized the references to more complex issues that the anime addressed. It's a shame that the episodes were so short, but again, this proves how good Trigger is, to condense so much content into such a short time interval.Overall, I'm not exaggerating when I say that Inferno Cop is the greatest anime of all time. Because of MAL, I can't rate it more than 10/10 here but honestly I'd give it at least 420/10 if not more. society and the meaning of life.

Where one episode left off the following not only continued off but reminded the audience what happened before with a recap.-plot wasn’t true to its audience nor was it deep. Hero/main character’s goal was to avenge a wrong from his past. Even though that goal was from long ago it was reminded to him recently before the final episode started. Yet, he still didn’t follow through on it.Art-animation is cheap. Might as well be cutouts.-why are most of the henchman the same? Anime is already short would it be to much to at least give them a...different color of a hat or some slight variety?-lacks character emotion.-artwork is fair not beautiful. Reminds me of nickel and dime American comics.-lay-back artwork is used (real scenes embedded)Sound-voice acting was extravagant. My guess one guy decided to more than one voice. Maybe the budget was limited.-sound effects weren’t always appropriate. For example why would a revolver emit a machine gun effect?Character-I am sorry but what? “who, the f___ are you?” Aside from the unneeded vulgarity how is not clear who that person is with the car and the outfit?- Another flaw with logic wording, “I am immune to bullets”. Fine, but why did affect you at the end?- I could continue and continue with all the flawed logical word choice but by then I would have written an amount greater than a significant essay. different color of a hat or some slight variety?-lacks character emotion.-artwork is fair not beautiful.

I don't want to spoil too much, since I believe every moment is worth experiencing without any prior knowledge, from the first frame. As Hot Fuzz satirised the modern overly dramatic police flicks by making them as mundane as possible, Inferno Cop takes the opposite approach by cranking that all the way past 11. And does it ever work.As a character, Inferno Cop is a satire of the Shounen Jump! style protagonist we seek in our action shows, incorporating elements from around the...world, from the homeland's Son Goku and Light Yagami to all sorts of other inspirations including Spider-Man, Aragorn, HAL 9000 and Joan of Arc. Hell there's even a somewhat subtle nod to Ghost Rider of all people in his design. But Inferno Cop is able to capture the spirits and depths of not only what makes these characters timeless and appealing, but also combines them into an effortless performance by Junichi Gotou, whose experience and expertise in the voice acting industry shine as he creates a performance of a lifetime. The fact that he was snuffed of an Oscar-award is frankly insulting.The sound design would be nothing to write home about, with the exception of Junichi Gotou's performance and the frankly transcendent music that hits every beat possible. It is somewhat let down by sounds that drown out the actors, however upon reflection I realise that this was entirely intentional. During the show's more bombastic scenes, it would be impossible to hear anything, and this further deepens the aforementioned satire of its overblown contemporaries that forego realism and presentation for an insulting and overly simplistic view on action that doesn't treat the audience with any critical thinking skills. And I, for one, applaud the subtle yet infinitely deep commentary.In regards to alternate characters that surround Inferno Cop, I would hate to spoil but each is just as endearing and heart-warming as the last. With many people coming and going in Inferno Cop's tragic life, one can't help but feel wrapped up in many of the moral quandries faced by our protagonist. However I do want to make a quick shout-out to Hellfire Boy, who's backstory is as endearing and moving as someone like him deserves, and who's ultimate sacrifice feels as personal and touching as only a skilled master can pull off.In conclusion, Inferno Cop is a show that not only satirises the entire anime and entertainment industry worldwide, but that stands up on it's own as an emotional, timeless piece that a short review like my own can provide. The parodies all have a unique flair that range from YouTube advertisements to Marvel comics and, of course, anime, but one doesn't require being well versed in any of these prior as they are all an absolute joy to watch.In conclusion, Inferno Cop is a heart-warming story that has the power to touch the lives of millions worldwide. Anyone expecting a show to turn their brains off won't be disappointed, however this is not the optimal way to watch this show. Inferno Cop deserves, nay, deserves, nay, deserves your respect, as well as a re-watch, an in-depth look, and even the purchase of some merchandise while you're at it.In conclusion, the flashy animation complements the writing flawlessly; one could not exist without the other, and the depth and substance here will be one that sticks around for generations to come, and rightly so.Inferno Cop is a masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough. world, from the homeland's Son Goku and Light Yagami to all sorts of other inspirations including Spider-Man, Aragorn, HAL 9000 and Joan of Arc.

This anime is dificult to rate. I appreciate that it\'s my favourite studio\'s first ""work"" and I very well KNOW that it\'s not meant to be taken seriously and is just a parody for fun.That being said, I didn\'t enjoy this very much neither ironically nor unironically, unlike Ninja Slayer that I enjoyed both for ironic reasons (the ""yeaaaah""s, the photoshop fights, the fanservice, the anime stereotyoes, etc)...but mostly for unironic reasons (great characters, writing, cool premises, awesome visual stills and serious moments). Of course this review is about Inferno Cop, but I just wanted to get that out of the way since the two shows get compared a lot. I can make an educated guess that the only reason this is rated higher than Ninja Slayer is 1) It ""did it"" first and 2) Ninja Slayer is 50/50 parody and serious, which is something I personally like but I can see how it can be something difficult for people to grasp, while Inferno Cop is 100% retarded so that no one but the top 1% of r/whooooosh inhabitants can make the mistake of taking it seriously. There is little I hate more than people taking goofy things seriously, and so I didn\'t do that with this show, but still it wasn\'t the most entertaining thing.What studios Trigger and the late Gainax do so well (which is mainly why I like them so much) is strip shows out of other qualities to their barebones most important one which is fun. At the end of the day, a show can have serious character development, deep lore, deep characters and character relations, complex serious plot and what not yet still be bad if it\'s made with no ""entertainment value"" in mind. How are you gonna know about the deep characters and plot if the show is so boring that you can\'t even get more than a couple episodes in without falling asleep? At the end of the day, the entertainment value and the FUN of it is what matters by far the most. Everything else to it is SECONDARY. Shows like Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, and Ninja Slayer from Animation, and cartoons like Aqua Teen Hunger Force understood and why they are some of my favourites of all time. If entertainment wasn\'t above else then why are classic cartoons liek Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry that have little coherent plot that is only there to create scenarios for slapstick and absurdist humour, still timeless things that are enjoyed by nearly everyone today? Well, that is my philosophy at least, you may disagree with it but I am very sure it\'s true for people like myself.In terms of entertainment this show is about as fun as a 4 or 5/10 serious show would be, has no other qualities than that, and it is like 35-50 minutes long in total, I can\'t give it anything more than 3/10.

Well, that is my philosophy at least, you may disagree with it but I am very sure it\'s true for people like myself.In terms of entertainment this show is about as fun as a 4 or 5/10 serious show would be, has no other qualities than that, and it is like 35-50 minutes long in total, I can\'t give it anything more than 3/10. I wanted to like this, sorry Trigger and Imaishi for I have sinned, but I am being honest.', ""Inferno Cop is a perfect example of 'don't judge a book by its cover'. At first, I saw the art style and decided to not watch it based on that, but seeing as the episodes were only 3 minutes long, I gave it a shot anyway.Story: 8/10Inferno Cop has a very interesting narrative and story. It portrays a lot of real world issues in a comedic way. In only 3 minutes too.

It serves as a masterclass on how to make a great show with the budget of your average powerpoint presentation.Not once in all 13 episodes did I find myself bored by the story or visuals, though I did stop to question what I was watching at various points. Inferno Cop somehow manages to keep the viewer enthralled in it's ludicrous story, yet does so with less motion than your average asthmatic brick. It's humour may as well be improv with how...unpredictable it is, yet it works. And it works well.Regardless of it's significance regarding Trigger (and therefore the whole of  anime), Inferno Cop is awesome (in various ways) show that can be watched in less than an hour and yet tell more of a tale than some full length TV anime. I would absolutely recommend giving it a watch.tl;dr: watch it, it gud. unpredictable it is, yet it works.

I hear you ask. ""What is Inferno Cop?"" Well...Inferno Cop is an anime created by Trigger (YES! Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia and Promare Trigger) following the adventures of Inferno Cop, a police officer with a flaming head who seeks revenge after his family was murdered by Southern Cross, a shady, Illuminati-like organisation that attempts to control the world with its various monsters and thugs, with Inferno Cop dispensing justice on pretty much anyone...he feels like in Jack Knife Town.And he does it by either A. Shooting them, B. Blowing them up, or C. BOTH! And trust me...It\'s bizarre as heck but surprisingly entertaining.This anime kinda feels like something you\'d see on Adult Swim during it\'s early days, a little cheap and crude looking yes, but short, sweet and sidesplittingly funny! With one thing I also enjoy about it...The hamminess of the voice acting, it\'ll leave you in stitches.However the plot is a little nonsensical at the start and the animation like I mentioned before is pretty cheap and crude BUT! I think it works in the show\'s favour, adding to the humour and hilarity! Not to mention at the end of the anime it gets kinda epic, or as epic as it can be for a show like this!Honestly if you want a good short anime to watch sometime, why not give this a shot if you like your share of strange and funny humour and more explosions than you can shake a stick at. Oh...And did I mention that this anime is on Anime Bancho\'s Youtube channel? No I\'m serious look it up! he feels like in Jack Knife Town.And he does it by either A. Shooting them, B. Blowing them up, or C. BOTH!

And then, there's the Opening and the Ending, The Opening is a short 4 seconds with a short tune, because no time must be wasted to watch this masterpiece, and the Ending is a beautiful song in German, with meaningful lyrics and a rhythm that makes you dance.This anime is a...masterpiece, Trigger saved anime one frame at a time. masterpiece, Trigger saved anime one frame at a time."", ""Every so often, there comes an area where crime has run rampant, becoming a scourge on the innocent people who want nothing more than to live there peacefully.  In places like Townsville, Gotham city, Metropolis, New York City, Tokyo and others seem to be under a curse that attracts the worst of the worst to their streets, where they build their empires, corrupt the political systems, or just rain general destruction down on the population.  There are many of these locations, all of which are really better off being avoided, but one town stands out among all the others.  There’s one town...where the light of hope has all but flickered out, and the concentration of evil in the form of gangs, super villains and horrible monstrosities has almost become the majority.  This is Jack Knife Edge Town, and yeah. with a name like that, it’s no wonder things have become so bleak.  In a town like this one, the only entity that can stand in the way of the forces of evil to protect the innocent is one man...  No.  One cop.That cop is none other than Inferno Cop, who is really more a mass of sentient muscles than a man in a police uniform.  Oh, and did I mention that he has a flaming skull for a head?  Yeah, despite looking every bit like a hellspawn himself, Inferno Cop is the one man the criminal population fears, and he’s dishing out the kind of hardcore, bloody justice that would make Sleepy Johnny Estes jealous.  Having lost his family to the Southern Cross gang, Inferno Cop wants both justice and revenge, and will happily fire his inexplicably explosive bullets at any being that opposes him, even hostages on some occasions.  Unfortunately for Inferno Cop, neither avenging his family nor cleaning up the streets of Jack Knife Edge Town will be as easy as shooting a bunch of gangbangers, because there’s a lot more going on here than just your average every day criminal behavior.  He’s going to have to fight giant monsters, cyborgs, judges, robot dinosaurs and the forces of heaven and hell themselves to bring this story to a happy ending.  It’s a mad world out there, but is he mad enough to survive it?Well, guys, it’s Studio Trigger time again.  I talked about this company a few years ago in what turned out to be one of my favorite reviews from my collection, Kill La Kill.  That and Inferno Cop are their first two titles, and also regretfully the only works from them that I’ve actually seen.  I’ll eventually see Darling in the Franxx when it’s finished airing, how could I resist with the amount of controversy surrounding it, but for now, all I really know about them is their origin.  Studio Trigger was established by former Gainax employees, including director Hiroyuki Imaishi, and information about their first official title...  Titled Inferno Cop, if you haven’t guessed by now...  has been hard to come by.  I read in an interview that they were hired by a youtube channel to create a short length anime series, and after a few concepts fell flat, they eventually settled on an idea they thought nobody has heard of before...  A cop who’s on fire and slays evil.  That explains the show’s low budget, but there was another detail mentioned that I’m a bit more curious about.Further down in the interview, Hiromi Wakabayashi states that the basic idea behind Inferno Cop was to put in as little effort or time as possible, and that each episode had to be completed in under two hours.  I’ve tried to find some explanation on how mandated this, what circumstances dictated it, or any kind of reason why this was the rule, but in lieu of an explanation, I’ll instead say that Trigger responded to these limitations in a surprisingly inspired way.  the animation in this series is a bizarre combination of high-definition sprites and stock visual effects like fire, explosions and blood spurts.  I know people like to say that shows like Robot Chicken are just guys playing with star wars toys, but stop motion animation of any kind is a lot of hard work compared to that image.  Well, that same difference in effort exists in Inferno cop, with their on screen motions looking like someone cropped an image and is moving it with his cursor compared to actual frame-by-frame animation.Does that mean it doesn’t look good?  Hell no.  As relatively easy as it probably was to animate, Inferno cop looks awesome.  Kill La Kill would occasionally move a character like they did in this show, and it was usually pretty funny, but seeing it done non-stop throughout the series is kind of a unique experience.  It’s especially ridiculous when you see just how gritty, detailed and edgy the designs are, from the run-down, crumbled aesthetic of Jack Knife Edge Town to the masculine, testosterone-laden character designs that look like they were taken out of a vintage western comic book, being used in such a rudimentary way, there’s something about it that just works.  The time and budget restrictions also lead to a lot of the characters having repeated templates and poses, with simple artistic and fashion-related changes distinguishing between the characters.  Yet, somehow, it never looks cheap.  Yeah, the characters are just still images being moved around(which looks hilarious in the racing episode), but there’s so much happening on screen at any given time that the effect is lost.Well, that works just fine for the animation, but I’d like to think the music got a little more TLC from the producers, because it’s pretty awesome.  There are several episodes that include commercials for the Inferno Cop soundtrack right in their run-time, and I would really like to snag a copy of it, because this show’s music is fucking tight.  The music is a hard, fast blend of rock and techno, and I don’t air-guitar very often(or ever, really), but these tracks make it pretty tempting, especially with background tunes like Hell Dillinger and Chaser.  There are some cool gimmick tracks like the Egypt-inspired Desert City, the ominous Theme of Southern Cross, and the swanky, swinging OZOMBIEDESUKA, but the real gems of the soundtrack are the vocal tracks.  The song Die Hollen Polizei serves as both the intro and closing of the show, and it’s also used constantly as an insert song, which would be annoying if it wasn’t so awesome. My personal favorite, though, is Grue Elise von mir, a bona fide rock ballad that gets used for any ‘sad’ or ‘touching moment in the series, even though they’re kind of hard to take seriously.Inferno cop never got picked up for an American release, which is a huge shame because I know that Funimation would knock it right out of the park, but they did manage to cast an actor for Inferno himself when his character made a cameo in another anime, Space Patrol Luluco.  Christopher Sabat wound up being perfect for the role, as anybody could have predicted, but he hasn’t been able to touch the main series, unfortunately.  The original Japanese voice actor was Junichi Goto, a newbie at the time who brought a tough and grisly-voiced performance that makes it sound like he was trying to channel Segata Sanshiro.  He’s pretty damn good, as far as my English-speaking ears can tell.  The rest of the cast was basically just a handful of guys doing hastily improvised voices, and they’re cast so repetitively that...  I swear to God this is true...  In the credits in the final episode, they actually fast forward through the cast listing, even though they still list every single character, important or not, meticulously crediting each role.When I was first exposed to Inferno Cop, I really didn’t have any interest in it.  I honestly didn’t even know it was anime...  I thought it was Russian, or something.  I knew made a brief appearance as an okay joke in an AMV Hell movie, and it made another brief appearance in a terrible reanimated clip in a Ponies the Anthology installment, but aside from those glimpses, I spent five years never having any reason to check it out...  That is, until April of this year, when I volunteered at my local anime convention.  They had me doing a bunch of odd jobs, but my last one was acting as host and head-counter for a couple of showings, the first among them being Inferno Cop(which got a two hour slot despite being an hour long with Fact Files).  Having to watch it in a crowded room full of adults whose IDs I had to check, and being part of a group viewing experience, I’ll admit, I got sucked in.  I was able to embrace the ridiculousness of it, warts and all, and it wound up being one of the highlights of the con for me.Having said that, Inferno Cop is stupid.  Like, it’s really stupid, a show full of randomness, logical inconsistencies, problematic elements, and an almost impressive number of cliches and deus ex machinas.  If you’ve read my reviews up until this point, this would seriously not seem like something I’d ever be into.  I mean, how can I have the gall to gush about this series when I very recently called Excel Saga lazy?  And no, I’m not going to backpedal on anything I’ve said in the past, nor am I going to make up some bullshit about this show having depth, or some underappreciated metaphors or social commentary.  Inferno Cop is exactly what it looks like from a cursory glance:  It’s stupid nonsense full of bad writing and juvenile sensibilities.  I’m not gonna deny the fact that just about every element that went into this series is something I’ve shat on other shows for doing in the past, so why am I being so much nicer to this one?Well, there are two things Inferno Cop does right, and they’re both pretty important.  For the first thing, let’s take a look at Magical Play, a show I was distinctly disappointed with, despite it being every bit as weird as Inferno.  It was appropriately weird and full of batshit crazy ideas, and it created an unpredictable environment where anything could happen in it’s world of fluffy nonsense.  Despite having all of this going for it, it got boring real fast due to a lack of direction and a tone that was always shifting in confusing ways.  Are we here to see the girls getting into weird dream-like situations, or are we here to see a backstory, plot and earnest attempts at feels?  Unlike Magical Play, Inferno Cop is whole-heartedly committed, making for a sense of consistency in the execution.  It knows you’re just there to see what crazy thing it’s going to do next, so it never tries to be serious, it never tries to make you feel(it kind of makes fun of you for it, honestly), and it never loses focus of what it’s doing, tying it’s most entertaining element directly into it’s vague and highly forgiving plot threads.And for the second thing it does right...  I’ll be honest, this one feel like the more important one of the two, even though Magical Play actually did kind of nail it.  There are several shows based on random lunacy that I just wasn’t able to stay interested in...  I’m talking titles like Excel Saga, Hayate the Combat Butler, and Hare + Guu.  Yeah, they were great at first, full of wild and exciting comedy that felt brazenly and defiantly weird, but as time went on, they just sort of lost their momentum.  Once you’ve seen a little girl eating everything in sight, transporting them to an alternate Kirby-style stomach dimension, there’s really nowhere to go from there.  Comedy styles can be overused, at which point they become predictable, after which they became dull.  The worst part of Excel Saga was the part where you realized all it was doing was lazily parodying a bunch of genres with by-the-book observations and padding them out with weirdness.  And Hayate jumped the shark so often that it just made people miss the manga.But this leads me to the biggest thing Inferno Cop does right...  It’s short.  The biggest weakness of random nonsense comedy is that it has a shockingly poor shelf-life.  The longer it goes on, the more exposed it gets, and the clearer people are able to see the method behind the madness.  It’s not impossible to keep this kind of comedy effective for lengthy stretches, but you have to be working extra hard to keep the comedy fresh by reinventing it and taking it in new directions, like Baka and Test was so good at doing.  This is why I’m not really on board with the new FLCL reboot...  6 episode FLCL was perfect FLCL.  Inferno cop is only an hour long, and that’s WITH the fact files segments, which I actually feel are a necessary part of the experience.  It’s because Inferno cop is so short that it never lags, and it’s able to jump from plot point to plot point like an anime speed-run without ever feeling overwhelming, and all the things it does that WOULD be ran into the ground by a longer run-time, like all the cliches, deus ex machinas and on-point Evangelion references, are able to leave a fond impression on us by only happening once or twice each.  And on top of that, it actually manages to have a pretty satisfying conclusion.Inferno Cop is available on Crunchyroll.  It hasn’t been released on any form of physical media that I know of, not even a freaking Malaysian bootleg, but it damn well should.  There's also a series of in-between segments that I mentioned earlier, called Fact Files, which gives deliberately pointless information about what you just saw, and it's totally worth your time.  A second season has recently been announced, but hasn't aired yet.As much fun as it is to watch Inferno Cop, and as highly as I do recommend checking it out, it’s obviously going to run into a glass ceiling with me.  It’s a good show that’s a blast to see, especially with other people, but there’s still so many more enriching anime titles out there, titles that a lot more time, effort and thought put into them, that i’ll always recommend first.  I think the best way to describe the experience of watching this show would be that it’s like seeing two really close friends with similar tastes and interests just try to create a narrative on the fly, making constant attempts to one-up each other and make each other laugh, and even if you don’t get the story they’re coming up with, you feel like pointing out all of it’s problems would just be mean.  “Like, why does a world-wide cruise have to be dirt cheap for Inferno Cop to ride it when he just won a million yen?”  And the answer is “Shut up, we’re playing with giant robot dinosaurs now!”  It’s no masterpiece, not even close, really, but it’s an experience I highly recommend having at least once.  I give Inferno Cop a 7/10. where the light of hope has all but flickered out, and the concentration of evil in the form of gangs, super villains and horrible monstrosities has almost become the majority.  This is Jack Knife Edge Town, and yeah. with a name like that, it’s no wonder things have become so bleak.

It hasn’t been released on any form of physical media that I know of, not even a freaking Malaysian bootleg, but it damn well should.  There's also a series of in-between segments that I mentioned earlier, called Fact Files, which gives deliberately pointless information about what you just saw, and it's totally worth your time.  A second season has recently been announced, but hasn't aired yet.As much fun as it is to watch Inferno Cop, and as highly as I do recommend checking it out, it’s obviously going to run into a glass ceiling with me.  It’s a good show that’s a blast to see, especially with other people, but there’s still so many more enriching anime titles out there, titles that a lot more time, effort and thought put into them, that i’ll always recommend first.  I think the best way to describe the experience of watching this show would be that it’s like seeing two really close friends with similar tastes and interests just try to create a narrative on the fly, making constant attempts to one-up each other and make each other laugh, and even if you don’t get the story they’re coming up with, you feel like pointing out all of it’s problems would just be mean.  “Like, why does a world-wide cruise have to be dirt cheap for Inferno Cop to ride it when he just won a million yen?”  And the answer is “Shut up, we’re playing with giant robot dinosaurs now!”  It’s no masterpiece, not even close, really, but it’s an experience I highly recommend having at least once.  I give Inferno Cop a 7/10."", 'A short review for a short show.Inferno cop is an intentionally poorly-made mini show about a police officer who deals with various super villains, crime organizations, cyborgs, demons and all kinds of crazy shit. Just writing this review makes me recall all the amazingly wild, absurd and stupid things that happen in this show. If you, like me, like surreal humor and enjoy things that make no damn sense, then youll love this show. Very little anime have made me laugh so hard I cried, and this is one of them. The horrible animation, voices, design, story and everything works so well with the intent...to make a pile of shit. If anyone reviews this critically and say “theres no character development, the plot makes no sense and the entire show looks ugly!” They’re lost. Yes, this show is horrible, but thats the point. Every aspect gets a 1, except for enjoyment which gets a 10, therefore, overall I give it a 10. to make a pile of shit.

Please don't let its art style deter you from watching one of the most beautiful creation known to mankind.Story: 10Its obvious that this anime is making fun of every anime cliché out there.

Not only did Inferno Cop keep me on the edge of my seat from all the raw action, it also made me shed a few tears from the sad moments it had. What happened to HellFire Boy was so ironic that I cried tears of real sadness and I also laughed my ass off.

Man, that was one wild ride! I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire duration, and ended up binge watching the whole thing in one sitting. While I think I sense some sarcasm in the reviews I read after watching it, I can still say this anime is action-packed, hilarious and out of the box. It simply breaks so many conventions of its format, and explodes into something unexpected and a complete laugh riot.There were times where I simply couldn't help but laugh at the animation style used,...which is ridiculous in a parody-like way, and yet beautifully done. It combines even live action images at times, and that's when you realize this anime isn't trying to be serious or thought provoking kind of stuff in any way. It's intentionally over the top, and succeeds in being a good one at that. The action scenes are fun, and the comedy is literally sprinkled everywhere, making even the serious moments rather intentionally funny.And of course, it does have a great soundtrack which grew on me real quick. All in all, this action comedy anime is a treat for anyone willing to try something both over the top and out of the box at the same time. It made me forget all about the real world, and immersed me into a world of wildness. Inferno Cop is not simply hilarious, but one of the most hilarious pieces of art ever created.

I could not make better if I tried.The animation is absolutely horrible and I love it. There are times when this show doesn\'t even try and it works so well. Half of the characters are just copy-pasted to the point where you can\'t tell if it\'s a deep and complex analogy for how the anime industry is so saturated with the same characters...over and over again or if the animators were just having too much fun.This show has a FULL ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK and it somehow slaps. I had to go look this up because I forgot whether it even had more than one song but I found a playlist full of bangers.The characters are amazing and they have so much complexity and depth. Look at Inferno Cop himself, who has a total of zero definable personality traits. He\'s so complex and well thought out that we mere mortals cannot comprehend his existence.The story is so amazing that I cannot even begin to describe how great it is. Every plot twist had me on the edge of my seat. My brother, who I rewatched this with, said it was like nothing he\'s ever seen before, and I\'m definitely not lying through my teeth when I say that. It is glorious. It is amazing. It is...  E P I C. People say it\'s not even comparable to shows like Evangelion or Monogatari, and that\'s true; it\'s because they simply do not understand the subtle and DEEP themes and symbolisms in the plot. You just ""don\'t get"" Inferno Cop if you can\'t see how amazing it is.That\'s right, Inferno Cop is the greatest anime ever made and I\'m tired of pretending it isn\'t. Ignore the fact that this review only gives it a 9/10, it\'s because MAL\'s scoring system simply cannot contain the pure levels of EPIC this show consists of.

Kuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Demo Shimasen ka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29583/Kuroko_no_Basket__Oshaberi_Demo_Shimasen_ka,"[""Well this is a fan disc episode.That pretty much sums it up to be honest, your favorite colorful haired basketball players will even remind you of the fact that you're watching a fan disc episode while you're watching.The episode really is just a recap of the events leading up to Season Three with a lot of quality jokes and banter from the Miracles and Seirin crew. It's nothing to add to the story but it's definitely a fun watch and getting to see all of the main characters get together and talk about their games makes it worth it. "", ""'Kiseki no sedai', seirin crew, and a member of shukoku crew (Takao) in Magi burger part 2.The fandisc 2 is about chit-chat about up and downs and review in winter cup competition from the character beside the funny jokes, some funny secret, and also the interview about 2 member of kiseki no sedai : Mukkun and Akashi.Aah~ it is funny to see the crew and kiseki no sedai chit chat outside the main story and show their own true characther. Its look like watch when the boys are gossiping about basketball and teasing each other. ^w^Afterall is funny enough and makes little enjoyment...to fans of KnB to fans of KnB"", ""This episode is a comedic recap of the second season of Kuroko no Basket. What you'll get is Kuroko, Kagami, Kise, Aomine, Momoi, Midorima, Takao, Hyuuga, Izuki, and Kiyoshi talking about the Winter Cup games that were shown in that season. Murasakibara and Akashi also make a little appearance.Essentially, you're getting a funny little meta episode where all those characters chat with each other and commentate over the games. Plus, you'll get a few extra funny scenes like Aomine talking to Tetsuya 2 and Midorima shutting down one of Izuki's puns.The thing I liked about this episode was that you got to see...Aomine talk about Touou's second match with Seirin. It was cool to see him somewhat talk about being in the Zone with Kagami who also talks about it. Kise also talks about the Kirisaki Daiichi game, or rather, he talks about his displeasure at watching them play underhandedly. It's just interesting to watch characters talk about things they wouldn't normally get to talk about, which is sort of the purpose of these episodes.There's also a little interview with Akashi in there, so that's fun.

It wouldn' be such a big fuss, but when every single especial, movie or OVA is some sort of recap episode, then it's getting somewhat ridiculous. I guess, not only are sports IRL filled with in-between replays, but the Anime counterpart appears to embrace hat trope and materialize it into several recaps that parrot the same exact thing.Other than the panoramic commentary by the characters which are suddenly forth-wall-sexual, I really enjoyed...the original animations, the conversations they have and the inside jokes they made, really, that part alone carried this episode and I would have loved it if the entire episode was just that. the original animations, the conversations they have and the inside jokes they made, really, that part alone carried this episode and I would have loved it if the entire episode was just that.""]"
Kyoushoku Soukou Guyver (2005),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1374/Kyoushoku_Soukou_Guyver_2005,"[""There was a time, in anime, when men were men, and they had huge swords and guns with which to leave bloody trails of corpses in their wake. Indeed, the Guyver series is one such anime, and in ages past it flew far in the firmament of ultraviolence into territories known by such classics as Ninja Scroll and Akira.The remake brings Guyver up to modern standards as far as animation and sound are concerned, but otherwise it is deliciously old school in many respects. You'll find no moe lolis or tsunderes here, just a good old fashioned story about a boy and his biomechanical robot...armor and the mutated freaks trying to kill him.Guyver was always pretty dark and the remake lives up to this standard. You'll see young Sho tormented by the Chronos corporation in devious and spectacular ways, and he must constantly fight to protect his loved ones, who are kidnapped to use as bait in the early part of the series. To be sure this is a pretty old plot device and you could say that Sho is not much different than Peter Parker but with an alien symbiote (oh wait...) but as our old pal William Shakespeare would remind us its not the plot that counts but how you use it. The series takes us through quite a few ups and downs and makes a strong emotional impact. You will be impatient to see what happens in the next episode and there is never a drag in the action.Surprisingly, one of the main appeals of the series is the growing relationship between Sho and his girlfriend. The development of her character is excellent and adds a lot of emotional flavor to the story, increasing the suspense and NEVER getting in the way of the action killing.A few people have complained about the ending, but without posting any spoilers I can say that it is satisfactory from a dramatic and emotional perspective, even if there's a shit load of story material left unsettled. It would be great to have a second season, but since Guyver still hasn't found its audience I guess we'll have to make do with manga scanlations for now. In the meantime do yourself a favor and check out the Bioboosted Armor Guyver, if you have any taste for old school anime action you will not be disappointed. armor and the mutated freaks trying to kill him.Guyver was always pretty dark and the remake lives up to this standard.

And it is not coincidence because the original manga-ka, Yoshiki Takaya, was influenced by Kamen Rider. But despite that, a lot of traits in Guyver are still distinctively unique, original, and engaging.The beginning of this anime will be repetitive in some aspects, but I feel it is for the right reasons. At times, Cronos will try to kidnap Tetsuro and Mizuki to lure out Sho in almost the first 12 or so episodes, but like I said, the reasons are legitimate since it's...the only way they can lure out Sho and eventually, they'll resort to other methods and the series itself develops to go beyond that aspect. I think the show was being realistic in that kind of way and I feel it does a great job of conveying that which is why I can forgive it being repetitive in that light.What I love most about this installment of Guyver is how it uses a majority of their characters and how they develop individually, as well as their relationships with one another. It really surprises me how Mizuki develops and is used in this series. I say any average anime watcher will wonder how a character like her can be utilized, and I love how the anime really explores that and makes the story progress all at the same time.As for where the anime ends, I heard it only covers roughly half of what the manga offers. It has an ending that does feel conclusive, but there is still a mountain of material and aspects left to explore, develop, and resolve. I know Chris Patton (who plays Sho) has expressed in the DVD commentary as well as the dub director that they want to do more Guyver. I hope in due time they make more Guyver anime.Moving on, if you've seen the original OAV or read the manga, a majority of the character designs still have the same feel, but with new techniques have an upgrade that apply to faces, clothing, and hairstyles which makes them look more appropriate to their ages while I felt some of the character designs in the oav looked a little too mature and old, especially Tetsuro and Agito. Sho this time looks a lot like Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing as opposed to his more feminine design in the oav (I'm to assume that his design in the oav is more faithful to the manga's). Sho looks a little more generic with his design but he still comes across as unassuming with his slim build. I also like Murakami's design in this TV series. I felt his new fashion for the TV series is also appropriate for this day and age as he looked more like a Miami Vice character in the OAV, and I feel that design would be a little silly today, especially his aviator sunglasses in the oav (despite my love for old school.....and Miami Vice).The coloring and detail to the Guyver suits still look appropriately organic, but the movement also makes it look more flexible and less stiff from the original OAV. The action is pretty violent on Berserk levels and its constant and exciting. My biggest problem is some of the background drawings, especially in the forest during the daytime. The detail and coloring look more like a children's coloring book. It really does stick out like a sore thumb. But the city designs on the other hand are very breath taking and the other character designs as the series goes on are pretty shiny and nifty.I would like to open up this part of the review by saying I really enjoy the dub. It's of course not in the league of Cowboy Bebop's or Gundam 08th MS Team's, but it's a great dub and far superior to the old OAV dub which really sucked. I thought the actors did a very excellent job of portraying teenagers and yet still being true to the situation that lies around them. Despite how I feel that the seiyuu cast in this one doesn't hold up to the talent of the oav's cast, I felt it still does a great job and I feel the English equals it. So despite not having an all star cast in Japanese, I think the English and Japanese voice acting are still top notch.The background music is also excellently orchestrated. It really creates this organic feel and it really comes across as sci-fi along with horror elements. I thought the OAV had more catchy music and I personally like it more, but as contradictory as it sounds, I think the music in this series captures the atmosphere of Guyver more appropriately.All I can say is if you want a well-paced story with an excellently utilized cast of characters along with wicked action, then this is the anime for you. As for a new installment, I hope to count on it. the only way they can lure out Sho and eventually, they'll resort to other methods and the series itself develops to go beyond that aspect.

This version which is considered The New Guyver far surpasses the original in many ways. There were numerous elements that had room for plenty of improvement and it succeeded on improving in some areas. Most noticeably is definitely the animation, characters, dropped story elements, and better use of plot devices.The animation is very good, the fights are very brutal and stylish; a good portion of the fight scenes are fluid and aren\'t downplayed into unseen action. The character designs for both the Guyver...and creatures are done well. The creature designs are imaginative but some come off way too goofy looking. The animation and artwork are far from perfect though. Some episodes lack the same quality and the artwork appears to be done very lazily. This is most noticeable during episodes 13-16 especially. I found myself actually despising the artwork at times. Fortunately though, the animation regains its focus way before the end and returns to its former glory.Character development along with character usage stood out to me quite a bit. The characters are better used and given longer life spans to push the story this time around. This is mainly concerning the villains, in which this added a little more depth to the storyline. There are hidden agendas and one villain in particular evolves into more of an antihero type. The main character Sho is much easier to tolerate now, and is given the time to better adapt to the armor. His actions and personality are very believable, especially in the way that Sho isn\'t a trained fighter. This fault puts him at a big disadvantage against all of his opponents. Despite the realism that is applied here, this is actually a love/hate approach for me. Sho at times appears to be too weak and many battles are won by pure luck.There are many questions answered this time around unlike the original series which raised a few and left them hanging. I\'ll leave that part alone as not to spoil it with details. The battles at times can be violent. They consist of weapon use via high energy attacks, fisticuffs, along with slicing and dicing. The battles have their gory moments at times. However, they\'re also a mixed bag to me. Some are very well done with the Hyper Zoinoids boasting some nice abilities; but I can understand the hatred from the fans to a certain degree when concerning the violence in the series. The original was definitely more violent. One battle in particular that really stands out as being heavily toned down in comparison with the original, would be the battle with the Guyver\'s nemesis Enzyme.The battles with Enzyme can be boring to say the least. They are not on the same level when concerning the sheer brutality and drama found in the original. Those whom never saw the original will benefit the most with these encounters. While fans whom have seen it will more than likely find it very hard to digest; but this not at all means the original is better. The action scenes present here are still entertaining, and the storytelling elements along with the characters are far superior to the original.The soundtrack and voice acting is also greatly improved. The opening theme song ""Waiting For"" performed by Reiri is without a doubt one of my favorite songs in anime. This song alone makes me want the soundtrack, and even if this was a bad anime I could actually watch it to listen to this song alone.The New Guyver is a good series and despite the things it does well; I still have a hard time giving it a full recommendation because of it\'s unfinished feel. I think this will appeal more to those whom just love anime and can over look weak endings.Highs: Nice animation & artwork, great action, characters serve a purposeLows: Inconsistent animation, open ending, last three episodes are disappointing and creatures are done well.

The ending ??? to be honest this was my biggest problem with the anime... Zx-Tole was the last fight ? really what happens with Chronos? also possibly rethink the animation so it looks less like Power Rangers! ', 'Think about the last great anime series you\'ve seen....think....think...think...now forget that about that garbage you call ""good"" and go watch Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor.I\'ll start by saying that way back in the day I watched the original Guyver.  I\'ve learned that it was an OVA and i\'ll tell you this...do not compare these series.  The orignal was junk and this is a fucking work of art.The story follows this fella named Sho.  He\'s your normal high school student who through a run of bad luck, (or good), get\'s turned into this Guyver, a Bio-Mechanical Weapon.  The coororation who designed, constructed, and...discovered this Guyver unit wants it back and is certainly not thrilled with the fact that this kid is the one who has ""melded"" with it.  As the series continues, it follows Sho, his friends and allies, and the fight to save the world from the orginization know as Chronos.Let\'s start by saying that this show progress at a wonderful pace.  Each episode covers pleanly of ground and leaves the veiwer wondering what is going to happen next, and hanging with suspence.  Throught the entire series, we meet new and exciting people, are given more then enough background about them to form an opinion, and learn to either love them or hate them.It\'s a topic that has been done before, meaning good vs. evil, but this series has this uniqueness that is very intriguing and addictive.  The series in it\'s entirety capures topics so perfectly and discusses, religion, science, bio-mechanics, and human integration in such fulidity that even someone with little or no knowledge on a topic comes away in utter awe and belief.  That\'s the first GREAT thing about this series...as crazy as it seems, it\'s BELIEVABLE.  Amazing story telling.And one of the things that make this series so believable are the characters.  Let\'s start with our main man Sho.  He\'s the shy, quiet, nobody at school.  He has his own morals and beliefs, and he carries this on even after his transformation.  He\'s not a fighter.  He doesn\'t want to hurt and kill people.  But he\'s got no choice.  It\'s either him or them.  He\'s got to protect his buddy, his buddies sister (who Sho really wants to lay the nuts too), and the rest of his friends from the ""evil cooporation"".  As the saying goes, ""A man\'s gotta do what a man\'s gotta do"".Then we have the main bad guy, Guyot.  He\'s got his reason\'s for wanting to take over the planet and he has a plot that, if played out right, would work.  He looks like a bad guy, acts like a bad guy, and does bad shit to good people.  It was very refreshing to have an evil do-er that we want to fail.I also haven\'t metioned the underlings.  These are the main threat to humanity.  They are called Zoinoids and are humans tranformed into mutants.  They are given super-human strenght and unique bio-weapons which only they posess.  There are many different types and levels of zoinoids so we aren\'t watching the same people fight the same looking creature over and over again.Finally i\'ll say this about the character\'s in Guyver: TBA.  There are good guys that you don\'t like and bad guys you are really pulling for.  A VERY nice change.The music ties in well throughtout Guyver.  From orcastrated, violin sessions providing thrilling fight music to quiet background tunes during monologues, everything matchs the atmosphere perfectly.  The voice acting was nice too.  No one really stood out above others as either superb or foolish; they just did a wonderfully ordinary job.The Opening Theme was brilliant giving the viewer a quick glimps of what to expect to see.  You see are the main characters, the Guyver suits, the enemy, and the upbeat music gets you excited to start the episode.  The Ending Theme music is nice too, a much slower melody and provides you a calming atmosphere, integrated with lines and bubble things.This series just so well done.  You feel for the characters, and you relate to what they are going through.  You laugh, cry, and pray everything works out for them.  You love the crisp lines detailing the characters, and are blown away with the background.  The plot has so many twists and turns it would give a sailors knot a run for it\'s money.  It\'s drawn so well and the animation is so smooth.  What little CG it has is blended in so nicely you don\'t even know it\'s there.  You\'ve got blood, guts, and glory.  You\'ve got an underlying love story.  You\'ve got a story of unreprised friendship.  You\'ve got fight scenes more then worthy of mention.  If you add it all up...you\'ve got you\'re next best series.Now quit reading this shit and go watch for yourself. discovered this Guyver unit wants it back and is certainly not thrilled with the fact that this kid is the one who has ""melded"" with it.

So there was a...lot of odd cloured and shady blood which I found quite lame. Fight scenes were JUST above average and the Opening was actually quite cool.So in this respect I am MOST DISSAPOINTED with the animation compared to the original OVA!SoundOpening is a very nice/sad song very appropriate, character voices were cool, Zoanoids were perfectly cranky as usual, I really would like to hear the new English dub for this one because in the ova sho used to scream all the time and aptom made me laugh the way he used to taunt sho, so that’s something for me (and other fans) are looking forward to.StoryExcellent, I say excellent because I never read the manga and the ova ended on a ridiculous cliffhanger that always left me wondering will the story continue. Well it didn’t just continue, the story was remade (so to speak). Expecting the same things that happened in the ova I was considering skipping to the rest of the story, luckily I didn’t and apart from the first two episodes which correlate with the ova the rest was a fresh new perspective of the story of Guyver. I wont give any spoilers but I will say that although it is the same story as the ova, key (and I mean KEY) elements of the story and characters are explored and explained like never before giving the story more substance, as well as events taking different turns new characters etc.CharacterAnother shining point for the remake. Character development is so much more explored/explaned now between characters (e.g. shos relationship with his father and past, Agitos past.) This really helped with emotional build up with main episodes (cough enzyme 2 cough). The characters themselves are as expected entertaining, whether it’s Guyver 3 plotting or Zoanoids surprising relationships with each other. In retrospect its quite amazing the way your views of characters may change throughout this series. Nothing lacking in the charcter department at all.EnjoymentI would say enjoyment could easily be increased by watching the OVA series first.If you do happen to watch this version first I can guarantee you still won’t be disappointed. Guyver itself is a very interesting take on an accidental hero (like spiderman) dealing with a overwhelming situation when just trying to live a normal life.Sadly when I think about it the thing I like most about this remake is the expansion on the actual story, but for some reason I prefer the original OVA mostly because I felt although it was very korny (yes its korny) it really drew me in with the action scenes and in this remake those same action scenes did not hit as hardNever-the-less as a hardcore Guyver fan I was very impressed and satisfied with the new version. The manga has been running for so long it makes me wonder where the story has gone up til now and if they will animate it further.Time will tell I guessPlanet Tyro Rating: High WatchablePlanettyro.com lot of odd cloured and shady blood which I found quite lame.

It\'s Big, loud, dumb, and cliched, however, this just adds to the overall charm of the series. In a way, it brings back memories of those years of my childhood I spent glued to the TV watching ""Power Rangers"".""Guyver: the Bio-Boosted Armor"" follows a boy named Sho Fukamachi, an average High School student who lives with his father, is treasurer on the Student Council, and like watching old Sci-Fi movie with his best friend Tetsuro. The story kicks off as Sho and Tetsuro find a ""Guyver Unit"". After Tetsuro accidentally turns it on,...it attaches itself to Sho and transforms him into ""The Guyver"". The two then begin to learn of a secret society known as  ""Chronos"" who created the Guyver, and has secretly been creating mutants called ""Zoanoids"", who they plan to use to conquer the world. As Chronos learns of their identities, their attacks begin hitting close to home, and Sho decides to destroy Chronos, before it\'s too late.Sho\'s also not the only one with the powers of The Guyver, however, there is also Oswald Lisker, a Chronos employee who holds the unstable Guyver II and Guyver III, a mysterious stranger who appears and disappears like the wind.If this description sounds absolutely awful to you, you\'re not alone. When I finished  watching the first episode show, I was looking at myself in a mirror, demanding why the hell I thought sitting through this thing would be a good idea, but, I decided a few days later to keep on going. I\'m glad I did.While I\'m not a fan of the idea of turning off your brain in order to enjoy something, Guyver is a series where you can just sit down with some good friends, maybe get out some cold drinks, and sit back and enjoy a gory, action filled series.Funimation has put up the entire series up for free here (http://www4.funimation.com/video/?page=show&b=37) and will be re-releasing it on Blu-Ray this summer. it attaches itself to Sho and transforms him into ""The Guyver"".

You got the MC that as usual goes in the usual loop of ""i can\'t do it"" to ""i can do it and will protect everyone"" the MC doesn\'t give you any reason to rally behind him as a viewer really.

All and all I really loved this anime and hope they will do some more seasons one day.I would have to give it a 8/10 ', 'Guyver is basic shonen adventure dreck (extra emphasis on ""basic"") where a mediocre high school student dons a suit of alien power armor to fight an organization called Chronos.It was boring and terrible, and I watched it to the end because apparently I am trash for this kind of thing.The source manga has not aged gracefully, and the anime would have felt dated and backwards even on its initial release over a decade ago. Characters don\'t seem to have strong personalities to distinguish them from the basic outlines of the tropes that were molded from, and the overall flatness of these characters cause the ""serious""...dramatic beats to spew an endless fountain of bathos and narm. This is particularly true of the female love interest Mizuki, whose main purpose is to exist in an endless cycle of hopeful waffling and emotional breakdowns so over-the-top that they were hard to take seriously. The lead character Sho does not escape this comical overreach either, with a personal crisis that occurs near the middle of the show only succeeding at eliciting guffaws aplenty.Guyver does better with its anti-heroes. Although their personalities are just as rote as any other characters, at least there is conflict built into their situations, which means they are more engaging by default.Pacing is better than average. Guyver basically starts off as a simple monster of the week formula, but soon starts to break the status quo and veers into more of an adventure structure with a longer set of rescue arcs. Although the focus on monster fights as obstacles results in conflicts and resolutions that feel artificial, this anime does successfully escalate the threats over time. However Guyver ends on an incidental fight with a tertiary character, which leaves a bad aftertaste.While Guyver is dense with action fights, little of the animation is particularly expressive. At the very least, the gross insect-inspired monster designs were pretty fun. dramatic beats to spew an endless fountain of bathos and narm.

It's only at the very end that we become aware of any physical ailment, and while I know that's there largely just to end his story more neatly, it's also rushed and somewhat anticlimactic. Notably, MI6 is entirely absent in the end, since Nix was removed from it prior to these events, which is also surprising given that he killed Percival not too long ago. I can also more easily buy Da Vinci figuring out how to implant himself...in the minds of others than I can Lupin suddenly figuring it out and replicating it across so many people, even if it's really the only way for him to combat a personality like Da Vinci's. In any case, the visuals for this one were still fantastic, the central conflict pitting Lupin against Da Vinci was entertaining and intriguing, and the whole idea of putting everyone in a mental prison and having them use their greatest skills to get out were all pretty great. I think this one takes bigger swings than the rest of the series, and in doing so, manages to put on quite the spectacle. in the minds of others than I can Lupin suddenly figuring it out and replicating it across so many people, even if it's really the only way for him to combat a personality like Da Vinci's.

Mix: Meisei Story,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38098/Mix__Meisei_Story,"['For someone whose all-time favourite anime is Touch, there\'s a strange feeling to be had watching a quasi-sequel an entire thirty plus years after Touch originally aired. A mixture of nostalgia and of heavy emotions, of how things were and how they are, of how we have changed but not changed much at all.But throughout it all, the one emotion that lingered strongest was: ""I wish I was watching Touch instead.""It\'s a story that has been done thrice before, with Mix now being Adachi Mitsuru\'s fourth at-bat with coming-of-age baseball dramas. The biggest difference here is that Mix isn\'t so much a personal story...in the way that Touch and Cross Game were, but is an entirely sports-focused series in a similar vein to H2, albeit with heavy themes of family and nostalgia. Touch in particular was focused on themes of trauma, guilt, angst, loss, and love, of trying to prove yourself and trying to be someone who you are not. There are none of these things in Mix— not even a touch of romance— which makes the entire experience pretty mild unless an already prodigy-level pitcher aiming for first place at the Koushien is all you ever needed.The matches are engaging in typical Adachi Mitsuru fashion, as they can be over in a split-second from the tiniest of mistakes, making it impossible to reliably predict who will win and who will lose. No team is invincible, and no player is infallible. The epic music crescendos with Touma\'s masterful pitches, each landing with a loud thud as the innings rack up and the stakes increase. One mistake, one poor pitch and Meisei could be immediately sent home with nothing but regret and a years-long wait until next summer\'s tournament. While the first half of Mix is largely slice-of-life and an introduction to the characters, the second half is extremely tense and devoted to Meisei\'s run at the summer tournament.As a sports anime, Mix is great. But with only twenty-four episodes devoted to a still-ongoing manga, with enough chapters to already cover several seasons worth of similarly paced content, to have things end as prematurely as they do makes the anime feel like lost potential. ""Really... that\'s it? No sequel announcement? This is how we\'re ending?"", I thought, as my video player reached the end of the final episode\'s credits. Adachi Mitsuru\'s anime adaptations— namely Touch and Cross Game— are notable in how they actually portrayed the entire story despite the length of their manga source material. Touch told a full story, from beginning to end. So did Cross Game. But Mix, unless things are to change, has only told about 10% of the entire story, hoping anime viewers will be OK with an ending that doesn\'t conclude anything or make the viewer feel at all happy with where things are leaving off. It\'s like a manga that was gutted and canceled with two week\'s notice— it simply isn\'t an ending.But I guess that is the fate of anime produced in 2019. The days of fifty, a hundred episodes airing weekly is behind us, with three different seasons produced over an entire decade being the best one could hope for. Most of the time anime adaptations will simply end after the thirteen episodes and remain incomplete stories. It\'s a shame Mix was produced in 2019 instead of a decade ago when longer stories still had a fighting chance. Because, you know, Touch never even showed its true colors until twenty-five episodes had passed. Maybe there is more here as the story progresses, and maybe, just maybe, had it been a full adaptation, it could have had the potential to match or even surpass Touch.I enjoyed Mix. I enjoyed returning to a peaceful setting painted by Adachi Mitsuru, and hearing all the silly fourth-wall-breaking gags the characters prod the viewer with. The summer tournament in the latter half was climactic and exciting. But every time the show would reference Touch, with Touma pitching next to Tatsuya - his splitting image - I would feel a desire to simply return to Touch instead, much, I suppose, as Touma\'s coach is haunted by nostalgia, unable to let go of his memories at Meisei thirty years past.So I write this review, six years after I wrote my Touch review, with manga volumes of Touch and Cross Game still standing next to my computer desk. Obviously I haven\'t let go just yet, but that doesn\'t mean I didn\'t give Mix a fair shot, either. I just don\'t think it did it best. in the way that Touch and Cross Game were, but is an entirely sports-focused series in a similar vein to H2, albeit with heavy themes of family and nostalgia.

First of all it has this good family spark in it and we learn a story about two families merged into one. Brothers are looking nearly the same but they really aren't blood related ones. This anime kind of hits us in the moments that we didn't expect it. Anime touches hard theme because teams manager is favorising chairmans sons who appears to be all-time starting pitcher no matter of results. In general Touma has hard time because of this situation he can't event have his own good training time because manager is...only looking at chairmans son and he doesn't bother how the others are doing, or maybe this is how author of story would like us to think it is? To be honest it's more slice of life/school anime than a sports one but maybe in second part od season we will see more games.Art and animations has this old style that's easy to remember for those whom watched many '80's anime series. Still it's more than decent, even more than good I will even call it great. I like voice acting here it's also brings some memories from the past. Baseball game sounds are polished and done well. When ball lands in the mitt or is hit by the bat, the sound is clear and obvious, and very real. Character development may look a bit slow but in general it time flies quickly in Mix so you need to watch it carefully to not miss boys advancing to high school. Overall I can easy give it 9. It will be 10 if only there will be a bit less of slice of life and more of action. only looking at chairmans son and he doesn't bother how the others are doing, or maybe this is how author of story would like us to think it is?

I understand that I might be missing out on some of the important information, such as the backstory of how they became national champions 30 years ago, the dynamic husband and wife, etc etc. The list can go on and on. However, not watching/reading Touch has allowed me to get a better grasp on what the show did right and wrong.To me, this anime was solid. The storytelling is always going to be solid, since it was originally by Mitsuru Adachi....I have watched cross game and I picked up similar vibes. The powerful batters always have that clearness in those eyes, there is always one/two girls in the show giving it a romance kind of feel and the atmosphere had the same kind of aura. However, even though it is similar, Mix is unique. An outsider coming into this without knowing anything about Touch, the story's that I heard about what happened 30 years ago were so intriguing. I kept on wanting to just watch more and more. Each of the main games that they had that lasted more than 1 episode (such as the last one) were a hard fought battle. Even then, I didn't know what was going to happen. Usually I tend to predict where the anime is going but for this one that was certainly not the case.Even though there is a lot of good things about the show, it doesn't give me amazing vibes. Shows that I give a 9+ to are usually ones that I really enjoyed and I would rewatch it anytime. This one didn't strike to me as something I should rewatch. Although the show did everything right, I feel as if it didn't reach the viewer enough. Perhaps I should say it was too bland? I am not sure. It is also hard for me to recommend this because the topic is just so niche.Another reason why it is hard to recommend this show is because of the other shows that went with it. I thought that this season (Summer 2019) was going to fall short compared to the other reasons and how wrong was I. Shows like Fire Force and Demon Slayer dominated throughout social media and sadly Mix, was just there. Plus, not only did it kind of end abruptly, but there just isn't enough. I am pretty sure that the story is no where near finished but some of the things aren't fleshed out enough. Does that mean I think there needs to be a sequel? Yes. If there isn't one then I will be disappointed. 26 episodes is a 'long anime' but compared to other sports animes such as Kuroko no Basket, Baby steps, Hikaru no Go, this doesn't have enough.As a result, this anime was a disappointment that it ended far earlier than I wanted to. I would like to watch more but with no sequel announced, I am losing hope at a rapid pace. The charaters, art, sound, story were solid. Everything about this show was solid. I would recommend this show as a result of all of the things it does right. Shounen animes should learn from Mitsuru Adachi style of writing, as all of his works had relatively decent success. TL;DR : Watch this show if you enjoy sports anime or if you are on the fence about watching it. I am sure you won't regret it. I have watched cross game and I picked up similar vibes.

After finishing it, I\'m only left feeling... disappointed. 26 episodes just isn\'t enough substance to wrap up what the first season was trying to create. Storylines and character development throughout the season fell flat, and the ending was inconclusive and leaves a question mark on MIX.Though it has weird pacing throughout the early part of the first season, MIX\'s story is easy to follow, despite being bland at times. There are some high moments, and there are some very dull...moments.The artwork of MIX is one of the strongest aspects. The art style encapsulates the world of MIX greatly.While the OP and soundtrack are generic, it gets the job done well. It reeks of ""high school Japanese baseball"", in a good way.Character development is one of my biggest gripes about MIX. The characters are mostly a blank slate, with only a few instances of them showing potential for growth. I feel like there wasn\'t enough time taken to build up the main cast to become multi-demential. There was plenty of potential that wasn\'t reached. I felt the storytelling created by Adachi Mitsuru was not fully realized. Many of the opportunities for arcs were seemingly thrown out of the window every episode.Overall, while MIX didn\'t reach my expectations, I have hope that a second season is made, and it expands on the universe of MIX.

Writing and story aside, the animation is top tier, so good I thought it was Production IG...for a second. The music isn't at all irritating, as it can so easily be in shows like this, and the fact that Mix was created with such love and care made me want to rate them as such.The reasons to watch Mix are the following: if you love baseball anime (despite it being repetitive at times), if you like slice of life, and if you like calm, realistic main characters (the side cast leaves something to be desired). Oh and if you like Kaji Yuki.It's animation is absolutely fantastic, never once dropping because of it's classic art style. I watched it all the way through, and while I definitely prefer Diamond no Ace, Cross Game and Major faaar more, I still enjoyed myself massively.But Mix wasn't without flaws. The baseball aspect was very stereotypical (but at this point in sports anime, how can it not be?), and the supporting characters were extremely bland, contributing nothing to the team. And then it's whole sister-obsession. The show focused ridiculously on Otomi being some curvaceous, voluptuous icon, where she was only 14.Also, be warned, those who have issues with Eren/Mikasa pairing (although when the started to live together, they were 10, well aware of their separate upbringings) will definitely have problems with the main 'couple' bordering on incest. Thankfully, the show doesn't focus too much on it at all, and one can even shrug it off by saying it's brotherly love. But honestly, at 5 y/o, you don't really notice that you're from separate parents. I don't have a step-sibling, but I'm sure that being raised from 5 as siblings MAKES you siblings.Oh Japan. Of course if that's your cup of tea, more to ya.Regardless, I found refuge in Souichiro, the 'twin' brother. But I still liked Touma plenty.Bottom line: give it a chance.

The dub is done well here on Funimation and everything is fine. The only problem is recent, Funimation cut half of the episodes down to episode 12 and hasn't fixed it now. So when I came back to watch it again to hear the English VO's again, I was met with the sub on Crunchyroll. I have no problem with subs, the problem is when I found out...why the show got so much backlash. See, while the show goes on, music plays in the background. It fits well, and it all comes together. On the sub, the background mix is way too loud and you cant hear the narration. the storyline gets quite bland after a while, which is saddening. Considering the storyline is bland you would think they would have too many episodes right? nope. 24 episodes are too short considering the ending of the show, which I will not mention because of spoilers. The pacing is fine in my opinion, but It does get in the way of show ending once it reaches its limit of episodes. solid 8 for everything but 2 points deducted for slow pacing and sound on the dub. why the show got so much backlash.

Needless,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6030/Needless,"['Typically shounen style action series are not usually my thing.  I find them to be completely silly and juvenile and cater to a demographic that I am just not a part of.  The posturing and trash talking, the ridiculous reversals of fortune, and the long drawn out nature of the fighting usually cause me to lose interest.  Honestly I am surprised this appeals so much to teenage males, who typically have the attention span of a goldfish.  However, initially Needless seemed to be different, and appeared as more of a parody and comedy with an extremely enjoyable female lead.  Eventually...though it loses its way and falls victim to the things that doom many of its brother anime; trying to be and do too much instead of sticking with what was working.The plot, initially is about as basic and nondescript as they come.  Needless is set in a post apocalyptic world in which a new race of super powered humans have emerged, possessing fragments of power that give them mastery over a certain skill such as fire, gravity, and magnetism.  These fragments apparently have all come from a common source, a god-like being known as the Second.  These altered humans are known as Needless.  But there is a hard and fast rule however, while some fragments are more powerful than others each Needless can only possess one.  It all sounds like it an interesting take on the superpowers genre, and it a lot of ways it is though the way that the powers are used begins to get annoying after while (more on that later).  All is not well in the world of the Needless though as they are threatened by the extremely powerful Adam Arclight and his followers in which they face extinction from his scheming.  Only the mysterious Adam Blade and his band of resistance fighters stand in the way.Needless is chalk full of slapstick comedy, action, blood and death, explosions, fan service, and machoism.  Fans of these are likely to find plenty to like.  The real problem with the series as a whole is the pacing of its storyline.  Things move along quickly in the first 1/3 of the series.  Perhaps a bit too quickly, which may have lead to the problems it suffers from for most of the middle and late portions of the anime.  The heroes find themselves trapped in a room where they must do battle with Arclight\'s strongest followers.  The battles are action packed but they drag out...forever.  The story comes to a crawl and these battles seemingly go on forever as almost half the anime is taken up by this one fight and set in this same room.   The shocking plot revelation made during this arc is obvious to anyone with any degree of sophistication.  Once our heroes finally manage to get out the rest of the series is almost completely taken up with flashbacks, plot building, and adding a conspiracy arc.  While this made Needless\' story infinitely better and more complex it again felt to me like a complete reversal once again in the theme.  To me it was like the director couldn’t make up his mind.  Did he want to create an echii action parody, a straight shounen fighting anime, or a complex story about genetic research and political intrigue?A small rant is in order on the battles.  I know that it is a staple of this kind of series to yell out and name all of your attack moves and special abilities, but really is it that hard to come up with some names that make some sense?  After hearing ""Little Boy"" or ""Dean Drive Fox Hound"" uttered for the billionth time I just wanted to shove a pair of scissors into my ears.  And seriously what the hell does Dean Drive Fox Hound supposed to fucking mean anyway?  It’s nonsense!The real tragedy is that what they were doing at the start was working.  The best part of Needless is the characters, in particular Eve Neuschwanstein (try saying that ten times fast).  She’s got all the body measurements to make her a fan favorite, but she has a hilarious and quirky personality to go along with it to make her memorable.  She stupid, can’t remember anyone’s name which leads her to ""shorten"" people’s names into nonsensical words.  She has a really cool special ability called Doppelganger, which allows her to change herself into basically anything of the same mass as she is.  Unfortunately as the series progresses she tends to disappear more than a main character should from the action, thus taking away a lot of the appeal for the show for me since I really enjoyed her.  Also her Doppelganger ability is used in ways over the course of the series that seem to be inconsistent with what the ability should really be able to do.As for the other leads, Adam Blade and Cruz Schild the results are not as good.  Blade is a silly and typical shounen male with an over-the-top character design complete with an unoriginal and clichéd personality (basically think TTGL\'s Kamina).  Unless you love 12 pack abs and these kinds of stereotypes or this is the first anime you have ever seen, then you’re unlikely to be impressed by him.  That being said he does have his moments of comedy gold and he is not completely without merits.  Cruz is also a typical anime boy who reminds me of another TTGL character, Simon (the young version) in both looks and personality.  Though he seems to have more sense than most of his shounen brethren, and stays out of trouble for the most part and leaves the fighting to those with powers.  His greatest attribute is that he’s probably the only person in the show with a brain.The rest supporting cast is a mix of some very entertaining and memorable characters and more shounen stereotypes.  With the exception of Disc, the rest of Blade\'s team of resistance fighters is uninspired.  The ones who really shine are among Arclight\'s subordinates.  This starts and ends with the Pretty Girl Squad of Mio, Setsuna, and Kushinashi.  I found their antics to be the most amusing of any of the characters in the series.  They are probably the objects of the most fan service, next to Eve, but for the most part it’s all pretty funny and just doesn’t feel as pointless as it usually is in other shows.Artistically Needless is an uneven experience.  The animation of the fights, action, and special effects are all topnotch.  The service is well done, at least amongst the females, and they are cute and not too ridiculously proportioned.  However the men are awful.  I am on record as being a firm hater of bishies and effeminate men.  While the men in Needless are certainly manly, they basically look like bishies on steroids.  The fact that all of them looked pretty much the same (does anyone in the future wear shirts?) and the silly looking cartoonish muscles and impossible body builds took away from the art overall.The absolute worst thing about this series is the music.  The first OP ""Modern Strange Cowboy"" is without a doubt the silliest song I have ever heard and the worst example of Engrish lyrics gone wild.  The second OP is not near as bad but still not that good and both the ED themes are average at best.  Also the commercial break teaser halfway through is laugh out loud silly with the retarded sounding ""Needless"" being overacted by various male cast members.  The acting overall is decent, but again the male voice actors over play their parts so much that they just sound silly.Overall my final opinion on Needless mixed.  I did enjoy many aspects of it, but it had more potential than it delivered.  The schizophrenic direction and pacing are too much for me to ignore.  Your enjoyment of Needless is likely to depend on your own personal tastes.  If you love shounen action then you might want to give this a chance.  I found it to be an average series at best. though it loses its way and falls victim to the things that doom many of its brother anime; trying to be and do too much instead of sticking with what was working.The plot, initially is about as basic and nondescript as they come.  Needless is set in a post apocalyptic world in which a new race of super powered humans have emerged, possessing fragments of power that give them mastery over a certain skill such as fire, gravity, and magnetism.  These fragments apparently have all come from a common source, a god-like being known as the Second.  These altered humans are known as Needless.  But there is a hard and fast rule however, while some fragments are more powerful than others each Needless can only possess one.  It all sounds like it an interesting take on the superpowers genre, and it a lot of ways it is though the way that the powers are used begins to get annoying after while (more on that later).  All is not well in the world of the Needless though as they are threatened by the extremely powerful Adam Arclight and his followers in which they face extinction from his scheming.  Only the mysterious Adam Blade and his band of resistance fighters stand in the way.Needless is chalk full of slapstick comedy, action, blood and death, explosions, fan service, and machoism.  Fans of these are likely to find plenty to like.  The real problem with the series as a whole is the pacing of its storyline.  Things move along quickly in the first 1/3 of the series.  Perhaps a bit too quickly, which may have lead to the problems it suffers from for most of the middle and late portions of the anime.  The heroes find themselves trapped in a room where they must do battle with Arclight\'s strongest followers.  The battles are action packed but they drag out...forever.  The story comes to a crawl and these battles seemingly go on forever as almost half the anime is taken up by this one fight and set in this same room.   The shocking plot revelation made during this arc is obvious to anyone with any degree of sophistication.  Once our heroes finally manage to get out the rest of the series is almost completely taken up with flashbacks, plot building, and adding a conspiracy arc.  While this made Needless\' story infinitely better and more complex it again felt to me like a complete reversal once again in the theme.  To me it was like the director couldn’t make up his mind.  Did he want to create an echii action parody, a straight shounen fighting anime, or a complex story about genetic research and political intrigue?A small rant is in order on the battles.

Your enjoyment of Needless is likely to depend on your own personal tastes.  If you love shounen action then you might want to give this a chance.  I found it to be an average series at best.', 'Needless is not for everyone, but it is a fantastic show as long as you watch it for what it is and are able to enjoy it for what it is. Still, while it was still airing I got the feeling that most people had misconceptions.First of all, Needless is not a shounen. Needless is a shounen-parody. Or actually if I stick to proper genres I would agree that it\'s a seinen, and the reason why it is ""full of shounen clichés"" is because it makes fun of those classic elements by overacting them till they reach grotesque levels. It\'s important to understand that that...is the basis of the show.Muscular machos? Naturally. Battles that last for eternity? Most of the anime is set in a single room. Fighters with named attacks or techniques? In Needless they not only shout them all the time, they also write them on the screen with huge flippin\' letters to make sure you remember!I admit though that throughout the anime adaptation there are points when the show turns into the very thing it pokes fun of, but I\'ll get back to that later.The second popular misconception is that Needless is a Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann ripoff. Which would be hard considering that the Needless manga started years before TTGL. I won\'t stick my head into the sand and deny the similarities, I compare Needless to TTGL in this review on a few occasions myself, but while TTGL builds a strong coming of age story over the top of making fun of old school mecha anime, Needless stays in the sandbox where it feels safe but pushes its limits further there.As you can kinda expect from this type of show, the story is almost non-existent. A mash of dozens of old concepts thrown into a bowl to create a frame for the action, humor and nonstop manliness. What comes as a result is somewhat interesting, but it\'s kept on minimal complexity so it doesn\'t get in the way of the ""important"" elements of the show. On the other hand, the author had some fun with the character\'s special attacks and you can find quite a few references there. Naturally I\'m not talking about ""Mio-chan hip attack"", but things like ""Little Boy"", Dean Drive"" or ""Agnischwattas"". I won\'t call it deep but it\'s still a bit more layered than people would think.When it comes to characters, Needless has a huge list of archetypes, and this is also the point where TTGL fans start coughing blood. The ""main"" hero who likes to solve every situation with his fists (Blade/Kamina), the main heroine who\'s also a little ruff around the edges but makes up with bust size for lack of braincells (Eve/Yoko), a useless wingman for comic relief (Uchida/Kittan) and the timid kid who grows into a man (or not) (Cruz/Simon). The difference is that Needless really goes beyond the limits and centers the characters around their most basic trait, pushing that one aspect as far as possible. It also adds things like pedophile priests, bold old scientists and most importantly an army of lolis ranging from lesbians to androids. And yet, despite being this bottomless pool of one-dimensional fan service sources, there is not a single character in the show who is unlikable and every viewer can find one or two who they truly love. Even the one who was annoying in the anime gets cool later on in the manga. This palette of characters is what really makes or breaks Needless.The graphics are hardly anything special: the character designs are a nice recreation of the manga, while the animation is mostly fluid but not really homogeneous. The music on the other hand is quite worthy of praise. I would be the last person you could call a metal-fan, but the hard hitting power metal BGM of the show is just amazing. Taken from e-Zuka\'s ""I got you under my skin"", from ""Raging Flames"" to ""Elephant\'s Scream"" every track is a perfect match to its respective scenes and gives them the necessary boost.I think that just proves that Madhouse was the right studio for this show. With that said however, it also entails the consequence that Madhouse fans are all too familiar with: abrupt original ending. This case is not nearly as bad as for instance with Claymore, but the changes at the end, along with the severely toned down gore (compared to the manga), resulted in the anime sometimes coming through as more of a shounen than a seinen.So after all that, what makes this mixed bag of shallow elements so special in the end? The entertainment value. The indescribable energy that flows from every scene and gets multiplied by the music to the point that you clench your fist, jump out of your chair and yell ""F**K YEAH!"". The bursts of laughter you get every time said scene gets interrupted for a second with a crazy one-liner. The brainless fun you get from the painful lack of logic in the show. And I think that\'s the keyword, Needless is brainless fun. If you are looking for something more or different, Needless is probably not for you.

But for what it is, Needless is perfect.', ""NEEDLESS to say....While Needless bears many similarities to a previous anime, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, I feel that these comparisons are unfair and often lead to many people rating this series down. Comparing one's work of art with the Mona Lisa is an unfair one, after all.Needless begins off on a very good note, full of high-octane energy and very manly characters. While it is admittedly similar to Gurren Lagann, it really stands in a class of its own. The story... what story? Fans of this series aren't really interested in the story, or at least in my point of view. Its a generic setting...with generic characters. A badass hero, a moe heroine, a kid, an old guy. The characters don't exactly set themselves apart either, with very unoriginal backgrounds.Now that the bad parts are out of the way, let's talk about the good. Where do I start? Needless is full of incredibly good stuff, with fantastic art (although there are some dips in quality here and there, but little enough to ignore). The music, is brilliant. While pretty much unnoticible in most parts of the show, it is when the action kicks off that the music really gets going. Heavy metal riffs with fast beats really serve to get your heart racing during the epic battle scenes. The visuals are good, with a suitable style for a show of its type. They really don't spare on the blood either, which is a good thing (for most people, I trust).Ultimately, NEEDLESS is a series that really focuses on what its good at, and cuts away pretty much else. And what its good at, is providing ENJOYMENT. Yes, the slapstick humour, funny (though not very interesting) characters, the epic battle scenes and heavy metal guitar all combine together to provide an extremely enjoyable series. If you want to have a good time, and aren't really interested in heavy plots, emotional baggage, and complex character development, then NEEDLESS is for you! with generic characters.

This review is for the anime only.Although I\'ve only seen 3 episodes at this point, I think I\'ve seen enough to write a fair review. I\'ll update it later of course to reflect the future scope of the story, because at this time it\'s still not completely clear what\'s really going on. Besides the fact that we know Simeon is evil, what the Needless are, and that they are after Adam Blade.STORY: 7 (Good)The story so far is typical of a...shounen, with nothing really outstanding to set it apart from the rest. It\'s not overly simple though, so I believe it\'s worthy of being called ""Good"".The evil organization, Simeon, is out to exterminate the Needless, which are a sort of ""super-human"" who possess varying abilities (usually one per Needless). One of the main characters, Adam Blade, possesses the strange ability to copy the powers of other Needless he comes in contact with (think Sharingan), and use them all at his leisure. Eve has the Doppleganger ability, and can take the form of others using either a picture, description, or by coming in contact with them. So far, we don\'t know much about Cruz (such as whether or not he may be a Needless but just doesn\'t know it yet), so for now, he plays the part of the currently-weak, developing character that might turn out to be more useful later on.Throw in a couple of thought-provoking elements such as the Black Spot and Adam Arclight, and the stage is set for (potentially) a moderately interesting shounen.ART: 8 (Very Good)While the art isn\'t really top-notch, it\'s well done, and there\'s not much to complain about. Some found that in episode 2 the special attacks were rather bland, due to reused animation and the fact that each character took longer to ""call out"" their attack rather than to actually do it... But I found this little problem less obvious in episode 3. It seems like they cleaned up their act a bit. Episode 3 bumped up my judgement to ""Very Good"".SOUND: 10 (Outstanding)Let\'s face it, the OP rocks. I like the rock music played throughout other parts of the show as well. It\'s nice. I\'m a bit WTF\'d by the ED though, I actually find myself skipping past it every time due to it making my IQ take a temporary plunge, but I won\'t take points away for that... It\'s at the end anyway.CHARACTER: 7 (Good)It\'s about what I\'d expect from a show of its genre. Each character has room to grow, so it has potential. I liked Adam right off the bat, and Eve is definitely doing a good job of keeping the show fun. I\'m not partial to Cruz at all but maybe that will change. As I said, they have room to grow, but by the same token, they\'re nothing special at the moment.ENJOYMENT: 9 (Great)At the end of the day, I enjoy watching this show. This is not the kind of show I have to force myself to get to watching, unlike some other shows I\'m watching at the moment (*cough* Haruhi S2 Endless Eight *cough*). Seeing Adam kick some ass, I\'ll admit, is mindless, plain-old fun. And you\'re always curious as to what Eve will do that episode. Curiosity is a big part of what keeps me coming back for more.OVERALL: 7 (Good)This show has room to grow, and for those of you who judged it after episode 2, at least give it one more. Episode 2 didn\'t sit well with me either particularly, but I found the third episode redeemed everything a little. And after all, who knows where it\'s really going yet?I\'ll keep watching it for sure. I vastly prefer shows that are more thought-provoking, have deep stories, and well developed characters, but to be honest, this show is just fun in it\'s own way. Sometimes it\'s good to throw away the rules and rock out to some over-the-top action.Go watch the OP.

I bet that\'ll have some of you at least trying it out.', ""I feel this show hasn't been getting the love it deserves and I think the only way to rectify this is with a semi thought out and heartfelt review so here I go(it's the first one I ever wrote so be gentle)StoryOkay now get thisit's about bad ass muscle-bound lolicon loving mutant Priest dudewho lives in Japan after several countries decided to bomb them for some reason and so everyone got super powers.He fights an evil organisation filled with other muscle-bound mutant dudes...and some hot 6 year olds girls who also have superpowersthis organisation also has a bunch of bad ass robots that hunt people down.This priest right lives with a hot 14 year old chick who doesn't wear underwear and the bad guy from Mega man, one day on a typical days jogging for the bad ass priest he come across this green haired pussy kid who's being chased by one of the bad ass robots I mentioned earlier,so for some reason he decides to help out the loser and kicks the bad ass robots ass, the kid realising that this priest is totally awesome (something green haired kid could never hope to be)decides to go live with the bad ass priest the hot 14 year old chick and the bad guy from mega man.Then uh a bunch of cool an funny stuff happensArtI can't really say much about this since I don't know too much about it.But it has really bright outlandish colours that look lovely and capture your eyes.It has lovely character designs the characters look pretty distinct in their appearance so you can easily tell who is who though the rare few do look similar.The settings and background art look very appealing,and animation for the characters is fluid and well just great making many ofthe fight scenes look amazing.Animated by the people who made Death note it's about that level I would say.SoundThe soundtrack is filled with rock and roll type stuff which gets you pretty pumped up which is a must for this kinda show.The opening numberSpace cowboy is probably of the coolest and I guess GARest openings your likely to hear.It surprisingly features a couple of classical sounding pieces as well which seems a little weird  for the show but does not at all feel out of place.CharactersLets see you gotBad ass awesome priest with lolicon fetishBad ass awesome hot chick with big rackGreen haired pussy kid (you can ignore him)Dr dude from Mega manand group of other mostly bad ass characterswho would take forever to mention,most of the characters are cool and awesome basically.EnjoymentIf I could give a million points for this I wouldbefore warned thoughonly awesome people who like awesome things will like thisSo watch it nowor elsebtwshow = awesome and some hot 6 year olds girls who also have superpowersthis organisation also has a bunch of bad ass robots that hunt people down.This priest right lives with a hot 14 year old chick who doesn't wear underwear and the bad guy from Mega man, one day on a typical days jogging for the bad ass priest he come across this green haired pussy kid who's being chased by one of the bad ass robots I mentioned earlier,so for some reason he decides to help out the loser and kicks the bad ass robots ass, the kid realising that this priest is totally awesome (something green haired kid could never hope to be)decides to go live with the bad ass priest the hot 14 year old chick and the bad guy from mega man.Then uh a bunch of cool an funny stuff happensArtI can't really say much about this since I don't know too much about it.But it has really bright outlandish colours that look lovely and capture your eyes.It has lovely character designs the characters look pretty distinct in their appearance so you can easily tell who is who though the rare few do look similar.The settings and background art look very appealing,and animation for the characters is fluid and well just great making many ofthe fight scenes look amazing.Animated by the people who made Death note it's about that level I would say.SoundThe soundtrack is filled with rock and roll type stuff which gets you pretty pumped up which is a must for this kinda show.The opening numberSpace cowboy is probably of the coolest and I guess GARest openings your likely to hear.It surprisingly features a couple of classical sounding pieces as well which seems a little weird  for the show but does not at all feel out of place.CharactersLets see you gotBad ass awesome priest with lolicon fetishBad ass awesome hot chick with big rackGreen haired pussy kid (you can ignore him)Dr dude from Mega manand group of other mostly bad ass characterswho would take forever to mention,most of the characters are cool and awesome basically.EnjoymentIf I could give a million points for this I wouldbefore warned thoughonly awesome people who like awesome things will like thisSo watch it nowor elsebtwshow = awesome"", 'NEEDLESS was one of the first anime I started watching as it was airing, when I first got into streaming new shows via fansubs.  The shininess of watching brand-new shows hours after airing in Japan still hadn\'t worn off for me, so that may have somewhat influenced my opinion of the show.  Regardless, NEEDLESS is a crazy, action-packed, explosion- and fanservice-filled ride through a post-apocalyptic wasteland straight out of Fist of the North Star or sCRYed.My reviews have gotten a lot of \'Unhelpfuls\', so I\'m gonna try and stick with the usual format and see if that\'s more palatable.Story - 6/10Unfortunately, this is...NEEDLESS\' weakest point, since it\'s a comedy/action series, the jokes and the fights are really what keep the story running.  The overall plot is pretty much the exact same as the aforementioned sCRYed; an event that devestated part of Japan also gave the survivors mysterious powers, which the heroes use to fight against an evil megacorp trying to run things.  The battle between the two Adams is pretty awesome, but reminds me too much of Cable and Stryfe from the X-Men comics.  Very derivative story but not bad for what it is.Art - 8/10I know the art style turned a lot of people off, but I love the super-exaggerated look of the characters and the action sequences are superbly done.  The girls are all drawn primarily to be easy on the eyes, while the guys all have huge necks, pulsing muscles and multi-pack abs (except for poor little Cruz).  As a parody of over-the-top shonen anime, it\'s appropriate that the art style parody those same conventions.Sound - 10/10Easily NEEDLESS\' best stat.  I loved the music, from the BGM to both OPs and EDs.  I personally prefer ""Modern Strange Cowboy"" to ""Scarlet Bomb"" but they\'re both pretty killer as OPs, and the (in)famous Pretty Girl Squad takes over for the EDs.  The voice acting is very hammy and over-the-top; Adam Blade\'s seiyuu speaks maybe three lines in a normal voice, shouting all the others at the top of his lungs.  And the way he rasps ""Memorized!"" (omoeta) is fucking awesome.Characters - 8/10While few if any of the characters in this series have any real depth, this was never intended to be a series about dialogue and character interaction.  All the characters have one or two traits that are turned up to maximum volume and blasted 24/7; for example, Adam Blade\'s overwhelming arrogance and lolita complex, Eve\'s inability to remember anyone\'s name, and so on.  Still, despite the lack of depth the characters manage to be quite charming, especially the over-the-top hero of the show (Cruz is technically the main character, but Blade\'s the one who does all the fighting).Enjoyment - 9/10This show made me laugh, turned me on with the antics of the Pretty Girls Squad (especially when I first saw the ED, full of mostly-naked girls we hadn\'t even seen yet O_o), and got me pumped up for the crazy over-the-top fights.  Even slamming kanji into the camera\'s face to remind us of the names of the moves got a \'fawk yeah!\' from me.Overall - 9/10Usually story counts for more for me, and I wouldn\'t give such a high overall score to an anime that falls so short in the storyline category.  But as I said, the plot\'s not really what\'s important in this show.  I mean really, what\'s the overarching plot in Lucky*Star?  It\'s an insanely fun and crazy funny parody of shonen stereotypes and does it marvelously.  And interestingly enough, the parts that are parodied the most--the endless battles and in-your-face fanservice--are done about as well as I\'ve seen in the \'serious\' shows.If you don\'t like the pro-wrestling atmosphere of hugely muscled guys and hot chicks in skimpy clothes fighting one another (for often implausible reasons), then you might want to stick to more serious fare.  If you love shonen anime tho and like to laugh at the conventions of the genre, NEEDLESS is definitely worth giving a shot.

But then out of nowhere, ""WE\'RE MODERN STRANGE COWBOYS!"" The moment I heard this song, I knew I may just have found my new favorite anime. Which leads me to say this, the music and overall sound in this series is BEYOND AMAZING! Sound (10)As for that ""Blah blah blah, story line, narrating, etc..."" it is pretty much the gist of the entire story. I suppose settings after World War III are pretty common and that the series is kind of like a mix of Scryed...and Gurren Lagann, but I thought it had a little bit of Ikkitousen/DBZ/shonen-ish in general in the mix too. A bunch of fighting, ecchi, etc... I would definitely recommend those kind of series to anyone who may have liked this show as well. (Even if some of the mainstream shonen have extreme negative criticism from some audiences.) To summarize, even if Needless is doing what has already been done, It\'s doing it RIGHT. Story (10)Having said that just now, I want my readers to know this. This series is NOT, I repeat, NOT the new Gurren Lagann. No, if anything, Gurren Lagann is the new NEEDLESS. The Needless manga started in 2004 and I know this is the anime page, but you have to understand that these concepts all first started here. Mostly, the art and character designs. (And characters in general.) We\'ve got a pretty nice cast, a shota for all the fans of that out there, manly man for all the people who want their fill of ""WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?!"" and the girl who is pretty much the ecchi fan service until all the other girls show up. All of the characters are pretty unique in my opinion and all have their moment to shine. They\'re a group to be remembered, not just some random set of people that are like filler characters from Bleach or Naruto. Art/Animation (10) Characters (10)However, the most important factor of this show, which I think really will determine whether or not you can go through with it entirely... Is the ""Enjoyment"" factor. I could say ""Hey, I watch this show, and I love it!"" But it\'s WAY more than that. I am over here, singing the OP each and every time I watch this, like some kind of weeaboo, raving with my friends at how awesome every single moment of this anime is. We\'ll be over here screaming ""I\'VE MEMORIZED IT!"" ""LITTLE BOY!!!"" ""EVE CANNON!"" and it\'s just the most amazing experience I\'ve ever had in my entire life. Seriously, if I had to say what my feelings were for Needless in a single sentence, it would be something like this.""My Need for NEEDLESS is highest on my list of necessary necessities.""I\'m sad just at the thought that this series has to end. My overall rating of this series and enjoyment is a 10/10 and if you can watch this, pushing aside just the minor little similiarties and ""shonen-aspect"" that this show gives off, you\'ll be able to let loose and enjoy this as much as I do.BE SANITY!!!

(Lol, Ayako, and their subbing errors. This was my first review by the way.)', 'There are probably a ton of things that could be said about Needless, but in the spirit of this series we will just narrow it down to something simple. Needless! is a show you will either like for what it is, or hate it for the very same reasons.Needless is a pretty simple show with an equally simple concept. Have a mix of characters with noticeable personalities brawl it out in a span of 24 episodes, accompanied by some great art, fanservice, GAR, gore, comedy and a fast phased metal soundtrack that won\'t fail to get your blood pumping.In a future where Tokyo has...been bombed and \'black spots\', areas in which people with mysterious abilities roam, exist there is an evil company surrounded with secrets that has settled in the center of the Black Spot and eliminates all opposition. However, a small group of people decide to stand up against this company. Now the plot is in place we are only missing the \'Fight\' and \'Finish him!\' lines and the person they belong to. Ah well.Enter Adam Blade, our very manly main lead. Accompanying him are his sexy sidekick Eve, a kid with no combat abilities, an old geezer, a cool Shinigami girl with a giant sword, a loli half human-half cyborg and a girl with a split personality. On the evil company side we have the usual ultimate evil in human form, Adam Arclight, a mysterious guy warped in bandages, a magician kid and an evil queen type woman with a huge rack. Crew set? Let\'s Brawl.Quiz time. The question is: ""What makes a show with such a simple concept so popular?"" Maybe it are the characters. After all, who expects a priest that turns out to be an insane 12 pack abs devil priest with a lolicon fetish that prefers storing grenades over holy texts in his bible and has some wisdom like this: ""If someone hits you on the left cheek...DO A PILE DRIVER WITH YOUR OTHER!!"" ? Or a sexy girl that can transform any part of her body and comes up with the most unique nicknames since she cannot remember people\'s real names? Or a crazy maid that takes the meaning of split personality to a brand new level?It could as well be the art. It is good to great to stunning at times. Animation is smooth, characters look realistic enough. For Needless, that is. The creators probably also knew they did a nice job with the art, as they even included two moments in the series where the art is a..different kind of stunning. The soundtrack could be the secret behind the series\' success as well. It always seems to come with the right tune at the right moment, something that makes the fights so much more epic and enjoyable to watch. If not that then it probably is the comedy. It is well done and fits the tone of the show, yet does not fail to give you a good laugh every now and then.Needless is a show that may prove either enjoyable or not for the reasons above, but especially on the person watching it. Simple as that. If you are still not sure on what to expect, watch the first opening/ending or simply lock the door to your room, dig up your headphones and marathon the thing. Although the title may be misleading, this show could very well be something that makes a nice addition to your list. been bombed and \'black spots\', areas in which people with mysterious abilities roam, exist there is an evil company surrounded with secrets that has settled in the center of the Black Spot and eliminates all opposition.

Needless is about people who have supernatural powers called fragments that allow them to do wild shit.  The first 7 episodes of this are amazingly badass, it really sucks you in and the story just takes off quick and runs full steam ahead.  I can't really elaborate on the story without giving too much away, but a group of Needless go take on...some badasses early and it starts off chalk full of potential.  the rest will be below.Art was very good for its age, the sound was a little too 80's - 90's rage metal for me, but it wasn't totally out of place.  The voice acting was actually fitting as well.This show has a bit of a weird feel, on one hand it doesn't take itself too seriously, constantly breaking the fourth wall, but on the other gets a little deep for an action fighting anime.  The comedy keeps it afloat early and had me rolling at times.The characters start off strong, but then becomes are major weakness about half way through.**minor spoils**The progression is just too ridiculous.  It starts off so strong you start wondering where this is going and then after 9 or so episodes it just stagnates.  The characters are caricatures of caricatures.  it's got the classic samurai 7 feel to it, gathering the team, all with strong and weak points.  But ultimately the supporting cast were completley irrelevant.  They may have well just left them out since they really just got their asses kicked at every opportunity.when i said the story stagnates at around the midpoint, it's not hyperbole.  MC and crew get trapped in a room for like 9 episodes getting their asses kicked by weak characters and progressively fight stronger characters and the formula repeats until you're sick of it.  The character progression is almost non existent for anyone.  It focuses heavily on the antagonists, which is something i don't really like, and no matter how villainous the antagonists, it becomes obvious there will be no serious resolution.  At least they could have held that card closer to the end to dampen the dissapointment.at the end its the antagonists giving the motivational speeches and teaming up, which literally makes no sense.  the motivations of the antagonists are so flimsy that you cannot possibly reconcile it meaningfully.  You would think throughout the numerous heinous acts committed they may have questioned their role, but ofc they save that shit until the end, which just left a bitter taste.The ending turned into pure DBZ, with so many twists that i subconsciously reached for imaginary nausea pills.To sum this up, it starts off really strong, with interesting plot, characters, and potential and ends with a trainwreck.The actual main character is a weak boy who plays literally no role, in fact i still have no idea what his role was throughout the entire show but he garnered so much screen time I felt his value would be revealed by the end.  It wasn't.  He served no purpose other than to recap episodes.  If you can shut your brain off and watch it for the moments of parody, there is certainly something here.  But the tone is so confused that you can't call this a comedy or parody, you just have to call it a clusterfuck. some badasses early and it starts off chalk full of potential.  the rest will be below.Art was very good for its age, the sound was a little too 80's - 90's rage metal for me, but it wasn't totally out of place.

The action tends to be done fairly well, albeit usually fairly one sided.  The only thing that holds it back from being a 7 is the tendency to needlessly (pun...intended) take time to throw in fanservice.  I\'m not referring to panty shots or jiggle, that\'s almost expected nowadays, I\'m talking about taking a full 24 minute episode to slowly undress the ""Pretty Girl Squad"" with only the actual plot development in about 90 seconds at the end.  Hopefully they won\'t pull something like that again.ART: The character designs themselves are good, they just seem out of place.  Adam Blade looks like he belongs, but most of the other characters have designs more fitting for Romantic Comedies like Asu No Yoichi.SOUND: Nothing to complain about here, the OP is very good, the ED while a bit out of place is rather catchy, and as I\'ve said, Needless covers it\'s action fairly well, including BGM.  The voices all work, the only thing they need to work on is attack names, they seem a bit random, but that\'s more a script issue.CHARACTER: The characters are for the most part fairly good.  Adam Blade\'s lolicon tendencies are rather entertaining.  And as lolworthy as the existence of a ""Pretty Girl Squad"" is the members are rather likeable and the loli actually makes sense as a ""cute bruiser"" type rather than just fetish fuel.  The only pointless one is Cruz, who is so useless to anything no one even cares to remember his name.ENJOYMENT: The series grew on me after a couple episodes, it\'s definitely fun to watch, it just has a few facepalm moments here and there that detract from the series.OVERALL: Needless is worth watching.  If you aren\'t really a moe fetishist and are more a straight up action fan you should probably give it a few episodes to try to let the intial anachronism feeling wear off.

We call those anime, ‘Needless’.To describe what needless is; it focuses on multiple theme of being manly, being comical, being serious, being eechi but also being ridiculous itself. It’s anime for ‘GAR’ I can say. Spammed action sequences take majority of this anime, and there are tons of plot holes even on those actions. It follows typical shonen style plot and full of clichés. There is nothing good about anime except the fact that you will actually enjoy it regardless to how horrible it is.Actually, it’s...even more generic than you can think. There is useless boy who is reluctant to become a main character. There is a hothead, but also useless support character, screaming ‘LIIIITTLEEEE BOOOOOOOOOI’. There is ‘wanna-be-Kamina’ Blade man who smells like GAR barbecue. There is evil one, who is evil. They killed them of one by one. They have 4 mighty ones, and one ultimate boss, Adam Arclight. It is so generic, that makes it way too much predictable.Honestly, there is no real plot there. It’s just fighting sequences that make this anime worth with screaming of characters all over the place. Over-the-top actions and series of panty shots. That’s all about it. Regardless, let’s talk about how story of Needless goes. First, there was Cruz. He met some hot-headed manly dudes and girls. They made a crew. There is an enemy to fight by default. They just fight. They went to boss lair. They fight again. Soon they meet boss. Fight. Done, it’s the end of the story.One of the worst aspects of this series is pacing. Seriously, at first, it went fast; although it was ridiculous overall, pacing was not that bad. After that, they  got trapped in that gigantic room with pretty girl squads for about… I don’t know, about 6 ,7 episodes? That’s ridiculous. They could’ve at least provide some other background other than that. It screwed up some of enjoyment I had when they were just laughing and kicking around before they went there. Actions are dragged out so much, due to extremely detailed explanations and ANALyses on each move and some babbling, waiting, shoutings that character does. Plot holes are so big; you will have plenty of time wondering; ‘Why are they even waiting for 15 minutes in the middle of fight just to allow enemies to have a think time?’.However, the worst thing is probably that they failed to manage to keep the consistent and interesting plot itself. First 1/3 of the series was probably better in terms of fighting, or w/e. Later, it suddenly gets serious. Every aspect is basically ‘spammed’. It spams this serious and unserious mood about 10 times during one episode. Spammed slap stick comedies are timed so badly, most of time it ruins the mood horribly. There are so much spam of out-of-circumstance-bloods and nudities. Some plot twists are not actually a twist, since they were mostly predictable. It’s just spammed with absurdity. Funny thing is, ‘Side stories’ of needless were much better than its ‘Main story’. I enjoyed the entire support episode that those not contains the main stories. For example, flashback episode of Blade was better than Blade fighting with Arclight.Art, was terrible. No, it surely was. Starting with character design first; characters are overly muscular and females are overly… um ‘something’. Their body shape all looks exactly same, so does their faces. Design of Cruz is probably the worst here, look at his neck first of all. They all looks like some kind of mass produced clones with different hair style and costumes. Speaking of clothes, they are even worse. Oh hell, they are just ‘LAUGHABLY ABSURD’. Extremely wide collars, un-matching colours… Those costumes are also, almost same for every single characters. The worst, is costume of Disk-san. She wears pyjama from the start to the end and it is clothes that someone like your grandmothers would wear. Action part animations sometimes become choppy, such as the part where they are screaming their ridiculous attack names. Other than that, animation was overall just fine.Sound aspect was as poor as its art. Some audio effects are completely out of circumstances and break apart the atmosphere. OP was fine but it showed how spamming English language in J-pop can be resulted being ridiculous for actual English users. Ending… I better not describ; it’s lolicon fetishes. Well, that makes sense, since two things I can remember in Needless is spam of ‘LIIIITTLEEEE BOOOOOOOOOI’ and kawaii shots. Seiyuus send their most time… screaming. They sound all monotonous; you can’t say the difference between the voice Blade and Arclight when they are speaking, since they speak with exactly same emotion every single time. Moreover, the problem in their speech existed from the start; the title of, ‘Needless’ itself. Those who do not know English people might think its fancy name for calling super heroes, but I personally think it’s ridiculous. Also, there are some extremely uncomfortable attack names that seized me in pain, such as ‘LIIIITTLEEEE BOOOOOOOOOI’, ‘Dean Drive Fox Hound’, ‘Magnetic Worldo’ and even ‘Doppelganger’. They are spammed throughout the whole series and may decay your ear at the end of the series. Seriously, ‘LIIIITTLEEEE BOOOOOOOOOI’ is just the worst thing I’ve ever heard. I cried for overuse of misused English…There is not much to say about characters, since they are, generic. They have nothing except of being brave or following some same clichés that shonen suffers most of the time.Blade, despite of having some spam of irritating lolicon loving part, succeeded of being one of the coolest, and manliest one I’ve ever seen. Other than that, characters development and description is pretty much ‘dead’. They are empty, including Blade. They are just overridden by their cool abilities and failed to show what they have inside. Only one who actually showed that was Saten, but others; none existence. In terms of comical relief and some interesting plot, pretty girl squad and Eve was the only ones who were ‘interesting’.Yes yes, I can ignore everything. However, I just couldn’t stand that Cruz guy. He is the worst character in this series. Everything is on his point of view, yet what he do get kicked and punched to death while everyone is fighting. The part where I died was when everyone is saying, ‘YOUR ONLY ABILITY IS THAT YOU CAN FUCKIN THINK’. Guys, everyone can think, even the most foolish person in this earth. They are all just common senses that Cruz has. Oh wait, maybe because that everyone in his crew is too dumb to even find out what ability of making things freeze and burn at the same time. (Temperature) And, in this part, we find one big plot hole. In his crew, there is a android who lived 300 with super computer brain, and there is also a doctor, who was one of the most professional scientist in the past. It makes absolutely no sense that Cruz becoming the only one who can ‘think’.Eve is the only one character that makes this series at least a level of watchable. She is cool and very manly in terms of her spirit, which makes her only of the most ‘manlike female’ in the anime universe and also the best character of this series.Needless is a terrible and good at the same time. Although it was spammed with ridiculous comedies, ‘LIIIITTLEEEE BOOOOOOOOOI’, bad art, monotonous voices, bad English, plastic muscularity and ‘Ability to THINK’, it was very very enjoyable, like most of shonen stuffs. Somehow, character success of at least not being dull. Actions are cool and so does their abilities. There are scenes that you can say, ‘hell this is just awesome’. Dragged episodes cut these enjoyments in half, but whatever. It is still enough.So, in conclusion, Needless failed to become over the average anime in terms of its quality etc. every aspect. However, it was still enjoyable whatsoever. Needless will be forgotten, and I also do not particularly recommend watching this anime, but I can be sure that it was quite an experience having manliest characters and cutest females in one series with awesome superpowers. even more generic than you can think.

Well, I decided to give it a try and began watching this. The voice actors were for the most part pretty unknown ones to me, they haven\'t been in any other animes that I have seen, at least ,not in any positions from which I would remember them.It soon became pretty clear, that the anime isn\'t your typical shounen beat up...anime, because at least I have an image, that they usually have storylines that take themselves pretty seriously, and they don\'t really cultivate humor that much. This anime, however, seemed to be pretty humor based, and it wasn\'t trying to hide it\'s pure fan service either. As I watched the show, I noticed that I might actually like those shounen animes which I mentioned before, since I enjoyed all the fighting scenes and over the top charismas of the characters and muscles and everything that just screams ""fuck yeah, I am the real man"". That combined with the humor that I actually found to be pretty funny, it looked like this was going to be one really good anime to watch.I also liked the art of this anime, although there wasn\'t anything special on it, it was just fit for this anime, that\'s pretty much all I can say about it, not bad and not anything special. The music however, was so goddamn good. The music fits perfectly in the background of the battles. The music is just full of testosterone and it fits perfectly in the speedy and epic fighting scenes, making them even more enjoyable. I also liked the first OP of the show, for the same reason as I liked the background music of the show. The metal music just fits here perfectly and that\'s why I highly disliked the other OP. I Liked some of the characters, but, as it is with many other animes, the main character (or one of the main ones, I am not really sure), Cruz,  is pretty bland and boring character, but luckily the other characters make up for that. Adam is a bad ass character that I liked for the sole reason of him being an awesome ass kicker and really over the top confident character, which raises the testosterone count of this anime to the point that it\'s just so goddamn awesome that you can\'t hate it. The other characters also function well and they form a pretty good character roster, but Adam alone is one reason to watch this anime.As I said in the beginning, this anime is pretty humor and fast action based anime, but the story is also pretty interesting. However, the anime doesn\'t really utilize it that well, and I personally think that it doesn\'t have to. I think it was the writer\'s plan to make this anime more action and humor based one, and not focus to the story that much. And I think that\'s fine, the reason why I enjoyed this anime is because of the fast paced action and all over the top fights, manliness and humor, not the story. Don\'t get me wrong though, the story is, at times, interesting, but it\'s wasn\'t the reason for me to watch this anime. That being said, in the end, the story of this anime gets much bigger role than in the beginning. This was expected: there were many things that were unexplained, so it was kind of a good thing, since those things are explained in the end, but at times, it kinda felt like a forced drama, not to the point of annoyance luckily, so it didn\'t really kill the feeling of this anime.The fanservice also has a huge role in this anime. And in an anime like this, it doesn\'t really bother me, actually, I must say that some part of me might actually like it, I mean c\'mon, who doesn\'t like pantsus? If this anime would be a serious one though, then it might kinda kill the feeling, but in this kinda anime, it\'s not a bad thing.To summarize all this, I say that if you expect this to be an anime that has a deep and serious storyline, you probably won\'t like it, but if you just love all the action, over the top personalities, fighting and the humor, then you will enjoy this. anime, because at least I have an image, that they usually have storylines that take themselves pretty seriously, and they don\'t really cultivate humor that much.

A bomb was dropped on Tokyo city and as a result, some people gained strange powers like controlling fire or water or having great speed or strength and stuff like that (much similar to that in Sekirei). These people were given the name Needless (which is also the anime's title if you hadn't noticed). This anime is a perfect combination of action and comedy together with time to time ecchi.The story in this anime is quite good. It's basically about a group of Needless fighting another group which is oppressing them. The story has...progressed quite well. From start to end everything is in perfect order. They gave a pretty decent introduction as to what is happening and also gave a satisfying ending to the story which sort of ends the possibility that the anime will get a second season and continue with the manga. Anyway, it really won't matter that much when you finish the anime.Voice acting done was pretty decent. It wasn't like they were doing it on gunpoint or anything. It was pretty good. The artwork was also well done. It was well done and matched the sheer violence this anime had to offer. The way the action scenes were shown was also quite good.All the characters in Needless had perfect roles in the anime's story. All introduced characters had perfect and important roles in the story. Along with a role in the story, all characters had something funny happen to them which was very well done and these scenes decreased the overall seriousness which most animes of the action genre have. This anime is one of the best animes I have seen yet. I enjoyed every part of it. It's just full of comedy. Whenever a scene got too serious or emotional, something funny was thrown in to lighten up things. Even the finale, which is supposed to be a very serious and/or emotional episode, also had comical scenes around every corner. A scene did not go too long without some comical scene in it.Needless is a great anime. The violence might be too bloody but the excess comedy more than makes up for that. The way bloody violence and comedy have been mixed in this anime has made it quite different from the rest where most action animes are often serious. This great combination of action and comedy is what makes this anime awesome.I am open to suggestions. Feel free :-) progressed quite well. From start to end everything is in perfect order.

It was first aired in Dec, 2009 but only found this particular anime about 2 weeks ago. Didn\'t watch it right away, but when i watched the first episode, i couldn\'t stop watching.Very few Anime\'s hook me like this one. It reminded me of Gurren Laggan for some reason. I\'m not very versed in the Anime lingo, i cant tell you that this is a seinen or shounen or what not. I just watch them cuz i enjoy watching anime. Doesn\'t really matter to me what it\'s called do don\'t expect anything...on this review to have that much depth. All i am here to do is tell you what i think... and i think this is a great Anime to have. So lets go down to the scores...Story - 7: - Well i rated this a 7 because as I\'ve said before theres nothing new here. Post apocalyptic world with people that have super powers and theres one nut that tries to rule the world and the heroes goes out and stop him. Altho if you go to the story, that really wasnt their goal, it just happened to end that way, which made for an amusing story.Art - 8: - I gave this an 8. To often do i see anime that is consistent throughout the series. There will be a few episodes that seems that the producers used a different animator. For this series, it didn\'t come often, and the ones that did, turned to to be a more stylized and a rush job. In anycase Gurren Laggan had the same thing.Sound - 7: - Well nothing spectacular here just good. There were sounds, and background music but nothing that really popped out as good or bad. Opening and ending themes were standard and ordinary, even now as i\'m writing this review i cant remember the Intro and Ending music. It isn\'t bad either, its just there and unremarkable.Characters - 9: - Here is where it gets interesting. Without going into details and bordering on becoming a spoiler, the characters they had were interesting to say the least. Everything from am anti-hero hero, cute girls that constantly show their underwear, to multiple personalities and character types, including the "" cliché"" types that are abound in any anime genre.Enjoyment - 9: - I had a blast with this anime. Every episode was either entertaining, Amusing, to total laughter. It was enjoyable to say the least. It pokes fun at every anime you can imagine, and most of the time, it makes fun of itself. There are times where the characters are even aware that they are in an anime and make fun of each other. Lines like ""I cant believe that a minor character like you without powers is even in an anime like this.."" just takes the cake in making fun out of everything. And when it seems that it couldn\'t get any better, they snuck in a love story without you noticing it. Man, that caught me off guard. In anycase Total Enjoyment start to end.Overall - 8: - I have the overall score an 8. It could have been higher but i\'m just going on the average. Story and sound gout it down to an 8 instead of a 9. But don\'t let that 8 fool you, if you enjoy a good laugh or just tired of serious anime, and just want senseless fun, this is the anime for you. I highly recommend you watch this. As always, if your not sure, Download the first episode and watch it, It it doesn\'t tickle your fancy than don\'t continue, for me at least, the first episode was enough for me to say Hell yeah.. on this review to have that much depth.

I really didn't like the whole Chibi Mecha theme in Gurren Lagann. Anywho, this anime is EPIC in terms of story, characters and ACTION. I think this anime has it all: fan-service, epic fight, supernatural abilities, and ... blood and gore. If you were a fan of Gurren Lagann or even a fan of action genre-based animes, please do consider watching this series. I highly recommend it. "", 'Final verdict and tl;dr for convenience:Needless has no redeeming qualities when it comes to being as basic of a concept as a shonen duke-it-out. It\'s a poor and a mecha-less attempt of capitalizing on the hype for TTGL\'s ""post-apocalyptic rebels with an attitude"", and as such, it is rushed and bare-bones. I seriously recommend a critical re-watch if you somehow thought that anything above 6/10 is deserved, but I understand if you judge your anime by your personal watching experience.---The visual style and premise seem alluring, until you start watching it.

I don\'t mean like ""oh neat, this is a simplified black & white raster to intensify the feeling of speed and intensity"", I mean it like lazy and forgotten. There are unfinished sections within, and it\'s very blatant. For that alone, I cannot recommend this rushjob.Needless\' noticeable storytelling and character tropes include, but are not limited to:-clothing damage-constant peep-shotting, regardless of the previous-power lobbing-plot armor & strength (guy who is losing by all accounts suddenly just wins the fight)-stretching jokes and story recapping to hit the episode time-useless characters-pure lack of context and ideasThe story is actually not basic, just bad. After the nuclear war, sections of the world have become barren wastelands. Yup, it\'s just SECTIONS of destroyed, plantless/lifeless landscape, not the actual whole world, with people scrounging for scraps and living a generally shitty life. There is nary an explanation for this. Then comes a medicine megacorporation gone bad with the intent of... well, if there was an intent, I\'m sure it was hidden in the later episodes to justify one or two evil speeches. The big bad wants one of the characters for his plans and so lures the good guys into their home base after two destroyed goons.The main character, the shota, has little to no relevance to the actual storyline. The supposedly actual main character (voiced by Takehito Koyasu, DIO for one) is a thunderhead whose main trait beyond plot armor and stronkest ability is his comedic relief trump card, that is, going full Sanji on >12 yr old girls. The other main and side characters are either useless and/or boast tropes as their only defining traits.OST, apart from op/ed, is some nice-sounding, yet pretty basic metal guitaring.

There is no real storyline, and the little that is there is not amazing..It was interesting enough for me to watch the whole series.  I love anime with action and this is action packed, with cool abilities for each character.  I do enjoy that but to compare it to Gurren Lagan..give me a break, that was still to this day one of the best anime I have seen, and although I enjoyed needless...to a certain extent it is still my lowest rated anime on my list.  I know I have not seen a whole lot of anime, but enough to get on this site make a profile and continue to be addicted to anime and watch it everyday, and will continue to watch anime for the rest of my life.  Now don't let this deter you from watching this anime.  It is enjoyable because of all the action and cool different powers.  It does have a whole bunch of characters so that is a plus as well, but you don't grow attached to any like you do in Gurren.  Shit I cried during that anime.  You are not shedding tears for needless that is for sure...and the ending for needless...meh to a certain extent it is still my lowest rated anime on my list.

To me, I am fine with moe. I only enjoy this anime is because of the characters and the funny plot combined with great action scene. I don\'t come and watch this anime just because of panty shots.Episode 14 is the most funny part when Adam Blade says ""The reason is Girls. You look like a young girl and I\'m already in paradise"".To me, all the characters are badass and I like most of the characters except for Curz Schild. At least Cruz Schild instructed people in the last...episode which was good. All the cast do not show me things that I don\'t like (crybaby, whiny, arrogant)My 2 favorite characters are: Seto & Solva. They are badass females. You know I really love to see badass females even badass lolicons. Seto uses gravity power while Solva uses Magnetic World. Solva\'s powers reminds me of Magneto who uses magnetic powers. Wow an epic combination of x-men with cute girls.The art and animation looks fun just like Soul Eater. I really wanted to see action combined with humour otherwise it will not be fun to watch at all. I also wanted to see action at least my some badass female save the day like Revy from Black Lagoon. Adam Blade is a very cool guy who is badass.Every character is unique in a lot of ways which makes this anime even more fun to watch.I will recommend people this anime who are into fun and action scene with some panty shots.

It is not the typical ""Oh there\'s (insert generic bad guys here) lets go punch him lots!"" type.

However, I can't give it more than a 7, because it is all mashed together. Not a single genre is taken to its fullest, but simply left at the basic level. It leaves a lot to be desired and I'm under the impression that the original story, characters and action were supposed to be awesome and would have been, but there just wasn't time to develop any of it in mere 24 episodes. Also, there are a few ''aw, come on!'' moments. "", ""Do you like priests? Do you like repetitiveness? Do you like panty shots all the time? If yes then this is the anime for you!!!I am not going to tell you the plot since I am sure many other review probably already told you it. I am here to tell you what I think!You may be asking, why is it repetitive? The jokes that is how. Some of the jokes lag through from beginning to the end. But other than those there are some really nice ones that keep things interesting. There is also a plot so there is an actual ending to the anime....The way they tie things together and really do not leave any whole left to fill was really nice to see. I did however get bored at the end was happy for it to end. But it still goes on the all time for it's creativeness and the panty shots and stuff because, well I am a guy so it has more effect on me. I would recommend this to any that read this but not to my parents, they would probably judge me on my choice of anime.

In this stranger version of Japan there are weird stand out features that a lot of viewers cannot comprehend.Basically world three started quite a while ago, as weapons where passed around and altered and then finally fired at Japan it created what many people including the authorities and goverment call the black spot. And it is what it's called, the...skies black and it is a abandoned wasted land with nothing living, nothing inhabiting the area and nothing will ever change the black spot or change it any way.When the bomb hit and created the black spot, anyone who was in the area or near the bomb site then the would of been turned into what everone calls a needless or they would of been killed by the blast. Eventually people tried to inhabit the surronding areas and attempted to live within the black spot. Until a company named Simeon built a ginormous building in the centre of the black spot with seriously high security and governers from all over the world coming to visit so they could finally learn and find out what a Needless is and why they exsist. When rumours got out about everyone in the Simeon Company being a Needless there where riots and resistance groups that joined forces to go head on with Simeon..... All of which have ultimately failed at taking down the company.This is when we start to meet our main characters, Cruz is the first. This series starts off with the Resistance attempting to ambush Simeon, which fails, and two members trying to flee the battle ground to find somewhere else to stay until the fights die down. Unfortunetly though there is only one main character found from this particular scene. unfortunetly Cruz's older sister Nee-San is destroyed by a Testament robot (From Simeon). Cruz than has to find his way around the sewers in an attempt to get away from this robot before it appears again and takes his life too. Once he's in the sewers he manages to find the time to break down and cry over the lose of his dead sister, which then leads to the Testament breaking the concrete floor to get to Cruz in an attempt to take his life away too. Until a mysterious man wearing a choker and no shirt appears and takes down the Testament in front of Cruz.This ladies and gentlemen is our next main character, he never goes by his normal name so everyone just calls him Blade. His real name is Adam and everyone knows him as the memorization Needless, he won't use his power a lot but will use it if he's in danger or someone else his, he doesn't abuse his powers and he hates Simeon. Others we meet later on in some other episodes; like eve and Blades scientist.Cruz; As he has no powers at all he struggles quite a lot when it comes to survivng without his sister in this newly found world.He is a slightly awkward character, whenever someone upsets him he runs the other way to get away for a while.....It never works. He's a small character in the series as he has no powers or any special skills that he can use against Simeon; but he plays the most important role as our lead character who tries to come to terms with the newly found Simeon ruled Japan. He doesn't really like working for his new found friends but it's the only thing he can do as his sister and everyone else he ever knew was murdered in a matter of seconds; due to this he has to slave around for the new found friends until Cruz can stand on his own two feet..... Which will be never in this series as you can not magically earn powers like the ones that the Needless have. For starts the fanservice in this brings out the slightly funnier side of Cruz; he's the stereotypical main boy in the series as his nose bleeds a considerable amount when a naked girl appears and he seems to turn Chibi for some reason. But all in all he is a good lead character, he may be lacking some characteristics which we would rather see than a weak boy; but i think doing this makes a bit of a change for the series and the story line within it.Blade; As he has all of the power anyone can ask for he is the perfect character to be holding the spot light whenever Cruz hasn't run off or started crying for some unknown reason. But he hasn't got all of the powers in the world actually; his Needless power is the power of manipulation. In other words when he sees his opponent using a strong move than his brain automatically copies the move and uses it against them as he's more powerfull than most of the people we see him fight. Which means that over this series of anime we see Blade using tons of elements to fight with against others and completely random moves like the godly string one that we see in some of the earlier episodes of Needless. Eventually there are tons of other weirdly wonderfull whacky moves we see him posess but non of them apart from the fire element ones actually stood out to me; there is one thing that stands out though, it may only be small but it can indicate to the audience when the fight gets serious. We see a quick glimpse of Blades brain surronded by multi-coloured waves of energy, afterwards it usually says manipulation complete or something along those lines, But this only happens when he's being seriously serious in a fight.The anime is seriously good but i think the character designs and the story have to be the best thing out of the series. The fight scenes are usually short and not to violent; if they are long it's usually filled in by a lot of talking to the opponent. The graphics are ok i guess usually on high quality 3D moments; e.g. a car moving or a quick flash forward for the audience to show use where the next bad guy is. Even though i've done the review i think i'll still keep on watching the anime as i actually love the charcaters and their fighting styles.Saturday 27th April, 2013.       11:44 Pm     ~AmyXxx skies black and it is a abandoned wasted land with nothing living, nothing inhabiting the area and nothing will ever change the black spot or change it any way.When the bomb hit and created the black spot, anyone who was in the area or near the bomb site then the would of been turned into what everone calls a needless or they would of been killed by the blast.

Needlessly violent, needlessly stupid, and needlessly likeable for some reason. It’s replete with action, comedy, and enough fan service to make Kokonoe Rin blush, but it comes across as almost a parody half of the time instead of something really trying. At least, toward the beginning. The end tries to take a more serious route and while it does succeed, it succeeds in giving us a cliche story that could have been left out and still maintain the integrity of the show. If there were no back story it could have been a parody or a comedy but...with that background it seems like it’s actually trying to be something real.It’s hard to classify Needless as anything because of this. It’s shounen, but is it a comedy or an action story? While it can be both, it changes tone so fast you don’t know what hit you.StoryThere is a story to this series, which I found strange at first because the series starts with what appears to be a very basic plot of an evil corporation full of super-powerful people fighting a resistance of super powerful people. But later on we get a background plot of science experiments and creating god and all kinds of really  biblical stuff that is trying to make the show sound smarter than it really is. And the problem with the story in the series is it follows the same basic plot as Trigun and Trinity Blood. Spoiler The good guy and bad guy are experiments, pretty much brothers. And they are both called Adam to go with Eve. Which is a lot like Cain and Abel from Trinity Blood.While I can accept the biblical parts, it just seems needless (Ba-ba-ching). There’s also a thin plot about the main character, Cruz’s sister but none of it is really that great. The story is weak and there seems to be a bit too much of it toward the end when we’ve been exposed to fight scene after fight scene mixed with comedy, breaking the flow of things.In other words, don’t come to Needless expecting quality story-telling.If it were to boil down to anything, Needless is the story of a bunch of people with powers in a post-apocalyptic world where they fight each other formulaicly for twenty-four episodes.AnimationI had no problem with the animation. Characters looked a lot like those from Gurren Lagann which was a bit of a problem at first (Cruz=Simon)(Eve=Yoko)(Blade=Kamina). But it doesn’t matter, the animation is perfectly fine, though it isn’t amazing. It’s average.SoundI decided to watch the dubbed version and wasn’t surprised that there were quite a few voice actors who were god awful, including Cruz’s sister who had to have been played by a robot. I guess the main characters did competently but…you know. I don’t expect much from my dubs.The first opening and ending song for the show is good, but the second opening and ending isn’t. Within the show, the heavy metal soundtrack is pretty good.CharactersBelieve it or not, the characters in this show are average! There are a lot of characters but very few actually stand out. Blade is a lolicon priest who is probably the funniest character in the show, Cruz is an emo kid, Eve is a ditzy girl with big boobs. There’s a scientist who states the obvious or reiterates what somebody has just said.There are the girls of the Beautiful Girl Squadron, all of whom have no substance, though I like the seemingly mute lesbian one, Kuchinashi. The bad guy, Adam Arclight, is generic.So, not much to talk about in this department.OverallAn anime that prides itself on violence, panty shots, and comedy? It has to be good right? Fight scenes are too damn long, and when you have a twenty-four episode anime, you don’t want to stretch out ten episodes as one fight scene in the same room. Seriously, from episode nine to nineteen or so the show takes place in a single room. It gets rather boring and so does the anime. It starts fast-paced and promising but ends rather dully. I heard that the fight scenes in this show were some of the best in anime and I would like to tell the person who said that to suck it because the fight scenes in this show were lame and basic. I was not impressed by this show at all, but it was a decent distraction. It had some good moments, a lot in fact, but it was just so trite and basic and as it continued it tried to inject story but failed. with that background it seems like it’s actually trying to be something real.It’s hard to classify Needless as anything because of this. It’s shounen, but is it a comedy or an action story? While it can be both, it changes tone so fast you don’t know what hit you.StoryThere is a story to this series, which I found strange at first because the series starts with what appears to be a very basic plot of an evil corporation full of super-powerful people fighting a resistance of super powerful people.

I found myself laughing pretty often and I enjoyed the action. While its nothing groundbreaking in any way. It gets what ist supposed to get done right.The story is probably the weakest part of this anime. While its pretty simple its entertaining enough and interested me enough to where I could sit down and binge watch 6-10 episodes at a time even after seeing this Anime 5 or 6 times already.The Humor is probably what I enjoy most about the series. The Characters are pretty...one dimensional but since it is a comedy anime you cant really expect complex characters. I really enjoyed the Beautiful Girl Squadron. They made me chuckle the most probably. and really I found most of the characters to have a charm to them that made me really enjoy them despite that.The Art style is pretty good  as well as the animation. Certainly has its own unique look to it. The voice acting was mostly really good Some were just so-so. I also really enjoyed the music.Its most likely going to be an anime that hit or a miss with most. f you dont like its brand of humor the action might be what saves it for you. Its a lot of over the top fighting which is enjoyable to watch.If you are looking for a complex anime , well then this isn't it. Its made to be silly fun and for me it got that right. Hell I'd even love  a sequel even though this anime doesnt need one. I recommend it if you like comedy/action anime. one dimensional but since it is a comedy anime you cant really expect complex characters. I really enjoyed the Beautiful Girl Squadron.

Most of them are evil working under Adam Arclight who is basically a god.Speaking of gods, the powers of the Needless are basically abilities from the Second who is basically Jesus.

She is also insanely powerful with cool moves like a turning her arm into a drill. She is bad with names so she nicknames everyone. She needs a lot of calories to fight at full power which is why she drinks some weird soda with 5000 calories.Schild Cruz is a child without Super Powers but he makes up for it with his analytic abilities which serve as crucial means to beat any Needless they encounter. He is often victim of comic relief jokes and punishment.There are other amazing characters too with my favorite being Setsuna who has the Fragment (basically what the abilities of Needless are called) Speed who is basically the leader of the main Pretty Girl Squad the protagonists encounter. But there is also a mysterious character named Saten who's intentions aren't clear and some green haired masked woman.The show is amazing but often it doesn't take itself serous.

Midori no Hibi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/330/Midori_no_Hibi,"[""How would you ever feel if you went to sleep one day, tired of not having a girlfriend, and the next morning you woke up to find out that a girl who likes you had taken the place of your right hand? Or if you liked a guy but were too shy to tell him, and then you woke up to see that you were the dude's right hand? It's an impossible situation, you would say, but that's what's so great about anime: Anything can happen! A high schooler whose reputation as a delinquent scares away any girl he tries to hit on, Seji Sawamura,...and a timid girl who's had a crush on him for a long time, Kasugano Midori, are thrown into this very situation. Do we sense romance coming up? Definitely! Comedy? Has to be! Action? Uh, maybe... Ecchi? What!?No, I am not kidding, the show has all that, with the main focus on the first two. Because when your right hand loves you, that's bound to escalate into a romantic comedy, right? Midori no Hibi (Midori's Days) executes a somewhat standard living-together romantic comedy setting with a refreshing twist, and also does a great job of not leaning too much towards the ecchi side of things. You see some topless females now and then and some bikini shots, but that's all you really get, and after bad experiences with ecchi-intensive shows like Kanokon and Rosario+Vampire, I'm very delighted to see a show that manages to keep it on a decent level and focus on something else. Action scenes are scattered around too; our blond main character is a delinquent after all.The episodes of Midori no Hibi does nothing special; each episode features a new (mis)adventure in the now jumbled-up lives of Seji and Midori. Be it an otaku who thinks Seji is a doll maniac, a girl who really likes Seji or a trip to a hot spring, you'll be taken through a lot of before-seen situations, and some new. The ending is cute and happy, and when you think about it, the only good ending an anime as Midori no Hibi could have. And while the unoriginal way in which the final episode is played out comes off as borderline facepalm-provoking, it was still an enjoyable watch, right up until the final scene.One of the things I love the most about Midori no Hibi-- No, the thing I do love the most about it is the whole concept about bringing out what's on the inside of oneself, both feelings of love and supressed personality traits. While the characters don't develop much in the sense that their personalities actually change, they do develop by bringing out feelings of love or personality traits which are in ways hidden from others. And while we have all seen the soft-on-the-inside delinquent and the timid girl, the producers have done a good job with them in regards to the aforementioned aspect. And who can forget the uptight and determined yet tender Takako Ayase whose unrequited feelings of love towards Seji never comes to play, or the otaku who seemingly had a more human side to him inside, but in the end was no more than a crazed otaku anyway? When all comes to all, the cast isn't extremely original nor large, but a lovable gang nevertheless.The quality of the animation is quite good for this kind of series. The whole story takes place in a city, and there's frequent scenes on high places with scenic views of said city, which are usually animated quite well, from lights in the streets to the monorails criss-crossing the cityscape. Street views of the city and other close-ups such as furniture in rooms are usually beautiful and detailed, but the quality does deteriorate from time to time. The strongest point however, is found in the gorgeous lighting and shading effects. They are eminently soft and relaxing, and especially during the dusk scenes do they come off as tremedous. The character designs are in an entirely different class however, as they are very varying in quality; often no more than mediocre yet often very good. A few close-ups looked like simple Flash animations, while at times they were detailed and fluid, both in design and movement.The soundtrack was more than likely the weakest part of the anime. Not that it was outright bad; it was in fact quite atmospheric and fit well with the series, but there were no outstanding songs in the background music, and they were quite standard-fare for a romantic comedy. Two mellifluous themes for the opening and ending make up for some of it however, and the voice acting is superb too; the seiyuu manage to portray the characters very well, both their current mood and their character types.You may have noticed how I used 'soft' or some variant of it frequently in my review (was there some anti-aliasing feature for this show I didn't notice was on?), and that's just what it was. Soft, happy and cute. And just the right length to make it stay that way. If it was one season longer, I'm dead certain the show's quality would have worsened. And part of its charm is that it is such a short watch anyway. If you want a show that's short and charming, Midori no Hibi is the show for you! and a timid girl who's had a crush on him for a long time, Kasugano Midori, are thrown into this very situation.

Its manga run is done as well, having run from January 18th, 2003 to October 18th, 2004 in Shogakukan's magazine Shonen Sunday.  Viz is releasing the manga Stateside, and the final volume (number eight) will be out Stateside October 10th.  Media Blasters did a dub of Midori no Hibi, translated as Midori Days, and the final volume (number three) was released back in 2005.Story: Seiji Sawamura is a high schooler who likes to get into...fights, and has an infamous &quot;devil's right hand&quot;; however, this doesn't have the greatest reprecussions for his love life (he's asked out twenty girls and been rejected by them all as of late). Midori is a girl who has a crush on Seiji, but can't work up the courage to talk to him.One morning after lamenting the night before that he'll be stuck with no one but his right hand for a companion the rest of his life, he wakes up to Midori on his right hand....Yeah.The situation is pretty odd, to say the least, but, oddly enough, it works out really well, especially as a comedy.  The romance between the two is really sweet to watch as the series unfolds.  Midori is amazingly sweet, upbeat, and dotes over Seiji at every given changce. Oddly enough, she doesn't get on my nerves like most of her character types do.  And even though Seiji has a tough-guy image and can be oblivious to Midori at points, he does show his soft side more than once.Episodes, more often than not, follow what I've dubbed the triple F formula -- fighting, fanservice, and fluff.  Episodes seem to be polarized: they tend to either be really good, or really sucky, with none hitting any marks between.  These two points are probably the only drawbacks to the story.Art Style: The animation was done by Studio Pierrot, which also did the anime for Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket.  To me, Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket seemed heavily stylized in one way or another.  This didn't seem that way.  Beautiful character designs, smooth animation... not much I can find wrong with this, really.Music: The soundtrack for this series rawqs.  There's a basic theme, outside of the opening and ending, that you hear throughout the series in various forms.  It doesn't get boring at all, oddly enough.  Jazz, acoustic guitar, and classical-esque themes are the order of the day apart from aforementioned variations.  The opening and ending aren't all that bad, either.  I mean, they aren't particularly memorable, but they're still nice songs that fit the series well.Voice Seiyuus: Good.  There aren't really any roles that particularly stand out to me, but I do like the seiyuu that were chosen for the roles, as they fit the characters well.Voice Actors: Pretty much what I said above; no standout roles, but the voices still fit well, and don't get on my nerves like most VA dubs tend to do.Dub: The first I saw of Midori no Hibi was the dub of the fourth episode on a Newtype sampler.  All in all, Media Blasters did an okay job with the dub; not many liberties taken with the dialogue, and no censoring that I could see.Length: This is where the series suffers a bit.  Thirteen episodes doesn't seem like all that much, but, with the triple f formula and the polarization of episodes make the series drag a bit.Overall: Has some minor issues with story and length, but everything else is perfect.  If you're looking for an over-the-top romantic comedy, then this is for you.Story: 8/10Music: 7/10Art Style: 8/10Voice Seiyuu: 8/10Voice Actors: 7/10Dub: 8/10Length: 7/10Overall: 53/70; 75% (C) fights, and has an infamous &quot;devil's right hand&quot;; however, this doesn't have the greatest reprecussions for his love life (he's asked out twenty girls and been rejected by them all as of late). Midori is a girl who has a crush on Seiji, but can't work up the courage to talk to him.One morning after lamenting the night before that he'll be stuck with no one but his right hand for a companion the rest of his life, he wakes up to Midori on his right hand....Yeah.The situation is pretty odd, to say the least, but, oddly enough, it works out really well, especially as a comedy.  The romance between the two is really sweet to watch as the series unfolds.  Midori is amazingly sweet, upbeat, and dotes over Seiji at every given changce. Oddly enough, she doesn't get on my nerves like most of her character types do.  And even though Seiji has a tough-guy image and can be oblivious to Midori at points, he does show his soft side more than once.Episodes, more often than not, follow what I've dubbed the triple F formula -- fighting, fanservice, and fluff.  Episodes seem to be polarized: they tend to either be really good, or really sucky, with none hitting any marks between.  These two points are probably the only drawbacks to the story.Art Style: The animation was done by Studio Pierrot, which also did the anime for Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket.  To me, Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket seemed heavily stylized in one way or another.  This didn't seem that way.  Beautiful character designs, smooth animation... not much I can find wrong with this, really.Music: The soundtrack for this series rawqs.  There's a basic theme, outside of the opening and ending, that you hear throughout the series in various forms.  It doesn't get boring at all, oddly enough.  Jazz, acoustic guitar, and classical-esque themes are the order of the day apart from aforementioned variations.  The opening and ending aren't all that bad, either.  I mean, they aren't particularly memorable, but they're still nice songs that fit the series well.Voice Seiyuus: Good.  There aren't really any roles that particularly stand out to me, but I do like the seiyuu that were chosen for the roles, as they fit the characters well.Voice Actors: Pretty much what I said above; no standout roles, but the voices still fit well, and don't get on my nerves like most VA dubs tend to do.Dub: The first I saw of Midori no Hibi was the dub of the fourth episode on a Newtype sampler.  All in all, Media Blasters did an okay job with the dub; not many liberties taken with the dialogue, and no censoring that I could see.Length: This is where the series suffers a bit.  Thirteen episodes doesn't seem like all that much, but, with the triple f formula and the polarization of episodes make the series drag a bit.Overall: Has some minor issues with story and length, but everything else is perfect.  If you're looking for an over-the-top romantic comedy, then this is for you.Story: 8/10Music: 7/10Art Style: 8/10Voice Seiyuu: 8/10Voice Actors: 7/10Dub: 8/10Length: 7/10Overall: 53/70; 75% (C)"", 'Now you’d think, at least I certainly thought, that the show would go straight to the gutter with this idea. Incredibly, it retains this really appealing sweetness and innocence throughout, not forced or sugary, just…Disney-like, I guess. I mean good Disney, not all that crap that came out after the late 90s. That’s not to say it’s a clean show, ooooh no, the humor is delightfully pervy, but it avoids far more dirty jokes than it pursues despite the various body humor jokes and endless barrages of giggle-worthy nudity.After a while, anime humor tends to run together, but Midori Days’ brand of twisted giggles...feels strangely novel, and I think a lot of it is the frequent interludes of character’s fantasies and head-movies. Yes, head-movies, complete with credits. The story is regularly charming and uplifting, due largely to the fact that Seiji is not just a cliché bad-mouthed punk and Midori is not a cliché moe girl either.Seiji beats up other thugs just to rescue their pummeled victims because he remembers being a weakling when he was younger, and he’s still naturally adorkable when he’s not trying to act street. And Midori has a lot of spirit and spunk that she’s dying to express after being freed from a lot of her old anxieties, the development of which is really fun to watch. I think based on her cooking alone she’s earned her keep, but Seiji may have his mind on other disadvantages. (Use your imagination.) Unlike Midori, he is not enjoying this bizarre new spell and wants things to change back as soon as possible. Now if you’ve seen the movie Groundhog Day, you already know how things are going to turn out here. The fun is in the journey, and for the most part, the journey is a total riot with a tenderly sentimental conclusion. Miraculously, the mushy wrap-up does not feel forced either, making this really a gem of a romcom.On the technical side of things, the animation is okay, but nothing particularly special. Character designs are very easy on the eyes, but it’s still very very basic, especially for a brief 13-episoder.The music is fairly kitschy, but amusing, seeing as it’s used to highlight adorably stupid situations.The voice acting infinitely makes up for shortcomings in either case, though. Of course it sounds great in Japanese, but did the goofiness translate in the dub? Ooooh yes. Let’s just say I’m sorely disappointed that I haven’t heard Seiji’s voice actor in more roles, because he does a top-tier job. He’s as cartoony as need be for all the goofiness, but he also sounds to all extents like a normal teenager. You know how you hear a lot of anime characters enunciate perfectly, even the rough ones? Well, Drew Aaron as Seiji does not, and the casual snideness of the result is very nice on the ears, and very very funny. Midori is also perfect. Usually the high squeaky schoolgirl voice makes you want smear honey on your ears and blow a bear whistle, but Kether Fernandez goes into the ultimate octaves and still sounds very pleasant. Her unnatural pitch is actually excused by her physical situation, as we discover when Seiji switches places with her in a humorous nightmare episode and sounds like he’s been dippin’ in the helium as well. There are still a few grating cheeses in the most minor roles here, but the leads certainly compensate for them.I’ve already had my sick sick fun telling you what I enjoyed about the show, but I guess I should admit that it has more than a handful of problems. Actually, with all things in Seiji’s life, it’s woman trouble. His mean, drunk sister as well as a little girl and a classmate who have crushes on him all add to the story well when they’re used sparingly, but when they get their own episodes, the show goes from very good to really really bad. Those few episodes in the middle push the series to the limits of poor taste and cheap shots, and I have to wonder why the writers ever thought it was a good idea to take the focus away from Midori and the effect she has on her disgruntled host bad-boy.Not that the show is any more plausible in such cases. The animators can never really decide how Midori is attached to Seiji’s wrist, so they do avoid showing us, but it’s a little silly to think that TP-ing her is going to fool anyone. There are countless scenes, actually, where Midori pokes her head out and she and Seiji have a conversation in broad daylight and no one notices. The most minimal effort is made to hide her and it works, against all logic. I think Seiji goes to a school for students with impaired vision…who refuse to wear glasses. I’m not kidding, I’d totally believe it. The only character with glasses is also the only character that immediately notices Midori on Seiji’s arm. Co-inky-dink? I THINK NOT.That, and this show is kinda fanservice-heavy, by which I mean there are only three episodes of the show with no big plump titties in them at some point. You have been warned, for good or ill. Eh. Once you’ve seen two, you’ve seen ‘em all. I’ll never quite understand the male fascination with funbags.All in all, a surprisingly rewarding romantic comedy that balances innocence and bawdiness, laughter and tears, but yeah, it stoops pretty low on a few too many occasions, and it’s predictable and silly as all get-out.

Twisted good fun!*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoGJPYMgxD4Thanks for reading!', ""Delinquent gets a cute little girl for a right hand? Who knew this plot line would actually work?This anime is definitely the embodiment of the words &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; and &ldquo;comedy&rdquo;, i.e. Romantic Comedy in case you didn&rsquo;t catch my drift. It&rsquo;s about the relationship of reformed delinquent (Seiji) and the girl who took the place of his right hand (Midori). They go through daily life learning about each other, at the same time trying to avoid circumstances that will reveal their secret.The anime went beyond my expectations. It was funnier than I thought &ndash; the number of gags in the first episode was enough to...make me stick around and look forward to see the rest. It&rsquo;s also ecchi-er than I thought. I think out of 13 episodes, there were about 7-8 (possibly more) episodes that showed scenes of exposed breasts, courtesy of Midori (bite size ones), Seiji&rsquo;s sister Orin and Ayase. I didn&rsquo;t think it was vulgar though, since the nudity were used cleverly and for comical relief. This means a lot coming from someone like me who hates fan service. I like the plots per episode. It went from going to a figurine shop reeking of figurine otaku, to dealing with a preteen fan. The themes were just nicely done and clever.The ending was a tad predictable though, but I didn\\'t know if it would end the way I thought it would end. Well it did - and I&rsquo;d say it was a big &ldquo;whew&rdquo;.The main characters were likable. Seiji was funny, of course. He had some depth to him, so that was good. Midori is oh so adorable! Her personality was likable, and she&rsquo;s naturally funny. I have to ask though, why is she so shy when she&rsquo;s life size, and loud and outgoing when she became Seiji&rsquo;s right hand? Generally, almost everyone is likable. When I said &ldquo;almost&rdquo;, I meant everyone except Orin. She is definitely not ladylike, and was mean to Seiji.The drawing style was so-so. It was simple, but what I really like about it is that the characters all looked so distinct so it was easy to tell them apart. Most of the time, characters in one anime all look similar and the only way to tell them apart was their hair or eye color. This was not the case for Midori Days &ndash; The characters were all looked distinct and different. Midori had nice big green eyes, Ayase looked cunning, Seiji&rsquo;s look fit his personality well and the same goes for every other character. There were times when the characters would waver, but it was slight so you can brush it off easily.They also used some CG to compliment the scenes, that&rsquo;s always good. I also want to take note of episode 7, where they used &ldquo;manga&rdquo; scenes to portray Ayase&rsquo;s date plan. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the same quality as the ones used in FLCL, but I heard that the ones in FLCL cost a lot. It was nevertheless impressive, and it also complimented that episode well.The voice acting was nicely done. The seiyus matched their characters well, especially Midori&rsquo;s seiyu (forgot her name, though). Midori&rsquo;s voice, accent and vocabulary made her even cuter. I loved it when she would say &ldquo;desho?&rdquo; at the end of almost every sentence.I liked the music. Their was a wide variety of BGM and each one was made to fit a scene well. I do remember hearing the distinct BGM of a scene from the first episode, and I thought to myself how it complimented that scene well and it made the scene much funnier. The opening was OK, it wasn&rsquo;t my type of music, but it really fit the last part of the last episode. I really liked the ending theme though, it was sung by Saori Atsumi who sang Biidama, another song I really like.It was a good watch &ndash; from the first episode to the last. It was pretty stable, in terms of how I liked it. There weren&rsquo;t notable high points or low points, it was just alright. What I liked best about it was the humor, and of course, the adorable Midori. Can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s one of my favorites, but it&rsquo;s definitely a must-see. make me stick around and look forward to see the rest. It&rsquo;s also ecchi-er than I thought.

To me, this idea sounds like an excuse for an anime packed full of fanservice and vulgar jokes, many of them probably involving the main character forgetting about his hand being a girl and using it for activities such as, er... well, I\'ll leave that to your imagination....and this is why I\'ve never really felt a great urgency to try ""Midori no Hibi"".But now that I have finally gotten around to watching this, I have to admit it\'s not as bad as I thought...it was going to be. Yes it did contain some of the distastefulness that I was expecting, but the dirty jokes didn\'t get out of hand (*rim shot*) and go as far as I\'d feared. Instead, ""Midori no Hibi"" turned out to be something that\'s probably best described as a fun, entertaining anime that\'s not to be taken too seriously.""Midori no Hibi"" is essentially a romantic comedy, and the comedy is the main strength of it. A lot of it is pretty slap stick, but I couldn\'t help laughing out loud at times because some parts are just so funneh. The romance side has some nice touches too. One of its main strengths is the interaction and developing relationship between the two main characters Seiji and Midori, which is good since that\'s one of the focal points of the show. The story has originality, and did not turn out as predictable as I expected, but with such a bizarre set up, inevitably there are a lot of character ""fudging"" going on to make it work, like Midori\'s reaction after she first finds out what had happened to her. To be frank, I find it almost disturbing that she seems to be able to just accept the strange situation so readily and then adapt to it so quickly without missing the things in her old life that you\'d expect to be important to her - she seems to care very little about her family, for example. The characters are generally likeable and it\'s easy to sympathise with their problems, but some of the character development feels hurried - there seem to be no transitional stage involved as Midori opens up from being an introvert, and the way one of the characters Ayase changed her attitude towards Seiji also seems a bit sudden.Even though ""Midori no Hibi"" does not hold up to close scrutiny, it passes easily for a casual watch due to its entertainment values. There are some Ecchi jokes that the series could have done without, but as I said there isn\'t as much as I thought there would be. Presentation wise, ""Midori no Hibi"" is fairly unremarkable to look at, but it does have a reasonably good sound track with some nice BGM\'s and a pretty good ending theme.

Due to this animes lack of progression however ive come to realize that you could of watched the first 2 episodes and than watch the last and not really be all that confused about whats happening. If I were to say I iked it it would...be because it was fun and made me laugh on occasion. If I were to say I disliked it, I would say because of all animes I've ever seen, no anime has ever made me this angry. Whenever something was going to happen that would move the anime forward Midori would put a stop to it because of her selfishness and it made me hate her as a character.... Every episode other than the first 2 and the last 2 felt like filler that you had to grind through! Overall I would not recommendl this anime although it is somewhat of a fun ride, just be aware that you'll be doing about 9 episodes worth of waiting for something meaningful to happen! be because it was fun and made me laugh on occasion.

The love that Midori has for Seiji is amazing. She truly loves him with all her heart. My only 2 problems with the series is that 1) He never said ""I love you"" to Midori or even showed any signs of falling in love with her. Yeah technically he got depressed towards the end and showed some signs of questioning why he could easily say I love you to other girls but not Midori but still I wanted to see breaks where he would stop and look at her and say ""Wow. She really...loves me. She\'s really cute. I could really fall for her if she wasn\'t my right hand"".Also 2) I didn\'t like how when Midori returned to her body Seiji acted as if her love for him dissapeared. She has loved him for years before she became his right hand. Just go visit her and tell her how you feel. She LOVES YOU more then anything. Guaranteed success my friend.However when I write this I realized that he was torn and confused about his true feelings for her, but as always he finally came to realize that he truly fell in love with Midori.Story: 8/10. Story is pretty and sweet. These 2 buddies get into all sorts of shenanigans from school -> gang fights. It\'s a little stale but Midori\'s love and affection for him keep things cute and lively.Art: 7/10. The art is dated seeing how it\'s 2012. But still, Midori is cute, that\'s about it though.Sound: 8/10. Didn\'t really listen to the OP and ED BUT from the few seconds before I skipped them they seemed very powerful and cute.The voices are very nice though. Especially the delinquent voices (Sister/Seiji/other delinquents) When they say that Oora (idk how to spell it, it sounds very genuine and funny to me lol)Enjoymeny: 10/10. It\'s a very cute story about how a shy giirl\'s soul leaves her body to spend time with her crush and eventually show him just how sincere/genuine/cute she really is, and how she is the ideal girl that he has been searching for his whole life.It\'s a great series.

The characters and artwork (big eyes creep me out) are pretty lame and overall you might get a few chuckles. But other than that the series doesn't hold much enjoyment. "", 'After reading the shocking synopsis of Midori no Hibi you would expect a predictable and dirty comedy. However, it avoids making easy jokes and it focuses in making very funny situations in every chapter which are going to make you laugh a lot and have a great time. It is true that it contains some ecchi scenes, some of them unnecessary, but these don’t make the series lose its charm and innocence.One good point of Midori Days is its brevity. Although when you finish it you want more, more than 20 chapters would have made it fall in the easy way. Furthermore, there isn’t any...psychological evolution from the characters, and in a long tv series, probably, some users would have lost their interest in the show (although Midori is adorable and I couldn’t get tired of her).In my case, the fact that Midori no Hibi was different to what I was expecting and that it offers a good content, have kept me stay hooked on it and having a great feeling after watching it. So, if you like comedy, teenage romance with a bit of drama and you don’t care about watching some ecchi scenes, I strongly recommend this anime to you. psychological evolution from the characters, and in a long tv series, probably, some users would have lost their interest in the show (although Midori is adorable and I couldn’t get tired of her).In my case, the fact that Midori no Hibi was different to what I was expecting and that it offers a good content, have kept me stay hooked on it and having a great feeling after watching it.

The picture above shows a guy with a girl for a right hand.  To fully understand this strange phenomenon, you\'ll have to watch this anime, but I\'ll be telling you in my review just how worth watching this anime is.Story:  The story of Midori no Hibi is as followed.  Seiji ""Mad Dog"" Sawamura is a delinquent high school student who is feared by almost all his classmates for his ""Devil\'s Right Hand"".  He is a pretty strong street fighter, capable of taking down entire gangs by himself.  Unfortunately,...his status as a delinquent has led to him being rejected by just about every girl he has asked out.  For seventeen years, his right hand remains his only companion *wink wink* .  However, he wakes up one day, only to find that his right hand has been replaced by a tiny girl named Midori, who has actually had a crush on Seiji since middle school.  What follows is a zany but lighthearted romantic anime that is actually very, very worth watching.  In my opinion, the story is strange but unique enough that its abnormalities make it all the better.Art:  I simply love the art style of this anime.  It is extremely eye-catching, and the character designs are either adorable or pretty cool.  When compared to the amazing manga it was based off of, the difference is little to none.Music: An awesome aspect of the series, the music is something else.  Like Ouran High School Host Club, there is only one opening and ending theme for this series.  However, both of them, ""Sentimental"" and ""Mou Sukoshi...Mou Sukoshi..."", are pretty amazing and catchy.  The series deserves high points when it comes to the music, which fits perfectly with the theme of the anime.Characters:  To be honest, the characters in this series are fantastically done.  Seiji Sawamura isn\'t actually your normally oblivious male protagonist, and despite appearances as a romance anime, the fight scenes with him are actually pretty badass.  Midori is a very cute character at the beginning, but she evolves over the course of the series, and you get a lot more insight on her real self towards the end.  Other characters in the series fulfill pretty awesome roles, but I\'d hate to ruin them for you, so you\'ll just have to get to watching it.Enjoyment:  This series makes you laugh, smile, and probably almost shed a tear right towards the end.  It deserves that spot on your DVD shelf, and it is very re-watchable, despite it being a short 13 episodes.In the end, Midori no Hibi represents a magnificent anime that isn\'t exactly your standard fare.  It is a heartwarming yet funny story that delivers in just about every way.  I present it with a 10/10 rating, mostly because of just how emotionally powerful it becomes by the end of its 13 episode run.  Still, the humor, awesome art and music, and pretty well-done romance should grab you just as easily. his status as a delinquent has led to him being rejected by just about every girl he has asked out.

Straight, lets roll with this XD  I wont go further into the basic story because a: there's a dozen reviews already here and b: you can look the hell up in the story synopsis for that if you still need it crowbarred in.The show has one of the more outlandish premises i've seen in a show that isn't centered around pure chaos(a`la Abenobashi).  sure the original set up is straight out of left field but the show itself is...well written, has very likable characters and can easily put a smile on the face of the most angsty of the broody-brood set.    The show has a fairly long list of good points and only a few, that i could find, of bad points.for the good, lets start with the most important: IT ENDS!!I don't know why, but a good percentage of Ro-Co's(romantic comedy) leave you with an ending that's left open so as to not piss off too many fans who wanted a specific ending.  this show is at least kind enough to give you an ending.  is it completely obvious 10 minutes into episode 1 what that ending will be?  yes, but that's not the point.  this show thrives on its characters: put them in the sun and watch them shine.  Takamizawa being one of the best of the supporting cast.  He's obsessed with dolls and puppets and is the only person in this entire universe that can actually see the fact that there is a frikkin person on protag-Seiji's wrist, which really doesn't solidify your hope for mankind.  Of course he originally thinks she's a puppet to begin with and tries to get it naked so he can see the serial code so he can try and get one himself.After Taka, there's Seiji's neighbor's 10(i believe) year old daughter who's got a mad-on for him, as well as a girl from school who keeps trying to set up the perfect opportunities for them to hook up that always are explained in a way that reminded you of when the Coyote finished setting up a trap for the Roadrunner and would non-verbally exposit exactly what he wanted to happen before it's inevitable downfall.  I gotta admit, these fantasy sequences are flat-out awesome and even come equipped with title and ending sequences to cement the fact that every one of these people are bat-shit insane.the biggest problem i had with the show was that, no matter how awesome the characters are, the bulk of them just disappear after a certain moment.  loli-fest drops off the earth after her centric episode half-way through the series and Taka Kaiser Soze's after some chick runs after him like a fool in love, but at least that one makes a little sense since it can just be said that they were off making nasty, cosplay-rific, pimply(that's pimple-e, not pimp-ly), oily whoopie.  The sister character only shows up to scream 'boogadu-boogie' every now again, steal all of Seiji's money and say something to try and get him and Midori together.  What made me furious the most is that the character of Midori's maid seemed like she would be an awesome character to put into the story some, i know it would be hard to do but it looked like they took so much time into giving her a personality to just toss it all in the wastebasket and go about their day.the only other bad part was some of the music.  i heard a trumpet's wah-wah waaaaaaah  a few too many times and was glad there was no chase scenes cause you just KNOW that Yakety Sax would cue up.  But, as for bad parts, that's about it.some of the sound bytes were archaic and they dropped some characters with no explanation.  But the goods far outway that and its hard to properly convey how well this show is put together.  if you're a fan of sight gags, cute and/or odd story telling and rocoms, i suggest you check this show out some time. well written, has very likable characters and can easily put a smile on the face of the most angsty of the broody-brood set.

It takes a really ludacris situation, and turns it into a sweet, heartfelt and funny high school slice of life anime.This show is about a guy who cant get a girlfriend to save his life. He's been turned down by pretty much everybody at his school, and comes to the realization that he might die alone with only his right hand. Until one day he awakes to find a girl HAS become his right hand! This is another anime that caught me off guard with its really great opening and closing songs. Especiaully the ending song.I've said before in...past reviews that Slice of Life is my favorite anime genre, and it still is. Because of really great anime like this, just a good story that follows the lives of characters living crazy lives.

But I think that this show is very enjoyable, with great characters, and a original, and interesting concept.The story of Midori Days is, as I said before. Very odd. The idea of a guy with a cute girl on his right hand, who just happens to have a crush on him by the way, very bizzare and strange. But I believe that the show is, despite being and ecchi, very sweet and cute. And it's just a ton of fun watching...the two main characters relationship get better as the show goes on.The two main characters in the show are the best part about the show. Midori while on Seiji's hand is almost always full of energy and very cheerful. Though, when in her human body is increadibly shy. Her devotion to Seiji is insane, often getting increadibly jealous when he's around any girls. She is a cute character and fun to watch. Seiji, despite being a imfamous delinquent who everyone's afraid of, is often only doing it to protect the weak, as he remember's a time when he was weak and bullied. He's at heart, really just a nice guy who want's a girlfriend. In general he's a ton of fun to watch just like Midori. Unfortunatley the other characters I find to be no where near as great as the main two, Ayase, another girl who falls for Seiji after being rescued by him, to be honest, is a Tsundere and does not have much development during the show. And the episodes dedicated to her are painful. Shiroi, who is a ten year old girl, also has a crush on Seiji. But I really just find her quite annoying. Her episode dedicated to her also was not much fun to watch. The other characters don't get much screentime and development in the anime, like Rin, Seiji's older sister. Who appears in a couple of episodes to harass Seiji. Admitedly I do like Rin, I find her to be fun to watch. But she does not get nearly enough screentime in the anime. Midori's friend, Kouta. Is not interesting at all in the anime, but is much more interesting in the manga. Which in general, was better than the anime in terms of characters. As most of them at least have one chapter out of eighty five of them devoted to them, and it gives them alot more development.Story - 7Characters - 7Animation and SoundIn terms of animation this show is nothing all that special. The backgrounds look nice and the animation quality is good enough. There were not moments where the show went noticeably off model, overall the animation Studio Pierrot produced for this show, while nothing spectaular, is quite good.The series music is nothing noteworthy, all the background tracks fit the comedic situations the characters are in well enough but are nothing i'd listen to on it's own.

The title in Japanese, Midori no Hibi (美鳥の日々), is translated as “Green Days” since —midori 緑 is a homophone for the Japanese word for “green’, which you’ll get due to Midori’s hair. It’s green, get it?The anime adaptation consists of 13 episodes (April 2004-June 2004) but strangely it ended before the manga series did.The plot starts out with Seiji “Mad Dog” Sawamura, who is the toughest student in high school but he does not...have the best reputation with everyone, even though, he fights for the weaker students against bullies and yet, every girl feared him and he does make him a bit sad and lonely that he suffers from a gift and a curse. Meanwhile, one girl by the name of Midori Kusagano, a shy girl who admires Seiji from afar but hasn’t got the courage to confess her love for him but when Seiji whines about not having a girlfriend and not wanting to die alone, suddenly, he got his wish……..but not in a good way. Him and Midori finally meet face to face, or is it face to hand? But I got one question about this.HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN AGAIN? IT IS MAGIC? DRUGS?  ILLUSIONS GONE WRONG? TOO MUCH GANJA? THE POWER OF LOVE? This series doesn’t exactly answer that but it did answer that the real Midori is under a coma and has no way of waking up.As for the characters, well, most of the time they either screaming or panicking too much, which would be a normal thing if you see a human being on your arm but it gets into stir crazy results. Seiji is a character that I could relate to with his situation and can be enjoyable to watch but he seems, at first, not to get that he got his wish but he just say it wrong. Midori has that cue Moe girl personality and it might bother most people who get easily irritated by that but for me, she was average at some times but can irk you a bit. However, two other women in the series got on my nerves a bit. First, Takato Ayase…….yeah, I don’t like her at all. First, she act snobbish toward Seiji for being a delinquent, even though it’s total bullshit, and yet after he saves her from being gangraped and even though she has a crush on him, too, she still treats him like shit (most of the time but warm up to him at some times) and his sister, O-Rin, who enjoys drinking, beating up her little brother and taking his allowance, but he spends it on porn anyway so she’s doing him a favor. At first, I didn’t like her but I eventually didn’t mind her presence. There is also Osamu Miyahara, who idolizes and the closest thing to a friend to Seiji, but he’s really not that important and the same goes to Shiori, a 10-year-old girl who also has a crush on Seiji but she might as well hold a neon sign that says “Chris Hansen can’t wait to meet you.” Also, the strangest character in the series, Shuichi Takamizawa, a doll otaku with the overall creepy obsession and becomes very interested in Midori in her doll form. Last, there is a cat in this. He’s not that important. Moving on……..The animation is a bit appealing but it’s also clownish at a few times and overall “meh” and I hope you like the amount of fanservice thrown on, such as bare breasts, from almost every main female character (Rin, Takako and especially Midori). It can get excessively amusing but annoying at the same time. But then again, I forget that “pierrot” in Studio Pierrot means “clown” in French and yes, I know of one of their previous works, the one that ends to end already.  The music, I’m just not that much into this much saccharine J-Pop and it does fit the mood into the series and it works.FINAL VERDICT: It really wasn’t the anime for me.

But the general gist of the anime does come from a synopsis so if you want read that, I don't need to tell you what this anime is about.This is a romance anime and I think it is done pretty well....Draws two people together and a strange way and they get closer together as the anime progresses.  Though there are some surprises in and around the main character that brings some conflict and sticky situations but this romance is a pretty telegraphic romance since we already know what is probably going to end up happening in the end.This anime does have some action in it since the main character is kind of a delinquent.  But this does not take away from the overall romance side of the anime and actually ties in the main character's personality and helps us better understand what the main character is all about.Overall this is a very nice romance/action anime.  If you are a mainstream violent action person, I would say this is not for you but if you are into romance types then this is one to watch.  If you are a die hart romance person, this is still one to watch since the action does not take away from the overall quality in the anime.Kept this review nice and clean for everyone so until next time!

It's actually one of the most underrated anime series out there. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it is. The humor is right up there with Konosuba, which is saying something.Moreover, Midori Days excels not only in humor but also in its character development. Seeing Seiji grow through his bond with Midori is really satisfying, and while, Midori Days' heartfelt moments might not be as impactful as other romantic comedies like Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War. Its...humor surpasses that of any other romantic comedy I've seen, making it a more memorable watch.Don't let its 7.23 rating dissuade you from watching this show—it's only 13 episodes long and feels like it should be rated much higher. humor surpasses that of any other romantic comedy I've seen, making it a more memorable watch.Don't let its 7.23 rating dissuade you from watching this show—it's only 13 episodes long and feels like it should be rated much higher."", 'This show is pretty good, but so not for really little kids (more on that later). The characters are pretty good even if the character personalities are pretty much standard at best. We got the rebel, the silent shy girl, the perverted puppet otaku, the childhood friend of the rebel who tries to keep him out of trouble… ya… pretty standard far, except when Midori becomes his right hand. Then she is loud and actually sounds like a freaken chipmunk. Speaking of her becoming the right hand, they never once explain how that happened. They hint that it is because Midori is in a coma...at home but Damnit, I don’t buy that one bit!Another thing I don’t get is just how turning small makes your personality switch. Ya… Midori’s personality goes 1 80 on us and she turns really freaken annoying clingy to Seiji. When I say clingy, I mean clingy. And this isn’t a time goes on thing; this is a one day change.The animation is very well done, again, crisp and clean. Colors are bright and cheerful and it gives you that slice of life you know this is. Problem with that is, nothing really stands out except for the fight scenes that are sometime few and far between. There is a lot of fan service, showing most of the girls at least naked at one time or another and part of it on the idea of midori being small with large knockers… just… ya…The voices are done rather well in the English; though the yelling every time something goes strange is just annoying (it happens in the subs as well). The only one I really am not happy about is Midori’s voice, she is so high and scratchy in this that most of the time I want her to shut that mouth. It gets better but not for a long time and I don’t know if its because I got used to it or because the rest of the story was good so I didn’t care.Now with all that, you might wonder why I like this so much.

But its definitely unexpected! The story of course is original but you can basically tell that from the synopsis. I, like most people im sure, assumed this was a really ecchi anime(i mean really-- a girl as your right hand) and i usually just get bored with ecchi anime so i wasnt interested at first. But after watching the series all the way through its completely not ecchi at all! i mean theres like a dozen boob shots and a couple boob grabs but none of them are in an erotic sense, and like wtf, what kind of ecchi...doesnt even have a kissing scene!! arrg! lol, ok i really wanted at least one kiss, seriously they were together 24/7 and no kiss?! no cuddling? >helpless romantic here< sorry i lost myself there.Anyway, another thing that was really unexpected was the characters. i kind of expected them to be shallow and boring but midori was really cute and she was shy and strong and adorable all at the same time! of course seji was the classic ""teddy bear delinquent"" but he was a really cute one and he was sweet so it worked really well. the art and sound were up to par and overall i really liked this anime!This is definitely a cute one to pass the time, so if your bored-- give it a go! doesnt even have a kissing scene!! arrg! lol, ok i really wanted at least one kiss, seriously they were together 24/7 and no kiss?! no cuddling? >helpless romantic here< sorry i lost myself there.Anyway, another thing that was really unexpected was the characters. i kind of expected them to be shallow and boring but midori was really cute and she was shy and strong and adorable all at the same time! of course seji was the classic ""teddy bear delinquent"" but he was a really cute one and he was sweet so it worked really well. the art and sound were up to par and overall i really liked this anime!This is definitely a cute one to pass the time, so if your bored-- give it a go!', 'Why do we all want to watch Midori no Hibi? The answer is really simple. We\'re all curious where it\'s gonna go with this ""dude\'s right hand turns into a cute girl"" plotline.Well, I\'m here to tell you they went the boring route.It\'s not that surprising - was Midori no Hibi (Midori Days) going to be 13 episodes of jokes about what men think of their right hand? Of course not, and behind that silly concepts lies a basic anime.The story doesn\'t make much- what am I saying? It doesn\'t make any sense. Midori no Hibi is somehow a show about romance, handled in...the most annoying way possible.How many times have I found myself asking why? Why does Midori like the protagonist, Seiji, to begin with, when the only reason she knows he exists is that he takes the train on the platform opposite to hers to go to school in the morning? Why does she become his right hand? Seriously, can anyone tell me why?Seiji\'s backstory is... Odd, to say the least. I guess it\'s original that the reason the protagonist is a loser who can never get a girlfriend isn\'t that he\'s a hikikomori or especially unattractive, but... It really doesn\'t work that well, and feels taken too far.Now, to talk about the characters... How do I put it.I hate them.Midori is incredibly obnoxious, and being attached to the protagonist\'s body, she\'s unavoidable. Her reasoning, the things she does, don\'t even manage to make her cute or pitiful, for a simple reason; she\'s just an ungrateful brat.If only there were some reason she dreams of getting closer to Seiji so much, like some event he may have forgotten, or a tough backstory or family-life, it would for sure be easy to empathize with her, but there is nothing of the sort. She\'s in love just because, she\'s sad just because.She goes on to wanting for Seiji to immediately reciprocate her feelings, even though he never knew her before and by stealing his right hand (which he actually needs a lot, because his awkward plot of a life says so) she\'s being nothing but an annoyance.*Of course* he becomes attached to her! Why wouldn\'t he? He\'s an anime protagonist, she\'s an anime girl, can I make it anymore obvious?Seiji\'s... nothing special. He\'s really not as bad as he could be, likeable in some scenes and not as annoying as other characters or plot points in the show. He\'s awkwardly written, but isn\'t really a problem.There are other characters. I don\'t remember how long ago I watched Midori no Hibi, but I only remember three of them. One should be punished for his sins, the other should be punished for her sins, and the other other one... Believe it or not, I actually liked! She\'s Seiji\'s other love interest.Now, note that I would have complained that this guy doesn\'t really deserve girls fighting for his useless attention, but on the opposite of Midori, Love Interest n°2 has a *reason* to like him! It almost feels as if she\'s an actual character with proper reasoning. I\'ll say she\'s probably the only good character in this show, but it is to be noted that I generally like the trope she represents.Don\'t even get me started on this show\'s ending. It was incredibly frustrating and, frankly, uninteresting. In a way, it even makes everything that\'s happened in around 11 episodes feel useless.As I already said, all you\'ll find yourself asking is ""why"" and maybe a few ""how""-s here and there.You could watch Midori no Hibi and it wouldn\'t kill you. It\'s easy to follow, thankfully not any longer than it is, and is, at least, not particularly boring.The ending was what ruined everyting for me. It could have been a lot smarter, it could have had some interesting morality, but it went the easy though inexplicable route.Midori no Hibi wasn\'t even that bad to watch, except for the times Midori would annoy me to no end, or Seiji would be so clueless it wasn\'t even funny anymore. I simply feel like I\'ve gained nothing out of watching it, and I feel like constant jokes about women and right hands wouldn\'t have been as insulting to womanhood as Midori\'s personality.The first few episodes have a few humourous scenes but they unfortunately fade away as the show starts taking itself too seriously. the most annoying way possible.How many times have I found myself asking why?

With such a hilarious concept,you at least know the comedy should be good. However in terms of execution, it could of gone both way as with such a quirky idea, it also has a lot potential. It could have been a complete disaster or it could have been amazing. Luckily, it was amazing, which made it all that funnier.Story-10While the actual story was largely episodic, each individual episode was just too hilarious. The adventures of the main character with...a girl as his hand were very thought out and created some extremely funny moments. The overall story is fairly generic and fairly non-existent (pretty much guy wants to get rid of the girl, girl wants to stay with him forever), however this is actually good thing as it compliments the comedy. You won't have to think to much in this anime.Art-8Not much to say about this. The animation is fluid and the art does its job. Overall, it looks quite good, but nothing amazing...Sound-8The sound is fairly good as well. The voice acting is solid and all the characters sounded right. The opening was fairly average i thought, it did its job but I wouldn't want to listen to it over and over. The ending I though was great and catchy, and it made me watch the end credits. On a side note, the English Dub is amazing, the voice acting for that was superb, its probably one of the best dubs I've seen. I would actually recommend the dub over the subtitlesCharacter-9Haha, a Tsundere male protagonist, who woulda thought. Actually, I love the mis-understood delinquent male lead Seiji, he is too hilarious, especially when hes hating on Midori. Midori, the female protagonist, is pretty the total opposite to seiji, a rich polite girl, and this also increases the comedic moments. So overall, I really like the leads. The side characters were quite good as well, however i feel like there wasn't much development of them, as most characters only appear in 1 or 2 episodes. I guess thats the problem going for only going for 12 episodes.Enjoyment-10This show was absolutely hilarious and so I enjoyed it immensely. I laughed the entire time and wished the show went longer. While it wouldn't call the most interesting plot, the comedy alone keeps you interested throughout the whole series, and you will enjoy every step of the way. Did I mention this was hilarious?Overall, this series was hilarious. If you just want to sit down, switch the brain off and just have a good laugh, this is a must-watch. If your looking for an extremely complex story and twist and turns at every episode, then still watch this anyway because you won't care about this when you watch the first episode. However I've got to warn, surprisingly there is a bit of nudity(?) in this, but you shouldn't let that turn you away even if your not into that thing, as it doesn't ruin the show. In the end you will come for the comedy and you will be served a truck load of it. This was an amazing series. a girl as his hand were very thought out and created some extremely funny moments.

Midori no Hibi is about a standard anime maverick high school senior who wakes up one day to find his right hand has been transformed into a living 8&quot; version of the 15 year old girl who has had a severe crush on him but is too shy to tell him. Issues about naked 17 year old males with naked fifteen year old females and so are totally ignored and the writing is so clever you don't really...mind. The series gets high marks for never descending into the crude humor that the situation easily lends itself to; although it does come close. There is, however, a totally gratuitous, protracted topless scene at the end of the series and therein lies the problem.The first six episodes are pretty entertaining, if the series stopped there, I'd give it at least a 7. Unfortunately, the writers didn't seem to want to explore some very interesting comic situations they'd established; such as the otaku who falls for a female delinquent or, in contrast, took a fairly complex character and reduced her to a swooning harem stereotype quicker than Anakin Skywalker went over to the Darkside. So, there you have it, watch the first six, scan the second six, watch the 13 if you really can't figure out how it ends. mind.

But the positive reviews for this anime convinced me to give Midori no Hibi a chance, and I am very glad I did.Have you ever said, ""Man, I\'d give my right hand to have a girlfriend."" ? Seji is a guy who said the same line, and his wish came true. More than just a silly fanservice anime, Midori no Hibi is a show...about how both Midori grows as a person in order to develop the confidence to confess to the one she loves.Let\'s face it, using the right hand girlfriend premise is silly. It could be used for so many dumb sex jokes, but Midori no Hibi doesn\'t go there. Instead, they used it to develop their characters and actually get the watcher invested into them. They did way more than I would have ever expected them to do with the story, but in the end, it still is a romantic comedy-esque show with it\'s silly moments. Well done, nonetheless.Story: 9/10Art and Sound feel like they are from the early 2000s — which of course, they are. The art and sound have aged quite well in comparison to 2000s anime though. Nothing seems wrong here for me, but nothing seems to stand out either.Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Characters were done well here, especially Midori.Most of the characters are stock characters, and Seji seems to be one as well. He doesn\'t change much throughout the entire story, but he has his morals and although he is called a delinquent by others, he is a pretty decent guy once you get to know him. From fighting bullies to looking out for the weak, he does it all and earns the respect of many other cast members.Midori and Ayase are the two big examples of characters that change. Through their interactions with Seji, they slowly learn to change themselves and realize their feelings.Of course, we also have the stock side characters. From the friend who keeps getting into trouble, the local otaku, the alcoholic sister, and neighborhood school kids, there are a wide range of these side characters, but that\'s all they are. Side characters that show up for a short while, have their problems solved by the main characters, give the main characters a little bit of development, leave. Most of the screen time is taken by our main boy and girls.Character: 7/10Enjoyment. Hell yes, I loved this. Watched the first episode at night, went to sleep, and woke up early to binge the rest. There are comedic moments, and there are touching sad moments. A very nice balance that kept me entertained to the end.Enjoyment: 10/10Overall this anime gave me a similar sort of feel to Kimi no Na Wa. Minus a few litres of tears and boxes of kleenex. I have nothing else to say other than it was way better than I expected it to be.Overall: 9/10 about how both Midori grows as a person in order to develop the confidence to confess to the one she loves.Let\'s face it, using the right hand girlfriend premise is silly. It could be used for so many dumb sex jokes, but Midori no Hibi doesn\'t go there. Instead, they used it to develop their characters and actually get the watcher invested into them. They did way more than I would have ever expected them to do with the story, but in the end, it still is a romantic comedy-esque show with it\'s silly moments. Well done, nonetheless.Story: 9/10Art and Sound feel like they are from the early 2000s — which of course, they are. The art and sound have aged quite well in comparison to 2000s anime though. Nothing seems wrong here for me, but nothing seems to stand out either.Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Characters were done well here, especially Midori.Most of the characters are stock characters, and Seji seems to be one as well. He doesn\'t change much throughout the entire story, but he has his morals and although he is called a delinquent by others, he is a pretty decent guy once you get to know him. From fighting bullies to looking out for the weak, he does it all and earns the respect of many other cast members.Midori and Ayase are the two big examples of characters that change.

It was interesting seeing how Seiji and Midori were living out their lives in this situation and it worked out mostly plus you don't get to see well in my case the angry male character and the cute female character usually it's the other way around so this felt refreshing, I feel like the Slice of Life genre is missing because a lot of the situations like Midori getting sick at some point and Seiji plus Midori going to a convention made me feel like this genre was missing.I got a lot of fun out of these characters especially between Seiji and Midori it was a pretty bumpy ride with how their relationship went because losing your right hand which you use in fights and get's replaced with a cute looking girl can really make your life difficult, but the way these two developed was pretty adorable at times, you get to see Seiji see that Midori is actually a really caring and loving person which he slowly warms up to other time and Midori is just amazingly cute and cares deeply for Seiji.The other supporting characters also gave me a good time, the ones that stand out are Takako who is the usual Tsundere who also develops a crush on Seiji, Rin who is Seiji's sister and pretty much kicks his ass whenever she's on screen, but seems like a fun person to hang around with or get drunk since that's what she does, Shuuichi who is meant to be us anime/manga lovers, but seemed like an ok guy and Shiori who is one of Seiji's neighbours who has a complicated crush on him and is a very cocky girl. I liked these characters they would either make Seiji's and Midori's day a living hell or it actually would benefit them so it was interesting seeing these characters interact with the MC'sThe artstyle nicely showed off the usual style from the early 2000's so it didn't really stand out for me in any particular way, the Romance aspect is actually done very well and there is a Love triangle too, but it wasn't bad seeing Takako's attempts to woo Seiji were actually really funny and you kinda feel sorry for her, there is also a bit of fan service in there too from time to time though it is very awkward seeing a girl's breasts when she has been shrunken down to the size of a hand. It also had a good amount of comedy in here too which most of the time was actually funny though I think there were some points that felt a bit cringey, also despite the comedy there was some drama towards the end and it did generally make me fell pretty sad until everything worked out in the end.Midori Day's is one of those anime's where you look and think this is really weird, but if you watch the whole thing you'll find it's a very unique story well to me anyway and if you're a Romance fan who likes some comedy then you won't be disappointed by this.

I decided to give it a go because the premise was so outlandish I figured the show would at least be a bit of raunchy fun, but after a few episode's worth of Midori's never-ending Seiji-worship I had to call it quits. Does this girl even have a life or identity outside of Seiji? Every aspect of her character is devoted to either serving Seiji or talking about her crush on Seiji. It's the sort of regressive crap that gives anime such a bad reputation in regards to women's representation, and on top of that it's just boring to watch....That's really the most disappointing aspect of this show - just how utterly beige it is, both in the animation and in the story. This is billed a comedy, but the laughs run thin. It's rated R+, but that's another lost opportunity. If anything I wanted to see the writers take the lonely teenager with a girl on his hand to the obvious raunchy conclusion, and go all the way *there*, or otherwise make some other bold choices, but it doesn't happen. Rather they waste our time with this tedious mystery of why Midori is comatose, and when the rest of the show is already so dry, it's a bit hard to care about any of it. Outside of Seiji and some of the rough and tumble guys he hangs around, the characters are all too polite for their own good, or are otherwise just cut-and-paste anime stereotypes. I would have loved to see some truly off the wall characters - something like FLCL that takes an outrageous idea and runs with it. In that sense, Midori no Hibi could have been great had it capitalized on the crazy idea that forms the basis of this show, but sadly the creativity just isn't there to take it anywhere interesting.

(eh, not that I was in search for weird stuff, really) Anyway, in conclusion, I found out that I really loved this anime to my surprise.Yes, it sure has some mild-nudity once a while, and a few sexualized scenes (in a funny way, of course) in some certain episodes. But that's...just a fan-service material, and that's moderate with a good sense. Instead, it focuses on how funnier your everyday life could be if your one of hands turn into a tiny pretty girl!I, a person from Japan who have watched a handred anime for years and years, will say that this is definitely one of my most favorite anime I have ever seen.The exact reason for why it has got to be my favorite can't be described due to the site rules, but I can only say that they made this anime with a true love for Midori and Seiji.

A perverted high school delinquent wakes up one day to find his right hand has turned into a small girl!On the surface, Midori no Hibi has a very strange and somewhat off-putting premise. Everything about the sentence above screams out ""ECCHI! FANSERVICE! GROPING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"". A pervert\'s RIGHT HAND turns into a little (moe) girl? Sounds like another excuse to dish out awkward sexual situations in our daily dose of Japanimation.Yet, somehow, the anime pulls it off. What we end up with is a heartfelt, sweet, funny romance story, and while, yes, there is some nudity and groping (though perhaps...not by the people you expect...), it doesn\'t take predominance over the story or character development.Story (8):It\'s a weird one, but one that\'s told in a very satisfying way. The anime does not focus purely on the two main characters and their feelings, it branches out to develop the people surrounding them. In particular, the impact on Midori\'s family helps balance out the dream-like situation of the young girl, and the harsh reality of those she has left behind.The series is kept compact, but without dishing out the same old shlock every episode. Every episode has something different happening, be it absurd or dramatic.I think most of all, Midori no Hibi doesn\'t focus purely on the stupid elements of their core idea, they don\'t devote episodes purely for ""hi-jinks"", there is always that sad, realistic undertone throughout the show.Art (8):Kazurou Inoue who wrote the original manga, has a very distinctive style to his art, one that not everybody will enjoy, but I do, in the same way I enjoy his art in Ai Kora!.The main character (aside from Midori), Seiji, looks a lot like Hachibe from Ai Kora! if he dyed his hair blonde. They even have the same fox-eyed look.The girls are nicely drawn too, though in the anime they can sometimes look a little bland or out of proportion, but it\'s rarely noticeable. The anime adapts Inoue\'s work well, and the crisp colors and lines make it a joy to watch.Sound (8):The music box tune was well used for emotional emphasis, and most of the other tracks worked well for what they were conveying. Not the most memorable soundtrack but still pretty good. The opening and ending were nice.I would give this a 9 if it was based purely on the voice-work. I watched Midori no Hibi dubbed, upon someone\'s recommendation, and it turned out to be one of the best dubbed anime I\'ve watched. I can\'t recommend it highly enough. Seiji\'s VA does an excellent job of portraying the humor in the script, and some of the funniest moments involve his reactions. Look out for the short but sweet (and by sweet I mean hilarious) musical numbers.Character (9):I loved every character to be found here. I will never cease my praise of Inoue\'s ability to make even the most despisable of character tropes likeable. Even the tsundere (sort of), the bullying older sister and the annoying little brat are all actually cool characters, because they are given multiple facets to their personalities, rather than being defined solely by their core trait. The characters feel like characters.Seiji and Midori make a lovely couple (does that sound right?). I found myself rooting for Midori\'s love as much as I encouraged Seiji to find his own true love and...this is getting way too soppy.Side characters are nicely done. Takako is actually very sweet, Osamu is a funny sidekick, the cast are generally pretty awesome.Enjoyment (9):I enjoyed the hell out of this show and can\'t wait to read the manga. It\'s comedy was what I enjoyed the most, and there wasn\'t one episode when I wasn\'t laughing aloud. I could have easily watched more, and I hope that the manga continues the story further. One of the most enjoyable anime I\'ve ever seen.Overall (9):I think I\'ve fairly nailed down my points here, there really is nothing else to say.

Character design is the strong point here with memorably looking characters and many funny expressions.SoundThe voice acting is good, but a bit over-the-top a little too often. You get used to this after a few years watching anime, though.The outro song is really nice and groovy, and fits the japanese...language very well. The first bars of the intro song is catchy and all, but I lose interest when the verse starts.

This Seiji happens to be a real fuckup.

She is supposed to be an extremely shy girl, but once she becomes Seiji's right hand, she changes totally, turning into some kind of mommy.

The whole hand to girl thing was very original with some somewhat foreseen humor, but it remained funny none-the-less. As for the ending, all I can say is this is an ending that would be good for those who aren't emotionally stable and find tragic endings appalling. No, this anime has a pretty good ending, but I saw it coming.9/10. Mostly because the ecchi promised was very limited, but when it did appear, oh that made way for some freaking hilarious scenarios. "", 'i watched midori days because it showed up in one of the MAL ""best romance anime"" lists and the author drew a comparison to kiseijuu, which was pretty competently made if incredibly fucking boring. so since this show is short and has some nudity in it i decided to try it out.story - 2. the best comparison i can draw here is to bunny girl senpai since it\'s also a sex comedy with weird supernatural elements. unlike the situations in bunny girl senpai, nothing in midori days really seems to symbolize anything. midori just doesn\'t really like being at home and she wants to spend...time with seiji instead. my guess is that this premise is the author\'s weird kink.in one early scene, seiji goes to visit midori\'s (real) unconscious body. he tries to reunite the two of them by shoving hand midori\'s face into real midori\'s breast (for some reason she\'s completely nude in bed????), then midori\'s mother comes in and chases him out, rightly assuming he just performed sexual assault on an underage unconscious victim. i guess it could be to your taste, but i found it fucking skin crawling, so much so that i actually just skipped to the next scene.art - 6. it\'s fine. character designs are pretty bland but there\'s some pretty well animated visual comedy. the nudity all reminds me of creepy plastic dolls, though.sound - 6. the OP is actually a banger. i can\'t remember a single other piece of music from this anime, but 1 success is better than most shows i\'ve seen.character - 1. this is pretty much a sitcom, so the situations are pretty unimportant and the show needs to be carried by character interaction. in this area midori days is a fucking disaster.seiji is a belligerent douche. he yells at midori all the time and seems to be constantly frustrated with how annoying she is, even though the extent to which midori is written to be doting and subservient is pretty hilarious (or cringey depending on how you like your anime characters). his only real character trait other than that is that he\'s notorious for beating the shit out of people. yeah, this character\'s reputation for being a delinquent isn\'t actually a baseless accusation and he isn\'t actually a misunderstood nice guy, however much the show would like to tell you otherwise.midori is a non-entity, which, coming from me, is pretty harsh. i have a soft spot for moe and usually the cute character is enough in and of themselves to make me like them. unfortunately, midori has no personality other than being slavishly devoted to a main character who\'s about as likeable as an angry honey badger.Female Side Character falls for seiji after he beats the shit out of a bunch of dudes who were trying to kidnap her. gotta say i\'m not a big fan of the completely straight-faced glorification of childish violence. there\'s no parody or nuance to this, it\'s just painful to watch.enjoyment -

2. i hate everyone in this show, but it does have creepy plastic anime tiddies so watch it if you\'re into that. time with seiji instead. my guess is that this premise is the author\'s weird kink.in one early scene, seiji goes to visit midori\'s (real) unconscious body. he tries to reunite the two of them by shoving hand midori\'s face into real midori\'s breast (for some reason she\'s completely nude in bed????), then midori\'s mother comes in and chases him out, rightly assuming he just performed sexual assault on an underage unconscious victim. i guess it could be to your taste, but i found it fucking skin crawling, so much so that i actually just skipped to the next scene.art - 6. it\'s fine. character designs are pretty bland but there\'s some pretty well animated visual comedy. the nudity all reminds me of creepy plastic dolls, though.sound - 6. the OP is actually a banger. i can\'t remember a single other piece of music from this anime, but 1 success is better than most shows i\'ve seen.character - 1. this is pretty much a sitcom, so the situations are pretty unimportant and the show needs to be carried by character interaction. in this area midori days is a fucking disaster.seiji is a belligerent douche. he yells at midori all the time and seems to be constantly frustrated with how annoying she is, even though the extent to which midori is written to be doting and subservient is pretty hilarious (or cringey depending on how you like your anime characters). his only real character trait other than that is that he\'s notorious for beating the shit out of people. yeah, this character\'s reputation for being a delinquent isn\'t actually a baseless accusation and he isn\'t actually a misunderstood nice guy, however much the show would like to tell you otherwise.midori is a non-entity, which, coming from me, is pretty harsh. i have a soft spot for moe and usually the cute character is enough in and of themselves to make me like them. unfortunately, midori has no personality other than being slavishly devoted to a main character who\'s about as likeable as an angry honey badger.Female Side Character falls for seiji after he beats the shit out of a bunch of dudes who were trying to kidnap her. gotta say i\'m not a big fan of the completely straight-faced glorification of childish violence. there\'s no parody or nuance to this, it\'s just painful to watch.enjoyment -

I first heard about this anime after someone posted that Parasyte was set in the same universe as Midori no Hibi.  I'm not sure if that is true but that's how I got interested in this show.I really enjoyed this series especially the character interaction between Seiji and Midori.  It was also a nice surprise that this anime didn't heavily rely on fan service. But I just had to make this review to express my disappointment at the ending.*slight spoiler*There were many times that Midori confessed her love for...Seiji, but he never really reciprocated the same feelings for her.  At first, it didn't seem like Seiji was really interested in Midori but as the episodes went by, it seemed pretty obvious that he loves her.  Even when Seiji rejected Ayase, she also states that his feelings for Midori was love.  So to get an ending where Seiji never actually says that he loves Midori triggered me so much.Everything else about this anime was was awesome though.  For anyone who likes romantic comedy, I recommend this.Story: 8/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Character: 9/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 8/10 Seiji, but he never really reciprocated the same feelings for her.

This is one of the last thing you would find people do, and I've seen students watch all kinds of things (even blasting it and getting kicked out). This person had the genius in their brain...to have headphones on and not doing the assignment given to them (literally giving all the supposed reasons that they're doing it just to be conniving about it).A classic madlad in my take.With that aside, that's the kind of show it is. It's engaging to the point you're not doing work in the middle of class. In addition, it's only thirteen episodes long: I even discussed with this person there should be more of it when I took interest to the show and almost be a snitch to the teacher about it afterwards ('cause that's how it started).This kind of show is like a food for thought to this person, and I was all for it. Now, the art may be old, but you gotta appreciate the idea that a person could watch this on YouTube before COPPA or current YT CEO hellbent on a show that, for legal reasons, should not be distributed to the public. I mean, what the hell are you gonna watch when your teacher ain't that engaging? This show, of course!It can be raunchy at times. I mean hell it's a freaking HAND: like isn't your hand your girlfriend already?With that in mind: it's most definitely a classic. The characters can be iffy depending on your litmus test for tropes. Personally, it's mind-boggling enough to give your right hand having feelings. I would never think of such to this show because of it. It's very good.I appreciate shows that came out way before the 2010s which is sometimes hard to watch, but a pay-off to watch through it nonetheless. It was getting better at the time which probably at the time I was a complete normie. The only thing that got me caught in this web of trash goodness was Yu-Gi-Oh!, Hajime no Ippo, and TRIGUN (which ran short in my area and got cancelled for good).Overall, it's just making love to your hand.

The story begins from there to a 13 episodes short journey and I loved this anime so much, it is definitely one of the best rom com anime out there.I loved this anime and i will definitely recommend everyone to give it a...try:) try:)', ""I was a little hesitant of watching Midori Days at first because it seemed quite unconventional. However as soon as I started it, I had quite less complaints.STORY8/10It seems peculiar, doesn't it? I love this facet of the manga and anime industry. Where most of the TV soaps and movies have their limitations due to VFX, this industry can provide us with almost anything. Also matter as bizzare as a human becoming your right hand! It can explore, vary and broaden our imagination.CHARACTERS7/10The characters are not what I'd call mind blowing but they all have their share of adequate development.Startingwith Seji, I really admired him....He follows A-known-to-be-delinquent-but-actually-a-soft-person appeal. I know, I know, we have come across this a lot. But his development doesn't seem forced and is executed swiftly and softly unlike what we generally observe.Midori, for me, was a little less developed here. Her purpose from the beginning to the end remained same. Also noting her constant will to be a guy's right hand just because she was infatuated with him was superficial. She was naturally timid and  we do see her opening up and expressing her feelings but the anime doesn't let us explore this aspect or rather, is too short to do so.As far as the supporting characters are concerned, I enjoyed the side story in which Tsundere Ayase was involved. She didn't provide a tough competition for Midori (which we generally expect in a romance anime) but she had her own importance and her attempts to woo Seiji were comic. Seiji's sister Rin didn't really catch my attention or impress me. She was a little cliched and annoying during the show. Takamizawa,Miyahara, Shiori, and Kouta contributed a little as much as all supporting characters do.ANIMATION7/10The animation was pretty good. The transitions were fluid. But it was nothing special.SOUND7/10The OP and ED were decent. The voice actors were good pretty amazing and I'd like to give appreciation for that. The background music to was minimal and didn't seem as a principal focus in the show.ENJOYMENT7/10In the end, I was a little disappointed with no vindication given about how Midori became his right hand. But the excuse is, it's not a science fiction. The length could've been increased to around 20 episodes because I like my romance long.One good thing about Midori Days was that the fanservice didn't interrupt the flow of the show *breathes relievingly*OVERALL SCORE: 7+7+8+7=7÷5 = 7.2AVERAGE SCORE: 7STATUS: Recommended.

He doesn't get very good grades, as he is more focused on fighting than he is on studying. He's one of the most feared ''bullies'' also referred to as ''the mad dog'' with the ''devil right hand''. I put bully in quotations as (cliche alert!) Seiji of course has a big heart and mostly fights to protect the weaker. Some students idolize him for it, but the majority of the people are just afraid of him.Which brings us to the main part of the story. The problem with Seiji is, that he isn't able to get a girlfriend as most of the girls are just scared of him. At the age of 17 he hasn't ever kissed a girl, or had a girlfriend.Seiji therefore gets all his love from his right-hand. That becomes even more clear when one day he wakes up and his silent lover Midori Kasugano (voiced by Kether Donahue) becomes his right hand. Yes, she literally becomes his right hand. Let me repeat that one more time, she literally becomes a dude's right..... Well I guess you get that the story gets kind off weird sometimes. Midori had a crush on Seiji for a long time. As we get to know Seiji and his life better and better, we get why doesn't have a girlfriend. He's totally blind to female attention, and tends to think very down to earth. Will he and Midori get a relationship? Will she ever become normal again? Will the story put some cliche morals in? Watch to find out!Midori days certainly has a high WTF-Japan rate. Not that that is necesseraly bad, but it doesn't work out in the favor of the Anime The Anime starts out as a nice little comedy, which just a very weird basic idea (which because it is a comedy, kinda works in it favor). However halfway down the road, the Anime suddenly gets really deep and sentimental, and it doesn't work out well. Don't get me wrong, I like Anime with a deep story and character development, however the story stays really shallow, but you suddenly dive in the past of a few characters and a lot of morals are stuffed in the story, while you're still left in the mood of the comedy. It just doesn't work out that well. It really is one of those ''ahh I see what you did there, but NO.'' moments. Too bad because if these two basic ideas where made into two anime's, it probably would've worked. Also, although I haven't described every character, there are way to less characters, and a lot of them are introduced and suddenly left out again. It's so sad as there are some really really good scenes.Visuals.The visuals are alright. Fighting scene's are not special, comedy scenes aren't special, coming to think of it, nothing really stands out. However, nothing is particularly bad either, it's all just average (well maybe a bit above average but not more than that.)Voice acting (DUB).On average the voices are alright, some are very good (e.g. Shuichi Takamizawa a friend of Seiji you'll get to know later on, and Seiji himself is also very good.) some are average (his sister, a few classmates from him), and most importantly, Midori's voice is just annoying. Once you realize how high it is and how forced it sounds you won't get over it which destroys the feel of the Anime a lot.Sound.The sound and music is good, great at times. The music at the sentimental points and flashbacks as a matter of fact, is so good that it kinda helps you to get sucked into the story anyways.Re-watch value.You might want to watch this a few times, but I don't think it will get you out more satisfied than before, so it's not like it's a must.

Dispite the ending though the story telling of the anime was...awesome I think everyone in the story fit in perfectly.

"", ""Midori no Hibi may initially appear unconventional, introducing a rather strange premise, but as the series unfolds, it adheres closely to the conventions of typical romance anime. While the show heavily relies on comedic moments, they grow increasingly repetitive and exhausting towards the series' conclusion. Character development follows a standard trajectory within the genre, offering little deviation, ultimately leading the characters back to where they began (which is not very satisfying) . Although there are occasional scenes featuring high-quality animation, the majority of the series remains rather average in terms of visual appeal. The biggest flaw of Midori no Hibi lies in its conventional nature,...relying on a gimmick to stand out, yet ultimately failing to do so. While the series isn't necessarily bad, it lacks a compelling reason to watch, especially when there are many other anime offerings in the same genre that truly stand out. relying on a gimmick to stand out, yet ultimately failing to do so.

The two find themselves having to learn to adjust to their unique circumstances with Seiji not having his regular hand to use for fights and having a girl residing in his household while being where his right hand would be.Midori Days largely gets by on its humor concerning Midori and...Seiji’s unique situation, and the rather colorful supporting characters they interact with throughout the series. I’ll admit the humor did have its moments it got to me as Midori possessing Seiji’s right hand complicates things at times with his living situation with him now having a girl living with him and Seiji unwillingly being dragged into things Midori wishes to do at his behest. Some of the supporting characters also have their amusing moments such as Seiji’s sister, Rin, usually abruptly returning to the household to have things go her way and Seiji’s class representative, Takako, attempting to attract him through rather cliched romantic methods to no avail. On the other hand, the doll otaku character, Shuichi, annoyed me in episodes that focused on him due to how obnoxious he came off with his obsessive love for dolls and being an outright stalker of Midori, assuming that she is a puppet that Seiji owns.Outside of the comedy, Midori Days is about as typical as you can get for a romantic comedy series. The characters largely have their character types they stick with throughout the series, though Seiji and Midori do get some gradual character development throughout the series due to their unique situation. Later episodes attempt to try coming off a bit more serious in their developments to focus on the current situation concerning the real Midori’s coma and how this affects her family and friends. But due to the rather limited depth of many of the characters within Midori’s personal life and the heavy focus on comedy throughout much of the anime, this doesn’t have as much emotional impact as intended.In short, Midori Days is an okay rom-com thanks to its unusual method with Midori becoming Seiji’s right hand, with their unique situation and some of the actions of the supporting characters serving as the comedic highlights of the series. Beyond that, the series is pretty typical fare and doesn’t really do much else to stick out beyond its gimmick with its main pair of characters, being overshadowed by School Rumble as the rom-com of interest for many during the mid-2000s.

They try to go about life hiding that this happened to them and get into antics whether it\'s the heroine being mistaken for a doll, the heroine trying to thwart other love interests, and the hero getting into fights without the ability to use his hand.It\'s a weird premise and I thought with the ecchi...tag that it would just be a really disturbing allegory for masturbation but I was pleasantly surprised at how innocent and playful Midori no Hibi can be.

It doesn\'t drag and is easy to watch in one or two sittings.The art and animation are either on par or below average for 2004. Nothing is going to really pop out at you with bubblegum colors and after effects and say ""look at me"". A lot of the endearing moments come solely from the heroine but some side characters have fun scenes as well. There\'s mild nudity but it\'s not treated as over the top fan service.The hero is kind of a misunderstood person but he has his flaws, the heroine being in place of the thing that got him in the most trouble in the first place softens him up as the series goes on. She is extremely affectionate and he treats her like a friend or a burden depending on the situation. Side characters such as love interests, other delinquents, and friends all cause some sort of conflict that eventually needs to be resolved.A surprisingly fun watch with fun characters.

It had all the elements to be something special, but man does it fall flat on it's face hard.I guess I'll list off some things I enjoyed before I go into what I hated. The art direction is very expressive. Character heavily bounce between their standard look and more cartoony ones fairly regularly and its entertaining to see. The voice acting is also really solid (least when talking about the sub). The dub does have it's merits too, reminding me a lot of Golden Boy. Finally Midori...(for all the negative stuff I'll have to say about her later) does work well for the gimmick. She is the perfect personality to have in such a silly situation. I find the full frontal nudity to be oddly refreshing for a show that is not very sexual at all (as well as being basically needed for it's gimmick to feel more natural).Now to best sum up what made me dislike this show: balance.Most romantic comedies have to balance at least some drama in with their comedy, and Midori days is no different. The problem is the series does it in a borderline rage inducing manner. The biggest victim of this is the character Ayase. We really meet her in the second episode when the male lead (with Midori already stuck to his hand) saves her from what was to be a horrifying situation. Now you would think with something that serious the series would treat her character with some respect and dignity right? Nope, she becomes the punching bag for basically the entire series. Maybe if the series did a better job setting her up as unlikable this could've work out, but instead she is written as a hopelessly in love teenager girl who fails at every turn.Midori is the next problem: the series gives you basically no reason to root for her. She is cute yes, but why is she the best match for Seiji? Out of every character who falls for him in the series she has the least going for her, she is just a rich girl who (prior to the series) basically stalked him to the point where she had random photos of him laying around her bedroom. Throughout the series she destroys any possibility he could have at the high school life he wants. She doesn't change him for the better either, rather he does that mostly on his own.I feel like the author had a solid rom-com on their hands but got stuck with a useless gimmick that basically forces the series to end up extremely predictable in the worst way possible. I think watching this just hit me the wrong way because during the first few episodes I really liked where things where going and thought it may shock me, but at time went on I realized how terrible the whole ordeal is.

The anime executes a standard plot with a refreshing twist. The show has some topless females and bikini shots, but they are presented in a tasteful way. The show also features some action scenes, which are scattered around, with Seji being a delinquent and all.Each episode features a new adventure in the lives of Seji and Midori. The show doesn't break new ground, but it's still an enjoyable watch. The ending is cute and happy, and the only ending that...an anime like Midori Days could have.What I love the most about Midori Days is the whole concept of bringing out what's on the inside of oneself, both feelings of love and suppressed personality traits. The characters don't develop much in the sense that their personalities change, but they do develop by bringing out feelings of love or personality traits that are hidden from others. The cast isn't extremely original or large, but they are a lovable gang.The quality of the animation is quite good for this type of anime. The whole story takes place in a city, and there are frequent scenes in high places with scenic views of the city, which are usually animated quite well. Street views of the city and other close-ups, such as furniture in rooms, are usually beautiful and detailed, with the lighting and shading effects being particularly gorgeous. The character designs are varying in quality, but they are mostly good.The weakest part of the anime is the soundtrack. It's not outright bad, but it's quite standard fare for a romantic comedy. The voice acting is superb, though, and the seiyuu manages to portray the characters very well.Overall, Midori's Days is a short, charming anime that's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a show that's light-hearted and easy to follow. an anime like Midori Days could have.What I love the most about Midori Days is the whole concept of bringing out what's on the inside of oneself, both feelings of love and suppressed personality traits.

The only true bizarre scene is the last one, so make sure to note that it's not realistic.Tbh, it took me a while for me to realize that when the characters mention the horse races, they...mean they go to bet on the winning horse(s) rather than actually participating in the horse races. Thanks to this episode, I got the general gist of what Japanese people do during horse races (but only the realistic stuff.

Thank you) This causes him to develop Gynophobia (fear of women) and his body reacts to this phobia by secreting blood from his nose. Which is weird because, I don\'t know, don\'t normally main male lead in RomCom gets punched by a girl after his nose starts bleeding? So doesn\'t these nosebleeds makes it worse? So in a nutshell, he doesn\'t want to be touched by girls. So is it a sign for him to turn to the gay side?Kinjiro is reliable, when time comes, and he is depended heavily on Subaru. Which is good because he is the one responsible most of the time for bringing the ""dere"" side out of her.[Konoe Subaru]The generic trap in every anime who makes fun of flat chested girls. Though she looks nothing like a flat chest girl! This is blasphemy! Now even girls with B cup sizes can look like a guy in 5 easy steps?

She has the best of both worlds. Wanted both by males and females. She is an interesting character to me. She has her own harem (a tsundere with a harem? Even more blasphemy!), however her harem consists of the same gender. So do I label it as a harem or as a reverse harem?

It started out very well and interesting; and the more episodes I watched, the more I fell in love with the anime.Each episode kept me more and more interested in the anime. And even with my second run-through of rewatching the whole anime, I felt the same joy... there was a happiness that I felt more and more as I watched and enjoyed the series.There is romance, ecchi (not ridiculous ecchi), comedy, & cross-dressing, and it's very entertaining. To me, I felt this anime was much of a generic romcom (romance/comedy)... where it doesn't teach much...or give meaningful insights on symbolism to life and such. But that it's entertainment purposes, of which it does very well in providing that!This anime is about romance between main character Jirou (male) and slightly less main character Subaru (female). Its interesting plot is set to expand upon the episodes of bonding between these two who started off on the wrong foot. There are also a few important supporting characters who are very likable; they assist in moving the story forward and supporting the main character. Having these side characters each play their unique roles in the story along with their interactions with the main protagonist really makes this anime a joy and laugh to watch.The opening song also really grew on me and if you watch it, it'll grow on you too. The pacing itself is very well done throughout the series; giving me such a high incentive to continue watching, I marathoned the whole 12 episodes and skipped my sleep that night  >->  However, many people including myself felt that there was something missing from/after the conclusion.Have you ever watched those anime's where it is good, but there is something that you just want from it, something more...  even though you've already finished all the episodes? That's how this anime is. However, it is very enjoyable nonetheless. I know that the anime may leave fans wanting more, but accepting its conclusion appreciates the enjoyment that came from the anime.I would say that satisfaction varies upon viewers around: 7.75 to 8.75 out of 10. or give meaningful insights on symbolism to life and such.

I actually wish I had skipped all the episodes without her in it because this anime doesn't have much else going for it other than horribly overused harem cliches and ecchies thrown into a huge pile of you know what.Story 6:Guy discovers girl's secret. They make agreement to keep secret. They get close. Some other random girls show up. Lots of blushing and more blushing and nosebleeds. Every girl falling for the MC... how original.Art 9:The art is pretty impressive honestly.

These can be for simple nostalgic imagery, or simply to pull in a certain type of crowd. However, what separates most series is the reliance on these things and the ability to also tell an interesting story, with great characters and lovely animation. Mayo Chiki, unfortunately, prefers to go with the grain.Kinjiro Sakamachi, a high school student, suffers from gynophobia. To the point of where he\'ll get a nose bleed whenever he has physical contact with a female and can cause him to also pass...out depending on the length of physical contact. During an incident in a restroom, he happens to find that the extremely popular and good looking bishie butler Subaru Konoe is actually a girl. Subaru and her master, Kanade Suzutsuki, who is more of a sadist and the mastermind, decide to ""help"" cure Kinjiro of his gynophobia. Thus, our story begins!While the concept itself is not new, nor is the story itself is somewhat fresh, what makes it interesting is the relationship between Subaru and Kinjiro. Boy finds out girl\'s secret, boy keeps it a secret and slowly becomes friends with girl. Girl and boy slowly start to develop feelings, and girl struggles with the fact that she wants the relationship to progress but the boy is too dense and ends up missing this meaning. Had the show stuck to this formula and build the show around this with comedy elements, it would of been a much stronger show and would of been far stronger overall as a series. Sadly, we end up with a bombardment of ecchi scenes, and a plot that goes little to nowhere with clichés jam packed.Mayo Chiki\'s biggest issue is while it does deviate from the plot itself, it seems to have a difficult time staying on track. For the first several episodes, the show actually sticks fairly well to the meat of the story and is fairly enjoyable. However, as the show progresses and we are introduced to Masamune Usami and Nakuru Narumi, we are forced to accept the fact of what this show truly is. Pure fan service and stereotypes. Sadly, for the remaining half we are forced to sit through awkward fan service and un-funny comedy scenes from time to time until we get to the big episode. Episode 8 introduces us to the big chance for the plot to change. Subaru looks to Jiro, and express to him that she doesn\'t want to be just friends and the episode ends. What\'s going to happen next? Is she going to confess, or is she going to keep it buried inside? Suspense builds and anticipation grows and then the next episode is.. Kinjiro working at a maid cafe? Wait, what? Oh by the way, that huge plot point? Simply thrown away in two lines of casual dialogue in the episode. Moments like this completely take me out of the show and frustrate me to no end, because this is the big moment for Mayo Chiki to really come out and shine, but it completely throws it all away for two filler episodes that do nothing with the gynophobia, or Subaru and Kinjiro.While the show itself has one episode left, it\'s rather obvious that the episode is going to do little to nothing with the plot itself, as the story seems to be completely wrapped up for this first season. What are we left with? Thirteen episodes of disappointment and broken promises of what could of been a decent show. By no means are the characters bad, and at times Mayo Chiki shows signs of intelligence, but never does anything with it than simply pander to a type of crowd.Art (7/10)The one aspect of Mayo Chiki that definitely shines through is the animation itself. Characters are fluid and scenes are rather bright and full of color. While the show isn\'t exactly an action series, the scenes that do have Kinjiro being beaten up by his sister, Kureha, and whenever he does get kicked around by either Usami or Subaru do look rather nice.Probably one of the biggest shames about this series is it\'s well animated and very few short cuts are used, yet it is used for random fan service scenes.Sound (8/10)Sound, like with animation, is also rather well done. While I found the opening singer to be more ear-grating, the introduction is rather nicely done. Voice actors do a rather nice job with their lines, and I felt that Satoshi Hino, who voiced Kinjiro, really stole the show. By far being rather diverse with his dialogue. However, Yuka Iguchi (Subaru) and Eri Kitamura (Kanade) really did a nice job as well. With Eri really helping give Kanade that sadistic personality, yet at the same time giving glimpse of just how fragile she can actually be and Yuka giving Subaru a diverse vocal range of when she pretends to be a man, and her normal speaking voice.By far the strongest part of Mayo Chiki.Overall (4/10)Mayo Chiki was actually one of my genuine surprises for 2011.I was rather impressed with just how well constructed the series was, despite the fact that it was obviously meant to be a throw-away show just for a specific type of audience. However, it became painfully obvious that the show wouldn\'t break the chains it was bound in and simply ended up embracing them. While the show isn\'t terrible by any means, it\'s not going to get any new fans unless you enjoy anime cliches, a decent amount of fan service and a plot that panders around.If Mayo Chiki ever ends up with a second season, I can only hope that the creators will take a chance to deviate from the norm a bit more and present us with a surprise, which is what I was hoping for the first season to be. out depending on the length of physical contact.

The story also seems to be interesting, but this also...comes from a personal preference that I like to stories about a female that crossdresses as a male.The art is nice, I don\'t usually like guys with glasses but the art in this anime is capable of making the protagonist good looking to me. I also like how when Subaru is dressed as a boy the effect of actually making her look and sound like a male can be achieved, unlike in Ouran High School Host Club where Haruhi still retains some femininity, which fits the story well.The protagonist, Kinjirou, seems to be average looking but his fear of women, and his body\'s ""special"" ability, as well as his family make him seem above average. His little sister has an interesting personality and reminds me a bit of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! Subaru seems to be fully into the part of a male and a butler but also has a feminine side which is to be expected.Overall I\'d say this anime is worth watching. It probably won\'t make it into your favorites but it\'s not bad by any means. comes from a personal preference that I like to stories about a female that crossdresses as a male.The art is nice, I don\'t usually like guys with glasses but the art in this anime is capable of making the protagonist good looking to me. I also like how when Subaru is dressed as a boy the effect of actually making her look and sound like a male can be achieved, unlike in Ouran High School Host Club where Haruhi still retains some femininity, which fits the story well.The protagonist, Kinjirou, seems to be average looking but his fear of women, and his body\'s ""special"" ability, as well as his family make him seem above average. His little sister has an interesting personality and reminds me a bit of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! Subaru seems to be fully into the part of a male and a butler but also has a feminine side which is to be expected.Overall I\'d say this anime is worth watching. It probably won\'t make it into your favorites but it\'s not bad by any means.', ""Mayo Chiki is really just another typical high school/fan service anime with plenty of boob shots, a cat girl, a main character who can't interact with females, a hyperactive younger sister and the female/man butler combo. Visually Mayo Chiki is well animated and the character designs are well done, even though they all seem a little too familiar. There is nothing new which makes this series stand out from other anime of the same genre so I don't expect anyone to watch this series and regard it at one of their favourite animes of the year, but it does make for a good gap filler...in between some of the better releases planned for this summer. This is an easy to watch anime, there is nothing complicated or mind blowing about the story or the visuals but in the end it's still a fun series to pass the time while waiting for something better to come along.Review by Charles Shepherdwww.electricbloomwebzine.blogspot.com in between some of the better releases planned for this summer. This is an easy to watch anime, there is nothing complicated or mind blowing about the story or the visuals but in the end it's still a fun series to pass the time while waiting for something better to come along.Review by Charles Shepherdwww.electricbloomwebzine.blogspot.com"", 'There are still a couple of episodes to go, now that all main characters have been featured it is time to make my review, and my ratings are:Story- fair 6.The plot of the story is very simple and it is for the El Pollo ( Spanish for ""Chicken"" and I\'m referring to Sakamachi Kinjirou) to protect the cross dressing chiquita\'s ( Konoe Subaru the female lead) secret after he accidentally discovered it, which, by the way nearly ended his life, the arc of the story is not something were the chiquita (Konoe) moves into the El Pollo\'s (Jirou) life to mess things up....Actually, it is more like an accidental romance waiting to happen, but there are some challenges along the way for the 2, and it always involves the chiquita\'s mistress, Kanade who too bored with everyday life and finds fun in putting the 2 in a lot of awkward situations.Art- mediocre 5.The art itself can be compared to other animes like ""Infinite Stratos,"" ""Working,"" and ""Toradora.""Sound - good 7.All I can say is that i like both the opening and ending themes, I also admire Konoe\'s seiyu Yuka Iguchi, if I\'m not mistaken she once did a voice of some rich man\'s daughter in ""Mayoi Neko Overrun"" as Chise Umemori, I really can\'t believe that she can do voices of someone who\'s childish and someone who\'s like a MILF. Frankly, Konoe\'s voice actually sounds like a MILF than a dude.Characters: decent 4.I said decent, co\'z their are some info about the characters which were somewhat mismentioned so some added info about them should be appropriate, so let\'s start with the following:Konoe Subaru- Info states that she works for the Suzutsuki\'s estate as a butler?????? Ok,  that\'s a given, her immediate ward is the young and diabolical Mistress Kanade at first- before the El Pollo (Jirou) discovers her true gender, life for her is just the usual: serve the mistress(Kanade) with the utmost dedication which may probably include playing along with the latter\'s sexual advances ( she (Kanade) did mentioned that she has feelings for her)  , do good in school, and be careful that no one finds out your true gender. Upon meeting the El Pollo (Jirou) through unusual circumstances, life for her has somewhat change co\'z she\'s now faced with the predicament of  balancing her dedication with her mistress (Kanade) and her feelings for the El Pollo(Jirou). In ep9, the chiquita (Konoe) has stated that she wants to be the El Pollo\'s best friend, however it may also suggest that she is just being careful because her mistress (Kanade) might hear it and plan a bigger scheme to have more fun. By the way in this anime, she\'s the one with the balls here, since it was her who does all the buttkicking not only towards the El Pollo (Jirou), but to other cast as well.Sakamachi Kinjirou - As stated, he\'s called ""Chicken"" not only because he\'s a wuss, but because went one is to combine the last 3 letters from his surname with the first 3 letters of his first name you get a misspelled word ""Chikin."" Kanade would either call him ""Chikin"" but most of the time she will address him as ""Jirou,"" for Usami, she would call him ""Baka Chikin,"" most of the time that is, especially when she\'s pissed, in fact she is always pissed at the El Pollo (that\'s what I call him and again that\'s ""Chicken"" in Spanish). This poor El Pollo (Jirou) went through a lot in the hands of his sadistic wrestling superstar mom and his equally sadistic sister, which later on he developed a certain disease call ""Gynophobia"" that cause him to develop sever nose bleed when touched by a girl, ok so we all know that,duh. The thing about him, is that he\'s one gynophobic who can  still talk to girls- from a certain distance that is, be in a classroom with girls around provided by that his seatmate is Kurose Yamato his classmate way back from junior high, it is even suggested that they both used to share and exchange porn mags and it may also suggested that he also experiences sexual arousal\'s when viewing such lewd publications. Info states, that he\'s capable of fighting, but in one episode all I saw was (at least in this anime) is him  putting up alright, but ending up being punching bag as usual when he encounters the chiquita\'s father (Subaru Nagare) in disguise. Another thing about the El Pollo, is that he always falls victim not only with Kanade\'s  schemes but also with her sexual advances as well, it is not known whether or not the mistress (Kanade) has any feelings for him or was he just being teased for fun by the latter, but what is known is that all she did promise to help him cure her Gynophobia.........or at least that is what she always says.Kanade Suzutsuki - well, she\'s rich, she\'s pampered, she\'s the school principal\'s only kid, she\'s spoiled and most of all, she\'s bored, the moment she found out that one of the student discovered her butler\'s secret she instantly hit upon an idea to have fun with the 2 parties involved. That is, to manipulate her butler\'s blind obedience and to make use of the poor El Pollo\'s stupidity coupled with his psychological disorder. It is suggested that she\'s bisexual, since info suggest that she has feeling both for the chiquita (Konoe) and for the El Pollo since she both  teases them, however, to whom she more into is yet to be known. As for the background of this character, I can\'t seem to understand  that for her to be a principal\'s daughter is an understatement because school principles don\'t have such luxurious privileges and the school where this character is in don\'t look like some high class institution where it is exclusive for the rich, in fact most of the characters who are attending that school seems to just be part of the middle class.Usami Masamune - also called ""Usamin"" by the El Pollo, well all know that she\'s a former member of some radical fan group called S4 or better known as ""Shooting Star Sabaru Sama,""  of course no harem would be complete without a tsundere who\'s also competition for the El Pollo\'s affection. She\'s also one of those who kicks the El Pollo\'s ass, cute as she is, I\'m still for Konoe to be the El Pollo\'s love interest.Kureha Sakamachi - It is hard to say if whether or not if she has a brotherly complex for the El Pollo, what is known is that she always practices her wrestling move against her brother and she like tomatoes  a lot. And recently she has a crush on the chiquita (Konoe), but I wonder if she\'ll become lesbian when she finds out that that chiquita (Konoe) is a girl.Nakuru Narumi - For a ganguro who\'s a fan of BL (Boys Love.....EEEEEEWWWW) I don\'t see her flaunting her collection of BL manga, the only thing she\'s flaunting is her fetish for glasses, ok so she\'s the chairwoman of a group of BL fans called “Let’s warmly protect Sabaru Sama,"" but I don\'t see her being with her group, the only person she\'s with most of the time is with the El Pollo\'s sister Kureha and sometime she\'s seen with Usami. She probably the only character who get\'s drunk on carbonated drinks and can turn into a perverted lesbian or a bisexual.Enjoyment- good 7.What make this anime enjoyable is its comedy and romance genre,  this is one anime were the bellas (female cast) are on top and the hombres (male cast) are the underdogs. Also, this anime has quite an unusual harem genre in it, were it is shared both by the chiquita (Konoe) and by the El Pollo (Jirou), there are of course some ecchi in it but it is a bit subtle and safe enough to be view by a 13 year old with parental supervision.Overall - good 7.Like I\'ve said, there are still a couple of episodes to go, however, I kinda have a feeling that the chiquita (Konoe) will probably come clean and the El Pollo will still be Gynophobic, but, here\'s the thing, it is possible that even though the chiquita (Konoe) has come clean, the remaining female class will turn lesbian and the El Pollo will be left in the sides, let\'s just say that there is part of the opening theme which serves as a give away, if it is, I guess we just have to wait and see. Actually, it is more like an accidental romance waiting to happen, but there are some challenges along the way for the 2, and it always involves the chiquita\'s mistress, Kanade who too bored with everyday life and finds fun in putting the 2 in a lot of awkward situations.Art- mediocre 5.The art itself can be compared to other animes like ""Infinite Stratos,"" ""Working,"" and ""Toradora.""Sound - good 7.All I can say is that i like both the opening and ending themes, I also admire Konoe\'s seiyu Yuka Iguchi, if I\'m not mistaken she once did a voice of some rich man\'s daughter in ""Mayoi Neko Overrun"" as Chise Umemori, I really can\'t believe that she can do voices of someone who\'s childish and someone who\'s like a MILF.

I thought I was gonna get a generic anime with some ecchi sprinkled on top. I regret that train of thought completely. Its not a generic anime with ecchi sprinkled on top, its an anime with AMAZINGLY placed ecchi and hilarity combined with a decent story and great characters!Story:The story is heading in a way that Jirou and Subaru\'s friendship keeps growing with each passing episode, with events bringing them closer together. It also looks like Subaru and Kanade\'s friendship will be slowly restored to what it once was before an incident in their past. It...also keeps that comedic aspect with Kureha\'s love for Subaru and Kanade causing great misunderstandings that cause Jirou hell every episode. This never stopped even til the very end, with the final episode just being a cluster of misunderstandings and perversion. It went out with a bang!Art:It\'s pleasing to the eyes, the colors are vivid, the characters are well designed, with a wide array of different character styles being used, from kiddy designs (Jiriou\'s tomboy sister) to mature cosplay (The catgirl cosplayer in episode one).Sound:I found the Opening and Ending themes to be quite appealing to listen to. They aren\'t amazing amazing, but they are still really nice and go really well with the anime and the opening and ending sequences respectively. With each passing episode I seem to love the music more.Character:Jirou is that cool geek guy you get every once in a while. The man with Gynophobia due to... family problems. That... surprised me to say the least, and sadly for him he\'s been labeled as gay to to his gynopobia. That alone made me like his character since normally the guys are either accidental pervs or are no balled men that can\'t stand up to girls. Jirou is none of that, he likes his women! He just fears for his life due to his family! Totally waiting to see if he can get over his fear of girls in some way. By the looks of things, his gynophobia is going to stay for quite sometime at the rate things are going. Not that I mind, its hilarious to see.Subaru is the trap butler that never gets old. But, Subaru... is absurdly cute. Having to be such a serious butler for Kanade and then able to go into an extremely girl state amuses me to no end! Her affection of sheep is adorable as well! From the first episode I thought she might have no weaknesses, but gravely mistaken as in episode 3 a childhood fear is revealed, making her more likeable since she isn\'t ""invincible"".Kanade seemed innocent at first, which I was like ""Sure ok, every anime needs the innocent Ojou-Sama"". I was naive, There is nothing innocent in that woman. At all. I won\'t spoil anything, go watch the first episode to understand why I say such things. I said this all before episode three. She does have her kind side of course, since she does care for Subaru and the others as shown this episode. But.. She\'s still pretty darn evil when she has nothing better to do!Kureha is that insanely strong tomboy you see once in a blue moon. She is insanely strong, having fought a bear on equal footing, only breaking an arm in the process. She also has one hell of a variety of wrestling moves. I was in love!Usami is your general Tsundere gone DereDere by the end. She also has that Kureha charm with her insane strength. Plus, I damn found her cute as hell! I fell for Usami hard, loved her the entire series!Nakaru is the cosplaying Boys Love loving lunatic. She\'s pretty insane, with her intense love for boys love. But, the final episode showed me a side of her that made me go ""AWWW... AWWWW!"" It was pretty fantastic.Enjoyment:I might dare say this is my favorite comedy of the summer. I dare say it was actually. I have enjoyed every single episode of Mayo Chiki! I have been laughing at Jirou\'s poor state. Kanade giving him a hard time (Chicken-kun~), Subaru knocking him into a figurative coma. His sister beating down on him. Dear lord, he was abused wasn\'t he! (All the more fun for me!)Overall, I\'m totally going to keep watching this to see where it goes and how funny it can get. Hopefully we\'ll get some more backstory on Jirou since there are some things I\'m curious about his past. also keeps that comedic aspect with Kureha\'s love for Subaru and Kanade causing great misunderstandings that cause Jirou hell every episode.

I usually only feel this emptiness when I finish a series and still possess the craving for more.Story -The story is pretty basic. Typical slice of life comedy of a girl with a secret being found out by a guy who then becomes her object of affection.Art - The art is pretty good. It has a mild, yet pleasing look. Not too vibrant, not too dull. I don\'t know how to explain it. The characters are pretty well drawn and enjoyable.Sound - The...OP is decent. It\'s not my favorite but it contains those ""pick up the pace towards the end"" kind of feelings. It starts off slow and mellow but after it repeats itself the pace really picks up. Gives viewers a good adrenaline rush. Ending is pretty mellow as well but I usually skip it and go to the next episode.Characters - The main characters are the typical bunch. Rich Girl with a butler who falls in love with the guy who finds out her butlers secret, Butler that hides her true gender and falls in love with the same guy, various girls who have a crush on the butler but end up falling for the main guy (at least 1 does, typical harem business so I don\'t feel like it\'s a spoiler), and a sister who loves her brother and doesn\'t want another girl to take him away.I thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping for a season 2, the ending sort of hints towards one since he mentions ""beginning of our relationship"" or whatever.I was really hoping that there would be more mutual feelings thrown in towards the end but I\'m glad that Konoe was finally able to express her true feelings to him.^^^ not really a spoiler since we know thats what happens in rom coms...

This is my favorite anime out of all the anime that I have ever watched. I fell in love with it. Ever since I started watching this anime at ep 1, I couldn't stop! I never went to sleep I watched all the way from ep 1 to 6 from (unknown time) to 6 in the morning! It's because this anime is so beautiful and it has such a fantastic story. Every time I watched the anime, there was always something new and this anime always kept me happy. The more I watched the more I also...fell in love with the opening theme song.If you ever are feeling down, rewatch this anime and it'll bring back lots of memories from when you first watched it. You'll be happier/more joyful than you expect to be. If you want to or you are watching this anime, then be sure to remember that the anime ends at ep 12, because ep 13 is just an OVA (extra episode that has no real purpose). Anyway, many people are disappointed at this anime because they wanted more (and also because they thought that ep13 was the last ep), but I accepted it's ending and it made me happier than most people. I want people to be happy for watching this great anime and accept ep 12 that it is the real ending. So remember my words when you get to ep 12, aha!

Spoilers might be included. Professional approach on the subject not included.Oh God, I don\'t even know where to start this messy clusterfuck of a show.Long long ago while this show was still airing I\'ve decided to watch it and dropped it several episodes hence. Several years afterwards when I finally got around to checking which animes I have watched, I saw this and thought ""hey this seems good, why haven\'t I seen this before"" which brings me here.Oh God, where to start. For starters, there are the general actions of the bloody characters. The...characters appear to walking three years old with the body of teenagers. They accept commands simply because and their idea of common sense are basically not there. Things like ""I am doing sexual petting to cure MC\'s gynophobia""(which by the way, his ailment is not. A phobia is an irrational fear and our mc does not suffer fear from women, irrational or not) is straightforward stupid. It is bad enough when the butler does this because she is ordered to but when everyone else does is not reasonable in any way, ailments be damned. That stuff is something you do with a boyfriend, husband, whatever, not someone you just met some days ago and shit!Then there\'s the harem situation. For most harem titles the heroines will flock to the mc because of coincidence, fate stuff because here. But in here the heroines get to fall for the mc because of the dumbest reasons. The first one, being the butler falls under the category of the basic harem coincidence and goes onward from there but the others include:""I will use mc to make someone I like jealous yet I don\'t know that the person I like is actually a girl and somehow I fell in love with the mc in this scenario"".While the other is ""I will pair the mc with someone else \'cause they totally look good together but I want to tease mr mc as well because reasons. But wait! Somehow I\'ve managed to fall in love with him as well and now I\'m stuck with having to mediate for this two people while here I am, in love with the other person because of my own machinations, oops"".Now doesn\'t that sound stupid. Well yes it is.Then there\'s the scenarios that they get into. Why the hell would you think that the best cure for someone with fear of knives is do a pretend kidnapping? Oh, and lets throw in a knife wielding kidnapper in that scenario as well. On what universe does that seem to be the best answer to curing someone? Then there\'s the forgetting my only sibling\'s birthday and the I made my butler lose her job because I don\'t look where I walk yet I somehow magically swerved to go down the stairs. Well this is a comedy but come on, at least give your characters a brain at least.The only good thing about this series is the art, which I will admit is pretty good, and the fanservice, if you look at shows just for them. I mean they made basically hentai screenshots in a non-hentai anime, so there\'s that.Honestly this whole show is just plain fanservice pandering and stupid scenarios. It was a really painful drag to finish this show and I\'m wondering how I finished it when I have dropped more interesting stuff. characters appear to walking three years old with the body of teenagers. They accept commands simply because and their idea of common sense are basically not there. Things like ""I am doing sexual petting to cure MC\'s gynophobia""(which by the way, his ailment is not. A phobia is an irrational fear and our mc does not suffer fear from women, irrational or not) is straightforward stupid. It is bad enough when the butler does this because she is ordered to but when everyone else does is not reasonable in any way, ailments be damned. That stuff is something you do with a boyfriend, husband, whatever, not someone you just met some days ago and shit!Then there\'s the harem situation. For most harem titles the heroines will flock to the mc because of coincidence, fate stuff because here. But in here the heroines get to fall for the mc because of the dumbest reasons. The first one, being the butler falls under the category of the basic harem coincidence and goes onward from there but the others include:""I will use mc to make someone I like jealous yet I don\'t know that the person I like is actually a girl and somehow I fell in love with the mc in this scenario"".While the other is ""I will pair the mc with someone else \'cause they totally look good together but I want to tease mr mc as well because reasons. But wait! Somehow I\'ve managed to fall in love with him as well and now I\'m stuck with having to mediate for this two people while here I am, in love with the other person because of my own machinations, oops"".Now doesn\'t that sound stupid. Well yes it is.Then there\'s the scenarios that they get into. Why the hell would you think that the best cure for someone with fear of knives is do a pretend kidnapping? Oh, and lets throw in a knife wielding kidnapper in that scenario as well. On what universe does that seem to be the best answer to curing someone?

If you are looking for a light-hearted romance/comedy then you\'ve found the right anime!Story 7/10Mayo Chiki is based around your self-proclaimed ""normal"" high school student Sakamachi Kinjirou who lives a not so normal everyday life. His mother is a professional wrestler and sister following in her footsteps. This leads to Sakamachi becoming a punching bag for his mother and daughter making his body develop an illness which makes his nosebleed by the simple touch of a girl! At school he attends in the same class as high...school beauty Suzutsuki Kanade who has a butler that is quite popular with the girls named Subaru Konoe. Although as our main protagonist soon finds out Konoe isn\'t exactly everything he appears to be! Sakamachi accidentally discovers that Konoe is actually a girl and our adventure begins!The story isn\'t anything special but it does enough to keep your attention. It seems to have taken the road of many generic romance/comedy cross-dressing animes out there and only tries a bit to make itself different. It\'s typically about a girl cross-dressing as a butler attending high school and must keep her true gender a secret. Quite typical among many animes of this genre such as Maria Holic!Art 8/10The art is pretty well-done and nice to look at. From the character designs, to the environments and animations it all blends in well together.Sound 8/10The sound was another great aspect. Besides the opening and ending the BGM fit very nicely and of course the soundtracks went according to the mood and atmosphere to give it a more emotional feel. The voice actors did a splendid job acting out the emotions from anger, cleverness, sadness, happy and so on very well. Especially during tsundere moments where they would sound angry and unpleasant one minute and sweet and gentle the next.Characters 7/10I\'m not going to get specific with each character individually but I will give you the basic idea behind them all. The characters were a bit generic such as our main protagonist Kinijirou Sakamachi, being the guy completely ignorant not knowing when a girl likes him even when it is completely obvious to those around him and the audience. Typical nice guy who tries to be helpful to everyone; however with a little fight in him when picked on by the girls.Then we have our girls who are border-line generic as well. Our typical tsundere Usami,  clever-witty girl Kanade, loving sister Kureha and the main female protagonist who is a mix of a little bit of everything Konoe. I think you\'ll find many characters like these if you\'ve watched several romance animes however they do present them quite nicely and do show some progression in their character as the show goes on so it gets a point for that.Enjoyment 8/10Well, even though the story isn\'t all that fantastic I did enjoy it a lot. Since it is a romance/comedy it has its funny moments, and I must say I was cracking up throughout the whole show. Its story and simple romance is made up for in its comedy if not the comedy actually adds to the story. During the early episodes I was laughing up a storm and when I had attempted to watch this to pass the time at my college I had to shut it off before I started cracking up in class. The comedy with the added romance just made me burn through this show in one sitting, drawing me in to see how the story would all play out while breezing through the episodes simply because I was just laughing so much or had to see what happened next.Overall 7/10Mayo Chiki! is your typical romance/comedy cross-dresser anime. The story is decent and easy to figure out. Even though it\'s a bit generic it does have its differences and its comedy makes up a bit for what it lacks. If you are searching for a romance/comedy anime that\'s a bit more heavy on the comedy, then this anime may be for you! It\'s quite an enjoyable watch and even though it doesn\'t get an A grade in the romance department it does just enough to satisfy the viewer who\'s hungry for romance while they are getting their fill on laughs as well.They don\'t exactly say who our main character ends up with but it makes it quite clear in episode 12.Took awhile to decide between a 7 or 8 but in the end it gets a 7/10 due to it following a bit of a generic story and being a little to light on the romance then it should have been.

Even though Jiro had always hidden his fear for quite sometime he is forced to cure it by Suzusuki. All because of poor Jirou discovering the famed Subaru is actually a girl. The story evolves from the point where Subaru is forced to cure Jiro's phobia. Every time there is romantic moments between Jiro and Subaru there comes an awkward situation causing the comedy moments to appear. Most of the story genre is romance and some comedy here and then, but most of it's romance. The art is done really good especially how...the characters respond to a statement and think wrong and when there is romantic moments. Sound is also done really well with how the characters try to express their emotions and the background sounds to go along with the situations.  Each character has a unique type of personality that is fun to figure out.Jiro - One of the main characters the story focuses on and is the character that struggles to cure his gynophobia. Jiro is the first character introduced in the manga when it begins. He keeps away from girls to make sure he doesn’t pass out from a nosebleed. Once he is forced to be cured by Suzutsuki he suffers from going through a lot of treatments. The thing in Jiro’s character that is interesting to look at is how he responds to Suzutsuki’s treatments and what happens to him just to cure his problem.Suzutsuki – Another main character in Mayo Chiki, who tries to cure Jiro of his gynophobia in exchange Jiro has to keep Subaru’s secret. She doesn’t really care what happens to Jirou while he goes through his treatment. She has a mysterious type of personality so you don’t know how she really is like. Her personality is interesting because sometimes she does want to help Jiro, but most of the time she tortures him.Subaru – A main character in Mayo Chiki who is discovered to be a girl by Jiro and stays by him to make sure he doesn’t say her secret. She obeys her master command no matter what it is, which makes her a very interesting character. When she is with Jiro she reacts awkwardly to him causing them to be in strange situations. She usually thinks the wrong way to something that isn’t.Overall this anime deserves a nine because of all the genres and situations it features.

This anime is really fun and enjoyable, no matter who watches it.PEOPLE WHO WILL (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:People who enjoy light stories, with funny characters, some stupid drama and cute reactions.PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:People who are bored of typical anime stories and can't stand fan service or ecchi anime.So, to kick off the review I will start with the story.Story (8/10) : The story is pretty original, considering the genre. A girl who dresses like a guy falls in love with a guy that can't stay...near girls. Pretty cheesy and cliche, but it suits the style of this anime. It's developement is decent and the end is really cool. So, yeah, pretty much you have a complete story of a typical ecchi/harem/romance anime, but it's really well done, that's why I rate it 8/10.Art (9/10) : The art is really well done, with smooth animation, unusual for this kind of anime. Not much to say here, because it is not unique, but it's still eye candy (for me at least).Sound (8/10) : Not much to say for the sound. The voice acting is good, the OST I don't even remember it.Character (8/10) : Considering the genre the characters develop fairly well.Sakamachi (Main) : He is your typical anime protagonist, with the small detail that he can't stay near women. It's really cool to watch how he creates relationships with some girls and how he learns to adapt. Also, his reaction are really funny.Konoe (Main) : Cool buttler boy, who proves to be a kawai girl. Really nice developement on this character and I really enjoyed the romance between her and Sakamachi.The rest of the characters aren't super wow, but they fit the plot like a glove.Enjoyment (10/10) :  I think the anime is really enjoyable, for most people at least. It radiates a good feeling and you can watch it without having to worry about anything. Funny, sad, cute. All these are good for a comedy anime, in my opinion.Overall (9/10) : I believe that this anime is a great example of new-gen comedy anime. It is fun. it is well done and it is complete. Maybe the ending doesn't fit to everyone, it's still a legit ending. It sure has some flaws here and there, like excessive fan service at some points, but some people enjoy it, some not. Generally, it is an anime I would reccomend to anyone who would like to spend some time to enjoy a nice anime. near girls. Pretty cheesy and cliche, but it suits the style of this anime.

From the description, I was expecting a short 13 episode comedic anime surrounding a boy and the situations his gynophobia would get him into, and while that is slightly accurate, I did not at all expect to feel for the characters and enjoy the plot in the manner I did.STORY/PLOT:The plot was pretty episodic. Jirou and his gynophobia was also a pretty straight forward aspect of the story. The man is extremely sensitive, and even the slightest touch from a girl causes his blood pressure to soar. Now you can...imagine poor Jirou's condition can be a rather frustrating inconvenience, and that led to some pretty funny and warming scenes. Keeping Subaru's secret was also a pretty amusing aspect of the plot, and it led to some pretty funny, and once again heart-warming scenes as well.CHARACTERS:I really liked the manner in which they had Jirou and Subaru's relationship progress throughout the anime. As their relationship progressed, so too did the complexity of their character develop, which allowed me to get a feel for both them as individuals, and as a pair.Some of the supporting characters such as Kanade, Masamune, and Kureha were nicely fleshed out as well, with their own respective back-stories and personalities.Unfortunately I did not take a liking to Nakuru. I found her underdeveloped compared to some of the other characters, and her personality was pretty generic, however I can forgive that due to the role she serves in the plot did not necessarily require her to stand out.ENJOYMENT:There were a number of scenes in this anime that invoked feels and genuine emotion for me. Keep in mind, it was not to the severity of the emotions induced from an anime like Clannad or Toradora, the scenes which did make me tear up or feel for the characters in the were well done and positively contributed to my enjoyment of this short, funny, and sweet anime.OVERALL - 8/10 imagine poor Jirou's condition can be a rather frustrating inconvenience, and that led to some pretty funny and warming scenes.

Well for starters this is one of those anime I pick based off of just the cover art alone. For every now and then I will just randomly pick something to watch and just use the cover art to give me just the smallest indication of what the show is.The story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who suffers from nose bleeds when in contact with girls. A new semester begins and on his first day as well, he bumps into Kanoe Subaru in the boys toilets. This which would be a normal thing, wasn't normal...due to one thing. Kanoe Subaru so happened to be wearing panties.After a few fists flying at each other and a lot of shouting we find out that Kanoe Subaru is a girl dressing up as a boy so that she can be a butler to a rich household. Subaru then entrusts Jirou to keep it a secret from the rest of the school as if she is found out she will have to quit being a butler.The premise seemed alright at first but then it quickly abandons the sense of consequence for if Subaru could be found out into a typical generic harem. For which have been tried, tested and rinsed thoroughly.Even more so Mayo Chikki is rated R+ yet it only shows nudity in the odd scene every now and then (which half of them being Jirou having imaginative and suggestive dreams about one of the many love interests). The characters are standard as well in terms of being no different to any other harem anime. You have the angry Tsundere, the shy girl, the know it all and then the main interest.Now I would be lying to you if I said I didn't enjoy the show but I did and in my opinion a 7 is a good score for this show. It is good...just not amazing.The art design is average anime fare so don't expect to be wowed by it's production values. Character designs are nice but generic and more aimed at a cutesy lolicon style.The soundtrack is very forgettable to say the least (albeit a catchy opening song) there is just no emotional punch in those key scenes and an overuse of one particular track that plays in most 'normal day' episodes.My only issue with the voice acting is that I sadly watched it in English dub and it wasn't very good. Some voices didn't fit naturally with certain characters but some were still serviceable i.e the main lead Jirou, so I will say watch it in Japanese.All in all to sum it up, Mayo Chikki! is a good show, just not a great one and that is down to it not exploring routes that could have put depth onto its wide cast of characters. Now this is a slice of life anime, if you are a fan of that genre like myself then give it a shot or if your very critical then I would say pass on it. due to one thing.

As some of the other reviews say, as a rom com, it's lacking in the romance part. The entire anime, you can tell that the romance is there, but never really goes beyond a few awkward moments and a few kisses, the two never really get together. In the end, I longed for more, and to see where it would go with the two, but they left it up in the air, and with no sign of a second season to possibly wrap things up. As I said, I enjoyed the anime, but the end was...very lacking and had me wanting more.

Personally this anime has crossed my line. The whole basis of this show is making the main character a punching bag constantly receiving blows from everyone else, as well as sexual assault(just because he\'s male and the females are hot doesn\'t mean it\'s ok), so I don\'t understand how you can like this show without being a masochist, I just spent the whole time sympathising with all the shit this guy goes through. So I hate the female protagonist, I\'m fine with reasonable tsunderes like from toradora, but it\'s too much...when you want to beat up someone into amnesia because you forgot to lock the door. I also hate the rich bitch because she claims to do everything to help them both, help the girl because she needs a normal life and help the dude because gynophobia, but she\'s the biggest harasser in the whole goddamn show. She forces sexual assault on both of them, and constantly puts them in unfavourable situations, she\'s just a selfish brat who pushes what she thinks is ""best"" on others. So I hate all the major characters pretty much(including the main guy\'s family, again, punching bag) and I also dislike the main dude because he just goes with all this and also goes along with sexual assault towards the female protagonist as well. when you want to beat up someone into amnesia because you forgot to lock the door.

He worries about Konoe and wants her to be happy... That\'s so heartwarming...{ART - 8/10}What impressed more about it was the animation. Eventhough action scenes aren\'t the focus in here, fighting moves were very well done and are full of those cool ""air explosions"".About the overall style, it has nothing too special.

There are many things about this anime that makes it enjoyable, however there are some areas that is lacking for a supposed Rom-Com. The characters are verrrry enjoyable and the anime itself is a great one with lots of new content and it will make you want to finish the whole series in one go. However there are some aspects of Mayo Chiki that seem lacking. For instance, Mayo Chiki is a harem and the watcher can tell which girl the main character is going to go...for, as usual it is very explicit and is easy to tell. However throughout the 13 episodes that this anime consists of, there is no clear choice that the main character makes and the last episode feels more like an OVA and the story just cuts off at a really awkward phase. The fact that there is no other OVA to end the storyline or even a second season makes this anime lose alot of the appeal that it had. Honestly if this anime was announced to having a second season or a finishing OVA, then many fans of this anime would be ecstatic that this anime gets a clean and clear finish and would be able to see what everyone wants to see....

"", '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)Everybody has a weakness. This may be physically or psychologically. For some people, they try to cure this weakness to make themselves a stronger person. In Mayo Chiki, Jirou tries to do just this with the aide of the lady butler Subaru and her mistress Kanade. What we are left with is a fun show without much substance.STORYThe story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who has the worst case of gynophobia (fear of women) ever. One day at school, he discovers the secret of Subaru the boy butler -- he is actually a she in disguise....In order to keep this a secret, Subaru and her mistress Kanade decide to help him overcome his weakness.First off, the show is very sexual in its content, more so than I knew going in. Almost every joke and situation has sexual connotations attached to them. Meaning, the show is probably best for an older audience.That being said, I thought the comedy was fun. Many of the gags repeat themselves more than once over the course of the show, but I always found myself laughing at them.Besides the comedy, romance is also a major part. I found the romance elements to be fine for what they were. It is gradual but ends on an unsatisfying note. This is because not only is the show left completely open-ended, but the final episode of the show does not continue at all from where the second-to-last one left off. Meaning, the actual ending for the anime adaptation is really bad. This is unfortunate, but something that appears to have been unavoidable.As for the rest of the story elements, they were oddly placed in. Many things that are introduced are either immediately resolved or touched on for an episode and pretty much forgotten. Off of the top of my head, this includes things such as Subaru\'s weakness and Jirou\'s father. With this in mind, the writing for the plot itself can be described as bad.ANIMATIONThe shows art is fine for its time period. Nothing flashy but nothing bad either. It is just another generic looking anime.The character designs are fine as well.The actual animation was, again, fine. They don\'t go out of their way to showcase their skills, but the character movements and some of the fighting scenes were animated satisfactorily.CHARACTERSTo be honest, I actually enjoyed Jirou (the MC), Subaru (the female lead/butler), and Kanade (butler\'s mistress).Jirou was interesting mainly due to his gynophobia and general awareness. He wasn\'t a dumb MC by any means, and his phobia allowed for some interesting scenarios. I wish they would have explored his character a bit more than they did, but for this type of show, I guess what I got should have been expected.The same goes for Subaru. Being a girl dressed/perceived as a boy is unique in a lot of ways. This allowed for funny characterization and enjoyable misunderstandings. Again, small character development is present but not enough to truly care about the character.Finally, with Kanade, I mainly found her to my liking because she was the smartest. That is to say, she moved all of the events along mainly due to her families power. Plus, because she is very confident in herself throughout all of the show, she pretty much dictates how the characters will act or go about their business. She provides a sense of direction that was probably needed for the show itself. Besides that, I enjoyed her character a lot, simply because she had no qualms with constantly teasing everybody to no end.My gripe with them is that this is mainly it. They have their schtick and they stick with it for the entirety of the show. Granted, they wouldn\'t be the characters they are without them, but I would have liked to have seen some growth in one way or another out of any of them.Besides these three, I found the other minor characters to be fine with the exceptions of Nakuru (the glasses loving girl) and Nagare (Subaru\'s father). Those two were pretty annoying and I kind of hated their characters.SOUNDFor me, the OP and ED are too generic. In other words, they are not good. Forgetful and non-catchy is not a good mix.I will say, one of the pieces of comedy that the show liked to use was the ""music drop"". Meaning, when sappy music is playing only to suddenly cut short for comedic effect. Surprisingly, this worked on me almost every time. Perhaps it is just easy to get a laugh out of me, but I liked the way in which they ""music dropped"" almost every single episode.As for the voice acting, I thought everyone was appropriate in their roles, with no outstanding performances.ENJOYMENTI actually really liked this anime. I found myself laughing all the time, even if many of the sexual jokes were reused over and over. I would always found myself smiling when Kanade was teasing Jirou to no end or when Kureha was fawning over Subaru. The comedy it presented was nicely done and made me grin like a fool.When it comes to romance, I am a bit biased in that I love it to death. That being said, I loved the romance elements. I liked how shy Subaru would get around Jirou or how Usami played a nice tsundere character. It\'s not the best romance in anime, but it serves its purpose nicely enough.SUMMARYStory: Bad, all over the place with shoddy endingAnimation: Fine, serves its purposeCharacters: Fine, start unique but fall flatSound: Fine, OP and ED are no good but OST is somewhat good in contextEnjoyment: Great, lots of laughs and nice romance aspectsFinal Score: 5/10 In order to keep this a secret, Subaru and her mistress Kanade decide to help him overcome his weakness.First off, the show is very sexual in its content, more so than I knew going in.

(2011)Episode 13 is more OVA than an episode.The show itself can be criticised for the use of generic harem style. However, the argument that should always be remembered is that unless you say the same for every single harem outside of the first few that were written not adapted then the argument falls flat. I say written since the original harems may not all be adapted yet so would face criticism even if they are older than others.The story this time with the harem is different due to the cross-dressing girl butler for reasons explained in the show. The show does...something unusual for me and that is it gives all the girls as best girls. I honestly cannot fault any of them in the roles they play to choose easily. Personally, although I adore a sadist type like Kanade I do have to say I liked Masamune the best overall which is very difficult because all of them are great. Subaru the main girl is very interesting and a great one too of course.For a show that is 9 years old by year, it is an amazing quality to have stood the standards of the time. It must have been very highly rated for its art when it was released compared against some even in 2020 that have questionable artwork. One thing I must note is the cuteness of the style of uniform the girls wear. It has been seen before in this style but the fact some of them on their legs differ to others is a good detail. Seen as some girls wear tights or none or thigh high stockings or even Masamune that wears thigh-high boots. It is just nice to see things less generically done.The OP and ED are memorable and good. Generally, sounds are pretty well done throughout. Look forward to Kanade and her hiccups.Characters can be seen rather generic by this but they are all very well done.Kinjirou the main protagonist with gynophobia that struggles with this as an actual excuse finally given to not understand women properly. Sometimes things are basically written out clearly and he is still confused but he does get it also towards the latter part.Subaru the main girl who is the butler is very much the dream girl in that shes is the proper girly-girl hidden in plain sight.Kanade the mistress who Subaru works for hits the market for a sadistic but kind type.Masamune the typical tsundere who is actually very well done and brings quite a lot to the show with her common sense. It would be great to know more about why she lives alone.Nakuru a boy love enthusiast that episode 13 shows as a 'Moe' type who is also pretty much an Otaku.Kureha is the little sister of the main guy. She is very interesting in that in this a harem anime yet she does NOT have a brother complex. She has a great relationship with him as brother and sister but nothing more it would seem. This is actually so refreshing to see.A side note in that outside of all the random girls/guys in the show that we see in episode 13 during the halfway still we get a cute white-haired girl. Maybe she is novel/manga important to which I shall find out who I do not remember seeing anywhere else but she has something to do with Nakuru.In the end, I honestly think the show was great. It is a typical harem but like I said it cannot be used against it. It does have its quirks and its differences which makes for a great and consistent ride through the show.

It does not solve anything but instead kinda gives you a hint to a second season.(Also there is talk of a second season coming soon.) That is my only grip, now on to the real review.Story:9 A great story but in the end does not wrap up quite well.Art:9...A colorful palate for an anime. But nothing too special.Sound:9 The art suits the voices perfectly.Character:9 Very good variety of characters, but some are not explained all that well.(Also the 13 episode is more of a ova of a character i really did not care to much for.

Mayo Chiki is based on a light novel so it is a no surprise that the anime adaption is not complete and ends without a definite conclusion. By going through the synopsis, you probably know the premise, so I am not going to bother with that.First of all, cross dressing characters in an anime series is nothing new, but few anime do this as skillfully as Mayo Chiki. It gives away with cookie cutter characters and provides a genuine character development. What I said about the characters is true for all except the...main.

The character of Kanade or Ojou Sama is a masterfully crafted as it can be, the sinister plots that she puts up really increase the enjoyment level notably.The problem arises because the anime is not complete, it does not fully develop all its cast so most of the things are left unsaid and underdeveloped.Lastly, for a final verdict, I would definitely recommend this anime because it tries to do things differently although slightly slipping into the Harem territory which is also rudimentary. But still providing a fair share of laughs and giggles while also entangling us in a sweet romance.

Konoe Subaru, the famous butler of Kanade Suzutsuki, is peeing at the man\'s toilet when Kinjirou accidentally opens the door and reveals the butler secret. This well-known butler who\'s idolized by women at the school is actually a girl! By revealing her truth, Kinjirou is being dragged into the situation where he needs to cooperate with Subaru and Kanade Suzutsuki—the only daughter of principal, after face the butler in a wrong time and wrong place (toilet).This circumstances lead them to continuously meet one another. The...gynophobia guy—always got nosebleeding by the touch of a girl, the famous (woman) butler, the troublesome sadistic Ojou-sama, and not to mention also other characters to liven up the show.The show is a continually school life - slice-of-Iife story, spiced up with romantic comedy, it\'s undeniably fun. The difference between this one and the rest are every characters have their own one or two lil secrets. Those secrets are tied up with the main characters here, Kinjirou, Subaru-san, and Ojou-sama. You will find the story of them together is absolutely delightful ٩( ❛ ▿ ❛)۶  The supporting aspect is the art, I like the colour I feel it kinda relaxing, because it\'s not an action or supernatural genres so the movements or effects are not the core but still it\'s soft and pretty built.The scope of every characters involvement in several moments make a good development. While we are spoiled by the jokes, we can observe bit by bit their improvements, their roles which filled this rom com series. It\'s not too rush and not too slow either, slowly but sure the goal of Ojou-sama with the help of her butler to cure the Kinjirou\'s gynophobia will be the hint for the story to keep moving. Other characters too, are nice I love them in an instant. I truly set my eyes on Kinjirou and Subaru relationship, in the anime series, these two experience feeling of love and caring but vaguely appears, and everytime it appears I think that I could eat them up ⁄(⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄Well, for music, both OP and ED theme are nice. Nothing special yet it\'s good and sometimes I put it on my playlist to listen.

The difference between this one and the rest are every characters have their own one or two lil secrets. Those secrets are tied up with the main characters here, Kinjirou, Subaru-san, and Ojou-sama. You will find the story of them together is absolutely delightful ٩( ❛ ▿ ❛)۶  The supporting aspect is the art, I like the colour I feel it kinda relaxing, because it\'s not an action or supernatural genres so the movements or effects are not the core but still it\'s soft and pretty built.The scope of every characters involvement in several moments make a good development. While we are spoiled by the jokes, we can observe bit by bit their improvements, their roles which filled this rom com series. It\'s not too rush and not too slow either, slowly but sure the goal of Ojou-sama with the help of her butler to cure the Kinjirou\'s gynophobia will be the hint for the story to keep moving. Other characters too, are nice I love them in an instant. I truly set my eyes on Kinjirou and Subaru relationship, in the anime series, these two experience feeling of love and caring but vaguely appears, and everytime it appears I think that I could eat them up ⁄(⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄Well, for music, both OP and ED theme are nice.

It had me considering any and all of the following possibilities right then and there:1. ....would it be about the struggle to overcome one\'s fears?2. ....would it be about how far people will go to help their friends?3. ....would it be about finding true love?4. ....would it be about discovering one\'s own sexuality?5. ....or would it merely be about some whacky characters in even whackier situations, with lots of fan service and comic misunderstandings thrown in?...Sadly, although the writer (or writers?) really seemed to want to go in the more ""serious"" directions 1-4 above, they seemed to be on some sort of leash that would always pull them back to direction 5, never allowing them to truly explore any of the more worthwhile directions. (Not that fan service can\'t be entertaining in its own right, but after so many tantalizing steps in much more intriguing directions, it ended up feeling rather unsatisfying. To me, at least.)The plot suggests that it revolves around underage butler Konoe, since all the female characters gravitate towards her and then all hug her during the OP. But strangely, the person telling the story is Jirou, a high school boy who is introduced as being very annoyed with Konoe, who he believes is a much more masculine guy than he is. Yes, you read it right: almost everyone believes that Konoe is a guy, in spite of his long tresses!Of course, Jirou finds out about Konoe\'s secret when he stumbles into a toilet booth where Konoe was just relieving herself. (Doesn\'t ANYONE lock toilet booths or bathrooms in anime?!?) The necessary antics ensue, and Jirou soon finds himself promising Konoe that he won\'t reveal her secret. because that would cost her her job as butler. And being a butler is everything she he has worked for her whole life. Even when this makes Jirou look even more like a homosexual than he already does to his classmates. And to his own younger sister who already is more masculine than him, because she uses him as a vicitm for her martial arts\' practice every morning.Jirou\'s self-sacrificing nature really shines through here, since not many people would go that far just to help someone they only just met. Let alone a tom-boy butler who wasn\'t all that nice to him to begin with.  This seemed like the kind of set-up that could well have led to a nice romantic entanglement, I thought. The most important obstacle seemed to be Jirou\'s fear of women (the medical term slips my mind), which causes him to get nosebleeds whenever a woman touches him. An obvious comedy device, to be sure, but the backstory about him having both a dominating mother and sister who were both martial arts experts, sounded somewhat interesting.And then things get even more interesting, as Konoe\'s mistress Suzutski also chimes in. Although she likes to pretend that her interests are mostly of the sadistic kind, and she does like to play the occasional trick on both Jiroe and Konoe, many of her plans do seem to be intended to subtly help the both of them to make progress towards... Well, what? Romance, friendship, overcoming one\'s own traumas?At some point, it is revealed that Konoe lost her mother at quite a young age and Jirou emotionally supports her on the anniversary of her mother\'s death when Konoe visits her family grave. Pretty powerful stuff, I felt.But then, somewhere around episode 9, this anime simply seems to give up on the more serious themes of the show and it rattles off some lighter episodes. (Although the one about Jirou\'s martial arts sister feeling sad because Jirou forgot her previous birthday again seemed to hint at this series trying to dig deeper than just the fan service clichés).And sadly, the show decides to leave most of the story threads it pulled loose dangling and ends it all on a gag episode about a BL-fanatic classmate  being worried that nobody would like her for anything more than her breasts.  Again, even this plot element had some hints of wanting to be less shallow, as though the writers kept resisting the urge to go 100% mindless fan service to the very end. And, almost as an aside, Jirou does seem to overcome his fear of women by helping this female BL-fanatic over her own fear. But exactly why this happened with someone he had no feelings for remains a little obscure.ArtCertainly not bad, but some of the character models seemed eerily similar to some used in other shows. Konoe looks (and acts) a lot like Kirinoe from ""Ore No Imouto""(released a year previously), while Lady Suzutski has almost the same face as Menma from Anohana. Some minor characters (redhead Masumane whom I hadn\'t mentioned before) and the big-breasted BL-fanatic  in turn seem to have been copied for use in the (more recent) ""The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat"". I haven\'t checked if any of those other shows were made by the same studios, but it sure wouldn\'t surprise me.SoundThe OP en ED are not at all bad. And the first one was sung by Eri Kitamura, no less. Impressive. Of the voice actors and actresses, the one portraying Konoe (Yuka Iguchi) does the most striking job, I felt. Not only does she manage both her feminine and more masculine voice quite convincingly, she also infuses Konoe\'s words with real feeling. Hanazawa Kana surprisingly portrays the rather butch younger sister character Kureha who often beats up her older brother. And Eri Kitamura does a very good job of voicing the elitist Suzutsuki. The guy portraying Jirou did all right and portrayed all the right emotions, although he seemed to have fewer challenging lines then his female colleagues.CharacterWell, as touched upon under ""Story"", the dropping of all of this story\'s more serious plotlines leaves the viewer guessing which character has progressed how far in which direction. Sure, Jirou seems to get over his fear of women and Konoe gains a new appreciation of what it means to be a butler, but that seems to be about it.EnjoymentIn spite of this show\'s shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. The characters were interesting, many of the comic plot twists felt fresh, the animation and backgrounds were nice to look at, while the voice acting was quite good. All in all, this show made Konoe into an intriguing female butler who is both strong and sensitive. Definitely a memorable and possibly even a classic anime character.OverallA show that was apparently never meant to be anything more than a fun fan service romcom somehow continually tried to rise above its premise, only to get pulled right back down to it time and again. Really quite curious, but definitely interesting. Still, I can\'t help but feel that viewers looking for a ""fan service"" experience will come away from this feeling a little short-changed. And folks that got hooked on the romance angle will also be left feeling unsatisfied. Perhaps the moral of the story is that shows like ""To LoveRu"" and ""Kimi ni Todoke"" really shouldn\'t be mixed together this way, but should instead stay in their own respective niches?

I mean a bare bones romance/drama/comedy about a guy butler who is actually a girl and has romantic time with the guy who discovered she was a girl.Based on a light novel series (which should be a given for any anime I’ve reviewed lately), Mayo Chiki! is not as bare bones as I previously stated, but doesn’t innovate in any way. It’s a very likeable anime that isn’t bogged down by anything but its sheer use of cliches.StoryMayo Chiki! is the story of a girl named Konoe Subaru....She is a butler, but as a butler she must pretend to be a man due to some sort of familial something-or-other. Her mistress is amazingly rich because her father is the head of the schools, which apparently pays well enough in Japan to allow them to own a mansion, two butlers, two maids, a limousine, and a private hospital. On top of this, the mistress doesn’t have to wear a school uniform because she’s too rich and good for that. Then again, Konoe the butler guy/girl gets to wear her butler clothes around school as well.Anyway, Jirou, a typical high school boy with gynaphobia (I’m sure you can figure out what this means on your own) enters the stall with Konoe in it (she has to use the mens’ room as she is pretending to be a guy) and he sees her cute panties. Thinking her to be a perverted male, there’s a fight and before we know it, with just a simple shove, her butler shirt unbuttons and Jirou is groping her breasts.So now he must protect her secret that she is a female and he ends up going on crazy misadventures with her and her mistress. The mistress and Konoe seem to be falling for him, and they both try to cure his gynaphobia.While the story is an original premise, it enters the obligatory anime romance/drama cliches:-Pool episode-Beach episode-Hot spring episode-Festival episode-Bath sceneAnd we all know what this means! FAN SERVICE! And while it doesn’t really hit panty territory (we see them off the girl a couple times and on the girl once) it provides gratuitous breastage and lots of thighs. These episodes in no way innovate upon the basic formula that we’ve come to expect of episodes such as these, but they are funny and don’t come across as totally cliche.So most of the story revolves around the romance between Jirou and Konoe, and it does focus on some other characters who they become friends with along the way. Meanwhile, the whole school thinks Jirou is gay with Subaru since nobody has yet to figure out he’s a she.The plot never exactly does anything totally exciting, it just provides the basic skeletal outline for a decent romance/comedy. Nonetheless, it does it well enough that you keep watching it and want to see what happens next.AnimationThe animation is good. Characters look good and cute and all that. Backgrounds look nice. The ambiance of the show is very bright most of the time, a lot of bright colors really helping make the show easy on the eyes. The animation is also smooth. It’s not really, really fantastic animation, but it is pretty good.SoundA theme song that is good. An ending song that is meh. Music in the middle that is okay. The characters voice actors are all good and once again, I don’t have a lot to really talk about in this section.CharactersThis is where I really find my personal tastes being at odds with my critic tastes. Konoe is awesome, says one side of me. The other side tells me that she’s good, but not that great. They are combating each other and I think I’m going to choose my personal tastes over that of my critic. I loved Konoe. She wasn’t the most emotionally riveting character, not in the slightest, but she was a good character who was different from most anime girls. She was likeable in her want to protect and serve her mistress as a boy, but also likeable as a girl who really had no friends and met Jirou and was falling for him. The romance between the two is compelling because of this strange scenario and is the only reason it really works.Jirou himself, as our main protagonist, is merely okay. His gynaphobia is funny and he certainly is entertaining, but he’s cookie cutter minus the gynaphobia. His sister is the same, cookie cutter and not really compelling. There is a typical tsundere girl who rides on a moped and isn’t all that exciting.But the mistress is also a good character. While at first she seems like a bad guy with ill intentions, she slowly grows on you and you see that she truly is a good guy. I personally feel she had some romantic ideas about Jirou, but the series doesn’t really pass beyond the stage where characters admit to each other. It’s all implied.OverallMayo Chiki! is entertaining and provides two cool characters, but is an otherwise fairly basic specimen. One thing I noticed is two instances where it had some promotion for Aria the Scarlet Ammo seemingly. There is a poster in the background of one episode, and one character dresses as Aria. I guess the same studio did these two anime? The animation is somewhat similar. It also brings up a great comparison:There are anime out there that are not good story-wise or character-wise but are nonetheless really fun to watch. As a critic, I am usually thought of as that guy who reviews based on how good everything is. If everything is excellent, then it gets a ten, but when there are a lot of inadequate things, it gets something less than five.That’s not true with me. I do base my scores on how good the story, animation, sound, and characters are, but I also base it on something I can’t explain in paragraph form under a header: entertainment value.Now let me explain that comparison I’ve been getting at:Mayo Chiki!, just like Aria, has a lot of faults, but it is entertaining. That’s the bottom line. She is a butler, but as a butler she must pretend to be a man due to some sort of familial something-or-other.

But this is one of the decent ones that do not stack up and reuse cliche moments. Coming from a user who has mostly that kind of genre in his watch list, I did not watch this for that specific mix of genres. I came for the plot (I'm not trying to pass a joke here). Well not exactly the plot because the plot of this is you know... the usual situations and hurdles of an ecchi-harem anime. What I'm trying to point out was the...story line. The story is rather unique and has a bit of a dramatic element though not that brutal unlike the ones that focus on pure drama but enough to give a bit of a feel to the audience. However, with the comedy content in this one, it's enough to make you burst out laughing until you shed a tear or roll on the floor. (Well, I might be exaggerating and some scenes may be funny but not really that much for me because I'm used to watching hardcore comedy). The main characters maybe a bit different from our usual harem heroes and heroines but not that really far from them. You might get attached to some and make some ships but I kinda think that the development of each character wasn't really elaborated. Though there is progression, it seems a bit rushed. The artstyle is decent as well and thankfully there were no misdrawn scenes that might raise complaints. Though I didn't binge this series in a day, I was able to enjoy it and it gave what I was looking for. I gave this a rating of 9 because there were some parts that didn't really satisfy me and there were some issues that I can't really figure out. This anime is underrated and hopefully the studio can make some bonuses for this series.Mayo Chiki! can be a bit cliche with its genres but I do recommend that you give this a shot because no matter how you may see it, you might find something that you can enjoy about it. story line.

Though I didn't binge this series in a day, I was able to enjoy it and it gave what I was looking for. I gave this a rating of 9 because there were some parts that didn't really satisfy me and there were some issues that I can't really figure out. This anime is underrated and hopefully the studio can make some bonuses for this series.Mayo Chiki! can be a bit cliche with its genres but I do recommend that you give this a shot because no matter how you may see it, you might find something that you can enjoy about it."", ""One of the first harems that was added to my list and i must say it definitely was a good starting point.Here's the show in a nutshell: guy with gynophobia meets a handsome butler who turns out to be a super cute girl, guy learns something he wasn't supposed to and is sworn to secrecy or else he will face death, guy has to take part in training in which he has to be intimate with women in order to cure his gynophobi, stuff happens in between and the guy ends up loving girl, and that is the lovely story of Mayo Chiki! Now the...reason i wrote this really long one sentence description of Mayo Chiki was to show that, even though it sways in the direction of a harem the story is very unique and isn't a cliche haremThe first episodes of this series were geared t the  romance, and then it moved away from that and became kinda ridiculous in the middle, then before you realize it, the series returns to  Romance. Fan service also seemed to be more frequent during the middle (I can’t think of any reason other than they are trying to fill the episodes). In a way the middle episodes were almost like fillers.Everything received 8's ( Story, Art, Sound, Characters, Enjoyment, and Overall)the story was unique and entertaining its humor was uncompromising and unrelenting.The relationship between the two characters, Kinjirou and Subaru, develops at a nice pace in the first third of the show. Subaru was bold in approaching Kinjirou, which is nice to see, instead of the slow moving pace that other Romantic comedies usually have.I have to talk about one thing - i was very, very, very disappointed with the ending of Mayo Chiki!  All problems are suddenly resolved and Subaru and Kinjirou decide that they magically love each other during the show’s closing episode. with a show that had so much potential, it actually mad me sad that the show finished with such an ending.

Kinjirou becomes her first friend and crush so she tries to protect their friendship at all costs but at the same time wanting her relationship with him to go beyond friends.Konoe greatly resembles Koaru(Ladies Versus Butlers) and Chalotte(Infinite Stratos). these kind of character tend to have a double personality due to the fact being forced to cross dress. they show a poised,cool figure to the people other than the one who knows their secret.Another interesting character is Kanade, a yandere character is a perfect contrast for a gynephobic person. She uses Kinjirou to return her relationship with Konoe to what it originally was.Overall:i'd only give it a 6/10. it's disappointing to see such a good story that could've been way better gone to waste. it's like good coffee with no sugar in it. -.- the story starts off quite well, to prevent Kinjirou from spreading the secret of konoe, Suzutsuki made a solution where she will help Kinjirou get rid of his gynephobia(fear of women) in return for him to shut his mouth about the secret. the characters later on become closer to each other because each of them have their own secret.like i said, i watched this anime because the manga was good. it turns out the final chapter i read(15) was episode 7 of the anime and also the final episode where i can say it's good. after that, i'll give this anime just a pitiful 4/10 for its story. theres not much to say. all the episodes are like  stand alone episodes that has nothing to do with the anime. even if you skipped the whole thing and got to episode 11&12, i doubt i'll affect your understanding towards the the story because all the other episodes has no plot or whatsoever.for your info, the final episode is the 13th episode is the final episode, and again, this really is just ridiculous. this is the episode on the 'taned-megane' girl. what i'm saying is, episode 11&12 is the real ending. from my point of view, why can't they just make episode 13 into episode 11 and make the ending episode 12&13 instead? or they could even just make it into an ova instead?saying all that, the comedy isn't that bad. the ending was alright. i just hate to see 12/13 episode animes having ridiculous episodes that  could have been replaced with something related to the story line.Art/Sound: nothing special. op was enough to get my attention for two episodes, so i guess it's mediocre.Character:if it weren't for the characters, i wouldv'e given mayo chiki a 5/10. the protagonist wasn't that great. it's your usual rom-com protagonist who's a natural playboy. the character i liked the most is Konoe. when you first watch her, your impression of Konoe will definitely be a tsundere as she was really mad when Kinjirou discovered her secret. it turns out she was just a lonely fellow with no friends.

You have you basic character types, a twist within the premise and a small hook to get you to try to look forward to a chance of a season twoJust like any other Rom Com you have the male and female protagonist who are also followed by a supporting main character who like to tease the main protagonists.The storyline is alright and it was leading to a nice path but too bad they just ended wrong. Where in the opening you see Subaru running around the place, frantically looking for someone, which lead me to...a conclusion that in the last episode, something is going to happen to Jiro and things are going to get interesting. Too bad that wasn't the case. I'm pretty sure that somewhere along that line were two paths: One leading to my conclusion and the other is the conclusion the producers came up. That's because the author hasn't written a ending yet so the producers thought of this half-hearted ending for us viewers. What a great way to end with the final scene of subaru all dressed up thanking Jiro. I personally think the last episode is a ova but they included as one of the episode. Probably trying to tell us a message saying that there might be a season two, but don't get your hopes up to high.Honesty this anime is too similar to other Rom Com like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, except this time its about the butler not the princess herself.Both anime is about a guy finds out about a idol's secret and promises to keep it. anime shows the adventure of their daily live from that point on.Really it is pretty hard to rate a harem genre, since there is no standards to base it on. Liike some producers show you too much, some too less or show you some parts but not the ones your looking for and also like this one, just enough to make you continue.The artwork is quite nice actually. The cuteness in the characters appearance really make this anime quite enjoyable to watch although the ending is a disappointment causing the viewers to think what was the whole point in this story??This style of art is very high quality animationstyle, it is very detailed and has smooth animations, as well as the creative character design is very appealing with their cute eyes which stands out  a lot.Overall.. give it a shot! The artworks is nice and the anime is one of the  Classic Romantic Comedy where there's no point in the whole thing but its fun to watch the characters interact and see how the story progress.

Every episode has its own strength be it the sense of drama and suspense or the slapstick humour. These 2 factors are the main reasons that make the anime stand out more than the usual rom-com so it's definitely above average. Looking at it as a whole, it's very unique in the sense that it has the ability to make every episode exciting however because the anime is constantly being pumped in with humour and action, it blocks away the opportunities to insert the romance on a deeper level. If you are looking for something that is...light-hearted then this anime is for you. However, if you are looking for a romance driven storyline then you might not be a fan of this show. Either way, the show has a good balance of aspects of a good comedy/slice of life/drama driven plot if you were to exclude romance.

In fact, I think the anime missed its target. Sometimes it’s funny and there is a lot of action, but sometimes you also are waiting 2 or 3 episodes just for a fucking common love story. It pissed me off to have to watch 19 minutes of a boring story to catch the little moment of fun.But it clearly doesn’t match neither to (typically) a girl who wants to see a great love story, since...there still is a couple of pervert scenes and some ecchi. So after watching Mayo chiki, I’m still wondering who was the public who was targeted.  If you’re going to give a try, just watch the three or four first episodes : if you like it you can go ahead, but if you feel it’s too boring you can stop since it’s almost the same rythm all along. there still is a couple of pervert scenes and some ecchi.

The actual drama basically ended at episode 12 and episode 13 was, what do they call it, a filler? Yea, one of those, which would...have been perfectly fine in the middle of the series where it belongs, but at the end? There must have been some kind of mistake. But anyways, the story was really simple, I\'d summarize it: cute crossdressing butler ecchi with many clichés and ""fillers,"" but still kept me hooked. Similar to your average romcom anime, pretty much.ART - 9I absolutely loved the art style, I think it was the eyes that got me. I also fell in love with the character design, everyone just looked so attractive regardless of gender.SOUND - 10The seiyuus were perfect for the roles, the OP and ED are fantastic as well and fit the anime.CHARACTER - 9Very simple archetypes, but I fell in love with Subaru, so we get a point here.ENJOYMENT - 9Not much to say here, it was super entertaining and funny, had some ecchi but wasn\'t over the top or unneeded, had drama, romance, the clichés that we love, pretty much my ideal harem/ecchi (I haven\'t watched much that I enjoyed but I\'m sure this is what I was looking for).OVERALL - 8I\'d say, for this type of anime, this one was great.

Yes, it\'s a harem. Yes, the ""genre"" is very overdone. But the way the romance is told is so...compelling to me, despite the light-hearted nature of the show. I genuinely screamed at my computer a few times, and my heart was...pounding like crazy during some of the scenes.The last episode is a bit...meh, but I think the second to last episode more than makes up for it.

While the show was at times peppered with some moments that were obviously set aside for fan service, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed watching the rest of it. Of course almost all the girls have a thing for Jinjirou-kun sooner or later, as custom to the harem genre. However, each girl had her own insecurities unique from the others, and as Jinjirou became involved with them, he began to learn more about them and help them...in his own way.Now then, the range of different girls (all with varying hair colors, of course) adds to the anime's many themes. It feels a little ridiculous reading the synopsis and seeing how strange the cast of characters is: an aspiring pro-wrestler, the confident daughter of a noble, a cross-dressing butler, a fervent author of yaoi, a stubborn girl who lives with ghosts. I can't say that all of them had problems that touched my heart, though. Sometimes the comedy infused in the show kept these complications from really identifying with the viewer, and I didn't take them seriously. Others were closer to making me sympathize with the girl in question, but then again, how seriously can you take a show like this?Nevertheless, I did like the characters. Some of them seemed annoying at first, but they became cute later, and the main character Jinjirou-kun, was very likable. He isn't the classic pervert because he himself tries to avoid girls due to his condition. But of course, he can't stop the inevitable, as girls are everywhere.I was also quite satisfied with the romantic aspects of the show. For the girls that were most interested in Jinjirou-kun, I could clearly see why they were. A lot of harems have a problem in showing this, but in the span of 13 episodes, I think it was done well. Jinjirou is himself and despite avoiding girls a lot, he can talk to them normally and care about them. He's a sweet older brother and this shows in his interactions with others. While there wasn't a good romantic conclusion to this series, I think if it were longer there would have been.I very much liked the animation in this show. Everyone's eyes were brightly colored and the fight scenes (which there actually were a lot of, unexpectedly) were animated in such a way that it was easy to understand what was going on, who threw what punch or kick, etc. I'm not so much a fan of shiny pink shoulders and boobs as they're unrealistic, those were there, too, if you like that.The soundtrack was surprisingly good. I adored the opening song. While it starts out kind of cute, the lyrics and cut scenes make it seem a tad bit more serious than the anime is, but I still liked it a lot. Other moments of the anime had good matching pieces for silly moments and likewise for sad ones, some of which were very cheery or pretty.Despite some of the odd perverted circumstances Jinjirou-kun got into (most of which were in the first episode), I liked watching this anime a lot. I usually shy away from ecchi stuff and harem things, but someone convinced me to try this and I'm glad I did. It had me laughing a few times and I liked the way Jinjirou-kun was able to connect with the other characters. I always spent a few extra moments listening to the opening theme and even watched this anime in two-episode bursts.

It\'s like he has the girl version of being lactose intolerant (I\'m not directly gonna tell it because that would be a mild spoiler).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Firstly, if I had to say something about the...story, and I had to describe it with one word, it would be ""common"". It\'s basically an ecchi-harem story like any other ecchi-harem stories you\'ve ever seen or watched. The art is very pretty. I absolutely adore characters with the usual very anime-ish style; this is especially since the characters are quite bland and cliche, the only things that gets them going is the art and animation (points for the ojou-sama character; also, points for the moe and gap moe characters).The ending was not that satisfying in my opinion. That may be a bit biased due to the fact that I liked the other heroine (the ojou-sama character) better than the main heroine.Still, even with all these qualms, Mayo Chiki! is still worth spending your time on.My verdict: 7 out of 10 story, and I had to describe it with one word, it would be ""common"".

This show seemed like just enough of a breath of fresh air to me to the point where I actually found a great deal of enjoyment in this show compared to other shows of the genre, and that’s saying a lot. So let’s find out what makes this show so...special in the third review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February, Mayo Chiki.Story:Mayo Chiki is a story about Sakamachi Kinjirou, a boy who has developed gynophobia because of constant abuse by his pro-wrestler mother and aspiring pro-wrestler sister. This causes his nose to bleed whenever he comes in contact with a girl. Where the story really kicks of is when Jirou wanders into the boy’s bathroom only to discover the most popular boy in school, the butler of the principal’s daughter, Konoe Subaru, is actually a girl! This means Jirou has found out her secret, and she will do whatever it takes to keep it a secret. When the principal’s daughter, Suzutsuki Kanade, finds out about about his gynophobia, she promises to cure him in exchange for keeping the gender of Konoe a secret, because if it is found out that Konoe is a girl, she can no longer be Kanade’s butler. And of course, with a setup like this, ecchi moments and the buildup of a harem is sure to ensue as the characters take on the usual antics of an ecchi comedy. Now where I feel this show gets that original feel I mentioned earlier is in its concept. While granted, it’s not the most original, I feel it gave me enough to say “Hey, this isn’t so bad for an ecchi comedy,” and because of that little bit of effort put in to create a different type of ecchi harem my enjoyment was increased. Now of course, because I signed myself up to do this ecchi month thing, I’m really just taking everything as it is, meaning that I will be reviewing these shows for what they are as opposed to reviewing them based on the normal criteria. That being said, for an ecchi harem, this show did a fair amount of things that I was pleased with, but of course it was not without its fair share of low points. This show’s construction focuses heavily on ecchi-based comedy. A construction like this really leaves no room for anything dramatic, but this show decides to throw some in the mix anyway. Is this a bad thing? Well, it’s hit or miss depending on how, and the extent, to which it is used. Mayo Chiki’s moments of drama fall under 3 categories: trivial moments that have no place in the show, moments that are used to drive character development, and moments that are used to give us something that we don’t see in anime nowadays, ACTUAL ROMANTIC PROGRESSION. Whoa now, don’t get too excited, this isn’t like some Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry romantic progression, nut we will get to that in a second. There are some moments in this show where dramatic tension is introduced, and it really feels out of place within the show to the point where it takes away more than it adds. Thankfully, these moments are few and far between, but you can clearly tell when it happens. The second type is the dramatic tension used to give characters development, and the upside to this kind is that the show tones it down to the point that characters get much needed development without it feeling overbearing. The last type is used for actual romance progression. While there wasn’t enough romantic progression to make me feel completely satisfied, it had enough to the point where I felt the show didn’t start at square one in terms of the relationship between the 2 main characters, and that was enough for me especially in comparison to other shows in a genre where genuine romantic resolution always seems out of grasp . In terms of ecchi, this show has a ton, with the main character’s condition being the center of it. A majority of these scenes consist of your standard boob grabs, shower mishaps, etc, and these scenes are the major source of the show’s comedic style. Lastly, the show ends on an open conclusion, but leaves you with just enough to be satisfied with it. With no second season confirmed, it doesn’t look like there will be a continuation on the story’s conlusion, so what you see it what you get. So for the story of Mayo Chiki, it really sets up an interesting concept within the genre, or at least interesting enough to capture my intrigue. With the show mainly revolving around ecchi comedy, there is hardly any room for dramatic tension as shown by the moments the show try to add some only to fall on its face, but the show was able to incorporate some dramatic tension to allow for character development and romantic progression that was toned down enough to not take away from the value of the show. And don’t get your hopes up when I say romantic progression, because it’s very little, but at least the show didn’t feel like it ended at square one like all harems out there. I’m looking at you Nisekoi. The conclusion for this show is an open one, with no continuation by way of a second season confirmed, but leaves you with JUST enough to make you feel satisfied by the end. And the ecchi for this show is very heavy given the main character’s condition, and if its ecchi you want you’ve come to the right place.CharactersWhile the characters for this show are something to be desired, just like everything else about this show up to this point, they are just a bit better than other ecchi harems. The main characters have a bit of backstory that doesn’t seem overbearing or forced, and as opposed to the archetypes of characters driving the comedy, it felt as though it was the character’s individual personality that was the medium for the comedic scenarios. The first character of Mayo Chiki is Sakamachi Kinjirou. The protagonist of the story, Jirou is a second year high school student who discovers Konoe\'s secret. He suffers from gynophobia causing his nose to bleed whenever a girl touches him. He reveals the cause to be his mother and sister practicing their wrestling moves on him on a daily basis for 10 years, and he states his nose bleeds when a girl touches him because his body developed the reflex because he believed his mother and sister would stop beating him up once he started bleeding. He was forced to sign a contract with Kanade Suzutsuki to help him rid his fear of girls, however he was to keep Saburu Kanoe\'s secret of really being a girl to himself, otherwise according to Kanade Suzutsuki, an unidentified body (Kinjirō\'s) may appear in the sea of trees around Mount Fuji within a month or so. As he (by force) signed the contract he was saved from said fate. Jirou is basically your standard harem protagonist, but he does have a tad bit of backstory that gives us insight into why he does what he does, making him just a bit more than just your standard harem protagonist. But aside from that, there is nothing that really makes him stand out or be memorable at all. The second of our main protagonists is Konoe Subaru. Subaru serves as butler to Kanade Suzutsuki even though she is female. Her father will only allow to maintain her position (and fulfil her family tradition) if she can spend the entire 3 years in high school without anyone discovering her true gender. As a result she must cross-dress. Fortunately her physical features allow her to pass as a boy provided no one looks too closely. Complications arise when one day, Kinjirō accidentally discovers her secret. Although she initially hates Kinjirō, both because he discovered her secret and for being a ""pervert"", over time she warms up to him and he becomes her first friend. As a result she becomes less cold and more outgoing. Her father even notes that she has started looking forward to going to school. Eventually she falls in love with Jiro. Konoe’s character was actually surprisingly good. She is given a good amount of backstory shown through dramatic scenes and never becomes to overbearing given the context of the show, and this really makes her character stand out amongst the cast. But alas, despite this she is still rather shallow, being a generic crossdressing tsundere throughout most of her screen time. The next character, and definitely the most memorable of the show is Kanade Suzutsuki. Kanade is the single daughter of the high school\'s principal, who, on the outside, behaves well like a rich man\'s daughter. On the inside, she is revealed to be quite sadistic and threatens Kinjirō on his greatest fear and using his gynophobia to make him suffer. She is shown to enjoy tormenting and teasing Kinjirō by using his gynophobia against him. However, she did give thoughts about finding a way to cure his gynophobia although her methods to do so are generally overly complicated or humiliate him in some way and she does not deny that she finds them amusing. She notes that Kinjirō is the first, and only, man who is willing to talk her down and she has fallen in love with him as a result. Her character doesn’t have anything that makes characters good like development or backstory, but the thing that makes Kanade so fun is her personality. Most of the time is shows of this type, characters are just shells with archetypes used solely for the sake of comedy. But the thing I did like about this show it that, as opposed to the comedy being driven by character’s one defining trait, it’s more driven by their personality, with Kanade being the best example. Her personality shines throughout the show, and makes her a very fun character with her sadistic schemes and antics. She is also the main source of ecchi in the show, mainly with her constant agitation of Kinjirou’s gynophobia. The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster, but all are loveable in their own way despite lack of anything that, you know, makes good characters. Masamune Usami blackmailed Kinjirō, with the picture of him and Subaru on a mock date, to be her boyfriend up until the end of their school fair. Kinjirō accepted because of the condition that she will not spread the photo with Subaru and Kinjirō going out together. However she later becomes friends with Kinjirō and later falls in love with him. She is your standard tsundere-ish character, but she has some development as the show progresses, although this development is nothing new. I do thing she isn’t a terrible character, but her development is kind of like someone giving you a piece of candy you’ve had a thousand times. You don’t hate it and you’re happy to have it, but you’ve had it so many times you can’t help but want something different. It’s really standard development for characters of the genre, but isn’t terrible. Kureha Sakamachi, after watching and following Kinjirō and Konoe, believing him a male pervert cross-dresser, attacks Konoe to reclaim Kinjirō, only to be quickly defeated in turn. After this incident, still believing her a male, she has fallen in love with Konoe, much to Kinjirō\'s dismay. While tomboyish most of the time, she tends to try and act feminine when Konoe is around. Her character is solely here for the sake of fun, and considering she is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, I can’t hate her no matter how little development she has. She’s definitely my favorite character in the show and by far the most fun. Lastly, and certainly least, is Nakuru Narumi. She’s a perverted BL lover who always wears cat ears and has a glasses fetish. Yep. That’s it. Nothing here by way of anything, and one of those characters that makes you question why she’s even in this show. The characters of Mayo Chiki, while being nothing really special, did have some things to make them lovable, and some even had good backstory and development. While these characters are lacking, I really did enjoy a majority of them, even for an ecchi harem cast.Art/AnimationThe art and animation were really nothing special. I’ve said it before, but there aren’t many shows of this type with real artistic variety. Shows like Nisekoi and Saekano were masterful, and really individualized themselves, but a majority of these shows just don’t seem to be capable of producing something of much merit. But these shows really don’t need it. You come for the ecchi, you stay for the ecchi (if that’s your thing) and as long as the art isn’t jarringly bad you don’t really care either way. The character designs were good for this show, feeling individual and adding to the characters personality and is really the only standout thing in terms of art.SoundThe same goes for the sound. With no real atmosphere to be created, there really is no need for an immersive atmosphere. That’s not to say I wouldn’t like for an OST to strive to be different, but I guess that’s too much of a stretch. Again, you don’t come for the masterfully composed OST, you come to watch some lucky fellow be swooned by a number of girls wishing you could be in his place. The OP and ED were good, but didn’t stand out either. The voice actors all did a good job, but Konoe’s character did take some getting used to. She wasn’t bad enough to the point of being distracting, but was a little irritating, but that went away after I got used to it. Also, Kana Hanazawa was as beautiful as always. MARRY ME PLEASE HANAKANA.OverallMayo Chiki is a show that is really hard to recommend to anyone who doesn’t like ecchi harems. If you like ecchi harems, I would say this show does enough to make it interesting and I would recommend before any other, but for someone who doesn’t like ecchi harems, I would say stay as far away as humanly possible. While this show is somewhat of a breath of fresh air for ecchi harems, it’s really oversaturated with ecchi harem tropes in terms of the antics of its characters and this would make it really hard for someone who dislike these types of shows to find any enjoyment in whatsoever. The story has just enough to it to make It feel somewhat different, but as previously stated is oversaturated with ecchi harem tropes. There is romance progression, but just enough to the point where the show doesn’t feel as though it started from square one like all ecchi harems. The characters may not have been amazing, but they were all lovable, and it really felt as though their personalities where what was driving the comedy as opposed to their archetypes. Art, animation, and sound were nothing to write home about being very average and cookie cutter with exception to the character designs and Kana Hanazawa. Lastly, the ecchi is highly prevalent, focusing mainly on your standard boob grab shower mishap, etc. For this show being a review in Ecchi Month, the amount of ecchi just as much as I was hoping for. In the end, this is a show I can only recommend if you like ecchi harems. It felt like a breath of fresh air within the genre, but it terms of being something people who aren’t a fan of ecchi harems can enjoy, it is definitely not so. As for alternate recommendations, you should watch Date A Live. Because lets be real, if you liked this show, you have a liking for harems, and this was a fun one for me especially for a harem. Also, you should watch OreShura. Aside from this show’s hideous ending, it’s one of my favorite harems out there. special in the third review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February, Mayo Chiki.Story:Mayo Chiki is a story about Sakamachi Kinjirou, a boy who has developed gynophobia because of constant abuse by his pro-wrestler mother and aspiring pro-wrestler sister.

However, as the story progressed, not much really happened. It's kind of hard to explain, but it's not only this series problem. As one other fellow reviewer stated, it is the nature of this genre as a whole. Many of these types of anime have a pointless feeling after they end, and this is no exception. To top it off, the last episode was horribly unsatisfying as instead of spending time with the main heroine, who should be considered his girlfriend now, he goes on a date with some other harem girl.Now that...we're done with the problems of the series, I just wanted to state how i loved the characters in this story. The main hero of the story is pretty generic with his nice guy attitude, getting beat up by everyone else, and slightly clueless to the clues that the females give him. Now the heroine is pretty fun, especially since she's super cute :3. I just wish that the two interacted more than they did in this story. we're done with the problems of the series, I just wanted to state how i loved the characters in this story.

This anime has ALOT of tsundere moments, and its very cliche. The thing that I dont like about this anime is that it shows alot of abusive actions towards the main guy character. Almost all the characters are tsunderes and tend to either sexually or physically harass Kinjirou Sakamachi. But aside from that, this anime was okay.The story line is very cliche, so it didnt really catch my attention. The art is normal and very nice. I also liked the opening theme for...the anime, and also the ending was very good. The characters are fair, I'm not really into tsunderes because there are soo many of them in anime. But I guess thats what most people like. Overall this anime, as I said, is perfect example of tsunderes and perfect for any tsundere lovers out there. the anime, and also the ending was very good. The characters are fair, I'm not really into tsunderes because there are soo many of them in anime. But I guess thats what most people like. Overall this anime, as I said, is perfect example of tsunderes and perfect for any tsundere lovers out there."", ""Alright, just a one I suppose I should mention before I start this review- it's my first one. Bear with me, please! *^* Also...beware of spoilers ; u ; I'll try my best to avoid them.So...what exactly made me give this show, Mayo Chiki, as bad of a score as I did? Well, I suppose that there's two reasons: first off, I usually find harems to be pretty meh, and also, I was let down. You see, not knowing much about the anime before diving into it, I figured it would be different than other harems, with a strong female lead (Konoe), rather than one...who got all squirmy and constantly having their breasts fondled. Well, I shouldn't ever come to that conclusion. After all, this is a harem, and all harems NEED to have the fondling, it seems.Story: 5I thought the story was just, okay. I mean, it was plenty creative- a story about a teenage girl who became a boy so she could serve her mistress as a butler. If that was the story all on it's own, than I'm sure this would have been rated better. However, it isn't. There was the romance intertwined in the story that made me squirm way too much in the worst of ways. It was too generic, and it felt too much like other rom-com/harems out there. Still, there were parts to the story I liked, don't forget that. I thought Konoe's familial issues were interested, and I wished there would have been a part where her and her father made up. However, it was left up in the air, which did not make me happy.Also, I don't understand why the 13th episode even existed. It might be that Hulu has the last 2 in the wrong order, or that 13 was a special add on for a DVD, but it confused me. The story was closed up at 12 and I was happy then. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy watching a Nakuru episode >:3Art: 6To be honest there isn't much to say here. It's not that much different than other shows, with a style that doesn't bother doing anything different. It is also the kind of art-style that isn't afraid to make their girls as big-breasted as possible. Look at Nakaru as example (even if she doesn't like them). I guess that this should be the time for me to go on a short rant about one thing that ruined Konoe for me a little bit. How come she has completely average breasts, but still managed to be a guy? I know that she straps them down, but still. Again, average, but not that terrible. Not much noteworthy in this department. Shall we go on?Sound: 6Actually, the theme song was really nice, one of those songs that will remain in my head for hours after watching the show (I've even caught myself humming to it once or twice ;3), though the insert music is nothing noteworthy or memorable. Actually, that's a lie. There was the ONE song where all the maids were singing Happy Birthday to Kureha. Not living in Japan, I'm not sure if that's a common song they sing there (maybe at Maid Cafes?), but it was really annoying, and I wanted it over right from the start. Other than that, I guess I like everything, but nothing better than just good.Character: 3Yeah....I didn't enjoy the characters much at all. Usually I don't mind the characters from Harems, as most will try to find more creative characters, as annoying as they will probably end up being. While yes, there were a few characters that I thought were creative (Kanade is an example of a character you don't see so much, and her sadistic personality was pretty good...ish), most of the time I was rolling my eyes.Let's start with the Main Character- the straight man: Baka Chicken. Uh, I mean, Sakamachi Kinjiro. He seemed like a good guy at first, and actually, through the story I liked him okay. It's just that the some old nose-bleeding gags got on my nerves. How come he barely managed to improve on his 'illness'? Kanade promised, though I have a feeling that she just liked to taunt and torture him.After Baka Chicken, there's Subaru Konoe, the butler who's actually a girl. She's basically the only sane character (Baka Chicken is sane too...just boring) throughout the series, but she got on my nerves too. I can understand her insecurities about things, but sometimes she would over-react, and had a terrible, terrible temper. The more she lashed out at Baka Chicken, the more angry I'd get myself. And then...you know what happens. *eyeroll*The other main character of this show is Kanade Suzutski, who's the sadistic mistress of Konoe. She's always pissed me off, not gonna lie. Though she's made me laugh once or twice, everything she does seems too cliche, and it's really hard to like her when she's constantly harassing the chicken and her butler.The other (not as important) characters were probably my favorite. Though Kureha had the same issues as Konoe (beating Baka Chicken up), Nakuru and Usami (Bunny), were enjoyable. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for the BL Fanatics, being one myself, so Nakuru was an obvious favorite of mind, though she was annoying at times. I hated Usami at first, considering ultra-tsuns like her were too cliche and annoying, though after awhile, I realized I liked her a bit. She seemed to understand things better than most of the others, realizing that Subaru was actually 'dressed as a girl', though she never learned her secret.All in all, annoying characters, with a few, and I mean few redeeming qualities in them. Each one irritated me at some point, and tried to hard to be funny to be that funny.Enjoyment: 4I didn't enjoy the show that much. There were time that I was bored, and others when I was rolling my eyes or cringing. There was little to no laughter. It all felt too similar to others shows that I watched, so without relatable characters (all far too bizarre to be), I didn't feel there was much reason to watch Mayo Chiki at all.Overall: 5This wasn't the worst show ever, it just wasn't great. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes over-the-top everything, even if it's executed poorly and ends up being annoying. Decent at best. who got all squirmy and constantly having their breasts fondled. Well, I shouldn't ever come to that conclusion. After all, this is a harem, and all harems NEED to have the fondling, it seems.Story: 5I thought the story was just, okay. I mean, it was plenty creative- a story about a teenage girl who became a boy so she could serve her mistress as a butler. If that was the story all on it's own, than I'm sure this would have been rated better. However, it isn't. There was the romance intertwined in the story that made me squirm way too much in the worst of ways. It was too generic, and it felt too much like other rom-com/harems out there.

Decent at best."", ""Mayo Chiki is a fairly generic and raunchy harem fanservice anime. It doesn't really do anything to set itself apart from other similar shows. The main character is your typical protagonist who's bad with women and awkward. His primary love interest is a girl who disguises as a male butler, which I guess is somewhat original and leads to some interesting situations.I really need to emphasize that this is primarily a fanservice anime with a side of romance. The story progression is shoehorned in (often quite awkwardly) mainly as a means to create situations where fanservice can occur. There's never really any real progression aside...from Konoe kissing Kinjirou a few times (which, to be honest, is a lot more than what happens in many other romance animes). She even confesses she wants to sleep with him but of course he's too much of a manchild to do that. For a show that is pretty liberal with its fanservice, they really decided to draw the line there I guess.Usami becomes a secondary love interest for Kinjirou, but not a serious one. If they were going for a love triangle here, it's a pretty weak love triangle no matter how you look at it. Most of Usami's appearances exist just to create fanservice situations rather than serious romance.The story ends kind of awkwardly and the final episode has absolutely nothing to do with any of the main characters so if you're really interested in the romance aspect of this anime you'll probably be somewhat annoyed at the ending. This anime is primarily about the fanservice anyways so I doubt many people watching are that concerned about the story.Art and sound are fine, nothing to write home about but nothing offensively bad.True to its name, Mayo Chiki is about as inoffensive, bland and boring as chicken and mayonnaise. If you're looking for raunchy fanservice then you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for nuance or interesting plotlines or even characters with a bit of depth you'll be disappointed. from Konoe kissing Kinjirou a few times (which, to be honest, is a lot more than what happens in many other romance animes).

I've enjoyed it completely each time. The story keeps me watching. It's simple on paper yet the anime draws out its full potential. There is a substantial amount of ecchi, even some nudity   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but they're so ridiculous half the time you can't not laugh. (The glasses scene-yeah if you've watched this then you know what I'm talking about). This is definitely something I would recommend to someone, especially if they're in the mood for comedy. I think Konoe's...character in particular was done beautifully. We see that harsh dynamic between when she's acting like a butler and when she's acting like a real girl. I really appreciate the duality. character in particular was done beautifully. We see that harsh dynamic between when she's acting like a butler and when she's acting like a real girl.

To be honest, the ending is just a bit disappointing and didn't satisfy me at all, though I'm not sad about it. On the website I watched this on, it didn't label it as ecchi or harem, just a rom-com, so boy was I in for a ride xD Luckily, I'm a guy, so I'm not complaining I guess. Lots of fan service too, surprising amount, but can't do much about it. I really wanted a good ending too, sigh.. I had high hopes coming in, but the authors really had no idea...what direction this anime was going in, whether it was a harem or rom-com with just one heroine because it eventually became both and it annoyed the hell out of me -_- what direction this anime was going in, whether it was a harem or rom-com with just one heroine because it eventually became both and it annoyed the hell out of me -_-"", ""There are so many title already covering so many aspects of this anime that its very predictable.

"", 'This is a pretty typical slice of life high school harem.  If you enjoy that genre then this will be worth your time.  The cross dressing butler is a unique thread, but not uncommon.  This one was executed well, but with the weak ending that almost all harem anime have.  There is also an unnecessary 13th episode which is more of a side story.The show hits all the tropes: hot springs, maid cafe, fireworks, etc.  You will be frustrated at times with the strict adherence to the usual harem formula, but the characters are good enough to keep you watching....This is not a great anime, but enjoyable enough to spend an afernoon on. This is not a great anime, but enjoyable enough to spend an afernoon on.', 'Note: The review posted was of my original work at SekijitsuArtI must say that I find the background art, the character designs and just the art in general superb in generating atmosphere and character emotions with the story, flow and music brilliantly. In other words, the art suited the anime series. It wasn’t anything too detailed nor was it anything too plain. An example would be Subaru’s sea-blue eyes which would stun you for even just a second.Another example would be Nakuru’s ironic’ moe moment; those sparkles definitely added the effects it needed in making you fall for the moe trap (which isn’t necessarily a...bad thing keep in mind). The backgrounds and settings used had a beautiful touch to them in its own way without the need of microscopic details here and there but the main thing I’m happy about is how much the art truly belonged in this series filled with comedy and romance.MusicI continue to love the opening song for Mayo Chiki though I never really got around liking the ending as much as making me go out of my way as to get the full song. The more I watched Mayo Chiki, the more the song made me feel content whenever I saw Kinjirou (Jirou) and Subaru interacting. Those two are such a lovely pair. Then again, the music doesn’t just score a great 8 out of 10 for the opening but the brilliant use and execution of the OST’s in the series.All the events in the series were accompanied by these OST’s which never felt out of place at all. It gave the opposite feeling where it does its job in making you feel however Feel wants you to feel (ahahaha get it?).StoryWatching not only Jirou and Subaru having fun but the rest of the cast during and after school is no less than entertaining to witness. Kanade’s sadistic plans make everything intriguingly humorous and just the expressions the others give (mainly Jirou and Usami) only helps feed that fire. Being a comedy romance series, Mayo Chiki can definitely mix these two genre’s together while adding a bit of drama as well, giving a nice, even variety which wouldn’t disappoint you.The lead up to these events isn’t always consistent but they sure know how to execute any of these genres whenever they want. Feel has done quite a good job in adapting Mayo Chiki… if only they didn’t stuff up in the end.Mayo Chiki was inconsistent at times and added a few scenes in which weren’t necessary in that certain atmosphere.

That’s if you’re fine with a few ecchi elements incorporated amongst the comedy in the series then you should really watch Mayo Chiki. If you’re worried about having to watch episode 13 as an n ending episode, you can always watch it in between the series and then trick yourself in watching episode 12 last.It might work but I’m not sure because I’ve never tried it.

I went looking for reviews, and some said the show gets better. They were right. It puts less focus on ecchi events than it looks like it would. In the end though, it doesn’t get all that much better.The first episode gave a definite feel of the generic one-note gag you would expect from this series. That isn’t what the show delivers. There is ecchi humor, but it never seems like the show is making flimsy excuses to show boobs or panties or any of that. In fact, there isn’t much of that stuff at...all. The situations are much easier to swallow than the usual anime crap too. They are unusual, but they do not match the extremes that seemingly similar anime go to in their quest for ecchi content.The main character is not a pushover. He still gets pushed around sometimes, but not because he’s a wimpy little guy. He isn’t a pervert either. (Although it would be fair to call him a “healthy young man.”) That’s probably the most refreshing aspect of his character.

There was a nice variety in character types, that all had a part to play throughout the entire plot.  The story line does a good job of keeping elements of sexual tension prominent, without becoming tastelessly perverted.The ending however was lacking.  Rather, there wasn't one.  I realize within this genre, real closure is too much to expect, but in most cases, the plot comes full circle and their is a distinct ending sequence.  This series has neither.  In fact, the last episode seems to...open up brand  new plot points right up to the very end.  If it weren't for the lack of a next episode preview, it would have been almost impossible to realize I'd reached the end. open up brand  new plot points right up to the very end.

Something that would never happen in real life, but that\'s what animes are all about. It had a, ""unique"" situation.A crossing dressing butler trying to keep a job? That\'s different.The main Kinjiro though with a personal problem that prevents him from being with girls.Reminded me of Girls Bravo. It\'s...a slice of life show that of course doesn\'t follow any route to the episodes but the romance was lacking. With only 13 episodes I felt as if the characters were brought in late and were squeezed into the harem. The last episode added a love interest and then ends it right then and there. A season two would probably give this show a better rating than a 7 but I guess it wasn\'t popular enough. Like a lot of shows the ending is open ended but left me feeling kind empty since it ended like Oreimo season 2 without the OVAs.The art was good, nothing lacking, but nothing really to add to your favorites for it.Character design was pretty good. My favorite character was Usami, because I enjoy tsunderes and pig tails. The love interests were the usual bunch, the girl who is the prettiest girl in school, the tsundere that he unintentionally woos, a big boobed weirdo, and the main. It\'s pretty obvious the entire show that Subaru and Kinjiro are going to end up together like most RomComs it\'s predictable.The enjoyment factor of this was high for me i laughed and wanted to watch the eps to see what happens. The humor is what made this show so appealing for me. Much like Baka and Test the humor was perverted and had funny stereotypes which I enjoy on a regular basis.Though like most shows adapted and budgeted to early, end without an ending. This added in for the rating of a 7, but like I said before the romance didn\'t catch for me it didn\'t seem like they had a significant reason to be in love at that point, and when the show tried to get to serious I felt like it failed and was a little too dramatic about it.Overall if you don\'t have anything to watch and could maybe use a laugh or two you could watch a couple eps of this. a slice of life show that of course doesn\'t follow any route to the episodes but the romance was lacking.

Normally, I don't like harem shows because they tend to have really shitty main characters, basically no interesting characters, and far too much fan service, which usually isn't funny or sexy and just feels forced and annoying. I'm not entirely sure what about this show made me like it as much as I did, but I can try to summarize it.The main character is actually a likable person who, for a change, has a back bone.

Not to mention a mid tier 6/10 episode, and as a closing episode a 3/10.

Everytime our protagonist has physical contact with a woman he starts bleeding from his nose to the extent that prolonged exposure causes him to pass out.One day this gem a man discovers that one of the most popular guys in his school and a butler...to the school's principal’s daughter - Subaru Konoe is a girl.

Even the main trio is a bit bland and except a tragedy in both Kinjirō and Subaru’s life they are all pretty standard for a romcom. With two exceptions I guess.

Two - the whole “Subaru is a girl and we must keep it a secret” shtick is pretty entertaining in the beginning.

Then there\'s a gender mix up that constructed all kinds of intrigue.The first 4 episode and perhaps a new after are easily 10/10.Then I found myself coming back to this site to lower my rating again and again....It does not even matter how irrelevant episode 13 is.The last 4 episodes are easily the most boring episodes out of everything I ever watched. 1/10In fact, on reflection, episode 10 has way less plot than episode 13. I suppose people complain less because it\'s not the last one, which means you are supposed to wrap up the story.The characters are just already running all their old traits.

All 4 episodes could have been written by anyone who has half a brain.If you are out of really good anime to watch then I\'ll say it\'s worth a watch for the first half, maybe first 9. I dragged myself through the last 4 and I\'d say it\'s fine if I just not bothered.Also, I happened to have watched some subbed and some dubbed. Both for episode 1 and I have to commend the English dub for reworking the dialogues into what is fitting in English as well as more witty and energetic than the Japanese version (as far as the subtitles can tell me). Although later in the series it seems to be the opposite like these really cringey dialogues that should only happen in Japanese, for example ""please save me from crying about myself). It\'s like the English team lost interests or don\'t know what could possibly make it better.English voice actors (from the US, I guess) since the recent years have always been high quality. All the girls have very polished voices like they trained very hard at reading and singing. The only problem is, they don\'t sound like teenagers. To me, they all sound positively 25+. If they try to be more nasal or whiny to act young that would make it even worse (it\'s not TOO bad in this aspect for this title). So mental note to myself when deciding whether to watch English dubbed: the the characters are typically adult like in Cowboy Bebop then I guess it\'s ok.

Kinjiro accidentally learns Subaru\'s secret and is forced by her master Kanade Suzutsuki to keep it secret from the rest of the school. Suzutsuki has sadistic tendencies but she is also interested in curing Kinjiro\'s gynophobia that causes  nosebleed and fainting if he even touches a girl so she is not all-bad despite her sadism,...she also deeply cares for her butler Subaru.Story 7: Kinjiro and Subaru become friends and develop romantic feelings for each other that everyone can see, but all sorts of other girls also appear to Kinjiro\'s life (this is harem after all) and of course cause him a lot of nosebleed. Funny thing is that since no one knows that Subaru is girl (which is actually obvious)  everyone thinks her and Kinjiro as gay lovers. Subaru-sama is very loved among girls of the school and she(or he) as not one but two fan clubs, another one dresses like Ku Klux Klan- probably reference to similar joke in Baka to Test. It is pretty obvious that only Subaru has chances with Kinjiro so harem feels pretty pointless and I think this story would have been better as romantic comedy. Moments with other girls mainly feel like pointless fanservice. There is a lot of ecchi and at times it follows completely crazy anime logic. Like when in the first episode Kinjiro accidentally fells on top of Subaru and all her buttons come undone in a blink of an eye to reveal her breasts.... that\'s ridiculous even in ecchi anime.  Kinjiros relationship with Subaru actually develops in a nice manner though. Huge problem is the final episode of the season that ruins the development by making a side character Nakuru Narumi (Fujoshi girl who supports KinjiroxSubaru romance) part of his harem. This was extremely bad way to end the show since it ruins the feeling of development Kinjiro reached with Subaru in the second last episode and all those episodes prior that.So if you are not that interested in Nakuru\'s character or harem aspect I recommend you skip the last episode!Art 6: Nothing very bad, pretty good looking anime. Character designs are rather generic and I personally was bothered by the fact that they didn\'t even try to make Subaru to look like a boy when she is cross-dressing. She has long hair and cute ribbons and stuff while she is supposedly looking like a boy. If they wanted long hair but boyish look I think long simple ponytail would have been better option. Now she looks more like a very girly boy - a trap who is surprisingly really a girly girl and no trap.... or some kind of fake-trap....double trap- or Trap-trap...  Admiral Ackbar would be proud.Sound 6: Nothing too special. Opening and ending songs were ok. Voice acting was pretty good. Subaru especially sounds a lot like a boy while she doesn\'t look like it. That saves part of believability of this cross-dressing plot.  At times she sounds like girl as well when she is not acting like a butler. This was well done. Other VA:s are ok.Character 6: Main character is mainly a generic nice guy, but extreme gynophobia makes him a bit unique. He has an actual reason to be afraid of lucky pervert moments. Thanks to her violent wrestler sister he can also take a lot of physical damage. His name has a pun of chicken, but he is definitely not the worst coward in anime history. Subaru is a bit of a tsundere at first, but she becomes sweet towards Kinjiro pretty fast. She haven\'t had any friends before so she is very happy to befriend with Kinjiro and quickly realizes she wants even more. Overall I did find her rather likable character, she has clear motivations, she acts in a way that is surprisingly realistic for anime character and develops feelings for Kinjiro in rather natural way. Other characters include Subaru\'s master Kanade, sadistic rich girl who was bit frustrating at times and  Kinjiro\'s little sister Kureha who ""tests"" wrestling moves to her brother daily, being the main cause of his gynophobia. She still loves his brother deeply in non-incest kind of way and is attracted to Subaru whom she thinks is a boy like everyone else.  Because this is harem there are also other ""options"" for Kinjiro like Masamune Usami, textbook tsundere and character I don\'t think this show really needed, same with Nakuru Narumi, big busted and cat-eared fujoshi girl. Nakuru is alright as side character, kinda fun, but her attraction to Kinjirou felt forced to me and addition to harem in the last episode felt wrong to me. I really liked the joke about Masamune\'s apartment being haunted. Ghosts were just chilling out there and she paid no attention to them, that was so unexpected visual gag that it was kinda clever.Enjoyment 7: It was alright show, ecchi and humour, cute and funny stuff. Enjoyable.Overall 6: Main idea was nice, Kinjirou and Subaru were a good couple that developed nicely, ecchi was not bad, but at times it was too unbelievable. Harem-aspect was the biggest weakness of this show, there were not much actual competition between the girls, Subaru was the only real option for Kinjirou, so would\'ve been better without this forced harem-aspect. Sure most girls didn\'t know Subaru is a girl too but that would only make Jiro look gay and any attempts by girls hopeless. Especially that last episode made failure of this as harem comedy clear and I recommend that if you like JiroXSubaru more than forced attempt of harem leave that one out. she also deeply cares for her butler Subaru.Story 7: Kinjiro and Subaru become friends and develop romantic feelings for each other that everyone can see, but all sorts of other girls also appear to Kinjiro\'s life (this is harem after all) and of course cause him a lot of nosebleed. Funny thing is that since no one knows that Subaru is girl (which is actually obvious)  everyone thinks her and Kinjiro as gay lovers. Subaru-sama is very loved among girls of the school and she(or he) as not one but two fan clubs, another one dresses like Ku Klux Klan- probably reference to similar joke in Baka to Test. It is pretty obvious that only Subaru has chances with Kinjiro so harem feels pretty pointless and I think this story would have been better as romantic comedy. Moments with other girls mainly feel like pointless fanservice. There is a lot of ecchi and at times it follows completely crazy anime logic. Like when in the first episode Kinjiro accidentally fells on top of Subaru and all her buttons come undone in a blink of an eye to reveal her breasts.... that\'s ridiculous even in ecchi anime.  Kinjiros relationship with Subaru actually develops in a nice manner though. Huge problem is the final episode of the season that ruins the development by making a side character Nakuru Narumi (Fujoshi girl who supports KinjiroxSubaru romance) part of his harem. This was extremely bad way to end the show since it ruins the feeling of development Kinjiro reached with Subaru in the second last episode and all those episodes prior that.So if you are not that interested in Nakuru\'s character or harem aspect I recommend you skip the last episode!Art 6: Nothing very bad, pretty good looking anime. Character designs are rather generic and I personally was bothered by the fact that they didn\'t even try to make Subaru to look like a boy when she is cross-dressing. She has long hair and cute ribbons and stuff while she is supposedly looking like a boy. If they wanted long hair but boyish look I think long simple ponytail would have been better option. Now she looks more like a very girly boy - a trap who is surprisingly really a girly girl and no trap.... or some kind of fake-trap....double trap- or Trap-trap...  Admiral Ackbar would be proud.Sound 6: Nothing too special. Opening and ending songs were ok. Voice acting was pretty good. Subaru especially sounds a lot like a boy while she doesn\'t look like it. That saves part of believability of this cross-dressing plot.  At times she sounds like girl as well when she is not acting like a butler. This was well done. Other VA:s are ok.Character 6: Main character is mainly a generic nice guy, but extreme gynophobia makes him a bit unique. He has an actual reason to be afraid of lucky pervert moments. Thanks to her violent wrestler sister he can also take a lot of physical damage. His name has a pun of chicken, but he is definitely not the worst coward in anime history. Subaru is a bit of a tsundere at first, but she becomes sweet towards Kinjiro pretty fast. She haven\'t had any friends before so she is very happy to befriend with Kinjiro and quickly realizes she wants even more. Overall I did find her rather likable character, she has clear motivations, she acts in a way that is surprisingly realistic for anime character and develops feelings for Kinjiro in rather natural way. Other characters include Subaru\'s master Kanade, sadistic rich girl who was bit frustrating at times and  Kinjiro\'s little sister Kureha who ""tests"" wrestling moves to her brother daily, being the main cause of his gynophobia. She still loves his brother deeply in non-incest kind of way and is attracted to Subaru whom she thinks is a boy like everyone else.  Because this is harem there are also other ""options"" for Kinjiro like Masamune Usami, textbook tsundere and character I don\'t think this show really needed, same with Nakuru Narumi, big busted and cat-eared fujoshi girl. Nakuru is alright as side character, kinda fun, but her attraction to Kinjirou felt forced to me and addition to harem in the last episode felt wrong to me. I really liked the joke about Masamune\'s apartment being haunted. Ghosts were just chilling out there and she paid no attention to them, that was so unexpected visual gag that it was kinda clever.Enjoyment 7: It was alright show, ecchi and humour, cute and funny stuff.

Not a lot of times, mind you, but it\'s weird that it happened more than once isn\'t it? It\'s making me wonder if it has some deeper origin.Mayo Chiki is fun in how far it pushes it\'s innuendo and lewdness without straying too far into ""I Can\'t Believe It\'s Not Hentai"" territory. In fact there was only one scene with any real nudity in the penultimate episode, and it was...probably only there in whatever special dvd/blu-ray release I was watching because the listing here on MAL only has it as a PG-13. Despite the lack of nudity it manages to really push the envelope and there\'s a running joke of other characters guessing protagonist-kun\'s fetishes, or making some up for him.The glasses fujoshi girl is great, one of my favorite characters. The rest of them are all pretty funny as well, no annoying side characters who exist solely to be hated by the audience and everyone else. The protagonist is as boring and predictable as you could expect from your typical harem romcom, but that serves the comedy just fine. His gynophobia and physical reaction if a girl makes contact with him is also a trope I\'ve seen several times before, occasionally with swapped genders.

We are introduced to a new evil, the organization Devil's Fang headed by President D. There is something different about this new evil. Joker finally has his own archenemy!In Season 1 and 2, Professor Clover hated Silver Heart mainly. I remember Professor Clover as like the devil himself, bringing evil and terror. The new evil , President D. hates Joker mainly, we'll find out why in Season 4. He's a sadist that wants to destroy Joker and his Kaitou friends Queen and Spade, even placing bounties...on them all, I loved seeing that bounty part in the anime XDPresident D. is dangerous in that he would send assassins to target Joker on his heists and watch him suffer on that big screen monitor while eating that fat juicy steak lol That is a plus since it gives Joker more formidable opponents on his heists. Joker is still trolling hard! He pretends to lose or get trapped, but he actually has a trick.We are also introduced to a new character, Phoenix! Like President D. we don't find out more who he is until much later, but Phoenix is like the new Shadow Joker. Also it would seem he is not human, he could transform into a cool firebird with wings and powers. Since many heists involve treasures of Phoenix's background, he too competes in the hunt as a rival to Joker.The anime opening is spot on as always and it looks excellent! We got a exciting remix of the Sai Sai Hai Hai in the Season 1/2 Opening, The voice-acting of the characters is beautifully done.

Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42422/Healin_Good♡Precure_Movie__Yume_no_Machi_de_Kyun_Tto_GoGo_Dai_Henshin,"[""Yay! My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is.

Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that!

This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people?

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature!

This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something.

You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits?

They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is.

You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5.

Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature!

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo!

This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while.

I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good.

This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover?

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans.

Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate.

They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters!

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight.

Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo!

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely.

Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that.

For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process.

This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo!

But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows.

This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day.

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems.

Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners.

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it.

Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3"", 'Anyone who\'s talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I\'ve made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while.

This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me.

Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again.

Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).', 'This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film).

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys.

My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had...completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3 completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack!

I think it\'s absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already...do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco\'s voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn\'t Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin\' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka\'s mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they\'ve been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there\'s a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls\' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn\'t the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show\'s themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka\'s mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who\'s evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven\'t seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they\'re even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes\'s time won\'t know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn\'t alienate viewers who haven\'t seen their show, but they\'re deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don\'t directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie\'s biggest Achilles\' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I\'m so glad the movie didn\'t give them much in the way of screentime.For what it\'s worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin\'s arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don\'t get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can\'t just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don\'t get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they\'re sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn\'t seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there\'s literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn\'t a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it\'s fine for what it is. Normally I\'d say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you\'re not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn\'t want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!). do that! It\'s bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it\'s not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too?

It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is...missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover,  TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride. missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes.

The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young singer named Kaguya, but a wolf-like creature spoils her show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, magical creatures, transformations, and great action scenes! The story also has some exciting and emotional moments, even if it was kind of predictable. However, I would have prefered if it had spent more time on character interactions instead...of fighting. The villain plot also started out well but it left me feeling rather frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over. Sadly, this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. There transformations, while gorgeous, also lose impact when there are so many of them.But I don't want to be overly critical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through. of fighting.
