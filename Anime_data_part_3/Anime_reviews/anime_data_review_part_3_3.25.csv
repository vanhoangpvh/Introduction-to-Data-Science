Amanchu! Advance,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36800/Amanchu_Advance,"[""Oh, my dear Amanchu!, what happened to you? I don't remember you being so messy. I don't remember you being so unrelatable. And I certainly don't remember you being so mediocre.Amanchu! Advance is really a textbook example of how sequels should not be made.Before we start, it is important to express what does the original Amanchu! mean to me. I've always been a fan of Slice of Life. However, it is always very hard to find a SoL with good characters, healing atmosphere and, most importantly, enough entertainment value. Amanchu! had all of those and to this day I consider it to be the third...best anime of this genre I've seen. So, you can guess that I was really looking forward to its second season. And it hurts me to say that it left me disappointed.The daily stories of Amanchu! were one of the things that made the original series so good. If they were dramatic, comedic or both, they always managed to be impactful and brought a message with themselves. In which we get to the first huge problem of Amanchu! Advance. That it refrains from doing things the same way as before. The first hit comes very early on, with an episode about dreaming and flying on a broom. Oh no, Amanchu!, ghost stories are really not the way to go. Sadly, the show doesn't think so and decides to continue. Which is a decision that comes back to haunt it immediately. The dream stories are not very interesting, drag on for a huge amount of time and the fact that everything is a dream also makes them feel less touching, meaningful and nowhere near as impactful as before. In comparison to the daily stories it presents at the start, they are a huge dropout, both quality and entertainment wise.This is not where things end however. The character department is also a place the creators wanted to add in. And so we are presented to a couple of more and less important newcomers to go along our original core five. First of them is Kokoro-chan, a tsundere-ish kid trap... *sigh* Do I need to say more? ; Actually, let's keep this unbiased; Kokoro is a beautiful case of a character who gets a lot of screen time yet ads absolutely nothing to the show. His only role, despite appearing in most of the episodes, is to fall in love with Pikari and act like a kid. What I always liked about the characters of Amanchu! is that they all had their purpose. They were helping Teko with her diving training or they had their own little moments here and there. If Kokoro hasn't been in the show, literally nothing would've changed. Hell, he doesn't even bother telling others that he's a boy, even though he knows that everyone thinks of him as a girl. If you really had to add a childish character, as if Pikari herself wasn't childish enough, you really could've done a better job. Like with the other new character Kodama, Pikari's little sister. She has layers and overall felt like she brought a bit of common sense to the group, even though she appeared very little sadly. If she got all the screen time the show wasted on Kokoro, maybe I wouldn't be writing this review.Another area I didn't expect would happen is the yuri-bait feeling. As far as I remember, the first season didn't have any moments that would bait you into shipping characters. Because of that, it remains a huge mystery to me why do characters suddenly battle for Pikari's heart now. Why not leave them just friends? Do the people behind this seriously believe that the cringe-worthy dialogues about who loves Pikari more add anything to the show? Well, they technically could. But not when you know that nothing is ever going to happen. You know that nobody's going to ever express their feeling, you know that they'll stay just friends in the end. Then why all this battling for Pikari's heart? I just don't get it. The yuri-bait cliche which arose in the last couple of years is really starting to annoy me. And that is coming from a guy who normally very much loves yuri.It's also important to talk about the satisfaction factor this series brings. Because of all the things mentioned above, the original Amanchu! is one of the most satisfactory shows I've had the pleasure of seeing. At the end of every single episode I had a wide smile on my face and was genuinely happy. With Advance, not so much. There are a couple of episodes that focus on everyday's life, and these are all very good. However, as I said, the ghost episodes in particular feel very weird and not like something you can relate to anymore. Their purpose in general is very questionable, as I don't think there is any particular reason they were thought up in the first place. That as a whole brings the satisfaction factor of the show much lower than I wanted it to be.The animation and sound both stayed very much the same as in the first season. Character drawings are still very good, though I think they used chibi cheap faces way too much this time around. Backgrounds are still good, everything looks clean and sometimes it has very nice shots. I could very well be lying right now but I think the OST stayed almost the same as in the first series. Which is not a problem, because it is still generally very good and atmosphere fitting. Other than that, everything good.------Believe me when I say that I have nothing against adding or changing things for the greater good. I really don't. However, why did the creators decided to add elements that were destined to worsen the show lies beyond me. It hurts me to say, but Amanchu! Advance is a failure of a sequel. It's the same show deep in heart, but the things around changed so much you have to dig way deeper than before to find its real value. And that's a shame, especially for a small-audience show like Amanchu!. best anime of this genre I've seen. So, you can guess that I was really looking forward to its second season.

Unfortunately, this new season is an awful disappointment and a big step down from what was already founded of the previous season 2 years back.Anybody who is a fan of Amanchu! and/or Amano Kozue’s works will know that she is the one who created the Aria series, one that stresses on the light-hearted SoL features that we have come to know and love, and the same thing is brought forward to the manga adaptation of Amanchu!.The pivotal point is where the first season ended with...the first 20 or so chapters adapted into what as considered as an impressive feat in its time, and the second season attempted some ideals that quite frankly, don’t one mesh quite as well as what was already done with the all-new supernatural settings (the story of Peter Pan, the school’s ghost arc) and stuff that’s NOT about scuba-diving.Blame the anime adaptation all you want, but Amano-sensei has her faults too, because when you feel the main plot device of your series is getting stale, and you try injecting some new things that just don’t resonate with your viewers, you know the feeling that you have lost some dedicated fans when we crave for more of the plot device that keeps us entertained and showcases what the series is all about.At first, while I realized that the original team for Season 1 is back to reprise their roles (albeit with a new director), I immediately thought that it was the director’s fault for not choosing to adapt the manga chapter stories evenly, because for Season 1 it was ¾ scuba-diving and the rest SoL, but this season went the other rout and gave us less former and more latter, which mind you by the way, isn’t bad but kinda lost its footing in the process.The good stuff:Pikari, Teko, the Ninomiya siblings and Katori-sensei still live on with their lives, albeit SoL-ish and more of the same, and that’s not bad. The characterization in Amanchu! has never been the strong suit (but it does when it comes to scuba-diving), and I certainly can STILL appreciate it for what it is.J.C.Staff’s art and animation are also consistent across the board, and made me feel like I’m re-watching more of less the same from the foundations of the first season, I’ll give the acclaimed studio that of its professionalism.The bad stuff:Aside from the new director (which I’ve heard it’s a 2nd-rate one) whom IMO has no idea how to pitch this new season with the weird stories and such that it became a huge turn-off, I never appreciated the story arcs presented here (VERY particularly the Peter Pan arc, the one with supernatural dreams that span times past and future), because it didn’t click well with the main series, and as a manga reader, that is exactly the same sentiments I have here (and it spans 30+ chapters in the manga before getting back into the plot device). The SoL-esque segments also didn’t quite have the same sentiments as Season 1, so it was nothing but dull the entire way through.The music, particularly the OST, is not as well made as Season 1. While I have a soft spot for musical OSTs, what was featured here are good on their own, but nothing made me want to listen to them again (therefore making them Side-B tracks). I absolutely love the OST in Season 1 because it resonated with the series (as an introduction), but Season 2 made me lose faith in the series in terms of musicality, and just became a copy-paste thing.In the end, is Amanchu! Advance a good follow-up? Yes and no.Yes, if you want more of the characters and the art and animation,No, if you are anime-only and/or have watched Season 1 and wanting to know whether if Season 2 retained much of the quality that’s to be expected of the series.It’s not bad really, but I wished it could be better.

Just a decent follow-up when all is said and done.', ""Some people count sheep, I count Amanchu's moe faces. Without a doubt, the latter is more efficient when it comes to falling asleep, and when I do, I sleep like a baby. No, I do not mean that I wake up every 2 hours, cry, shit myself and suck titties. I mean I sleep without worries, wearing some sort of moe face myself, and it's great.This second season is much like the first one in terms of story. Slice of life silliness, school time and scuba diving. Everything there needs to be for the series to work. No one really cares what the story...is so let's focus on things that make this show good.Our characters are the epitome of kindness and happiness, but just like last time: never too much so. If there was any problems with Aria, it was how overly sweet it could be at times, making it almost nauseating to watch over and over again. The author has fixed this with Amanchu, making the whole cast well-balanced.The art is amazing. According to anonymous 4chan source, the series has had over 1200 different moe faces by far. The nature's backdrop alone is soothing to watch, and whenever there is animated water present, I can almost smell the fresh air. It's hard to believe that J.C. Staff can create something like this.The sounds are the best part of this show. I have seen the first season something like 6 times, 4 times practically eyes closed. You don't really need to even watch it to see it. The music is beyond calming and voice acting is almost ASMR. If there ever was an anime that needed to be watched while wearing headphones, it is this one right here.When it comes to enjoyment, Amanchu has given me a lot. Sometimes I put it to play in the evening before I go to bed, and it helps me to relax and fall asleep. It's rare for any series to do this to me. Non Non Biryori and Nichijou are practically the only others that give me this. Amanchu is and probably will always be my favorite healing anime. is so let's focus on things that make this show good.Our characters are the epitome of kindness and happiness, but just like last time: never too much so.

Amanchu is and probably will always be my favorite healing anime."", 'In the summer of 2016, J.C.Staff released an anime based on a manga by the creator of Aria. This element alone was enough to get some people’s eyes to light up, but the anime also featured diving, strong friendship/possible yuri subtext, cute animals, and memorable verbal tics. This anime went by the name of Amanchu!, and was a moderate success with fans of slice of life anime, as well as those who either were familiar with or were fascinated by knowing more about the sport of diving.Two years later, a second season has come onto the scene. While every fan seemed to initially welcome...it with open arms, this season has taken some directions that has the fanbase split.For one thing, there’s the matter of the show completely abandoning the diving aspect of its first season for several episodes. This feels a lot more like a normal “slice of life”, as we watch the characters do things like set up for the school festival and celebrate Teko’s birthday. This may be disappointing to those who enjoyed the diving focus in the first season, though it’s not completely abandoned and has a few moments in the spotlight of the show.There’s also the introduction of what at first appear to be a one-off side character - an older, dark-skinned child named Kokoro, who strives to “become a man” despite their feminine appearance. (I won’t spoil their true gender identity.) However, this side character continues to pop up in the series, and shows a mild romantic interest in Teko. Some have called this character a “yuri killer” and a flaw in the series.The third (and final) negative point against Amanchu! Advance compared to the original is the introduction of a three-episode arc that seems like an odd shift in tone from the rest of the series. This arc focuses on the supernatural, introduces a new character, and gives them a backstory associated with a minor character we haven’t spent much time with before. The first episode of this arc was moderately interesting...then it dragged on for two more episodes, for the most part Teko and Pikari-less. It honestly felt like the Endless Eight, and so did the fan reaction in the forums/comments I saw. (“Is the arc over this episode?” “Yes.” “Oh, thank god.”) The original author has a thing for supernatural elements, since they also made an appearance in Aria, but it worked much better there than in this more down-to-earth series. This arc also would have made more sense as OVAs then smack dab in the middle of the second season.So, since I’ve spent all this time complaining about Amanchu! Advance, why have I still given it a 6/10 score? (Some might consider that a bad score. I don’t. There’s ten points on the system for a reason.) Well, Teko and Pikari are still cute and perfect for each other, even if the show tries to stomp on my dreams by introducing a “rival.” They have some great scenes together much like the original. The more slice of life esque episodes have some humorous moments. Our cute mascots are still present and charming. Ai even seemed to abuse her brother less this season...or perhaps she just wasn’t around as much.Overall, I would recommend Amanchu! Advance to anyone who enjoyed the characters enough in the first season that they would want to spend more time with them rather they’re diving or not. If you got into the first season for the diving aspect, you might not have a pleasant experience with this season. it with open arms, this season has taken some directions that has the fanbase split.For one thing, there’s the matter of the show completely abandoning the diving aspect of its first season for several episodes.

Why is a realistic slice of life show about friendship, diving, and discovering yourself suddenly having episodes where there are witches and ghosts, dreamlands, and time travel? Even if some of the unrealistic things happen in characters' dreams, it's such a sharp change in tone that I can't help but be confused and utterly uninterested.And while I'm on the topic of being uninterested: There's nothing about any of the characters or plot that keep me drawn to the show at...all. Almost anything and everything that happens is essentially forgotten and never addressed again, and I have never once found the ability to care about anything that occurred this season.It's not exactly bad... But there's nothing in Amanchu Advance that draws in the viewer and makes them want to stay the way there was in season one. There's too much going on that has nothing to do with the original genre and plot, and it makes me sad to see that a show with so much potential is being wasted doing things that make no sense and don't even matter in the long run. all.

You have been warned.Based off a popular manga of the same name Amanchu advance is the sequel to the popular first season of the series that aired in the summer of 2016 and following on from the ova gives us the opportunity to see how much Futaba has changed after meeting Hikari and the members of the dive club and discovered how much fun the world of diving...has brought her and how this has changed her.Taking place weeks after the OVA the overall story of the series continues to follow the life of Futaba Ooki aka Teko as she continues to enjoy her new-found life in the town of Shizuoka where she spends her days attending school as a regular schoolgirl and at the same time diving deep underwater with the members of the diving club all the while striving to continue to improve herself and make as many happy memories as possible. Joining Teko in her quest to both improve herself and to make many happy memories is a host of characters that include Teko’s best friend the ever-energetic Hikari aka Pikari, the laid back but surprisingly perceptive homeroom teacher Mato and the kind and caring but surprisingly hot-blooded Ai Teko and Pikari’s senior within the dive club.Together with her friends Teko in this summer and the year after will encounter and meet many different situations and characters that will not only involve them in many unusual situations but also allow them to meet and befriend many unusual people that will have a profound impact on the lives of Teko and her friends and allow them to forge even stronger bonds with each other as they overcome challenges together.HikariHikari voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Girlish Number and Hundred fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Teko’s classmate and a fellow member of the schools diving club. A positive, direct and caring person by nature Hikari who has been nicknamed Pikari by her friends and fellow classmates is a friendly and persistent person by nature that tries hard to make new friends whenever she meets someone that interests her.  A kind, caring and perceptive person by nature Hikari while boastful to a degree is also someone that’s friendly and tries to help others whenever possible whether she knows that person or not. While somewhat absent-minded by nature Hikari is someone that can also be surprisingly responsible and determined at times and on top of her direct nature can also be pretty bold at times and willing to do things that most people will find odd such as calling someone out when on the streets rather than wait for an opportunity to greet them face to face as others would. While an overly cheerful and positive person Hikari is also someone that can be considerate of others and is quick to notice when someone’s mood is down. A prominent trait of Hikari is her ability to stay positive and cheerful at all times a task that she takes care off by finding things that interest and amuse her in the areas around the town that she calls wonders which can range from simple things like funny shaped fruits to rare things like an octopus fighting off competition for its future home. This aspect of her personality I felt matched well with Hikari's nature as a go lucky and energetic schoolgirl.Arguably the most prominent part of Hikari’s character is her friendship and relationship with her best friend Teko. As a result of meeting Teko back in the first season and finding someone that was both amusing and at the same time very similar to her in terms of personality Hikari has become fast friends with Teko and it can be seen that their friendship is something that she values highly. This is shown in her constant attempts to get Teko involved in her many actions within the series. As a result of seeing all the efforts that Teko has made both in trying to improve her personality and her skills as a diver, Hikari is shown to be very proud of Teko and is often shown to be elated when she see’s the former in a happy mood. Conversely, Hikari is also able to sense when Teko is sad and discouraged which shows the strong bond that has been formed between the two. Despite her positive and cheerful nature, it can be seen that Hikari like Futaba is someone that fears the future as she knows that someday that she and Futaba will be forced to leave each other as their lives proceed on to the next stages showing that beneath her cheerful demeanour Hikari also fears being alone once more. As a result, it can be seen that the reason for Hikari’s overly friendly and cheerful nature is because she wants to prolong this point in time and make as many great memories before the end comes. The character of Hikari I felt was an interesting character that did a great job of reminding us that while the time of youth is not infinite there is no reason why that should stop you from enjoying that time with your friends because while these times may past memories will last forever within your minds. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Hikari.FutabaFutaba voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A positive, calm and intelligent person by nature Futaba while a quiet person is also someone that is kind and caring towards all she meets and can also be surprisingly perceptive at times. As a result of being introduced to the world of diving by Hikari and the members of the diving club and of the freedom and independence that diving can bring to her Futaba’s personality has changed substantially from her past self. While still quiet to a degree Futaba in this season is shown to be more confident and able to interact with others more easily without becoming overly nervous and at the same time willing to enter new areas that her past self would never would have dreamed of entering showing the many changes that meeting Hikari and the members of the dive club had on her. In line with this new-found confidence of hers Is Futaba’s determination to be more responsible and independent that comes from her desire to not rely on others too much.While more confident this season Futaba still fears the unknown to a degree and can still get discouraged at times. However unlike in the past when she would no doubt have given up on the endeavour Futaba as a result of her determination to improve herself and of her desire to stand equal to Pikari instead perseveres showing her determination to be able to stand alongside Hikari on her own merits alone.  As the series goes on Futaba though still easily discouraged at times gradually starts to realise that worrying about something needlessly is useless and that instead of doing so should focus on things that she wants to do and not what society expects them to do. The most prominent trait of Futaba is without a doubt the friendship that she has managed to forge with her fellow classmate and diving club member Hikari. For Futaba who prior to the first season of the series who had very few people that she can call friends meeting and befriending Hikari can be said to have a profound impact on her life. While her friendship with Hikari remains as strong as ever in this season it can be seen that Futaba has become somewhat conscious of the remaining time that she can spend having fun with both Hikari and the members of the dive club and as a result feels an element of fear as a result of it. Paired with this fear of the remaining time left is Futaba’s view on the friendship that she has with Hikari and it can be seen that Futaba worries constantly and somewhat dreads that once the time is up and the two have to leave each other their friendship would also change.As a result of this fear, Futaba as the series goes on works hard to improve both her personality and her diving skills showing a determination to not cause Hikari to be upset and be disappointed in her as well as her own desire to be independent and not rely on her for everything. A peculiar and amusing aspect of Futaba’s character that I found to be hilarious is the fact that due to the strong friendship that she has forged with Hikari and how much she values it Futaba is shown to be somewhat protective of Hikari and dislikes it when someone else appears to contest her place as Hikari’s friend. In this state, it can be seen that Futaba tries rather determinedly to protect Hikari a fact that is best shown during the Halloween event. The character of Futaba I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her determination to change herself and improve her diving skills so that she can be with her friends and make many more precious memories with them before the end being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Futaba.AiAi Ninomiya voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Food wars and Denpa Kyoushi fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is Futaba and Hikari’s senior both in the school and as a member of the diving club. A kind, caring and friendly person by nature Ai while an upperclassman does not treat anyone differently based on their grade and indeed is someone that tries to help her juniors whenever possible. An intelligent and curious young woman Ai while rational and logical most of the time can also be somewhat childish and stubborn at times particularly if she encounters something that she finds amusing. An amusing aspect of her character that’s often used as comic relief is her hot-blooded nature which often causes her to be aggressive towards her younger brother when he disturbs her. However, despite this it can be seen that Ai cares a great deal about her brother. While a calm and cool person by nature Ai is someone that can get flustered quite easily especially in matters related to romance and, in this state, she can get surprisingly nervous which I felt was amusing. While nervous when confronted with issues of romance it can be seen that even in this state Ai can be surprisingly determined and tenacious especially when the other party is someone that has caught her interest and will not easily let go of the situation even when the other party tries to sever the bond between them which is best shown during the Peter arc.  The character of Ai I felt was an interesting one that while providing great comic relief to the series also did a great job of providing some level of calm that restrained some of Hikari’s antics. I also felt that the Peter arc that Ai featured prominently in did a great job of expanding upon her character if only by a little bit. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Oonishi did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ai.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the locations and settings that the main cast visit in the series was well designed and developed with the ocean environments and the dream settings being both beautiful and impressive in their scenery. The character designs for the series I felt was pretty good and while the main cast from the previous seasons did not really change that much I thought that the designs for the new characters that join in this season such as Peter, Kokoro, his sister Kotori and Hikari’s sister Kodama did a great job of not just giving each character a unique look but also one that matched their personalities and character. The animation for the many marine life and the animation for their dives underwater I felt was also pretty impressive with the former being quite funky. Music wise I felt that the series opening and ending themes which were Crosswalk by Minori Suzuki and Hello, Hello by Maaya Sakamoto I felt were both excellent and complemented the series calming tone pretty well. The series OST I felt also did a great job of highlighting the various moods and feelings that the cast feels as they encounter different situations while bonding with each other. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the members of the main cast all did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Eri Suzuki, Saori Oonishi and Ai Yamamoto who portrayed the characters of Futaba, Hikari, Ai and Kokoro respectively deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job at portraying their respective characters.Overall conclusionIn overall Amanchu advance, I felt was an interesting anime and a worthy sequel to the first season of Amanchu with its main strong points being its strong premise, excellent story, heartwarming interactions between its cast, character development and strong voice acting.The overall premise of the show which built upon the foundation that the first season started upon still remains the development of the character and personality of Futaba aka Teko as she learns to grow as a person not just in terms of abilities as a diver but also in confidence and personality. While the first season of the series focused on introducing the character of Futaba to the new setting of Shizuoka that she had just moved to by introducing her to not just the sport of diving but also to a host of new friends that include Hikari and her fellow members of the dive club this season instead focuses on the development of Futaba’s personality and character as she becomes aware of the limited time that they have to spend with one another for once they graduate from high school their time together would end.The key to this premise comes in two forms the first of which is Futaba’s desire to improve herself and be more independent of others and thus allow her to exist in society without having to rely too much on others. This desire is a result of Futaba’s realization that the time that she spends with Hikari and the members of the dive club while one of the most enjoyable parts of her life up to this point must at some point come to an end and as a result before that happens she must learn to not be too reliant on others and instead be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with them as she goes about her life. The second form is that of memories which is something that goes hand in hand with friendship and the changing realities of life that come as time advances. Within the series, this comes in two forms the first is via Futaba’s desire to treasure her time with Hikari by spending more time with her doing my memorable things such as the Halloween parade and working together during the school festival. The second is through the use of dreams of which Futaba is shown to be quite the professional dreamer which allows Futaba to have many and varied dreams that allow her and Hikari to visit many settings and locations that simply don’t exist in the real world. These dreams while entertaining also fulfilled the purpose of allowing Futaba to experience many magical moments that is simply impossible in the real world. A key struggle that exists for Futaba in this season was the introduction of a rival for Hikari’s affections in the form of the character of Kokoro and I felt that the struggle between them while entertaining and funny also contributed in increasing Futaba’s determination to make more memories with her friends something that was really appreciated.In overall Amanchu advance was a series that I really enjoyed that I felt built upon the strong foundations that the first season established. While I felt that the story, premise, character development, character chemistry and voice acting were strong I felt that the introduction of supernatural events such as the Peter story arc which while important for both Ai and Mato was a bit too strange for this season though it was still entertaining to a degree. As a final score, I would say that Amanchu advance easily deserves a final score of 9/10 let down only by the dreams enjoyable as they are felt a tad out of place. has brought her and how this has changed her.Taking place weeks after the OVA the overall story of the series continues to follow the life of Futaba Ooki aka Teko as she continues to enjoy her new-found life in the town of Shizuoka where she spends her days attending school as a regular schoolgirl and at the same time diving deep underwater with the members of the diving club all the while striving to continue to improve herself and make as many happy memories as possible. Joining Teko in her quest to both improve herself and to make many happy memories is a host of characters that include Teko’s best friend the ever-energetic Hikari aka Pikari, the laid back but surprisingly perceptive homeroom teacher Mato and the kind and caring but surprisingly hot-blooded Ai Teko and Pikari’s senior within the dive club.Together with her friends Teko in this summer and the year after will encounter and meet many different situations and characters that will not only involve them in many unusual situations but also allow them to meet and befriend many unusual people that will have a profound impact on the lives of Teko and her friends and allow them to forge even stronger bonds with each other as they overcome challenges together.HikariHikari voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Girlish Number and Hundred fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Teko’s classmate and a fellow member of the schools diving club. A positive, direct and caring person by nature Hikari who has been nicknamed Pikari by her friends and fellow classmates is a friendly and persistent person by nature that tries hard to make new friends whenever she meets someone that interests her.  A kind, caring and perceptive person by nature Hikari while boastful to a degree is also someone that’s friendly and tries to help others whenever possible whether she knows that person or not. While somewhat absent-minded by nature Hikari is someone that can also be surprisingly responsible and determined at times and on top of her direct nature can also be pretty bold at times and willing to do things that most people will find odd such as calling someone out when on the streets rather than wait for an opportunity to greet them face to face as others would. While an overly cheerful and positive person Hikari is also someone that can be considerate of others and is quick to notice when someone’s mood is down. A prominent trait of Hikari is her ability to stay positive and cheerful at all times a task that she takes care off by finding things that interest and amuse her in the areas around the town that she calls wonders which can range from simple things like funny shaped fruits to rare things like an octopus fighting off competition for its future home. This aspect of her personality I felt matched well with Hikari's nature as a go lucky and energetic schoolgirl.Arguably the most prominent part of Hikari’s character is her friendship and relationship with her best friend Teko. As a result of meeting Teko back in the first season and finding someone that was both amusing and at the same time very similar to her in terms of personality Hikari has become fast friends with Teko and it can be seen that their friendship is something that she values highly. This is shown in her constant attempts to get Teko involved in her many actions within the series. As a result of seeing all the efforts that Teko has made both in trying to improve her personality and her skills as a diver, Hikari is shown to be very proud of Teko and is often shown to be elated when she see’s the former in a happy mood. Conversely, Hikari is also able to sense when Teko is sad and discouraged which shows the strong bond that has been formed between the two. Despite her positive and cheerful nature, it can be seen that Hikari like Futaba is someone that fears the future as she knows that someday that she and Futaba will be forced to leave each other as their lives proceed on to the next stages showing that beneath her cheerful demeanour Hikari also fears being alone once more. As a result, it can be seen that the reason for Hikari’s overly friendly and cheerful nature is because she wants to prolong this point in time and make as many great memories before the end comes. The character of Hikari I felt was an interesting character that did a great job of reminding us that while the time of youth is not infinite there is no reason why that should stop you from enjoying that time with your friends because while these times may past memories will last forever within your minds. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Hikari.FutabaFutaba voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Guilty Crown and Anohana fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series.

As a final score, I would say that Amanchu advance easily deserves a final score of 9/10 let down only by the dreams enjoyable as they are felt a tad out of place."", 'Note: This covers the whole animated franchise up until 2023.Unlike with Amaama to Inazuma I was fully prepared to tear Amanchu to pieces but I decided that wasn’t fair so I rewatched what I watched back in 2017 about it, and continued with the sequel. And I’m glad I did that because the show wasn’t at all like I thought I remembered it to be. Learned a good lesson to rewatch the show you are going to talk about in order to talk about it correctly, for a second time.Anyways my first impressions about Amanchu! back to six years ago was that it was a...plotless, super slow, melodramatic, tryhard moe show with no explorations of its themes and elements, constant changes between a sad and a tryhard happy mood, with one of my most hated protagonists of all time that was constantly crying, along with one of my most hated co-protagonists of all time. With an ova sequel that was a completely melodramatic throwaway episode about a high school girl accepting that her friend now has more friends. What do I think about it now?First of all, Amanchu! is as plotless and slow as any moe slice of life out there really, in fact, it has more plot and progression than most I’ve seen, in the second episode it already introduces the scuba diving which is the main element in the show, and from there it progressively explains more about it, and it also introduces new secondary characters and a teacher that are part of the club. The main idea behind all this is to show how the protagonist, Futaba, grows from a crybaby with first world problems to…well, not that, as she learns to dive and not be dependent of her new friend and co-protagonist Hikari for everything, or at least that’s the intention.The show is certainly not tryhard moe but it is however tryhard funny, which to me usually misses the mark in any show or movie or whatever that tries that. Amanchu! desperately makes its characters overreact to every little thing changing its arstyle to a chibi one as well as changing the faces of everyone in order to make you laugh. Some will find it funny, some don’t, I belong in the second group. And it’s not a problem really, because unlike what I thought in 2017, Amanchu! is a completely lighthearted and relaxing show (or at least that’s what it amounts to) that shouldn’t be taken all too seriously, it’s not that it presents stakes and serious themes and then ruins it with constant comedy as plenty of anime and the MCU do.Sure, Futaba sighs a lot but she’s not sad or crying as I thought she did, in fact she only cries twice in the whole show, one even happens in a flashback. The reason why she feels so down at first is because she moved from another place and is overwhelmed by the completely different new town and people, and misses her old home and friends. Something which I thought was stupid back then, but can now understand and empathize (although not relate) with now, especially considering she’s just a teenager, speaking with teenagers from different countries during these six years helped me a lot with that.Also the teacher who I remembered being super childish, in fact is not, as she has some moments where she acts like an adult and gives advices to the teen characters of the show. Sure she is happy and having fun a lot of the times, but since when is that a problem? Being an adult doesn’t mean you have to be serious all the time, although this may vary depending of the place, country, culture and people around I guess.There are however issues within the show. Futaba seems to have a bit of a social anxiety going on with her, yet because of the lighthearted nature and tone of the show, it comes off more as her being extremely shy instead. Also, although there is some exploration in the show, it is true that the series reaches a point where it has nothing else to show and thus, instead of showing the protagonist learning to swim and improving herself, it proceeds to have five episodes about typical slice of nothingness happening that lots of slice of life anime have. Is during these episodes when the pacing and themes go to die and the characters fool around doing anything but talking about diving or swimming, including the teacher. And it doesn’t even lead to a satisfying conclusion in the last episode, since despite all the things Futaba learns in the season, she still needs the help of everyone around her, especially Hikari.I mean I guess she couldn’t do it perfectly at first try, but what was the point of the whole show then?As for characters, I still include Hikari within my most hated characters of all time, nothing very wrong with her in the way she is written I guess, she is the typical happy and very energetic character in a slice of life show. It’s just that she’s the reason why I had an issue with the show in the first place, she fools around all the time doing silly faces and trying hard to seem funny, that I found her irritating and wanted to kick her head open instead. I remember back when the show came out and people were debating if she is autistic and a proper representation of people from the spectrum, it was that bad. She is not, by the way.Then there was the big sister, whatever her name is, I didn’t remember her much, but during my rewatch I couldn’t stop thinking how much of a bitch this girl is towards her brother for no reason, she just likes to beat him all the time I guess. Hey people, when a woman is violent towards a man, is not abusive, is funny, didn’t you know? Off to my most hated characters she goes, taking what was Futaba place there before.Oh, and visuals and sound are fine I guess. The former are basic but serviceable, people had a problem with the school uniforms back then, I couldn’t care less about them, the only thing that stands out visually are the backgrounds, very pretty and based on actual places in Japan. As for the latter, the sound effects and voice acting do their job just fine and the music is relaxing like the shows intends to, with the opening and ending being very cute.The ova that comes after is indeed about Futaba’s friends visiting her, and one of them is jealous of Hikari, but there’s no problem in it, it is not presented in a melodramatic way, is all lighthearted and she gets over it by the end of it in just twenty four minutes or so. There’s nothing wrong with it so this is actually the best of the three animated installments, it’s just that it feels like it should have been the last episode of the season instead of being released on its own, milking the Japanese I guess.Then came the second season which remained more or less the same in terms of visuals and sound. The opening and ending are not as good as the first ones but they are still fine, as is the soundtrack in general. There is however some CGI in this season and it does not look good, as usual.This season is nowhere near as beloved as the first one and it is because of the plot. On the positive side, it has the undisputed highest points of the franchise, with Futaba finally developing as she was supposed to do during the previous season, while also introducing the very likeable family of Hikari. The problems with this season are everything else, as follows:-There was a bit of fanservice, very little actually, but definitely unwelcomed on a previously very clean and pure show.-If the previous season gave reasons to ship the characters thanks to some dialogues, this one leans harder on the yuri vibes by making Futaba jealous of a newly introduced character that likes Hikari, only to do nothing with that and not change the relationship between the characters in any way, it was all bait.-Speaking of which, said new character is thought of as a girl when he appears, but turns out to be a boy. Unlike Hikari’s family, he adds nothing, he makes the show worse by making everything more childish, and his whole personality isn’t likeable either.-Something like four episodes are wasted on dreams. There was dead time on the first season as well but at least the characters were actually in the actual setting. This third of the show felt like complete filler and nobody could defend it. There was an in-story reason for these episodes but that only led to a bigger problem that deserves its own paragraph which is:-The Peter Pan arc. Ladies and gentlemen, Amanchu presents what’s most likely THE SECOND WORST, MOST STUPID LOVE TRIANGLE OF ALL TIME, after that thing in the Twilight movies. Nowhere near as messed up for sure but it still comes off as a bit creepy and purely nonsensical and unfitting within a setting and show like this, and to think this was the reason why the dreams were in the show all along, to asspull a solution during this arc. Also, two versions of the same character that defy all time and space logic coexist in the same place, somehow. Also, the big sister character turns into a completely out of character childish, girly, easy to fool and manipulate version of herself. Also, it ruined the teacher by giving her a terrible backdrop, also, what kind of a love triangle has a student involved? Unless the show is a hentai, and if the author is not a creep, it is obvious that the two adults will end up together. Only thing they don’t, because the series does nothing with them just like with the other romance bait and yuri bait episodes, and it even gives amnesia to every character except the three involved, precisely because IT WAS ALL A DREAM.Some tried to defend the show by saying that these episodes were about showing the magic that can be found in everyday life, a message that the series tries to convey, and that every other Kozue Amano work has some fantasy-ish elements (and water settings) in them. Those are terrible justifications because Amanchu! is not those other works, it is its own thing with its own setting and rules, this is not another planet in the future like in Aria, it is contemporary Japan. And also, if the show tries to tell that even everyday moments in everyday life can be magical, throwing out of nowhere magical elements go against that message, precisely because those are not everyday elements, even more so when they end up having no impact whatsoever on the plot and characters by the end of the arc.Thus, Amanchu! ends up lasting for at least double the amount of time it needs to, if the show was just episodes one to six and twelve of the first season, the ova, and episodes three, five, ten and twelve of the second season, Futaba would fail at a midpoint in a whole show instead at the end of a first season, regain confidence in the ova (now episode 8 in this scenario), and achieve her goal and grow by the twelfth episode of a single cour anime. But unless a fan makes an edit that turns it into a watchable slice of life with a satisfying conclusion or something, here you are with a show that ends up being worse and more disappointing than the average nothing happens moe, because it makes you think that it will be about something, only to pad the runtime with unrelated random goofing around and out of place elements that go against the themes and messages, and be about nothing like most other moe shows by the end. So, the best thing to do with Amanchu! is to read the Aqua and Aria manga instead, which are more creative, make a better use of its water based setting, does not have out of place elements, and has six much better explored characters than Futaba here. plotless, super slow, melodramatic, tryhard moe show with no explorations of its themes and elements, constant changes between a sad and a tryhard happy mood, with one of my most hated protagonists of all time that was constantly crying, along with one of my most hated co-protagonists of all time. With an ova sequel that was a completely melodramatic throwaway episode about a high school girl accepting that her friend now has more friends. What do I think about it now?First of all, Amanchu! is as plotless and slow as any moe slice of life out there really, in fact, it has more plot and progression than most I’ve seen, in the second episode it already introduces the scuba diving which is the main element in the show, and from there it progressively explains more about it, and it also introduces new secondary characters and a teacher that are part of the club. The main idea behind all this is to show how the protagonist, Futaba, grows from a crybaby with first world problems to…well, not that, as she learns to dive and not be dependent of her new friend and co-protagonist Hikari for everything, or at least that’s the intention.The show is certainly not tryhard moe but it is however tryhard funny, which to me usually misses the mark in any show or movie or whatever that tries that. Amanchu! desperately makes its characters overreact to every little thing changing its arstyle to a chibi one as well as changing the faces of everyone in order to make you laugh. Some will find it funny, some don’t, I belong in the second group. And it’s not a problem really, because unlike what I thought in 2017, Amanchu! is a completely lighthearted and relaxing show (or at least that’s what it amounts to) that shouldn’t be taken all too seriously, it’s not that it presents stakes and serious themes and then ruins it with constant comedy as plenty of anime and the MCU do.Sure, Futaba sighs a lot but she’s not sad or crying as I thought she did, in fact she only cries twice in the whole show, one even happens in a flashback. The reason why she feels so down at first is because she moved from another place and is overwhelmed by the completely different new town and people, and misses her old home and friends. Something which I thought was stupid back then, but can now understand and empathize (although not relate) with now, especially considering she’s just a teenager, speaking with teenagers from different countries during these six years helped me a lot with that.Also the teacher who I remembered being super childish, in fact is not, as she has some moments where she acts like an adult and gives advices to the teen characters of the show. Sure she is happy and having fun a lot of the times, but since when is that a problem? Being an adult doesn’t mean you have to be serious all the time, although this may vary depending of the place, country, culture and people around I guess.There are however issues within the show. Futaba seems to have a bit of a social anxiety going on with her, yet because of the lighthearted nature and tone of the show, it comes off more as her being extremely shy instead. Also, although there is some exploration in the show, it is true that the series reaches a point where it has nothing else to show and thus, instead of showing the protagonist learning to swim and improving herself, it proceeds to have five episodes about typical slice of nothingness happening that lots of slice of life anime have. Is during these episodes when the pacing and themes go to die and the characters fool around doing anything but talking about diving or swimming, including the teacher. And it doesn’t even lead to a satisfying conclusion in the last episode, since despite all the things Futaba learns in the season, she still needs the help of everyone around her, especially Hikari.I mean I guess she couldn’t do it perfectly at first try, but what was the point of the whole show then?As for characters, I still include Hikari within my most hated characters of all time, nothing very wrong with her in the way she is written I guess, she is the typical happy and very energetic character in a slice of life show. It’s just that she’s the reason why I had an issue with the show in the first place, she fools around all the time doing silly faces and trying hard to seem funny, that I found her irritating and wanted to kick her head open instead. I remember back when the show came out and people were debating if she is autistic and a proper representation of people from the spectrum, it was that bad. She is not, by the way.Then there was the big sister, whatever her name is, I didn’t remember her much, but during my rewatch I couldn’t stop thinking how much of a bitch this girl is towards her brother for no reason, she just likes to beat him all the time I guess. Hey people, when a woman is violent towards a man, is not abusive, is funny, didn’t you know? Off to my most hated characters she goes, taking what was Futaba place there before.Oh, and visuals and sound are fine I guess. The former are basic but serviceable, people had a problem with the school uniforms back then, I couldn’t care less about them, the only thing that stands out visually are the backgrounds, very pretty and based on actual places in Japan. As for the latter, the sound effects and voice acting do their job just fine and the music is relaxing like the shows intends to, with the opening and ending being very cute.The ova that comes after is indeed about Futaba’s friends visiting her, and one of them is jealous of Hikari, but there’s no problem in it, it is not presented in a melodramatic way, is all lighthearted and she gets over it by the end of it in just twenty four minutes or so. There’s nothing wrong with it so this is actually the best of the three animated installments, it’s just that it feels like it should have been the last episode of the season instead of being released on its own, milking the Japanese I guess.Then came the second season which remained more or less the same in terms of visuals and sound. The opening and ending are not as good as the first ones but they are still fine, as is the soundtrack in general. There is however some CGI in this season and it does not look good, as usual.This season is nowhere near as beloved as the first one and it is because of the plot. On the positive side, it has the undisputed highest points of the franchise, with Futaba finally developing as she was supposed to do during the previous season, while also introducing the very likeable family of Hikari. The problems with this season are everything else, as follows:-There was a bit of fanservice, very little actually, but definitely unwelcomed on a previously very clean and pure show.-If the previous season gave reasons to ship the characters thanks to some dialogues, this one leans harder on the yuri vibes by making Futaba jealous of a newly introduced character that likes Hikari, only to do nothing with that and not change the relationship between the characters in any way, it was all bait.-Speaking of which, said new character is thought of as a girl when he appears, but turns out to be a boy. Unlike Hikari’s family, he adds nothing, he makes the show worse by making everything more childish, and his whole personality isn’t likeable either.-Something like four episodes are wasted on dreams. There was dead time on the first season as well but at least the characters were actually in the actual setting. This third of the show felt like complete filler and nobody could defend it. There was an in-story reason for these episodes but that only led to a bigger problem that deserves its own paragraph which is:-The Peter Pan arc. Ladies and gentlemen, Amanchu presents what’s most likely THE SECOND WORST, MOST STUPID LOVE TRIANGLE OF ALL TIME, after that thing in the Twilight movies. Nowhere near as messed up for sure but it still comes off as a bit creepy and purely nonsensical and unfitting within a setting and show like this, and to think this was the reason why the dreams were in the show all along, to asspull a solution during this arc. Also, two versions of the same character that defy all time and space logic coexist in the same place, somehow. Also, the big sister character turns into a completely out of character childish, girly, easy to fool and manipulate version of herself. Also, it ruined the teacher by giving her a terrible backdrop, also, what kind of a love triangle has a student involved? Unless the show is a hentai, and if the author is not a creep, it is obvious that the two adults will end up together. Only thing they don’t, because the series does nothing with them just like with the other romance bait and yuri bait episodes, and it even gives amnesia to every character except the three involved, precisely because IT WAS ALL A DREAM.Some tried to defend the show by saying that these episodes were about showing the magic that can be found in everyday life, a message that the series tries to convey, and that every other Kozue Amano work has some fantasy-ish elements (and water settings) in them. Those are terrible justifications because Amanchu! is not those other works, it is its own thing with its own setting and rules, this is not another planet in the future like in Aria, it is contemporary Japan. And also, if the show tries to tell that even everyday moments in everyday life can be magical, throwing out of nowhere magical elements go against that message, precisely because those are not everyday elements, even more so when they end up having no impact whatsoever on the plot and characters by the end of the arc.Thus, Amanchu! ends up lasting for at least double the amount of time it needs to, if the show was just episodes one to six and twelve of the first season, the ova, and episodes three, five, ten and twelve of the second season, Futaba would fail at a midpoint in a whole show instead at the end of a first season, regain confidence in the ova (now episode 8 in this scenario), and achieve her goal and grow by the twelfth episode of a single cour anime. But unless a fan makes an edit that turns it into a watchable slice of life with a satisfying conclusion or something, here you are with a show that ends up being worse and more disappointing than the average nothing happens moe, because it makes you think that it will be about something, only to pad the runtime with unrelated random goofing around and out of place elements that go against the themes and messages, and be about nothing like most other moe shows by the end. So, the best thing to do with Amanchu! is to read the Aqua and Aria manga instead, which are more creative, make a better use of its water based setting, does not have out of place elements, and has six much better explored characters than Futaba here.', 'The slice of life anime about diving and having fun continues with Amanchu AdvanceAdvance leaves off where the first season did just with newer characters and Amanchu going off in it\'s own little new element it incorporates into all the slice of life moments Teko and the Diving Club goes through.So who\'s the newer characters, well we get Kodama Kohinata voiced by Aya Suzaki, Pikari\'s younger sister, Kokoro Misaki voiced by Ai Yamamoto, a friend Pikari encounters who actually has an infatuation towards Pikari (which makes MUCH more sense later on) and Kotori Misaki voiced by Ai Kakuma, who is essentially the same as Kokoro...cept, towards Teko. Mainly Kokoro gets the most screentime in terms of new characters as Kokoro\'s focus towards Pikari is heavily used in this season, Kodama and Kotori gets some but they are pretty much satelitte characters in some sense towards Teko, Kokoro and Pikari but still they have some sense of development as they are around the main characters nonetheless.The ""new element"" of Advance that it implements in this season is Teko\'s ""daydreaming ability"" which somehow gets an entire arc to itself with the ""Peter & the school festival arc"" involving Ai and Mato of all people. See Teko from the first season daydreamed ALOT and this manifested into her ""supernatural power"" of imagining lots of things and somehow...the rest of the cast can do this too in the Peter arc and one episode where Teko shows off her power. Now in saying this and this being Amanchu, this isn\'t entirely serious (besides Peter\'s arc) nor is this a shounen series so take this element with a grain of salt of how it proceeds. Nonetheless Teko\'s daydreaming ability does bleed into if things are a dream or in reality at times but for Amanchu, LA doesn\'t think it\'s something to dwell on it, especially when the daydreaming somehow allows Teko to meet and know someone in both their dreams and somehow Teko knows them in reality by the end of it as well. Again it\'s Amanchu so LA can actually let this slide a bit. But nonetheless incorporates this season\'s ""meetings and partings"" especially when involves the new characters and it only solidifies the nature and theming of youth of Advance.So with this new element into the mix, yes it means that the focus on diving is diminished BUT diving isn\'t all that Amanchu is all about as the core nature of Amanchu is about having fun, making friends be it through supernatural or genki means and the solemn greatness of youth and with it\'s new characters in hand, Amanchu Advance doubles it\'s efforts in this statement making it even more solid than the first season, heck the ""Advance"" in the title at least incorporates Teko trying to get her advanced diving license and though that gets talked about and shown at times, it\'s more or less the through-line for the plot while it can do it\'s supernatural elements and new characters for the bulk of this season.In terms of animation once again done by JC Staff, well the animation is pretty much the same as the first season just with the supernatural elements added to it allows for more creativity given especially in it\'s backgrounds. The animation is pretty as always from the first season as well as keeping the original character designs is good too. Overall Advance\'s animation is the same as the first season just with a bit more flourish due to it\'s daydreaming element and it\'s still beautiful nonetheless.Voice acting is pretty much the same as well but adding in the new characters voice actors, with Aya Suzaki, Ai Yamamoto and Ai Kakuma were nice additions to the anime all things considered, not to mention all of them blended well and had great chemistry with the main cast especially Ai Yamamoto to Eri Suzuki\'s Pikari and Ai Kayano\'s Teko for the majority of the time. LA wanted to once again put Shizuka Ito as MVP this season but that\'s just LA\'s bias talking, it\'ll go to Ai Yamamoto and Ai Kayano all thing considered with Saori Oonishi as Ai during the Peter arc especially was great on Saori\'s part.Amanchu Advance is by all means is goes through the same notions as the first season just with Advance going through some new directions and new characters, especially with it\'s supernatural elements taking Advance into a newer and interesting direction which actually does make Advance for LA at least much more interesting than the first season, sure the first season had narrative focus on Pikari and Teko\'s friendship but Advance...well advanced Pikari and Teko\'s friendship not only towards themselves but to the the rest of the cast, new and old, add in the character development of certain characters LA wanted like Mato and some unexpected ones like Ai and Amanchu Advance...literally advanced it\'s plot for what a slice of life anime without much tension or character development and solidified it\'s core focus of youth and ""meetings and partings"" that much better.Amanchu Advance is one of those anime season where you can both turn off your brain and revel in it\'s beautiful yet comedic slice of life moments as well as be wrapped up in Teko\'s daydreaming plots...be it lethargic or serious it becomes... cept, towards Teko. Mainly Kokoro gets the most screentime in terms of new characters as Kokoro\'s focus towards Pikari is heavily used in this season, Kodama and Kotori gets some but they are pretty much satelitte characters in some sense towards Teko, Kokoro and Pikari but still they have some sense of development as they are around the main characters nonetheless.The ""new element"" of Advance that it implements in this season is Teko\'s ""daydreaming ability"" which somehow gets an entire arc to itself with the ""Peter & the school festival arc"" involving Ai and Mato of all people.

Advance never feels like it gets up to the level of quality that was displayed in the first season, as the show strings along multiple types of storytelling that don\'t really work when put together.\xa0 Like the show is barely even about scuba diving anymore.That being said, the show still does have its exemplary moments, displaying the positive themes of how wonderful and magical life can be, as well as the more important message of accepting ones own faults and fighting through adversity for the light at the end of the tunnel.\xa0 At the end of the day, Amanchu is still an Amane Kozue work, and while the storytelling this time around is subpar and strange at best, its shining moments really stand out and personally give me a smile on my face considering the worth and usefulness of the messages it conveys.Overview:+\xa0 Good themes-\xa0 \xa0Storytelling gets a bit...off sometimes-\xa0 \xa0Dives into actual magic instead of feeling mysticalCharacters:As far as the main characters go, there\'s not really much change.\xa0 Both Pikari and Teko don\'t feel very different from the previous season, with any changes really only contributing to Teko, though that\'s debatable since she already got a major character arc in the first season.\xa0 Despite that, their relationship still remains very cute and one of the more positive aspects of the show in that regard.On the flipside, a majority of the supporting cast in the first season gets a lot of the season\'s focus.\xa0 Both Ninomiya twins (mostly Ai) and Kato-sensei get their spot in the limelight, though the actually quality of said attention is debatable.\xa0 Regardless, the show does take the time to expand on the characters we already know, which is still a plus considering prior, we didn\'t really get to know them or any prior backstory like we got with the show\'s main duo.As far as new additions go, characters like Kodama and Kokoro can vary in quality with each appearance.\xa0 Sometimes they have their shining moments, and other times they\'re just sort of there and sometimes act like a hinderance to what\'s happening on the screen.\xa0 This, coupled with the fact that the show only uses them as supplementary characters ultimately doesn\'t give them the benefit of the doubt and makes them worse off than they could\'ve been.\xa0 The new additions are nice, but they really could\'ve been portrayed better.\xa0 Especially Kokoro, since it\'s only at the very end that I feel they become a tolerable character.Overview:+ Different character foci-\xa0 New additions feel underwhelming at times-\xa0 Character development/exploration this time feels weirdArt:I feel like J.C. Staff never puts in the effort to make Amanchu as nice as it could look.\xa0 Like the first season, Advance has a very muted color scheme and a quality about it that makes it look much older than it really is.\xa0 Indeed Kozue-sensei\'s artstyle is reflective in the artstyle, down to the way she draws long dresses (as evident by the similarity of the school outfit to the Undine outfit in Aria) and her weird way of drawing cats, but I just feel like the quality could\'ve been so much better than it is.\xa0 Hell, Aria got a visual update in Avverine, so why can\'t that series\'s younger sister get the same treatment?That aside, the continued gag of \'secondary comedic\' faces continues as more amusing expressions continue to infect with Kodama\'s now probably being my favorite out of the entire Amanchu cast.\xa0 At least that\'s consistent, and definitely my favorite aspect of Kozue-sensei\'s art.Overview:+ More second faces!-\xa0 Art quality still feels underwhelmingSound:Minori Suzuki\'s ""Crosswalk"" and Maaya Sakamoto\'s ""Hello, Hello"" both come off as very light and gentle songs, with the ED coming off as more energetic with a bit more of an upbeat tempo to offest the more smooth and wave-like feeling that comes with its OP counterpart.But really, I feel like the star of the show in terms of sound comes from the show\'s BGM, as from the first note, it sets in the slice of life and more lax nature that encapsulates the show as a whole.\xa0 This is one of those cases where the show would otherwise feel incomplete without it, and I greatly appreciate having just a simple melody accompany what\'s going on in the screen to give the show that extra quality to it.Overview:+ Decent OP/ED+ BGM really sets in the show\'s tonePersonal Enjoyment:As much as I am a fan of Amane Kozue\'s works, the one problem I find with it is how difficult her series\' are to marathon.\xa0 Due to their lax nature and how objectively, very few things happen in each episode, I find myself drifting off and paying less and less attention unless there\'s a resurgence that occurs which, when it does happen, does bring me back to what\'s going on on the screen.I compared Advance to ""Aria the Natural"" because their emphasis on the more magical parts of the world brought the series down due to how out of place they feel.\xa0 That, in addition to how droning some episodes can feel catalyzed and drove in the fact that this season really wasn\'t all that great.\xa0 It has its high points, but comparatively, Teko\'s journey towards boosting her self-esteem was a much more worthwhile and satisfying journey that watching an entire arc about Peter Pan.\xa0 I still like Amanchu as a series and feel that it doesn\'t get the attention it deserves, but at least in this case, there were enough flaws about it for me to validate a less than optimal score than what I would like to give the series.That being said, any fans of Amane Kozue should still consider Amanchu.\xa0 Sure it isn\'t as great as Aria, but there\'re things that it does better than Aria (as well as enough references for you to go crazy over), which give it more than enough reason for consideration.\xa0 Advance I feel is still the lesser of the two seasons, but it\'s still decent enough to warrant a watch.\xa0 Just be prepared to see a hump during the middle section of the show.\xa0 That was definitely a tough one to get over. and move into making summer their first summer memories together, hoping and praying that they would be as mystical and memorable as they hope for it to be.I mentioned Amanchu\'s older sister, Aria, because this season of Amanchu! feels very much like that series.\xa0 Specifically, it feels very much like \'Aria the Natural\'.\xa0 This time, the story takes a different turn from the story about a girl in a new town to focus more on actual magic and mystical properties of the world in the setting, something that greatly separated \'Aria the Natural\' from the rest of its series.\xa0 As such, the show takes time to focus less on its characters and more on a new part of the series that feels unnecessary and out of place since the establishment of an arc like this creates a detachment from the rest of the series that didn\'t REALLY feel like Amanchu.\xa0 Kozue-sensei\'s usual sprinkling of mystical aspects to idealize the lives of her characters and make them more exciting is nothing new, but neither is her tendency to go kind of overboard and flop because of it, and that\'s really why the story of Amanchu! goes south in this case.Aside from that though, the show has a weird tendency to go into \'Pikari Worship\' mode, where various characters put her up on a pedestal, something that gets boring considering there are several episodes which are devoted entirely to this plot point.\xa0\xa0Because of this, Amanchu!

I personally was part of this group, but I had heard of some comments at the announcement of the new season. Safe to say, whilst it does have a lot of the same story elements that made the first season so great, it doesn’t overall feel the same with the inclusion of some more new elements.Just a pointer that there won’t be any major spoilers, just some general comments about plot devices or themes,...and it does relatively follow off the first season. However, if you have a pretty good recap of the show, there’s nothing crucial that was revealed in the prior season.~ SCORES ~Story: 7/10Art/Animation: 8/10Sound: 9/10Characters: 8.5/10Enjoyment: 7.5/10Overall Score: 8/10~ REVIEW ~Story: Near to the beginning of the series it starts out much how it ended. Calm feels, combined with a steady journey continuation on the introduction of deep sea diving. I was pleasantly surprised by this as, as mentioned previously, the comments that I read prior to watching this season did infer about some other elements. Admittedly though, there were two parts of this new ‘supernatural’ element that was added into the story. In the beginning it does seem to meld well with the story, not sacrificing the integral theme of the show itself. However, as time goes on it does seem to take a bigger role in the story’s direction, and the overall the tone begins to shift towards something much more dramatic than I was not only not prepared for but also a bit uncomfortable in adjusting to. Alongside this, the theme of diving is eventually brought back near the end and the show seemingly moves back to its roots, but if anything, this feels more disjointed. It began to feel like the whole theme of diving was just forgotten for nearly half the series and was only brought back near the end as a seeming ‘round-off’ to remind the viewer what they were watching for originally. That’s not to say that the story itself wasn’t great, I did enjoy the construction around and the depth of some themes that were discussed (the majority of which I can’t talk about more in depth unfortunately, but overall it felt like there was two stories competing for the major dominance of the narrative that the show was going for.Characters: Arguably one of the primary reasons that Amanchu! did so well in its initial season was the characters and their specific development throughout the course of the series. Teko and Pikari were the undeniable stars of the show, making every moment enjoyable and fluffy in every sense. All the major main characters returned for Advance, but there was some much-needed development that I found in several of the main cast that felt under-represented in the first season, as is very common with a lot of slice-of-life anime. The new characters felt like a nice addition to the crew, with none of them necessarily intruding on the prominence of the original cast with no meaningful contribution. Some had lengthy arcs that took place in a tertiary story throughout, whilst some had almost a full episode dedicated to their stories. Again, I won’t spoil who is who, but they did feel like a nice edition with good character designs.Art/Animation: A slight irk I can have with J.C Studios is that their emphasis on detailed drawings for frames can sacrifice some of the fluidity with the Key-frames. Nonetheless, this series didn’t feel like any sacrifices were made that obviously. The animations felt nice enough and the character outfits chosen, more specifically in one episode I would like to point out, didn’t seem to hinder the animation too much (though I do still wonder about those school uniforms haha). The big standout here for me though would have to be the background art used in the show. Time and time again the feelings of comfy-ness came flooding in every time I saw a new landscape or a new underwater view. The detail that was put into the everyday things in life such as the school itself felt nicely done too. I don’t honestly think it was anything to jump off the walls screaming about or that it made the show, but the Art especially played a significant role in aiding the show’s execution supported by some decent animation.Sound: It’s hard to review this as it always seems to depend on the series what I say about it regarding either the sound as a standalone, or the comparison of the sound with the new previous series. I will just clarify here that the critiques themselves are referring to the music and voice acting of this season only, not about the original Amanchu! Most of the original music was used in the second season, however it felt like there was a bigger presence of simple piano instrumentation which I felt did work with some of the more sombre moments of the season, in comparison with the season before which all relatively had a lot of the same music style. Voice acting as always was top notch, with the relationship between Teko and Pikari wholeheartedly believable through a wonderful mesh of adorable yet real dialogue and the delivery of such.Enjoyment: Overall, I would say that I did enjoy this season, don’t get me wrong, however there was something that felt slightly more off compared to the original. I get that there can be the issue of that fans should be able to move along with a development in the show’s theme, and that the changes that take place had already been written in the manga before, but for me as the show had heavily marketed itself as a show about diving in the first season, to take such a radical turn away from it did hinder my enjoyment somewhat. Nonetheless, I did try and take every moment as individually as possible unless it referred to possible character development, and with this I enjoyed these moments a lot more than I initially thought I would.~ CONCLUSION ~To conclude, Amanchu! Advance was a well-made and enjoyable sequel to Amanchu! though despite this enjoyment it couldn’t be ignored that the series does take a sharp change in direction halfway through which could hinder one’s enjoyment of it. However, given the genre that it does switch to, this can be on a person-by-person verdict and some may love it, some may hate it. I would recommend giving it a watch once you’ve caught up on the first season though. and it does relatively follow off the first season.

All in all, it was a great, but messy season of a great anime. I enjoyed it really much, even with its failures and shortcomings.

Alice to Zouroku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34350/Alice_to_Zouroku,"['-- This review contains spoilers. Only read if you have finished the series. --Story:This was an anime that caught my eye from the very beginning. The way it presents itself could be alluring to anybody, yet the story felt as if though it lacked any creative direction. Our main character, who goes by the name Sana, is basically an experiment with luck on her side. After her escape from the depressing facility, as if by fate, she meets and ends up being taken care of by Zouroku. Like most people, Sana cannot escape her past and is forced to go head to head with...enemies... and then the second half of the story begins. This is where it essentially fell apart for me. Rather than focusing on what caught everyone\'s attention to begin with, it lowers itself to carefree almost slice-of-life-like daily events that do not seem significant initially. Another girl somehow magically attains the Dreams of Alice power and the last third of the show basically revolves around her and the birth of her friendship with Sana. This ended up achieving two things: Sana is no longer lonely, and we see a glimpse of the impact the Dreams of Alice has on the world - or at least Japan. However, at what cost did this underwhelming ending have on the show? Let\'s not forget how the expansion of Wonderland was ceased all at the push of a button, literally.Art:In terms of art, J.C.Staff has done better. With that said, it does portray a sort of childish atmosphere, and I can see why they went with this. I don\'t recall seeing dips in quality, either. For what it was trying to achieve, I would say it did a good job.Sound:The music was different from what we normally hear. Overall, I would describe it as a happy-go-lucky adventure in itself. It mirrored the show, or to be more precise, Sana\'s personality.Characters:When it comes to character development, I doubt there\'s much ""development"" a child can achieve in a show. But with Sana, we basically start from ground zero. As Zouroku mentions, everything is a first with her. Their relationship together can be seen as a grandfather and his granddaughter, or possibly even a parent and their child. His constant help really emphasizes how little she knows of the world, and throughout the show we end up seeing how she gradually learns. In comparison to the child characters, the adult characters received little screen time. If the show was longer, we could have gotten to know them a bit more. The show mainly focuses on the children, with the exception of Zouroku, and the things they learn throughout this journey. Zouroku himself is an honest man who wants nothing to do with corruption or what isn\'t deemed as the ""honest life."" His real granddaughter, Sanae, is painfully just there in the background most of the time. She seems like an airhead, but in reality she\'s just always cheery - much like Sana is.In the end, there wasn\'t much to the story and characters as I thought there would be. If the show was expanded into more seasons, then I could understand. Unfortunately, it looks like they decided to give it its own ending. The final scene with grown-up Sana seemed rather cryptic as the fog that surrounded her and flowers she held immediately made me think she was at a graveyard, which possibly hints that Zouroku died about a decade later.To me, the whole show seemed like a waste of a decent plot. Nothing was really achieved on a grand scale. The exception would be the Dreams of Alice being spread to other people, but we never really got to see more into that other than it happened. But who knows. Maybe that\'s not what the show was going for. Maybe it was just a story about a girl who desperately wanted a happy ending.Final score: 4/10. enemies... and then the second half of the story begins.

Among the multitude of shows this season that garnered attention early on before dissipating or self-combusting, like flashy fireworks on the 4th of July, Alice and Zouroku possesses the framework to achieve longevity (Don’t be surprised if news of a sequel arrives). With an astonishing 44 minute intro episode, a strangely mystifying opening scene, and an engaging premise (characters known as “Dreams of Alice” can conjure up anything they desire with the...“Mirror Gate”), Alice and Zouroku was virtually guaranteed to attract viewers. Any anime can display sparks of potential, as Re:Creators and Eromanga-sensei had before quickly falling out of favor in the public eye. The challenge is to somehow transform the sparks into an electric current, to maintain the hype (if not exceed it), and to craft and grasp a standard of excellence. This, my friends, is what Alice and Zouroku achieved.A casual observer will most likely give this show a quick once-over, noting the cutesy character designs and simplistic promotional art, before turning away in disgust. However, as the adage goes, there’s more to this show than meets the eye. You see, Alice and Zouroku takes pride in its philosophical edge. Supported by an excellent script and a fascination with orchestral strings (especially in episode 4’s rescue operation), the deeper ideas and implications represented here are simply astounding in its amount of detail. For example, one character, deprived of self-worth, only senses fulfillment in helping and nurturing others (this character is rather deficient in the third level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs) while another character is a prime example of the Resource Dependence Theory (the more love and support she receives, the more content she is; the less love and support she receives; the less content she is). Alice and Zouroku, above all else, crafts more than a few moral conundrums, appealing to the intellectual in me:Is it OK to sacrifice individual needs for the good of others?Do the risks of an endeavor outweigh the rewards or, vice versa?Would you kill one person to save many?Is isolating unique traits just as destructive as forcing these traits to assimilate?If you flaws are detrimental, should you embrace them or seek to minimize them?If special abilities existed, would it be acceptable for a controlled minority to possess them or should all of us have them?Of course, Alice and Zouroku isn’t entirely intellectual nourishment; much of what constitutes this show is directed towards flaunting its inventive brilliance. Produced by J.C. Staff, which (judging from its involvement in Food Wars and Prison School) is no stranger to innovation, the visuals are unsurprisingly wonderful; the eyecatches, consisting of a spinning Mirror Gate on a blank background, are proof of this. However, it’s the cinematography (stunning establishment shots of the city), subtle stylistic touches (characters can alternate their clothes and hairstyles), and intriguing narrative techniques that truly showcase Alice and Zouroku at its best. There are quite a few narrative techniques in this show, like the occasional genre shift or the homages to Alice and Wonderland, but what really stands out is what occurs in episode 8. Here, the storyline shifts away from the protagonist, introducing a girl named Hatori (she’s a “Dream of Alice” as well as said protagonist), and it presents a fairy tale (“The Evil Witch”) that parallels the events of episode 8 (a story within a story, if you will) before reverting to the original plot halfway through the episode. It is this creativity that shines through in the second half of Alice and Zouroku.The waning minutes of episode 5 is when this series adjusts its focus, from drama to slice-of-life, from flashy fight scenes to melodic midnight walks, from tracking devices to stuffed animals. The orchestral strings, once bombastic and frenzied, are smoothed out to project a relaxed, carefree vibe; the occasional accordion solos are quite easygoing in their own right. The show’s sense of humor begins to come into its own, as it’s less reliant on the protagonist to generate laughs (we’ll get to her in a bit) and more geared towards its expertise of the Fish Out of Water concept. The characters’ unawareness of social cues and elements is brilliantly executed (the segment where one character explains what marriage is to another is simply a treat). Yes, Alice and Zouroku can deliver unabashed excellence but it’s the little things, the more refined touches, which make this show worthwhile.Alice and Zouroku can establish settings as well as anyone, it can provide substantial themes to its storyline, and it can handle pathos like few are able to (the emotional scenes are quite realistic, neither overbearing nor underwhelming). However, expecting this show to construct a respectable cast is out of the question. At best, the characterization is unfulfilled, with hints of depth and dynamics materializing on occasion. Practically everyone you encounter in the show will momentarily stroll into the spotlight, spare a few lines about what constitutes them as a person, perhaps mention a tragic past, conjure up some sort of connection with the main cast before vanishing into the background; this allows the spotlight to illuminate even brighter for the protagonist. Sana is said protagonist and she, to put it lightly, is a handful. Early on, Sana projects the utter arrogance of someone who is fully aware of the unfathomable power she wields. It is this arrogance that generates a multitude of the disasters, both insignificant and catastrophic, in Alice and Zouroku. When Sana encounters a pig puppet, she causes pigs to rain from the sky. When Sana encounters a “Dream of Alice” misusing her abilities, she handles it with all the poise and control of the 10 year old that she pretends to be. When the issues she’s created are resolved, Sana excessively emotes over it, delivering the waterworks and self-pity like an attention-craving prima donna. Really, the only person in this show that’s worth appreciating is the titular character.The “Zouroku” in Alice and Zouroku is rather unconventional for a show of this nature. He’s irritable, socially withdrawn, and a habitual smoker to boot. Yet, Zouroku is also the only realistic character you’ll find here. In a show overcompensated with shallow, cutesy idealists, this man comprehends his limitations and shortcomings more than anyone else; in one climatic scene, Zouroku states, “If there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s that nobody in this world is perfect. We lean on each other to get by because there’s some things you can’t do alone, no matter how smart or capable you are.” With an admirable performance from the wildly underrated John Swasey (the star of this show’s dub), Zouroku lords over the cast, dispensing words of wisdom in his realm of dominance (“It’s more important to focus on the people close to you than [to] dream about things that are out of reach”). Sana may be this show’s poster girl, the marketable leading lady, the reason why future viewers will be interested in Alice and Zouroku, but it’s this guy that you’ll remember long after you finish watching.More than anything else, Alice and Zouroku was released with the sole intent of achieving popularity, and (seeing that it’s among this season’s most discussed titles) it succeeded. Every character (excluding Zouroku), every song, every awe-inspiring fight, every heartwarming scene was beneficial for its cause. Even the most obvious of its missteps, the laughable CGI, helps in sparking conversations about the show as a whole. Mind you, this strategy isn’t necessarily flawed (in this day and age, eyeballs mean everything) but it reduced this show’s potential. Alice and Zouroku doesn’t do enough to establish its own identity; it never pushes boundaries, never introduces new concepts, and never expands horizons. Alice and Zouroku comprehends the conventional and thrives in it; for that I hold no grudge. I just wish it amounted to more than a solid yet redundant title. Its best moments are understated, like Sanae humming the theme song at one point, and I commend Alice and Zouroku for what it does accomplish. Philosophically, it’s fascinating. Musically, it’s thrilling. Cinematically, it’s enchanting. However, this title is hardly worthy of any admiration or fervor. Alice and Zouroku is a respectable work, as sharp and concise as a staccato rhythm. It is a jack of many trades and master of none; there are areas of this show that fascinate me but, as a whole, Alice and Zouroku leaves much to be desired.7 raining pigs out of 10 “Mirror Gate”), Alice and Zouroku was virtually guaranteed to attract viewers.

Alice and Zouroku comprehends the conventional and thrives in it; for that I hold no grudge. I just wish it amounted to more than a solid yet redundant title. Its best moments are understated, like Sanae humming the theme song at one point, and I commend Alice and Zouroku for what it does accomplish. Philosophically, it’s fascinating. Musically, it’s thrilling. Cinematically, it’s enchanting. However, this title is hardly worthy of any admiration or fervor. Alice and Zouroku is a respectable work, as sharp and concise as a staccato rhythm. It is a jack of many trades and master of none; there are areas of this show that fascinate me but, as a whole, Alice and Zouroku leaves much to be desired.7 raining pigs out of 10', 'Most of us have at one point questioned our own existence. After all, knowing our reason for being can be among our most valuable assets. We desire meaning from our lives, so pondering questions like “who am I, really?” and “what is my purpose?” is only natural.I bring this up not to go into some deep, pretentious analysis of this topic within the show, though there is some material there. Rather, I bring this up because Alice to Zouroku could have really benefited from taking a good, long look at itself in the mirror and seriously asking these questions.Hereafter referred to as “AtoZ”, Alice to...Zouroku seems to face a bit of an existential crisis. The issue here is twofold: one pertaining to its focus as a whole - in other words, what it is - and the other to its appeal or value to viewers; its purpose for existing in the first place.Genre-wise, AtoZ mainly functions in two sharply-contrasting halves. One half of it (technically closer to two-thirds) is mainly slice of life with some interesting fantasy elements incorporated, while the other is more focused on action and drama. It does eventually stick to the former, but much of its runtime is spent stubbornly refusing to commit to one or the other, which comes at the detriment of both halves not being as well-realized as they could have been.This kind of balancing of vastly different genres isn’t the easiest thing to pull off, but here is one area where I’ll give AtoZ credit. While its choice to hedge its bets does limit its greater potential, the show actually does an okay job selling the shift between them. The show spends long enough between genre shifts (usually a full episode or two) to allow its desired tone to properly settle in. This means that when it’s in slice of life mode, it actually manages to feel like slice of life, as opposed to just “down time” between action set pieces. Meanwhile, the more dramatic points still feel like more than just diversions. The series manages better than most to have two personalities at once; one for exciting times and one for laid-back moments.Even with only a 12-episode lifespan to work with, I’m glad it at least managed to explore the slice of life portion to a satisfactory degree, because that half is actually quite decent. The dramatic elements, on the other hand… well, to put it bluntly, they kind of suck. I’ll get back to that.Unfortunately, for AtoZ, contrasting genres isn’t the real issue here. A more notable issue is a lack of any substantial standout qualities – something to make it appealing over any other story of its type, particularly with how many of its wildly varied ideas are commonly seen in other series. Pretty much every individual element – every idea and its exploration - in AtoZ ranges from decent enough to outright bad, and none of it comes together to create something greater.Starting with the presentation, how are the visuals? They’re okay, I suppose. Color-wise? It’s fine. Character designs? They’re distinct-ish. Animation? Average to stiff. Level of detail? Not bad. Character expressions? Functional, but nothing more. There’s plenty of CGI, but it isn’t integrated very well into 2D scenes. There’s also an extended action sequence featuring some full 3D shots, and while it is decently dynamic, it simply doesn’t look that great (and that’s not even counting one hilarious animation error involving a moving background outside the parked car). What about the rest of the action? It’s nothing special. There’s no impressive choreography or impact, nor much emotional buildup, and little to no tension (as I’ll expand on later). There’s one exception that was actually solid, but the action as a whole isn’t much of a selling point.So if the visuals can’t impress, then what about the sound? Well, the voice work is competent (subbed; haven’t seen the English dub), including vocal expression and delivery, but it’s not outstanding. Sound design? It works, I guess. Music? Actually, the soundtrack, while not that memorable in its own right, is often quite evocative in context, and I quite like the opening and ending themes. But does a modestly above-average OST do enough to make otherwise mediocre presentation great? It does not.“But so what?” one might ask. After all, almost every aspect I’ve listed so far, while typically unremarkable, is still acceptable, including the show’s handling of multiple genres. At the end of the day, the presentation is nothing ruinous, and it doesn’t have to be great if there’s strength of substance being presented.Sadly, this is where the show runs into a serious fundamental problem: AtoZ, at least during its non-slice of life moments, is straight-up poorly-written. Those dramatic elements I mentioned earlier are seriously squandered by persistently low quality of writing.The series tries very hard during these dramatic scenes especially to keep things flexible and varied. On one hand, the show poses all sorts of questions about Sana, her existence, the facility she escapes from, and several characters, among other things. The show leverages these questions and finds a degree of success here in initially hooking viewers. Alright, seems fine so far.But on the other hand, there are all the different powers that Sana possesses, and they pose a real problem: they’re too powerful. Their versatility is taken way too far to give the show any hope of telling a compelling dramatic story; creating matter to summon pretty much anything, mind-reading, flying, manipulating objects, teleporting with some control over the destination, and that’s just from episode 1. Later points introduce some other equally if not more broken powers. Sana can pretty much do whatever the plot demands, and that includes pulling new abilities out of thin air whenever convenient. Normally, the established powers are already enough to prevent the main characters getting into truly tight situations, but even in rare exceptions, Sana possesses so many convenient powers that there’s usually nothing stopping the series from just coming up with a new way out for her or others on the spot.The only semblance of a limitation on Sana’s powers is her current energy level, which in practice ends up almost a non-issue for her. When it does come up, it can easily be fixed as soon as Sana gets a hold of some food. How does the series compensate? Simple: make Sana conveniently not have eaten enough since last using her powers.This lack of sufficient limitations also creates all sorts of loopholes that quickly result in things falling apart. For instance, why can’t Sana just teleport out of every problem? The show only bothers to contrive an excuse about half of the time, usually something to do with food again, and even those aren’t always very well conveyed or thought out. Any other time, it’s like everyone just outright forgets. That’s a real tension-killer, and it’s far from the only tension-killer this series falls victim to.There are other writing issues present, which include plot holes, other loopholes, inconsistencies, contrivances and so on that bring the whole thing down anytime it attempts something dramatic. I’m going to get into some plot/event spoilers for the first 5 episodes here to go over some of them; scroll past to skip them. Now, I want to be fair to this show, so only things I feel have at least a noticeable effect on either the show’s integrity or the viewer’s experience are included.With that said, let’s begin!*****SPOILERS FOR EPISODES 1-5***********************************************************************- The show tries to make Sana’s recapture seem like a huge threat, but her teleportation ability undermines this. Even if, somehow, she gets kidnapped, attempts to rescue her fail, AND she gets taken back to the lab… so what? As soon as she isn’t actively being pinned down, unable to use her powers (and they have to let her use her powers eventually or they can’t do tests with them), she could just teleport away! That is, assuming she isn’t “conveniently” too low on energy at the time for that to happen, but this was only the case on her initial escape. There’s just not enough sense of finality or decisiveness to the threat of Sana’s capture, which only serves to dampen the suspense even more than it already was.- Furthermore, Sana gets a tracking device put on her for safety before her kidnapping in episode 3. Setting aside the fact that this leads to even less tension, even Sana’s successful capture would just serve to easily reveal where she and the research lab are located. And the show tries really hard to make this whole sequence dramatic. It doesn’t work.- Episode 1&2: Sana, while a few normal pancakes away from fainting, was easily able to teleport both herself and Sanae to many random places in quick succession. This includes Antarctica, tens of thousands of miles away, and then she brings back a swarm of pigs along with them. This only serves to make the brokenness of her teleportation more obvious, while seemingly contradicting the “conservation of energy” rule established. (Apparently all those pigs combined have less energy value than a few normal pancakes.)- Episode 1: in the car chase, there was no apparent reason why Sana and Zouroku couldn’t just teleport themselves away and use Sana’s powers to replace the car on the other end. She had enough energy to easily lift the entire car, drive it around, and detach her opponents’ giant chain - a quick short-distance teleport at least to a nearby hiding place should have been no trouble. But nope, got to keep the poorly-rendered car chase going!- During the kidnap in episodes 3-5, instead of using her powers to teleport Zouroku to her, Sana could have just teleported away herself. Clearly neither a lack of energy nor her being pinned down was preventing her from using her powers, seeing as she manages to summon Zouroku, heal herself completely and then literally rewrite her situation mere minutes later to get rid of the hands pinning her down, all with no extra food. (And as mentioned before, this whole time we know Sana has a tracking device on her, so everyone is obviously going to have no trouble getting to her. The lack of tension continues!) At least the sequence led to some decent, if rather forced, character development.- Sana can instantly and easily look into anyone’s head and find out everything about them and their background, including what their relatives are doing (episode 1; she finds out about Zouroku’s granddaughter). This makes the mysteries surrounding who characters are, the facility she came from, where that facility is, what their motives are, and who Sana herself is, become completely trivial matters. Sana should have figured all this stuff out, either while she was at the lab or after her escape, but the issue is never brought up.- This anime’s plays for sympathy typically fall flat. The lab just does vaguely (very vaguely) “horrible things” to its subjects for energy experiments for which we’re given no context as to why they should ever have involve horrible things, because they’re the show’s generic evil organization figure which exists for the sake of weak drama and making us feel sorry for Sana. Minnie C immediately blows her clichéd “dead partner” backstory in an attempt to make her a sympathetic villain, except that we don’t even know her enough to feel any kind of attachment or sympathy. But hey, got to have an excuse to make her a menacing and villainous woman who is mean to children and shoots one in the leg without remorse to stop her from acting out of line.- On that note, Sana getting shot in the leg by Minnie C is probably the show’s most egregious example of a failed sympathy card. “*gasp* NO! SHE SHOT THE CHILD!” the audience cries, only for it to barely matter 2 minutes later because it was instantly healed with Sana’s usual overpowered magic abilities while she simultaneously rewrites her situation so she isn’t even pinned down. Really? Neither one of these abilities was established beforehand, and 2 minutes later it’s like Sana forgets she ever got shot, with no effect on her personality or outlook. All that came out of it was brief shock value and another excuse for Sana to have low energy and require a delicious Snickers® bar to later recharge. It just ends up feeling like cheap plays for emotions because this poor, poor child is captured and pinned and scared and wetting herself and is in pain for a few moments. All this, while we know she’ll just be rescued shortly because of the tracking device. It’s overblown, ineffective in context, and too shamelessly manipulative. Yes, drama is technically manipulative by nature, but this show makes its manipulation mechanisms way too obvious to the viewer to be effective. It’s clear when the show is just playing for cheap sympathy points, and in many cases, it comes across as desperate.AtoZ’s dramatic elements aim for flexibility, but ends up creating loopholes and relying on half-assed excuses. It tries to create suspense, and mostly fails because of said loopholes. When it goes for sympathetic, shocking or dark elements, they feel cheap, and there are overall hardly any successful dramatic scenes. As a whole, the quality of writing just isn’t up to standards, and at times, it gets plain annoying.***************************************************************************END OF SPOILERS**********But with all those issues out of the way, is Alice to Zouroku an irredeemable show? Well, maybe not.There’s a certain major development and shift that comes up in the middle of the series, almost out of nowhere. Some might call that another instance of poor writing. I’m going to call it a miracle, because it kicks of the “second half” of the story, where, at last, the series actually focuses on one thing! No more poorly-written pseudo-dramatic nonsense; just slice of life albeit more whimsical than average with some wonderland-fantasy elements. And the show definitely benefited from this transition, going from something I generally disliked to at least finding passable for the rest of it.Despite all of the writing problems present in the dramatic portions of the show, the slice of life components fare significantly better. When the series opts to focus on the more down-to-earth relationship between Sana, Zouroku and Sanae, most of the writing issues don’t apply. Granted, the occasional questionable element still pops up; these are mainly smaller details like Sana using her energy-demanding powers to fly because she’s supposedly too tired to walk, or her saying she hadn’t eaten in 3 days even though she clearly ate a rice ball earlier that afternoon, but none of it is stuff that cripples the antics as a whole; at worst, it might affect a brief interaction that is quickly moved on from.As for the antics themselves, they’re not going to blow anyone away, but they do offer a few decisive strengths.While the supporting characters of Alice to Zouroku are straightforward and unremarkable, the chemistry among the main duo is actually fairly strong. Zouroku’s staunch no-nonsense attitude makes him stand out from your typical guardian-figure lead. For Sana, whenever she’s not reduced to a plot device (something thankfully exclusive to the dramatic elements), watching her try to understand the world around her can be interesting.Ultimately, though, it’s the way these attitudes contrast and bounce off each other that make things endearing, and it also leads to the occasional bit of genuinely solid comedy. Most of the gags revolve around Sana getting confused or making a naïve comment because she’s still learning and/or Zouroku’s stubborn nature. While comedic subject matter itself is highly subjective, the show does fairly well in terms of setup and delivery. The jokes are fairly infrequent (I wouldn’t call this a comedy-focused series), but the ones it has are rarely predictable, well-timed, and never overbearing, nor do they get hammered in and outstay their welcome as if viewers are too stupid to “get it” otherwise (that last issue is a particular pet peeve of mine, so well played, AtoZ).“Don’t stand on the chair!” will go down as a favourite of mine with the context in which it was said.So, are these slice of life portions enough to save the show?Ehhhhhh…Like I said, they may be the more decent parts, but I wouldn’t call them exceptional. The show’s one real strength – its comedy – is sorely underutilized, and about a third of the show still consists mainly of poorly-written and almost entirely failed attempts at drama, action and suspense, so by the time it finally gets comfortable, its integrity is already compromised.Still, passable is passable, and the show deserves some credit for managing to recover from its extended weak beginnings, albeit having to do so with near-complete abandonment of its original direction. By the end, it just barely manages to find itself, but the two halves and even ideas within each half are a bit disconnected. As for convincing reasons to recommend it, or strong justification for its existence, I’m a bit iffy on both accounts. This is one of those cases where I think the show genuinely improves over its runtime, and the show’s last few episodes were easily its strongest; it just does so by so frequently changing face that it often struggles to have a real face at all. It never quite reaches the point where I’m comfortable saying, “Yes, this is worth watching!” Your mileage may vary.First half: 4/10 – Second half: 6/10 – Overall: 5/10A large enough portion of Alice to Zouroku’s runtime is spent on its functional fantasy-slice of life antics that there is still some value in the final product, despite it having very weak dramatic writing in the first half. That said, the product as a whole is decidedly lacking in focus and cohesion, ultimately resembling a haphazard hodgepodge of theoretically workable ideas, forced into an oddly-shaped blender that couldn’t properly handle them all. When the resulting pulp gives off a murky, unremarkable appearance, fails to acquire any consistent standout elements, and clutters up what could have been its main draw, I have to question what it really offers over many other series in any of its veins. Zouroku seems to face a bit of an existential crisis. The issue here is twofold: one pertaining to its focus as a whole - in other words, what it is - and the other to its appeal or value to viewers; its purpose for existing in the first place.Genre-wise, AtoZ mainly functions in two sharply-contrasting halves.

Rain falling down heavily. A small girl in a hospital gown suddenly appears on a camera, just to disappear in a matter of milliseconds after a mysterious object pops up above her head. A group of people desperately try to spot the escapee on one of the monitors. Finally, she stops, feeling tired and almost defeated she continues to move.She has been found.A woman catches up to her, riding on a giant hand coming from the sky. The little girl falls over. She is approached by the woman.Sudden slice from the right. A new user has...appeared. Fight occurs. The little girl escapes into an unknown world, or at least unknown to her.Enter Zouroku: an old, experiences yet grumpy owner of a flower shop. As he walks into a shop, like every other day, and there he notices a child grabbing food that she didn\'t pay for. He lectures her, after which she offers him a free wish if he helps her.... Bam! She\'s gone, nowhere to be seen. Filled with disbelief, he continues with his normal life. As he enters his car, he spots the same girl asking him for the same thing again. And then a giant wrecking ball appears.Zouroku tries to escape but he can\'t. The child lifts up the car and they begin to drive away. Two other little girls start going after them. A chase commences. A bunch of insane, incomprehensible stuff happens and when all calms down, this one, grumpy old man grabs those magical children and tells them to stop causing havoc. They disperse, except for the girl who was with him before.Upon hearing her out Zouroku decides to let her live with him, taken by pity and pure compassion for a broken, hurt child, he takes her in, despite seeing what she brings. And so begins a tale of magic, both figuratively and literally.*Slight spoilers included*1. The magic of youth and the youth of magicThe premise of Alice to Zouroku is something that should work perfectly in concept. Think about this for a second: What is magic to you? If I\'d ask this of you, I would most likely get those two responses the most:a) A fictional, fantastical power that allows the user to do tricks beyond human comprehension, often performed by street artists through the usage of trickery and illusionsb) A feeling of wonder and amazement, something you\'d never believe unless you\'ve seen it with your own eyes, for example, ""this wedding is magical""Let\'s delve a bit deeper into the second one, shall we?Now, I don\'t know about you, but I always considered my childhood to be the most magical part of my life. During my younger years all I wanted to do is explore, learn and see new things, every time I saw something amazing I could feel that exact feeling of magic. My first day at school? Magical. First time I saw anime? Absolutely magical. First time I played video games on my own computer? Filled with the essence of what the ""magical"" feeling is. I could go on and on, name my firsts and whatnot. The point is: Childhood is magical. And so is this show.Sana, the little girl with magic abilities and the main heroine, encapsulates both the magic that you can only see in fiction and the feeling of magic every human has felt before. She\'s not actually human though, she\'s just a being in a form of a child, however she acts as human, thinks as human, learns as human and feels as a human would. Every time she sees something or learns a new word she asks about it, she\'s always curious, energetic, ready for new things. Raised in a cut-off, dark place where she had no access to the outside world, each discovery shapes her way of seeing reality. First thing she gets to experience is the cold, hard rain when she attempts to escape. She asks ""is this how the outside is like?"". Her first impressions are clearly negative, but she gets to discover normal human things with Zouroku and his granddaughter, ranging from love, to a hot bath, to the meaning of the word ""mom"". Seeing her learn those things, act like a child really reminds me of that little scrub that I was. It\'s magical. Combine that with the ability she possesses though, and you got an explosive combination.Sana can do anything. Unlike other people with a similar ability, she has no constraints on her ability other than her vital energy which depletes whenever she uses it. She can summon things into the place she\'s in or teleport at will, so pretty much whatever she can wants to becomes reality. The things is, she doesn\'t know what exactly she wants most of the time. Her knowledge on human world is limited. For example, when she teleports, she rarely specifies the exact place, it\'s more like ""take me away from here"" or ""take me as far away as possible"", which results in her landing in places like the South Pole and being surrounded by penguins. Sometimes it leads to her riding a rocket. Sometimes it ends with her summoning a bunch of pigs. The list goes on.As such, this show tackles the idea of giving immense, nearly limitless power to a being with the mentality of a child. Even the adults with that power have something of a child in them, one of them created her power by watching a TV show and the other is overly selfish and ambitious. This topic sounds pretty interesting, doesn\'t it? Well, it is presented in a pretty peculiar way though.2. Gray area, or the lack of thereofAlice to Zouroku presents two different sides in the initial conflict. One of them are the people over at the institute that initially kept Sana and other children trapped in order to use her as an endless energy source. They are ruthless, don\'t consider Sana to be a human and will proceed to injure and abuse her, all just so they can keep her in the lab. The other side is a secret agency who tries to find the institute and rescue the children inside. They believe that even if Sana isn\'t human, she can still in a normal society, just like all the other users of ""Alice\'s Dream"" no matter what ability they possess.Obviously, if there\'s a way to include those people into society, they should have the right to do so. That\'s out of question, and the show clearly agrees with this by portraying the latter side as ""the good guys"", and the first as ""the bad guys"".Wait.Yes, what I\'m saying is that despite such a big potential for a multidimensional conflict with numerous layers and possibilities for convincing the viewer towards both sides, this show doesn\'t try to do any of that. There\'s only black and white, no gray, and it directly tells you which is which. There\'s pretty much no justification for what the ""evil people"" are doing, they\'re just greedy and want to create an infinite free energy source, and while this could be framed as something of an ideal, like it\'s an attempt at helping entire humanity survive or something similar, it\'s just that simple. Every person from that institute is evil, they have evil, selfish intentions that could be fixed by ""the good guys"" if they gave them a chance. There\'s no room for any thought, even if you can understand that some have their reasons, they\'re still wrong. It\'s a huge waste of potential for sure, there\'s no doubting that, but...If you were to look back at the previous segment of this review, you might be reminded that this show is, in fact, all about a child. And how do children see things? They see them as good or bad. That\'s it. They don\'t delve deeper into what goes into decision making and instead they simply choose based on what they think is right. If you think about it, it makes sense as to why it\'s presented this way, but that doesn\'t change the fact that there was some things that could be explored more, like other characters\' point of view on things. I\'m not talking about reasons behind their actions, those are touched upon here and there, but what I want is for this show to present some other opinions on the subject. It would be fine if this show was called ""Sana"" or ""Alice"", but it\'s called ""Alice and Zouroku"", and that old man should have more than enough to say about morality and such. Speaking of...3. Crooked stuff and why we hate itZouroku has a very interesting take on reality, on the outside, a very simple one, but definitely fitting for the show and how it\'s presented. His motto is ""I hate crooked stuff"". It matches his job ethics, as a florist he has to keep everything nice and organized, symmetrical and beautiful, but he applies this to his private life as well. The first time he got a chance to properly talk to Sana, and was offered a free wish, he refused, because he wanted to be on the same page as her rather than having some sort of an advantage above a child. He\'s a simple man, he has lived his life for far too long to put up with all this in all honesty. He only wishes for everything to have flow that he can follow. That doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t have a heart, as he takes Sana in, but it\'s because he genuinely wants to help this lost girl who lived a horrible life before meeting him.By saying all of this in episode one, this show introduces an idea into out head: Leave Sana alone, she has suffered enough, let her have a life, it\'s time for all of her mental pain to be repaid. Zouroku is supposed to be us, or at least tell us how to think. It\'s him that introduced this simple mindset. You\'re supposed to understand why something is crooked, but hate it because it\'s still crooked, perhaps want to fix it on your own. It\'s pretty simple, but at the same time rather subtle, I didn\'t even realize that this is why I missed how simple this show is for the longest of time.4. Fuzzy is a good feelingThanks to Zouroku with his strict attitude and Sanae and her genuine love towards her, Sana slowly begins to properly grow as a person. Somewhere towards the middle of the show she is finally able to create a mindset. You might think it\'s a bit too fast, but she is not really human and her learning abilities prove that she learns much faster than anyone else, but fails to understand words because, well, she\'s bad at understanding things. She invented a phrase for the feeling when she can\'t quite understand or comprehend a situation, it\'s called ""feeling fuzzy"" and she uses it constantly after the first major arc, she\'s unsure about a lot of things after all. Sana is unable to make decisions for herself, she needs others to do that for her. She wants to do things, but doesn\'t know how to go about doing them, that\'s why she\'s the happiest around Zouroku who thanks to his experience and the ability to spout harsh reality to everyone, helped her numerous times when she was in dire need and when she just craved for some small favors. Not only that, but she\'s still learning about the world, finding out about new words, understanding the basic principles of a daily life, finding out how to make friends and what other people mean to her, and most importantly, she finally starts to think about something in colors that aren\'t just black and white.Her first encounter with something bad after she properly settled down in Zouroku\'s house is another ability, another ""Alice\'s Dream"" that seems to have hurt her guardians Zouroku and Sanae. After living such a comfy lifestyle, she shows her weak side and fails to get a full grasp of what\'s going on. When she finds the person who\'s responsible for this, she immediately assumes she\'s a bad person, as she would normally. However, upon learning her story and her reasons for using that power, she starts to understand, which isn\'t something common for her. It pretty much completes her character as of now, at the point where the show ends, if it will ever continue it would require showcasing more moral problems or add something to her. As we stand now, the plot is technically incomplete, but the show itself pretty much is.5. Alice in WonderlandIf you\'ve ever indulged yourself in any form of art, then there\'s a really high chance that you have heard of a little book called ""Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"", or as we know it, simply ""Alice in Wonderland"". It\'s a pretty old novel that got adapted into many different mediums, there was an animated Disney movie, there were live action movies, there were many other works inspired by it. It undoubtedly had a huge influence on art, with such an inspiring and expressive world that the Wonderland was, with such amazing, memorable characters like The Mad Hatter and such an intriguing atmosphere it was doomed to become a classic sooner or later. Alice to Zouroku obviously takes away from that, but I think this is where it falls a bit short.First off, the name of the power itself is ""Alice\'s Dream"", second, the bad people call Sana by the name ""Red Queen"" and third, the place where she was born was named ""Wonderland"". As such, if you know the books, you can quickly get a grasp on what does it mean in one way or another. Sana is the ruler of Wonderland, she was a part of it long before she existed as a being called ""Sana"". Nickname ""Red Queen"", who ruled of Wonderland in the novel, seems fitting, but my problem with all of this is that it\'s so poorly explored that it hurts.Having one of the most legendary and probably one of the best settings as the inspiration of a show led to some amazing results before. Here, Wonderland is just a simple, green land with some simple images that Sana created. You can\'t even imagine my excitement when I heard that this world is not only going to be based on THE Wonderland, but it will also resemble the mind of an energetic child... but alas it was rather poor in content and mostly just full of randomness. Once again, this technically works, the world is incredibly random after all, but as a visual medium I would expect more, but all of this could probably be explained pretty easily.6. Technical stuffThis show looks pretty awful. It has its charm and it keeps close to the original art style, but in motion it all looks clunky and very underwhelming. The character designs work well on their own, but when they move they look very stiff, even in the action scenes. Combine that with the heavy usage of CGI in certain parts, most noticeably in the first episode, where there was an entire chase sequence made entirely using computer effects, alongside such errors as a background moving while the car the characters were in was, in fact, not. Simply put, it is ugly, unpolished and poor. The directing is basically on par, but it isn\'t exactly bad. There were a lot of solid shots, but there were quite a few places that weren\'t properly established, even Kashimura\'s house where most of the show takes place lacks in that department. With that being said, it\'s not that surprising that the Wonderland looks like it looks, the people who were responsible for the visuals seemed as if they lacked passion in the first place....The sound on the other hand is sincerely very good. You can hear the inspiration from it momentarily, each track has seems to have its own reference to ""Alice in Wonderland"". There are sparkly noises and upbeat, almost fantasy-like tunes being snuck into even the more modern sounding ones that were created for the fights or the scenes in the city. It tells a narrative on its own while keeping in touch with what\'s going on on the screen, which almost makes up for the low quality visuals. Almost.7. Personal ramblings AKA Serious Spoiler SectionI\'m pretty sure that the thing I like the most about this show is how it treats the idea of adoption and a single parent family. Technically, the lab that Sana was in was almost like an adoption house without the adoption part or the love part. People in there kept her alive, but they didn\'t care. Once she escapes, she is taken in by a caring father figure who is able to both keep her alive and safe and genuinely care for her. This became especially strong once Zouroku actually adopted Sana, the entire episode was focused on their everyday lives, with Sana blending into society despite her powers and the institute believing that she couldn\'t, almost like people not believing a child could get adopted, and with her finding things who she never even knew she needed to properly exist, just like a child that\'s up for adoption since birth. I might be reaching here, but the show does tackle the topic and does so quite nicely.Another thing that I found to be interesting and charming is Sana\'s voice actress, who despite being a somewhat of a fresh name on the market, truly nails the sense of wonder and curiosity. She can even get a bit annoying at times, like a child would, but not to the point where it seriously influences the show\'s quality.Now that we\'re done with the positives, I think the main problem I have here is that the show overall feels uninspired. I touched on this a bit when I mentioned the visuals, but it\'s not only that. The writing is solid and the themes are presented nicely, but there\'s a severe lack of direction with where it wants to go in terms of plot. It sort of misses itself in the middle, despite having some important moments. Don\'t get me wrong, I like the idea of an after story instead of prolonging one arc, but by doing so they had to add some parts of the characters we haven\'t seen before, creating confusion. Using timeskips usually ends up like this, because you can\'t tell if they developed it on their own or whether you missed something. There is a pretty clear reason for each storyline, but gluing them together seems to be the problem that really kept it from going anywhere other than just good. But I think being just good is fine, as long as people can build up on it. I surely got something out of this, I got to see more of some themes and developed a better understanding of them. Not only that but it was a good show on its own, so those things make it worth a watch, maybe not memorable initially but if I were ever to see a child character or another theme about what makes a human, this show would certainly come to mind.Also, some of you may be on the offense with me defending the show because ""it\'s about children so it makes sense that it\'s simple"" (I could even do that for the art style with how it looks like a child drew it) to which I say that you might as well be right, but I think if it can even work, then this show would be the one to make it work. Unfortunately it didn\'t quite hit the homerun, but it feels as if it paved a way for some other project for the same director or writer in the future. Simplicity should be used more, you would be surprised how well it works with most shows. Just don\'t mistake simplicity with mindlessness.8. OverallAlice & Zouroku is not really a peculiar show, nor is it the most intriguing or special one that I\'ve watched. Hell, even some of the more generic shows that aired the same season felt much cleaner than this did, but that shouldn\'t undervalue that things that it achieved. Creating a good main character who is also a child certainly wasn\'t the easiest task, making a plot that diversifies into territories outside of its own setting is commendable and its attempts at tackling its themes worked better than I imagined. The problem is, it feels as if this was always doomed to be some sort of a side project to J.C.Staff, from the animation that shows how tight they were on the schedule, to the rather poor creative vision with its setting designs, it all almost falls apart whenever it build on something. The fact remains though, this show constantly builds on something and just like Sana, it adapts as well as it can, at least I feel like it does with the way it was handled.So with that I\'d like to recommend it to everybody, maybe it\'ll miss your mark fairly soon, but I think it has a solid chance to grow if more people pick it up. Don\'t leave that cute, blonde girl hanging all alone on the cold, dimly lit street and pick it up to see what\'s this Werty guy is rambling about, and perhaps call him out for giving you false hope later. Who knows?As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own. appeared. Fight occurs.

Personal ramblings AKA Serious Spoiler SectionI\'m pretty sure that the thing I like the most about this show is how it treats the idea of adoption and a single parent family. Technically, the lab that Sana was in was almost like an adoption house without the adoption part or the love part. People in there kept her alive, but they didn\'t care. Once she escapes, she is taken in by a caring father figure who is able to both keep her alive and safe and genuinely care for her. This became especially strong once Zouroku actually adopted Sana, the entire episode was focused on their everyday lives, with Sana blending into society despite her powers and the institute believing that she couldn\'t, almost like people not believing a child could get adopted, and with her finding things who she never even knew she needed to properly exist, just like a child that\'s up for adoption since birth. I might be reaching here, but the show does tackle the topic and does so quite nicely.Another thing that I found to be interesting and charming is Sana\'s voice actress, who despite being a somewhat of a fresh name on the market, truly nails the sense of wonder and curiosity. She can even get a bit annoying at times, like a child would, but not to the point where it seriously influences the show\'s quality.Now that we\'re done with the positives, I think the main problem I have here is that the show overall feels uninspired. I touched on this a bit when I mentioned the visuals, but it\'s not only that. The writing is solid and the themes are presented nicely, but there\'s a severe lack of direction with where it wants to go in terms of plot. It sort of misses itself in the middle, despite having some important moments. Don\'t get me wrong, I like the idea of an after story instead of prolonging one arc, but by doing so they had to add some parts of the characters we haven\'t seen before, creating confusion. Using timeskips usually ends up like this, because you can\'t tell if they developed it on their own or whether you missed something. There is a pretty clear reason for each storyline, but gluing them together seems to be the problem that really kept it from going anywhere other than just good. But I think being just good is fine, as long as people can build up on it. I surely got something out of this, I got to see more of some themes and developed a better understanding of them. Not only that but it was a good show on its own, so those things make it worth a watch, maybe not memorable initially but if I were ever to see a child character or another theme about what makes a human, this show would certainly come to mind.Also, some of you may be on the offense with me defending the show because ""it\'s about children so it makes sense that it\'s simple"" (I could even do that for the art style with how it looks like a child drew it) to which I say that you might as well be right, but I think if it can even work, then this show would be the one to make it work. Unfortunately it didn\'t quite hit the homerun, but it feels as if it paved a way for some other project for the same director or writer in the future. Simplicity should be used more, you would be surprised how well it works with most shows. Just don\'t mistake simplicity with mindlessness.8. OverallAlice & Zouroku is not really a peculiar show, nor is it the most intriguing or special one that I\'ve watched. Hell, even some of the more generic shows that aired the same season felt much cleaner than this did, but that shouldn\'t undervalue that things that it achieved. Creating a good main character who is also a child certainly wasn\'t the easiest task, making a plot that diversifies into territories outside of its own setting is commendable and its attempts at tackling its themes worked better than I imagined. The problem is, it feels as if this was always doomed to be some sort of a side project to J.C.Staff, from the animation that shows how tight they were on the schedule, to the rather poor creative vision with its setting designs, it all almost falls apart whenever it build on something. The fact remains though, this show constantly builds on something and just like Sana, it adapts as well as it can, at least I feel like it does with the way it was handled.So with that I\'d like to recommend it to everybody, maybe it\'ll miss your mark fairly soon, but I think it has a solid chance to grow if more people pick it up. Don\'t leave that cute, blonde girl hanging all alone on the cold, dimly lit street and pick it up to see what\'s this Werty guy is rambling about, and perhaps call him out for giving you false hope later. Who knows?As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own.', 'In today’s world, we don’t have supernatural abilities. Imagine if we did though…the things we can make history from, the tasks we can accomplish, or change the world altogether. Sure, we have technology but that’s nothing compared to powers that can make anything out of nothing. In the world of Alice to Zouroku, that’s another story. It’s a story where supernatural abilities exist and it all begins one day when we meet the girl named Sana Kashimura.Based on the manga of the same name, Alice to Zouroku takes an interesting approach at modern fantasy. The first episode shows Sana escaping from a facility and eventually,...she encounters Zouroku, a florist with a seemingly mysterious past. We quickly learn that Sana is far from ordinary as she is able to materialize objects out of thin air and perform inhuman feats. The story evolves from here as we learn more about Sana and how she adapts with her new life.Confession time. A show like this can set off some red flags. I have to admit, the first few episodes could really be a make or break for fans. It’s easily noticeable that the show bounces between supernatural thriller to slice of life drama. This could be a bit distracting at times and even annoying for fans who is interested in a specific genre. In the meantime, Sana is a character that is inevitably the main focus of the show. In terms of character relationships, the most dynamic one is between her and Zouroku. Their relationship feels like daughter and father although it starts off rocky at first. Zouroku wants to get rid of her after realizing that her power can cause havoc in his life. However as time passes, he grows to accept her and even care about Sana’s well-being. It’s also important to note that Zouroku teaches valuable lessons to Sana about being taking responsibility for using her powers and not always be reliant on them. In respect, Sana undergoes changes (both physically and mentally) and even becomes fiercely protective of Zouroku. She also begins to make friends and through them, she understands the world better.When I began watching this show, I often wonder how Sana can make friends with such a powerful ability. Also known as the Alice’s Dream, it’s an ability that she can use to materialize anything by imagination. This god-like power has potential to change the world.  What’s interesting is that Sana still displays the characteristics like a normal girl. She is normal enough to make friends, learn about everyday life, and like most kids, she is very curious about things around her. This extends to where she goes, the people she meets, and how she responds to them. A good portion of this show makes me realize that Sana is very relatable to any kids of her age. It’s through her personality that she is able to make friends with others including former enemies like Hinagiri siblings. At the same time, she is also protective of others that she cares about. When powerful individuals show up later in the show, we can see how Sana expresses her anger when characters like Zouroku and Sanae are put in danger. They are like family to her and she is eager to protect them at all cost.When it comes to visuals, Alice to Zouroku excels at making its modern setting feel real. Whenever fantasy elements are present, the show is able to draw attention to them with impressive aesthetics. However, I do have a mixed feeling about the character designs. It’s not necessary unwatchable but not visually impressive especially with characters like Zouroku who looks just like a plain old man. Furthermore, some of the CGI in early episodes can be very distracting. On the other hand, the producers did a wonderful job at choreography with high tense action sequences. The animation during those scenes are also very clean and showcases character abilities to their fullest. Similarly, I also find the theme songs likable as it has the fantasy feel with its colorfulness.When it comes to soundtrack, this show offers a variety that ranges from intense fighting music, eerie suspense OST, to very lighthearted beats. In the meantime, I am most impressed by the character voice acting of Sana as it’s not always easy to take the role of a child. Beyond that, the show’s music will also draw a mystery feel in later episodes as it will give the impression that the series may be darker than it seems.Director Katsushi Sakurabi is no stranger to series with supernatural abilities. Having being involved in previous projects such as Flying Witch and Lostrange Incited WIXOSS, some of his talent is recognizable from this series. Alice to Zouroku blends a variety of genres together to bring a modern fantasy story. With a colorful cast of characters that draws peculiar mystique, I can safely recommend Alice to Zouroku to just about anyone. she encounters Zouroku, a florist with a seemingly mysterious past.

The idea of young girls with special abilities being experimented on inside of an institute has been used over and over in anime. One such example is Elfen Lied. Despite this cliché, one of the more attractive elements of the series is the main male lead, Zouroku. He is an elderly and brusque man with a strong independency. Despite his perhaps slightly misleading personality, he is a florist. Zouroku has a very good reputation - so much so that even the yakuza pay for his services.The relationship between Sana,...the lead character, and Zouroku is one that reminds us of a grandfather-granddaughter relationship, which seems perfect for two of them. I believe that Zouroku's unique strength of character will be a huge factor in the enjoyment and hype of this series. His strength lies more within his heart and ideals than his mind or body. I personally found myself wanting to know more about Zouroku than any of the other characters. I think it'll also be interesting to discover how he handles situations in future episodes.Another aspect of the series that is very important to me is the character development. Wih what has been released so far, it has already shown very realistic and well-done character development. They show it from the way they move to the way they interact to what they say. This is a major part of enjoying anime for me, and I think the character development by the end of the series will have been amazing.The characters and the story seem pretty good, and the voice acting works very well. Also, the music for this anime is very well done (background music, OP, ED etc.) One of the biggest problems I've had with this anime is the animation in episode 1. There are plenty of anime that use CGI. There are even some (such as Seikaisuru Kado) that are made almost entirely with CGI. While the normal animation of the series is okay, the CGI sequences, such as rhe chase scene in episode 1, seem a little clunky and rushed. I was a bit disappointed. I also personally didn't like the animation of the characters' eyes during episode 1, but that aspect quickly grew on me.Although the characters and story are good, and it begins with a great setup, the first episode wasn't as enjoyable as it should've been. It was more average than good. It was definitely enjoyable, but I feel as if it somehow could've been done better. After watching the next few episodes, my opinion changed to a more positive one. However, the first episode does give us a good introduction to the characters and the sides fighting, provides us with a backstory and a feeling of sympathy for the main character, and also demonstrates why this ability of hers is so feared. Their personalities also come through well.

The old man, Zouroku is just an ordinary old man who could somehow, adapt to...situations very quickly. As the story goes, Sana would of course get her pursuers from the place where she escaped from. Sana is just a kid, the pursuers are also just a kid, so Zouroku here did the very obvious thing as an adult, totally ignoring the special powers and the fact that he is injured himself, he scolded both Sana and the pursuers, hitting them all in the head.There would of course be more problems in the future, Sana getting scolded more, more conflicts, the struggle of life, but the first half mostly focuses on Sana learning important things, socialize, and getting to like Zouroku. the way they bond is just cute and heartwarming, there are of course hardships in the way, but learning how to overcome it together, and most of all, realizing that you are not unwanted and not alone, might be one of the strongest part of this anime, you might shed a few tears, but those are worth it.ArtThe art is very cute, not really that much detailed, and also bright, not literally. The art is pleasant to see, and easy to like, but nothing too spectacular after that.SoundThe sound might have been one of the strongest part that made me love this anime, both the OP and ED blends with the anime easily, and the OST itself is very strong, especially with the bonding, heartwarming, and tearjerking part, they are beautiful and enhanced the atmosphere greatly, the voice actors did great too.CharacterSana\'s character development is the main focus of the first half of this anime, clueless to begin with, she did everything which deserved a scolding from Zouroku, but scolding\'s not the only thing she received, as the story goes, Sana began to depend on Zouroku a lot more, absorbing every knowledge Zouroku gives to Sana, learning to apologize where she did wrong, learning to not overuse her powers, and a lot of the basics of life.Zouroku of course, did his part as the one who decided to take her in, he taught her to not depend too much on her powers and started to do things with her own body because at the moment, her body is just too weak and frail. I personally like Zouroku a lot, he\'s very brave, and he doesn\'t care if it\'s a villain or another living being, he\'ll scold the hell out of it and make things right.There are other characters, but they lack development because of the short anime length, this show could\'ve done more if it went to 24 episode, but sadly, it is only 12 episodes long.EnjoymentThis might not have been the best anime ever, it lacked episodes, some other characters desperately needed screen times, and the second part of the anime is not as good as the first one, i really enjoyed this anime because i\'m a sucker for heartwarming things and bondings, especially the beautiful music in the background, but i can imagine other people not enjoying this as much as i did, because the anime has it\'s flaws, and it\'s not easily fixed.OverallI personally gave this show a 9/10, while 6-7 is probably the most right choice for this anime, i just couldn\'t bring myself to give the anime that score, i went with 9 in the end after giving it a deep thought, while some part of the anime is dark, i think it\'s still a good anime to recommend to a lot of people, that\'s it for my review, thank you for reading. situations very quickly.

Ok, back to it), then he meets Sana and says ""I don\'t give a shit."" Walks away without a thought of going back. She stalks him around until he finally gives in and decides to take her in. It was very eye opening to watch over these characters, how a event they run into would turn out, and what would happen to the lives of the people involved and most importantly including Sana.

What the hell? That doesn\'t make any sense, are you saying the government weren\'t aware? Or is it something else that is confusing to understand?. I think the Author of the series thought it would be funny to replace a exciting series into a dumb, stupid slice of life comedy. ""What the hell? If that\'s all it\'s going to be about then I\'ll be on my way."" Ok, let me explain why I give this a 6 and how it was ok to watch. They show these little plot stories that progresses Alice\'s lessons about life of the outside world, it gives an explanation of some the characters you hardly knew, and you want to know about what Alice does with the power she has.I never got what her power does still, she makes things appear how she wants, she performs supernatural abilities, she teleports, and there is probably more that I\'m missing because her power is the most confusing ability I\'ve ever seen. The rest of the group have powers you get the gist of in 1 minute. Hers is, ""I\'m going to make a giant pancake out of nothing!""Characters: Most of these characters I\'m going to forget over a month.Sana: A child who doesn\'t know how to control her powers.Zouroku: A Grumpy Florist Old Fart who gives a shit and hates Crooked Stuff.Sanea: A air headed boring girl who doesn\'t do anything but lives with her grandfather.Shizuku: She has superpowered equipment.Other Characters: Watch the anime, I\'m not going keep explain all of them in one sentence.Animation: No, this animation isn\'t special, don\'t expect an anime to be perfect if it\'s referencing Alice and Wonderland. Sometimes it runs halfway like a watchable project, then it runs like a 100 episodic series. It has it\'s flaws I\'ve seen that isn\'t suppose to happen. It\'s art style does quite fit with the theme it gives, it\'s childish, its happy, and it\'s clean.Conclusion: This anime is a comparison to Usagi Drop, except it doesn\'t give much interest about the characters because it lays out a simple plan to make one character to be very simple to understand and not try do anything about it. Why did I enjoy this Anime as a 6? It has the atmosphere that you can get into that has a boring ass plot you\'ve seen abunch of times, it\'s not something you get your hopes up for, but you wouldn\'t mind watching it.The Anime gets a 6/10, no demons involved, sorry morons. touch of art style).---This Review will contain SPOILERS, it\'s not that I want to spoil it because it is required to be described what happens.---Plot: Wow!

They show these little plot stories that progresses Alice\'s lessons about life of the outside world, it gives an explanation of some the characters you hardly knew, and you want to know about what Alice does with the power she has.I never got what her power does still, she makes things appear how she wants, she performs supernatural abilities, she teleports, and there is probably more that I\'m missing because her power is the most confusing ability I\'ve ever seen. The rest of the group have powers you get the gist of in 1 minute. Hers is, ""I\'m going to make a giant pancake out of nothing!""Characters: Most of these characters I\'m going to forget over a month.Sana: A child who doesn\'t know how to control her powers.Zouroku: A Grumpy Florist Old Fart who gives a shit and hates Crooked Stuff.Sanea: A air headed boring girl who doesn\'t do anything but lives with her grandfather.Shizuku: She has superpowered equipment.Other Characters: Watch the anime, I\'m not going keep explain all of them in one sentence.Animation: No, this animation isn\'t special, don\'t expect an anime to be perfect if it\'s referencing Alice and Wonderland. Sometimes it runs halfway like a watchable project, then it runs like a 100 episodic series. It has it\'s flaws I\'ve seen that isn\'t suppose to happen. It\'s art style does quite fit with the theme it gives, it\'s childish, its happy, and it\'s clean.Conclusion: This anime is a comparison to Usagi Drop, except it doesn\'t give much interest about the characters because it lays out a simple plan to make one character to be very simple to understand and not try do anything about it. Why did I enjoy this Anime as a 6? It has the atmosphere that you can get into that has a boring ass plot you\'ve seen abunch of times, it\'s not something you get your hopes up for, but you wouldn\'t mind watching it.The Anime gets a 6/10, no demons involved, sorry morons.', ""I enjoyed this one, a facinating series about people with powers, it has some great action moments, followed by some wonderful just family moments.   I liked it.Story:   It's cute, it comes off as more action packed at the start, but as it progresses it becomes more about just family and these kids with powers.Art:    The art is nice, especially later on, I can't say much without spoiling, but I liked how creative it got in the last few episodes.Characters:  I think this is where it shines, it has a nice cast, each with their own personalities, a...bit of drama that worked, and some hard moments dealing with things that just worked for me.Enjoyment and overall:   I liked it, I would recommend it, I say if you want, give it a shot. bit of drama that worked, and some hard moments dealing with things that just worked for me.Enjoyment and overall:   I liked it, I would recommend it, I say if you want, give it a shot."", ""Starting up Reviews again: my 15th - Alice to ZourokuWhen I started watching this series I didn't really know what to expect however the more episodes that came out the more I started to enjoy this series. I loved the powers and the whole story of what happens to the people with powers however it lacked a lot of detail.The plot of this show...there wasn't really a solid plot, was more of a semi-slice of life anime of a girls everyday life with a new family...with the exception that she just has powers! I couldn't really find a solid plot at all however it...still was a good anime at the end and I still had a lot of enjoyment watching this series. I suppose you could say that there was two plots to this anime: the first focusing on Sana and what she has to do in order to get away from her past and become who she wants to be and the second being of the 'witch'. The second Plot is more of this 'Witch' finding herself when she has gotten lost and Sana comes into play and tries to 'save' this witch from herself.What about the characters? I actually really enjoyed a lot of these characters, they all had unique details of one another and you could see the different personalities of each. I loved the last few episodes when the 'witch' and her friend arrived as it sort of shown more different types of characters within the anime. Sana is the main Protagonist and you can see her development the most as she really has nothing at the beginning, she knows hardly anything however as the story progresses she develops 'oneself' and shows us more of who she is becoming.The Animation of this anime was unique and I actually liked it, it was nice and colourful in parts and it wasn't too in your face. Was a nice smooth animation that sort of blended together in frames. The sound was also lovely and very nice throughout the series, it put you on edge when there was something happening and it also calmed you in the nice slow scenes which gave you more feeling throughout.I really liked this series and would enjoy a second season. I really enjoyed watching this and I loved the different types of characters that was displayed throughout. I really did enjoy the different crazy plots that did come up with what Sana kept doing with her powers. My favourite part was near the end with the 'witch' plot where it shown the anime in a new 'dark-themed' way with what some characters had to go through.Would recommend this to people that prefer Slice of Life as it is really just a Slice of Life with the added Powers. Would definitely watch this series again.   A lot of the characters can become liked and the story itself can still be good with what happens towards the end of the series.~ Canaan still was a good anime at the end and I still had a lot of enjoyment watching this series.

It\'s one of the rare animes that fill your heart with warmth , comedy and magic . When you\'ve watched  many animes, your longing for something special.Something that has a new vibe. It reminds me of Jinrui wa suita Shimashita X Usagi Drop X Gakuen Alice but a good original anime on its own. Just watch it. Damn, seeing this anime wrongly valued(with its reviews) as its really is make me sad.(may contain spoilers)The Story:The story was great though it had more potential. They could have executed it better. Showing Sana\'s every day life....It could have been more gratifying.  The flow was disoriented and it felt like it was rushing its end. It lacked of familial , friendship and school scenes. It\'s inclinement after inclinement.How I wish it was the nichijouísh kind of anime. More of like Kobayashi-san chi no maid dragon.(The end was very annoying and infuriating. Showing the old Sana thanking Zouroku. How much lazy can you get?!  I mean you would love to see her grow right? But most of animes leave us with ""hey,just use your imagination"" or ""happy now? we have the ending:nomoreseason2"".)Art:The art is good.As far as I can tell it deviated so much to my expectance of the art(the story should have been more heartwarming as its art). Well, just wait to see the wonderland.The characters:I did not find it to have corny lines as most of feels anime would have. Maybe because of the story and the character development. The lines were so natural and was connected to each other making the characters feel a little bit real.As for example how Zouroku replies to Sana when they have a conversation.Or how Sana throws her tantrums.It amplified the characters cuteness, and its heartwarming concept of home.(though it would have been better if they focused on the homey concept)Sound:Two words. ""Original:Nostalgia""Enjoyment:Just fuckin\'watch it. Its really fun.Overall:Well though it had many downs,but I will be keeping this close in my heart and treasure it as one of the few animes that really made me feel frazzzled.

There are government agents and other kids with powers that variously intervene and propel along a larger story, but the plot structuring is loose, and the tone often shifts to warm slice of life character moments without any overt foreshadowing.It comes off feeling both well-rounded and unpredictable: a consistent pleasure to watch.', 'Alice to Zouroku finished airing after 12 episodes each being 23 minutes long,( apart from the first episode which is around 40 minutes long) but if you deduct the opening and ending there would only be around 21/20 minutes of the actual show. The show was created by Tetsuya Imai and came from J.C Staff studio. In this review, I will make a fair judgment on the show considering the series loyalty to its genre\'s and my personal opinion on the quality of the show.Firstly let\'s revise the genre\'s that the show relates itself to; Adventure, Mystery, Seinen.Adventure~ It is undeniable that this show...contains traces of the Adventure genre in its plot. The adventures are related to the main character \'Alice\' other known as Sana. She runs away from a research facility and finds herself in a strange world with no knowledge of her surroundings. While wandering from place to place she meets Kashimura, Zouroku an elderly florist with a grumpy but honorable attitude. Sana finds herself in a constant adventure as she learns how to live like a normal girl without using her powers to complete simple everyday tasks. But although the show could be tied to the genre of adventure throughout the entire season, it is undeniable that the real adventure only started from episode 9-12 (in order to avoid spoilers I will not mention much about why in my opinion the real adventure only happens at the climax of the show)Mystery~ Personally I don\'t see this show as a mystery whatsoever. This show is pretty straightforward and the biggest ""Mystery"" of the show was in the 1/2 episode where Zouroku\'s occupation was being revealed. If you look at the official poster for the show you can clearly see that the show will have something to do with flowers so it\'s not a mystery that Zouroku is a florist. So, in my opinion, this genre is not fitting for this show and could mislead people who are searching for a mysterious anime.Seinen~ For those unfamiliar with this term it means a genre that is aimed primarily at the male, college-aged/young adult. Seinen anime and manga tend to be a little bit more mature than it\'s counterpart, Shounen, which is aimed at younger boys. I personally find this genre to be the most misleading and misplaced in this shows description. Maybe this was a mistake on the publishers part for adding this genre into a show which is more so aimed at the young female audience with child-like problems and cutesy themes.All in all the show gets a 1/3 genre accuracy on its genre choosing which in my opinion is dishonest and unfair towards its viewers.Next, I will give my ratings for Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, and Overall.Story~ The story itself gets a 4/10 since it isn\'t anything new in the anime industry and it wasn\'t shown in a new light. this shows highlights consist of the cuteness of the characters. The story is fairly decent since it revolves around Sana getting used to the world outside of Wonderland but in my opinion, the show had a slow paste and most of the content was unnecessary and could have been made more interesting if there was more going on in each episode. therefore a 4/10 seems like a fair rating in my opinion since the story was not clear and not as enjoyable as initially we are led to believe.Art~ 5/10, The art in Alice to Zouroku is quite pleasant but not anything spectacular. The art was very simple and followed a very cute pattern with most of the characters having pretty similar facial shapes and features. In the first episodes, the art gets messy and becomes an eyesore when Zouroko and Sana are escaping the twins Hinagiri, Asahi and Hinagiri, Yonaga who came from the same research facility and happened to be Sana\'s first and only friends at the time. In my opinion, 5/10 is a fair rating for this show being that its highlights consisted of scenes from Wonderland which were rare until the last few episodes.Sound: 5/10. The sound in the show was pleasant also. The opening ""Wonder Drive (ワンダードライブ)"" by ORESAMA was very catchy and colorful which got me hyped for the episode to begin and the ending ""Chant (kotringo edition)"" by toi toy toi was pretty decent also. The voice acting was fair but I found Sana\'s voice to be a little irritating at times. Most characters have nice voice actors but I can\'t bring myself to give the show too much praise for its sound due to personally not being impressed with the sound.Character~ 4/10. Most characters were pretty unimpressive and most not getting much screentime even though they showed potential as interesting characters such as Ichijou, Shizuku. Zouroku himself, although the main character, does not get much screentime and not a lot of him is ever revealed. The only character development which was shown to us is between Sana and Ha-chan as she is referred to by her friend. Sana\'s backstory was pretty quickly revised but I wouldn\'t say that it wasn\'t clear. Ha-chan\'s story was told at the ending with the problems she was having and the truth behind why she seemed so depressed throughout her screentime. apart from these two only one other character was given a solid backstory Tachibana, Miriam C which for the sake of keeping her backstory more effective I will not disclose in this review.Enjoyment~ My enjoyment of the show comes down to 4/10 due to not being impressed with the show and not really looking forward to each episode as much as I would for other shows. the show was not outstanding with its plot or characters and personally, I just enjoyed the opening and the relationship between Sana and Zouroku.My overall score for Alice to Zouroko is 5/10 since it wasn\'t complete garbage but it was far from a masterpiece. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if the characters were more relatable and if the plot was a little more gripping and explored more. I wouldn\'t discourage anyone from watching this show and I understand that many may enjoy it and I am in no way bashing your opinion. This anime is not for everyone and that is all you should keep in mind. This series would be a nice watch when you have spare time on your hands that you wouldn\'t mind spending on this show. I cannot say anything else about this show since I personally won\'t be rewatching it ever again but I wouldn\'t say regret watching it.That concludes my review for Alice to Zouroku which finished airing Jun 25, 2017 contains traces of the Adventure genre in its plot.

This is a simple show about Sana Kashimura and her experiences with other people and the world around her. Yes, there is some of the story dedicated to other characters and the powers they have, but it all revolves around Sana. It's cute, it's beautiful, it's entertaining, and I find it highly enjoyable. JC Staff tried making a good anime this time and you can tell from the animation and beautiful detailed artwork. It's much better than their previous works such as Little Busters!Just watch the show if you want to get a feel for...it. I love it, others hate it. It's a nice show and it's easy to follow. Zouroko is funny and Sana is extremely adorable--their relationship is funny and interesting, if a bit predictable. it. I love it, others hate it. It's a nice show and it's easy to follow. Zouroko is funny and Sana is extremely adorable--their relationship is funny and interesting, if a bit predictable."", '‘Alice and Zouroku’ is the latest of a flurry of recent Seinen series about cute children and adoptive parent figures bonding, in the vein of ‘Usagi Drop’, ‘Barakamon’, and ‘Puco’s Udon World’. Except for the fact that it takes more of a Fantasy route.The story involves our main character, Sana, a girl with an ability known as Alice’s Dream; which allows her to materialize anything that she imagines. This ability has kept her and other children with the ability locked inside a government facility until the day that she escapes. From there, she meets an old florist named Zouroku, who agrees to take her in...and keep her safe from the government trying to find her.The reason the series is called ‘Alice and Zouroku’ despite the main character’s name being Sana is because the story makes use of a lot of allusions to ‘Alice in Wonderland’, certain characters are made as clear reflections of characters from the Lewis Caroll novel, and the premise, as we learn later on, is intended as a sort of subversion to the novel, with our main character’s development being how she goes away from the representation of Wonderland, and finds excitement in ordinary life, from which it is able to mould a ‘Coming of Age’ tale similar to Caroll’s book whilst also cleverly subverting it.Combining elements of Slice of Life and Fantasy can be a tricky thing, one that could result in the series feeling trapped in an identity crisis. Thankfully, the series is mindful of when to properly use its genre components. The Slice of Life area of the series is where it shines the brightest. The chemistry between our two main characters is a particular delight to watch. Sana, being the young and optimistic (despite her experiences) child dominated by an intensive curiosity for the world around her works well as a comic foil with Zouroku’s gruff, grumpy old man persona. In Sana’s case, her powers offer an unlimited range of comic relief sections which help to make for a nice shake away from the mundane nature of most SOL series. The development between the two is also delightful, as they both learn from each other, Sana reigniting Zouroku’s softer side, while Zouroku helps to teach Sana how to adapt to the new world around her. I also enjoy how despite the story containing some hinted darker elements, they never tried to make that into the focus of the series.Most of the supporting characters are there to provide either extra Comic relief or lengthy exposition. Zourokus granddaughter Sanae, who takes an instant liking to Sana is cute if a bit naïve. I read that some people found her character annoying but I never did mind her. From the facility are two other Alice’s Dream weavers, twins named Hinagiri, Yonaga and Asahi, or as I like to call them, Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dere, they don’t really do a lot apart from try to capture Sana early on in the series before going through a background development. We also get Naito and Ichijo, two government agents Zouroku gets to help him. Despite often being used as subjects for exposition, they do provide for some entertaining moments, and even make you think a spin-off starring the two of them wouldn’t be a bad idea. Later in the series, we also get introduced to Hatori, a depressed young girl who discovers that she has those powers as well, providing the conflict for the final arc which I won’t get into for spoilers, but her story is still quite gripping, providing the best part of the series.The fantasy elements of the series permeate through its production. The Soundtrack attains a nice ambience to it. The OP and ED are also relaxing as hell. Even though none of it is particularly memorable, it does still manage to achieve what it sets out to do. The animation looks fine for the most part. At first, I wasn’t too sure about the blocky, cartoonish character designs in what at first seemed to be a dark series, but as the series settled into its tone and decided what it wanted to be, the more the character designs seemed to fit. Being a fantasy series, it should only be natural that the animation is used to make a wondrous visual display. This is certainly true when we see Alice’s Dream in action, and later on when we see the surreal environment of the representation of Wonderland, we see the series’ strengths really come into play with a myriad of animation styles keeping the environments visually interesting. The first episode did feature some terrible CGI which was so unpleasant to look at that I almost considered dropping the series there, but I kept with the series and I’m glad I did.So, with so many positives weighing in favour of the series, ‘Alice to Zouroku’ is one of the best shows the year, right? Well, unfortunately there is a major setback the series has going against it. As I said before the series works best when it embraces its slice of life elements. Additionally, the last arc focusing on Hatori displays the series’ ability to also weave its more fantastical elements to create a dazzling visual treat. I haven’t so far however mentioned the early-middle portion of the series, because that is where the series was at its weakest for me.The storyline of Sana trying to hide from the government feels too much like ‘Elfen Lied’ for my taste, and it largely consists of action setpieces involving the character’s powers. These aren’t as exciting as the series seems to think they are, mainly because the unlimited nature of their powers takes away a lot of the suspense. It is my belief that action scenes should have some sort of limitation for the protagonist to overcome, and while a character who can create anything in a fight may sound exciting, it ultimately just feels like a cavalcade of randomness which feels severely lacking in tension. This portion of the story also carries a debate about whether the Alice’s Dream weavers can integrate into human society, but this theme was already examined a lot better in the quieter moments when we actually saw Sana interacting with the ordinary world instead of relying on dull exposition to make us think this.Not to mention, the arc goes on for a lot longer than it needs to, thanks in large part to these action scenes, which unfortunately takes a lot of the series’ runtime away from the more enjoyable moments. I was relieved when the arc finally did end, and the series got back to focusing on Sana and Zouroku’s everyday misadventures, as well as that final arc which really does accentuate the series’ highest qualities.With all that said, ‘Alice and Zouroku’ is still at least worth a watch if you have nothing better to do, or if you’re looking for an alternative Magical Girl series/Slice of Life. Although it could have reached higher heights, I am still ultimately glad that I checked it out, and that is perhaps one of the nicest comments you can give a series. and keep her safe from the government trying to find her.The reason the series is called ‘Alice and Zouroku’ despite the main character’s name being Sana is because the story makes use of a lot of allusions to ‘Alice in Wonderland’, certain characters are made as clear reflections of characters from the Lewis Caroll novel, and the premise, as we learn later on, is intended as a sort of subversion to the novel, with our main character’s development being how she goes away from the representation of Wonderland, and finds excitement in ordinary life, from which it is able to mould a ‘Coming of Age’ tale similar to Caroll’s book whilst also cleverly subverting it.Combining elements of Slice of Life and Fantasy can be a tricky thing, one that could result in the series feeling trapped in an identity crisis.

At first, I wasn’t too sure about the blocky, cartoonish character designs in what at first seemed to be a dark series, but as the series settled into its tone and decided what it wanted to be, the more the character designs seemed to fit. Being a fantasy series, it should only be natural that the animation is used to make a wondrous visual display. This is certainly true when we see Alice’s Dream in action, and later on when we see the surreal environment of the representation of Wonderland, we see the series’ strengths really come into play with a myriad of animation styles keeping the environments visually interesting. The first episode did feature some terrible CGI which was so unpleasant to look at that I almost considered dropping the series there, but I kept with the series and I’m glad I did.So, with so many positives weighing in favour of the series, ‘Alice to Zouroku’ is one of the best shows the year, right? Well, unfortunately there is a major setback the series has going against it. As I said before the series works best when it embraces its slice of life elements. Additionally, the last arc focusing on Hatori displays the series’ ability to also weave its more fantastical elements to create a dazzling visual treat. I haven’t so far however mentioned the early-middle portion of the series, because that is where the series was at its weakest for me.The storyline of Sana trying to hide from the government feels too much like ‘Elfen Lied’ for my taste, and it largely consists of action setpieces involving the character’s powers. These aren’t as exciting as the series seems to think they are, mainly because the unlimited nature of their powers takes away a lot of the suspense. It is my belief that action scenes should have some sort of limitation for the protagonist to overcome, and while a character who can create anything in a fight may sound exciting, it ultimately just feels like a cavalcade of randomness which feels severely lacking in tension. This portion of the story also carries a debate about whether the Alice’s Dream weavers can integrate into human society, but this theme was already examined a lot better in the quieter moments when we actually saw Sana interacting with the ordinary world instead of relying on dull exposition to make us think this.Not to mention, the arc goes on for a lot longer than it needs to, thanks in large part to these action scenes, which unfortunately takes a lot of the series’ runtime away from the more enjoyable moments. I was relieved when the arc finally did end, and the series got back to focusing on Sana and Zouroku’s everyday misadventures, as well as that final arc which really does accentuate the series’ highest qualities.With all that said, ‘Alice and Zouroku’ is still at least worth a watch if you have nothing better to do, or if you’re looking for an alternative Magical Girl series/Slice of Life. Although it could have reached higher heights, I am still ultimately glad that I checked it out, and that is perhaps one of the nicest comments you can give a series.', 'Spoiler free reviewI welcome feedback on my reviewsWould you like to become God, or at least, gain the powers of God? The power to create something from nothing. The possibilities are endless when you think about the capabilities this ability has. Anything you ever need to survive is there for the taking, you just need to summon it. Think of all the world problems that could be solved with our very own friendly neighbourhood God. However, with power comes responsibility, as there would be many people that would to try and take advantage of this omnipotence.Alice & Zouroku is the story of Sana, a lab...rat who can use the ""Dreams of Alice,"" the ability to create matter. She escapes from the research facility to escape the scientist that want to experiment on her and runs into Zouroku Kashimura, a grumpy old florist that decides to take her in. Now, whoever wrote this story seemed to be unsure where exactly they wanted to take it, as the anime would often switch between a Slice of Life to a Drama. There are shows that can mix these two genres well, but it just didn\'t work out for A&Z. The Slice of Life element felt like forced cuteness, giving characters an unnatural moe that puts you off the show, while the Drama element is just badly done, with the boring villains, solutions to problems that feel thrown in for the sake of ending arcs quickly, and the unrealistic reactions that characters had during scenes. (Oh, a giant hammer-wielding Santa just appeared out of nowhere, and this girl just disappeared before our very eyes. Is a movie being filmed here?) These reactions just ruined the flow of scenes as you were left trying to figure out why everyone in this anime is so stupid.The powers that are portrayed in the anime, named ""Dreams of Alice,"" would allow certain people to create matter. The objects that they could create however were different from character to character. Miriam C Tachibana could create giant arms that did whatever she wanted them to do such as grabbing or crushing objects, while Shizuku Ichijou had access to 666 different techniques and weapons she could bring out at a whim. Sana, however, had won the  Superpower Lottery, which gave her any power she wanted. Along with matter creation, she could also fly, teleport and use telepathy, just to name a few of abilities. The anime does well to explain how everything works and the limitations that they all had, so you\'re never confused about why a character is able to summon pigs or freeze people.Most of the characters were pretty likeable, from the childish ones like Sana, Sanae Kashimura, and Yonaga/Asahi Hinagiri, to the more serious ones like Zouroku, Ichijou and Ryuu Naitou. Most of them had their own goals that circled around the ""Dreams of Alice,"" either wanting to look after them or use them for their own selfish purposes. However, there were a few that seemed important but were left unexplored, soon to be forgotten by the anime. What was Kouichi Kitou\'s goal for wanting to experiment on the ""Dreams of Alice?"" Whatever happened to Cleo after the first arc? You\'re never really given the bigger picture to how all this started, as it\'s brushed aside to make room for the next arc.The animation was quite nice for this show, although it often threw in some CGI to create the objects the ""Dreams of Alice"" would summon and other stuff like the everyday car. Looking past the 3D animation, the backgrounds that would often be shown were quite stunning, especially during the Wonderland scenes. Nothing else really stood out, as the character designs were pretty normal, (but that fits the setting of the anime so it\'s to be expected) and the action scenes didn\'t have any eye-popping visuals.Alice & Zouroku could have been something great, but it just wasn\'t able to show it\'s full potential as it tried to do too many things at once.

You know the Government hiding and making experiences in humans with special abilities. However, I knew this one would be much lighter than Elfen Lied was.The story is not overly simpleminded but I didn’t enjoy the slow pacing of some episodes who were in my opinion, boring or annoying because of Sana’s childish behaviour.Also, I am not happy with how it ended because I think there were plenty of unresolved questions.ArtThe visuals were quite cute and good.

I wrote this review for my blog and thought I'd post it here on MAL too.)“This is the story of a girl who continues to search for ‘herself’ so that she can become a ‘me.’”So here we are and instead of joining the hype for titles like Attack on Titan Season 2 and Boku no Hero Academia Season 2, I decided I would try out something a little more my speed. Alice & Zoroku was something that looked cute and wholesome with a touch of action to keep the story from feeling too stagnant. In other words, just the sort of anime I...was looking for to keep me entertained during hot summer days when I would rather stay cooped up in the A/C then brave the UV rays outside. Although now that I’m at the end I’m finding that it may have been a better idea to join in on some of the more anticipated titles the season had to offer.Alice & Zoroku was not a bad anime, honestly. The story kept me interested enough to finish out the twelve episodes of the sickeningly sweet main protagonist trying to sort out right from wrong in her strange new home. Sana possesses what is known as a “Dream of Alice” which grants her special powers. She’s not the only one though, and the real meat of the plot is her sorting out just what is okay to use her powers for and what is not, along with another young girl by the name of Hatori (who doesn’t even show up until episode 5). Unfortunately, there were several things that kept me from appreciating everything the show had to offer.For one, the main character’s name is not Alice. It’s Sana. This, of course, was not the ultimate thing that caused me to enjoy the show less than I could have, but it irked me throughout the past few months everytime I caught sight of the show on a forum site or in my Crunchyroll queue.The second thing that distracted me from what was a potentially wonderful anime was the art. The way the faces were drawn in profile had me giggling from just how ridiculous they looked, with a straight line directly down from the point of the nose through the chin, with the mouth placed comically to the side. Again, nothing too big. I could look past a particular art style I didn’t find all that appealing for the sake of the story.Except that the story was nothing that I was expecting either. The first few episodes establish the relationship between Sana, the young female protagonist with otherwordly powers, and Zoroku, a stubborn elderly man who takes on the responsibility of becoming her guardian. When you hear this, you might think, “Oh man, I can’t wait for this girl to get in all sorts of supernatural trouble with a grandpa tagging along for comedic effect,” but that’s hardly what you get. There are minimal scenes where Zoroku interacts with Sana’s powers, but hardly any of them directly relate to the overall plot. As I mentioned before, the real story comes in the interactions between Sana and Hatori, another girl with a Dream of Alice, and how they sort out their own moral conflicts. Out with the old and in with the new, it seems.Overall I would give this anime a 5/10. It managed to keep itself lighthearted despite handling such heavy topics by keeping the main characters young and innocent and playful, but there was simply too much that took away from the enjoyment of it all. The art was funny looking, the characters not given enough time to develop, and the story focused too much on Zoroku on the beginning only to cast him aside later for the ‘real’ plot, thus leaving the rest of it rushed. was looking for to keep me entertained during hot summer days when I would rather stay cooped up in the A/C then brave the UV rays outside.

there\'s a connection somewhere.The story begins with Sana a girl who has a power called Alice\'s dream which is an ability to create anything she imagines, but she is a test subject and after escaping the lab she encounters and old man called Zouroku the question is will he help her?Now the story wasn\'t particularly strong, but it was definitely interesting and kept me interested to the end as the show does start off in a thriller like...way then during the halfway point it becomes more of a slice of life anime then it finishes off with some really weird and deep stuff that did sort of lose me for a second though I enjoyed it all the way through till the end.It was interesting seeing Sana experiencing new things since she was always kept locked up and how this affected her view of the world and her own life in general because at some point she really does question whether her existence means anything and whether it will amount to something as she keeps calling herself a monster until the people around her like Zouroku and Sanae say she is who she is which helps her out.I did like how the story paced out like it went through different arcs as you can tell when the situation changes and there is also the stuff that happened because this anime can get pretty dark at some point and then it can be really weird the next which shows how random this anime was, but this wasn\'t a bad thing as the characters always made the situation either funny or interesting as they try to figure things out and try to fix it.It was also interesting how there were other people who had the same ability as Sana, but had different variants and it was a bit tense seeing how some of these people used their powers because Sana mainly used it to help her, but there were others like Miriam C or Hatori who used their powers for more destructive or personal uses which showed that having powers isn\'t always a good thing.The big problem I have with the story is the fact that the ending felt rushed and a bit anti-climatic as it finishes with an adult Sana monologuing over how well her life has gone thanks to the people who looked after her which shows there isn\'t going to be a season 2 and the fact that all it took for the situation to be fixed was Zouroku saying ""I\'ve had enough"" which just felt stupid, other than that though the story was alright.Now the characters were also a reason why the anime was pretty good, but there was certainly some screentime problems for some characters.Sana Kashimura is the female MC and is actually not human since she was born in the dream world and eventually took on a human form, she starts out arrogant and immature until Zouroku made her learn some manners and then helped her how the world worked, over time she does become more mature, but when facing certain situations she can be rash in her decisions and often use\'s the phrase frazzled when she feels something she doesn\'t like or confuses her, some people might find her annoying because she does whine a bit, but to me it wasn\'t dislikeable instead it was more cute really.Zouroku Kashimura is the male MC and he is a florist and owns a florist business, it\'s rare seeing an older person being a protagonist and he is actually a very likeable person because behind his grumpy exterior he is actually a wise and caring man and makes sure his family is ok, the problem with his character is that he wasn\'t used that much other than being Sana\'s guardian I mean you see them connect a bit, but you don\'t really get to see his character shine outside of those moments with Sana and Zouroku.Sanae Kashimura is Zouroku\'s granddaughter whose parents died while she was young, she switches from being a mother and sister figure to Sana and she is a really positive and happy person often making sure that Sana is happy, safe and well fed, she also has this weird fixation on stuff that\'s cute like when Sana was having a sleepover with her friends she wished she had joined in when they were messing around.Yonaga and Asahi Hinagiri are twins who were also test subjects alongside Sana and were her only friends, Asahi is the more adventurous and Yonaga is the more responsible one, but sometimes they swap personalities which makes it difficult to differentiate whose who, when they are freed from being test subjects they become proper friends with Sana and you can see from their interactions that they really care about her since she is like them.Hatori Shikishima and Ayumu Miho are two friends who end up in a difficult situation because of Hatori acquiring powers, Hatori is the more depressed of the two mainly because her parents constantly fight and she thinks that she is a burden to them until Sana helps her realise that her existence isn\'t meaningless and this helps her become a better person, Ayumu is Hatori\'s best friend and enjoys playing football, she cares about Hatori\'s well being and went to great lengths to make sure she wouldn\'t feel sad anymore which shows the close bond that the two had which at times made it seem like they were more than friends.Shizuku Ichijou is a person who has the same powers as Sana, but is from another organisation that is trying to help people like Sana live a normal life, her tone of voice doesn\'t really change much though she is definitely a badass that shouldn\'t be messed because her powers are immense and has saved Sana on multiple occasions and she has even helped teach her a few things too.The artstyle was mixed in some areas, I really liked how dream land looked it was full of weird and wonderful things which just made the whole thing feel like a weird drug trip, but there are points where there is CGI that really ruins some scenes like when Sana and Zouroku are trying to get away from the twins and that whole chase scene looked really bad luckily it was the only scene that looked bad while the rest kept up nicely, the design of the characters looked a bit similar to the characters from Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica too.The soundtrack also surprised me too because I really liked how the music sounded during the dream land scenes as it felt mystic which fitted very nicely with the moment.Despite there being the mystery genre there were some good bits like Sana\'s origins which aren\'t really explained properly which is a little disappointing, but the best part of this aspect is pretty much during the whole dream land sequence with Sana trying to help out Hatori figure out the meaning of her existence and the reason why she existed too.There is also some comedy and Slice of Life elements too especially with the interactions between Sana and Zouroku which were just great and funny moments, but the sad thing is they were too far between all the other stuff which is the main weakness of this anime is that is didn\'t take advantage of the relationship between Sana and Zouroku and just made it a side thing.Overall this was an interesting, sweet and mysterious anime with a few flaws, but still enjoyable though sadly there won\'t be a second season which does disappoint me a little since I think Sana still has more to tell in her story and I would have loved more moments between her and Zouroku though sadly that won\'t happen. way then during the halfway point it becomes more of a slice of

""Story: 8That 8 is at least for the premise. It starts off quite interesting. It could have gone a more serious route like in the first arc where it was about keeping Sana/Red Queen contained or obtaining her powers, but it quickly changed into a slice of life show after that, only returning to the supernatural stuff in the last arc.Characters: 7They all build to some degree or another. Sana becomes more and more like a human child as time goes on. Zouroku and Sanae also grow closer as a family with Sana. Ayumu and Hattori towards the end also sort of grow up.

There really weren't that many adult themes in this show, nor is anything here really mature.Who's this for:-If you want an unusual slice of life show-Moe fans-Loli fans-If you like supernatural stuff/superpowersWho's this not for:-If you really want something serious as implied by the seinen tag.-If you don't like slice of life-If you were looking for something deeper than a growing up story"", 'The ""Pantheon of opportunities ignored"" has another addition to it with this anime. Coupled with shit 3-d animation as well, this anime deserves a skip. But why?Honestly, I was betrayed by the first 4 episodes of what was going to happen and how the story was going to progress. I\'m not gonna discuss this openly for fear of spoilers, you\'ll just have to watch them yourself. But I swear they flipped the anime around like a pancake and reveal a very charred side of the story that I would rather wait for, it felt rushed, to put it mildly.The rest of the anime is primarily...about how children interact with new things in life and the struggles they might face coupled with the strange powers that exist in this world, wich sounds good granted, but it was not what I wanted.What I wanted, was the first 4 episodes, stretched out neatly with the 2 main characters helping each other in their own unique way.I could easily see a path they could have gone to make this a really good story with all the fluff still there. I will say however if the release a sequel I will watch it. There is a lot of promise and opportunities. They might still ignore it though. Meh, if the do I\'ll just rate it 1/10. about how children interact with new things in life and the struggles they might face coupled with the strange powers that exist in this world, wich sounds good granted, but it was not what I wanted.What I wanted, was the first 4 episodes, stretched out neatly with the 2 main characters helping each other in their own unique way.I could easily see a path they could have gone to make this a really good story with all the fluff still there.

Meh, if the do I\'ll just rate it 1/10.', ""SPOILER FREETo be honestly, I enjoyed this a lot more than it is objectively good. I have a soft spot for gruff males in anime and Zouroku was by far the best part. Unfortunately, he didn't appear nearly frequently enough and his development ended in the first third of the series. Most of the show is about Sana and her cuteness which admitted gets less annoying as the show progresses.The main problem I have with his anime is that it's a potentially great slice of life that tries to have a plot and spends a lot of time on plot without having a plot...that's actually good. Ideas are introduced without much payoff and just die out. The powers the characters have also aren't explained very well and there were several moments when the characters didn't have powers or didn't use them that weren't explained.The art style is cute, but the animations is very mediocre and there wasn't even a really poppy opening. Still if you watch the first 2 episodes and like the old man enough, you might be able to pull through this show okay and be mildly entertained. that's actually good.

Initially the show comes off as perhaps a more action-oriented mystery, with the first arc of the show having a more serious atmosphere to it. But after the first arc, the show then does a 90 degree turn with the next arc being more down to earth compared to the first one. This was a bit jarring, as I had expected the first arc to be more fleshed out then just ""...and it\'s over"" The last few minutes of the arc felt rushed as most of...the ""antagonists"" are never mentioned again in the show, and only assumptions can be made about their fate. Despite the jarring transition, the rest of the show onward is more slice of life, with Sana experiencing more of the world around her under the care of good old Zouroku. Towards the end, thanks to newly introduced characters, Sana\'s peaceful life is disrupted, prompting her to resolve the issue, which leads us to how the show concludes itself. Though for me it was anti-climatic, the ending was rather fitting the story\'s direction in the later part of the show.Art: While the CGI in the beginning may have offset a lot of people, the animation and the art direction from then on is absolutely heartwarming if not joyful. For me, most anime I watch generally have acceptable or quality animation which is something I\'ve come to expect, so there isn\'t much to say about Alice to Zourokou\'s animation besides what I mentioned earlier.Sound: Not breathtaking, but certainly not dull, the music of Alice to Zouroku is not only fitting of Sana\'s cheerful personality but also the atmosphere of the show.Characters: Besides Sana and the other children like her in the show, not much character development in terms of backstory is given for the other characters. Throughout the show, you learn more about Sana and also the other children if its needed for the story along with bits about Zouroku. And that\'s about it, since the show\'s primary focus is really on Sana and her experiences or should I say her ""adventure\' in the real world.In the end, I enjoyed watching Alice to Zouroku because to me it was a rather heartwarming experience, I\'ll admit it wasn\'t a spectacular show, me giving it a 7 which is a rather common rating for me to give to generic shows. While not spectacular, it was by far a different experience from shows with a similar theme/outline.Overall: Pretty good but i\'m more of an optimist so its probably just decent/10 the ""antagonists"" are never mentioned again in the show, and only assumptions can be made about their fate.

The story proved itself to be interesting, taking inspiration from the escaped research facility girl with special powers trope, while putting a unique and original spin on it by utilizing Alice in Wonderland imagery. The idea of ""Mirror Gates"", each with their own unique set of powers and whatnot, provides wonderful grounds for narrative growth, limited only by how many powers one can come up with. The story changed about a third of the way through, from more of a sci-fi escape quasi-action featuring a magical girl and nefarious government agency, to an almost slice-of-life style story with magical mishaps...and how a young girl comes to exist as a normal person in a world that is utterly alien to her resulting in a mixture of funny and touching moments. That switch was unexpected, but proved only to make the show better for it. The art tried to flaunt its 3D in their exceptionally long first episode, but it fell flat on its face in my opinion, looking outdated and clunky in comparison to what their art direction should have been going on. luckily they drop the clunkier 3D very shortly thereafter, and the rest of the art is well done, no less than one should expect from a modern anime. The sound is perfectly normal, with a playful soundtrack and voice actors that fit their characters like a glove. The characters were my favorite part, and I found myself getting invested in their lives. Between Sana, with her unforgiving curiosity and penchant for mischief, Zoroku, with his stern old man discipline veiling a heart truly full of love for those in his life, and all the people that surround them in everyday life, it was a pleasure to get a glimpse of that. Even Zoroku\'s assistants are so realistic and human, and get their own special moments. The development of Minnie C has got to be my favorite example of a human villain off the top of my head. Her reasons for getting involved with the whole sinister government operation and engaging in so much ruthless behavior makes me almost want to forgive her. It was so heart-wrenching that I just felt like she should get her own happy ending, too. and that, ladies and gentlemen is how you write a good villain. On the total opposite end of the spectrum, however, is Cleo. Cleo, for those who don\'t remember his 5 minutes of dialogue, was one of the children from the research center. They set him up to be important and whatnot, they have him make a robot toy, and then he just disappears! That looks like an oversight to me. Like he once did play a big part, but they wrote a different show and put it over the part where he was going to matter. It keeps a good deal of levity throughout, but still has its serious moments so you don\'t forget how sinister the world can sometimes be. Overall a heartwarming show about family, accepting who you are, and learning that you shouldn\'t try to rely on yourself all the time. and how a young girl comes to exist as a normal person in a world that is utterly alien to her resulting in a mixture of funny and touching moments.

It's quite a strange one and the story is kinda intriguing too.The anime revolves around people who posses a strange power called 'Alice's Dream'. They can materialize anything they imagine and our MC, Sana happens to be the most powerful of them all. She was bound in a research facility but then escapes and ends up with a grumpy florist called Zouroku. How they bond and become a family is what the story is all about.First, the story is a new one. It is being adapted from a manga of...the same name, which I have to read at some point of time. The development of characters and strengthening of family bonds play a strong part in this anime, and honestly you'll love it.As for the art, it was just horrible in the first episode. That awful CGI made me wash my eyes with bleach and I had planned to drop it. But thankfully, they amped up the animation from the second episode and has improved a LOT.The sound is pretty good. The ED is so calm and peaceful that I'm already in love with it. The OP is kinda quirky but it's enjoyable nonetheless.Character development plays a strong part in Alice to Zouroko. We see Sana becoming more adaptive to human emotions and feelings. Zouroku's grumpy but lovable Grandpa is enjoying. There are also some dark characters like Minnie C, who gives of an air of a complete psychotic killer.Alice to Zouroku ended on a positive note and for once I can say, that I'm happy with the ending. No cliffhangers and no abruptness, the ending was real beautiful.Overall the enjoyment is pretty good in Alice to Zouroku. While not as good as many other shows this season, Alice to Zouroku manages to hold out on its own and create a place for itself.

It left us with many, many questions and very few answers.2. The tone was all over the place. The beginning has some dark (and VERY dark) scenes, and a clear main story line, but these are funneled out as the anime continues.Eventually the anime feels like any typical cutesy anime with a little girl lead where problems are solved by a down-to-earth adult scolding the thing that is doing wrong. It felt...like they didn\'t really know what kind of anime they were making, and some scenes feel very disjointed from others.Would I recommend it? Sure! ...just don\'t expect a masterpiece or to feel fulfilled after this season.All in all I\'d say if you\'re looking for a decent anime that deals with relationships, finding yourself, and questions why each of us exist, and don\'t mind that the main story leaves a lot to be desired and that there is a serious disconnect in tone between the first third and the last two thirds, then this anime is for you!

Enjoy.', 'To me, this anime is beautiful in the simple meaning of that word. After all the stories that I\'ve gone through, this is what\'s turned out to be my breath of fresh air. A story in which exclusively everything is good and nothing is bad.Happy.. Not just happy, but wonderfully happy developments happening all over the place....In a lot of stories there are characters that are the enemies in their given circumstances, but if those circumstances were to be different they\'d be friends, or even lovers. To realize our dreams of those characters, at least I turn to fan artworks in which those characters are drawn together. There isn\'t even many artworks of this story to find and I assume that it\'s because this story is a whole cake, not just a piece of it, if you understand my analogy. :)Regardless of that, this story is its own fan-fiction in that sense. Characters which start as enemies, but end up hugging each other in tears and becoming best friends. It\'s as if that is the essence of this story. I\'d even say that no one in this story is ever an enemy of anyone. Even the government is not a bad guy, that ever-present trope.Almost all of the characters are all bright and positive. At the very least, the conviction is understandable in positive light, but that is an eternal trope and won\'t be a surprise to anyone I think.I like all of the characters, but the young girls are especially noteworthy for me. They are good and kind people that are easy to love for me. If only the world was full of kids like that. I wish the world was full of people like the people in this anime in general.But, I\'ll just touch on what my feelings are regarding Sana.Sana, the main character, is almost perfect. The ""almost"" is there because she is so near-flawless, that a tiny thing like this is the only flaw making her less-than-perfect for me. For me, it matters that a younger character has an appropriately younger voice actor. He voice actor not being that is that single minute flaw.None the less, the voice actress of Sana performed better than flawlessly, to put it that way... She actually has the intonation, the rhythm, the.. I don\'t know how to describe it exactly. Her voice sounds like that of a little kid. The way she speaks, the way she stutters, the way the tone of her voice loses confidence, the excitement at times, the voice of an angry child.. Everything about her voice acting for Sana is childlike. Her voice contributed tremendously to me perceiving Sana as a genuine child and liking her as much as I do. It\'s not even right to say I like her, I\'m just happy to know that she is in the hands of two wonderful people, Sanae and Zouroku.Beyond just her voice, Sana as a character is such an amazing feat. She is very well characterized for a child character. The way she speaks, thinks, behaves and acts, it\'s all childlike. Not just that, but it\'s all also how a child that\'s never seen the outside world would be. My overall point is that Sana is a wonderful character that easily could\'ve carried the show by herself for me, but it wasn\'t necessary!While this is a fantasy story, it\'s not over-the-top. Once you\'re into the story, the story will not change until its end, so to say. There is a final event, but it\'s not a plot twist, or something to be described as an arc, it\'s just how the story goes, proceeds, and departs from you. The story will be just what it has been since the start. Because I am so loving of the topic of beautiful (honest, filled-with-good-intentions) human relationships, this anime has had my eyes in tears for what honestly felt like half of the entire duration of the show.I liked what the story was presented to me as, and I only liked it more and more with each episode.Having ended up loving this story, I am glad to have given it a chance.. I\'m going to read this manga.Did I mention that the ending of this anime, the very last scene, is something so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes yet again..Only thing left to add is that I loved the OST, having searched for one particular piece during the first occasion that it\'s played in the anime, because of how much and instantly I liked it, and, the art is cute and beautiful. The characters are expressive and especially in the last few episodes, the environment is beautifully drawn.

It had a unique premise, and the main characters were consists of 1 kid and 1 old man. Totally different from the norm. The storytelling was done really well, even the pacing flowed smoothly through out the series. It had a nice blend of action, comedy, drama and slice-of-life. The animation was rather unique compared to other anime released last winter, but it fits well with the story. The characters were well fleshed out. You’ll even like the suppose antagonists of the story. Indeed, a must watch if you want to relax and enjoy...a good anime with a solid story. a good anime with a solid story.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)It’s my hope to be a grandfather someday.My own Grandpa turned 85 years old this week. I called him up on the phone to tell him happy birthday and to see how he has been doing. We talked about my job, his thoughts, and just life in general. To him, he’s most grateful for a simple yet important thing: his family.From his wife to his siblings, from his kids to his grandkids and great grandkids, he is proud to know that his legacy is one filled with amazing people. Good people. And I’m lucky enough...to be a part of the love that he shares.Alice to Zouroku isn’t about birthdays and legacies, but it is about a relationship that spans a couple of generations. Sadly, whatever love it does have to share is lost along the way.STORYIt takes watching all of Alice to Zouroku to realize that its narrative construction isn’t exactly linear. Not in the one-event-after-another sense but in the how-it-coalesces sense. Because, at first, it seems as though the show will follow a strict, singular plotline. Instead, it goes for separate arcs and episodic content, jumbling together both approaches to achieve its story.If this content were half-arc-half-episodic or fully one or the other, then the anime would have had some merit, following through on a foundation or keeping consistent in its plot. Instead, this jumbling comes off as the anime having little to no focus. Many of the people in the first half do not carry over: Minnie C., the director dude, that one kid who can draw items into existence. Much of what goes on in the second half doesn’t tie back too well: Hatori’s dilemma, the explanation of her powers, the newfound government watch program. And sandwiched in-between are the show’s episodic morsels.Not that the two slices of bread on either side of the season are completely inedible. Sanae and Sana’s interactions in the second episode make for a fun, lively sequence of events that push the plot along while building the cast. And the exploration of Wonderland in the final couple of episodes, after it had been alluded to here and there for quite some time, demonstrates a follow through on Alice to Zouroku’s part.Still, the breads’ moldy focus heavily curtails the show’s most important aspect: Sana and Zouroku’s relationship. With the initial outing worried mostly about a research facility and the evil people chasing Sana, and with the last outing putting a ridiculous amount of emphasis on a couple of last-minute characters, there just isn’t enough time given to what the anime literally titles itself around.That’s why, when these moments between the old grandpa and the young granddaughter do pop up, they immediately capture the audience’s attention. It can be something as small as him pulling open a wrapper around some candy for her to eat or as big as her clinging onto and refusing to let go of him when he gets back home safe and sound. No matter the scale, their grounded moments together represent Alice to Zouroku at its absolute best.Indeed, all of episode six – with her tagging along during his job, their intermittent conversations, and her eventual adoption – make this aforementioned morsel the tastiest of the bunch. It can even be argued that the very, very last scene also deserves such praise. An older Sana fondly reminisces about Zouroku in a future timeline while clutching a set of beautiful flowers that no doubt remind her of him. The thematic implications alone here make this snippet infinitely more interesting than whatever the first and second halves of the show dished out. If for no other reason than it actually relates to the anime’s main goal.Besides the strange lack of focus, the anime contains even stranger decisions. Sana’s kidnapping isn’t so much shocking in an entertaining sense as it is downright uncomfortable to watch given how over-the-top the anime goes with it (when she soils herself, the potential drugging, literally shooting her in the leg with subsequent muffled screams and cries). Moreover, one of the story’s themes on humanizing remains restricted to the Dreams of Alice users as opposed to explored and contrasted through regular people as well. And, speaking of the Dreams of Alice, the premise never truly takes hold, acting more as a caveat to the narrative rather than a vital piece worth extra attention.A lot of the comedy does work in the anime’s favor thanks mostly to Sana’s inquisitiveness. Plus, to reiterate, her moments with Zouroku demonstrate that this story has heart. But, without tangible storytelling focus and with those few speedbumps along the way, the show’s total execution rots more than it would prefer.ART & ANIMATIONAlice to Zouroku’s first episode spells doom for the series when it trips up with error after error in its artistry. Asynchronous audiovisual production when a character sounds like he sits down and sighs but not really. Low-quality CG all over. Moving backgrounds when the characters themselves have stopped. Improper detail locations. While none of these specific issues exist for any longer than a few seconds at most, their frequency raises a red flag immediately for the rest of the show’s artistic integrity.Thankfully, the flag lowers quite a bit once moved beyond the first episode. Yes, the CG is still not ideal when it does appear, but it isn’t around as much or at least as prominently. And yea, the rare weird cut can rear its ugly head, like when Zouroku moves to attack Minnie C. for harming Sana. But, in general, the anime doesn’t wave that flag around with vigor anymore afterwards.Instead, Alice to Zouroku likes to draw one’s attention to the effort put into the designs of its characters. Their blocky nature adds some much needed charm to this story, and their looks capture their personalities well.For example, Zouroku’s furrowed gaze, white beard, and red sweater paint him as a stern yet likable grandpa. Sana switches from a princess dress and crown to a hoodie and short hair without ever losing her blonde strands and pink coloring, giving her a childish, cute appearance with ease. And Shizuku’s business attire contrasts with her magical maid outfit to complement work with “play” and to help accentuate her doubly helpful behavior.Sana’s Wonderland and the background artistry also deserve some praise. Her world away from the world contains all manner of depicted oddities: flying seals, giant turtles, crazy technology, piano bridges, shoe plants, ducky boats on a tea river. All it’s missing is a loony (read: mad) guy with a hat and some cards.The background art in Wonderland wows with its blue skies, pink clouds, and levitating isles. But the local city, Zouroku’s pretty floral shop, and the smaller locations visited (his house, the alley restaurant) also do their part in building the show’s appeal.By comparison, Alice to Zouroku’s actual animation does not reach as high as the designs and the background art, but it does not reach as low as the first episode’s wary mistakes either. Instead, it treads a middle ground. The characters’ imaginative summons, like Shizuku’s array of “weapons”, up movement for the duration of their stay, and the everyday actions of the characters don’t scream fluidity but get the job done regardless.That red flag never leaves the mind of the audience because of the stark nature of the errors committed. However, with the nice designs, pretty backgrounds, and passable animation, the show at least tries to hide that flag as best as it can.CHARACTERSOf the two main characters in Alice to Zouroku, Sana evidently earns the most screen time.Without knowing anything about her, Sana seems like any other child. She pines after tasty food she cannot afford. She isn’t afraid to state her honest opinion despite the situation. She loves to have fun without worrying about the consequences. Yes, she has her own personal quirks, like commenting on the smells around her and singing made-up songs any chance she gets. But she’s no doubt like any other kid through and through.At least, until one discovers that there’s more to her than meets the eye. As a sentient Dream of Alice, Sana isn’t human. She’s a construct of the people and the emotions she experienced very early on. In other words, not only does she have to mature as a person but also she has to learn what being a person even is to begin with. This double layer of necessary growth for her character gives her experiences throughout the season a meaningful edge twice over and a much more purposeful direction overall.So, many of the scenes in Alice to Zouroku that revolve around Sana center on her growth. Much like the craziness of her Wonderland dreamscape, these scenes come in all shapes and sizes. She finds joy in the simple things such as the squeaking of some wooden steps. She learns to apologize when in the wrong. She receives an education and a family to call her own. Incremental steps really, but they go a long way towards putting her on the right path for adulthood and “humanhood.”Her relationships with others, while few in number, also contribute to Sana’s growth. The twins act as a fun, recurring remnant from the first part of her life, letting her know that not everything from her past should be forgotten. Hatori, the main “antagonist” of the last arc of the season, is herself not the most compelling character (and honestly not individually relevant to the show), but she does (indirectly) force Sana to refrain from gut reactions and to think about sympathy towards others instead. And Sanae dotes on her as much as she can to give her the love and care she has never experienced before.These people are well and good for Sana’s growth, but the most important figure now in her life isn’t a friend or a sibling but (as anyone can guess at this point) a grandparent: Zouroku.Known as the man who despises “crooked stuff,” Zouroku is an older fellow whose tough demeanor and worn baseball cap hide the fact that he’s the town’s most proficient florist. He doesn’t take extra handouts from others, and he looks after his employees. In short, his age reflects his steadfast maturity.With age also comes wisdom. Zouroku doesn’t care that Sana is technically not human; he simply sees her as a sincere young girl who wants to live a normal life like anybody else. So, in their various scenes together, Sana listens to Zouroku as he passes on his wisdom to her. Be it about the need to lean on others during tough times or being responsible with one’s own power, he is the best role model for her to achieve the growth in character that she requires.Zouroku sometimes employs a harsh cranium squeeze to reprimand Sana which goes against his normally calm self, yet those words of his guide her all the same. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have much else going for him. No strong backstory, no outside relationships. In a way, that’s because he’s “been through it all” already, so he (on a life level) does not have much left to gain. Indeed, not only does this whole crazy experience not change him much but also he comes off as oddly unfazed by it all. This direction for his character leaves little room for him in which to express himself, thereby diminishing his presence and his impact within the anime.Nevertheless, by the end of the season, Sana has clearly grown. She may become “frazzled” again in the future, but, with the people in her life looking out for her to support her from here on out, she will surely encounter more opportunities and more happiness, too. All to make her life the one she has always dreamed about.MUSIC & SOUND“Wonder Drive,” the opening track to this show, includes a lot of spacey effects and otherworldly noises to produce its sound. It aligns with the alien nature of the Dreams of Alice, and, for at least this reason, the OP has a leg to stand on. Otherwise, the track fills said space with nothing too out of the ordinary. A clapping segment. Some twang from its guitar and a pattering of drums in the background. Vocals that do not overbear the listener but do not engage them either. Altogether, this track isn’t too interesting, but it works in Alice to Zouroku.Its counterpart, however, is a different, better story. Titled “Chant,” the ending track stands on two legs instead, providing music both intriguing and fun to hear. The acoustic guitar, the xylophone, and the chimes blend together into a simplistic yet whimsical sound that entrances one’s ear. As the instrumentation glides along, the main vocalist’s whisper-like lyrical delivery and the supporting background vocals combine to give the song its happy, gentle vibe. Everything coalesces as an awesome track that’s worthy of playing outside of the anime itself.Likewise, the original soundtrack also earns props for many of its heartfelt melodies that accompany its scenes. Light piano keys will give way to violin strings that evoke the same swell of emotions. Other times, acoustic guitar plays alongside the piano for a decidedly happier tune. Then singular piano keys will intersperse a warped sound-effect to lightly lay on the tension of a given situation.Beyond these piano tracks, Alice to Zouroku also provides different musical pieces that follow different moods and segments. An intentionally stumbling song – with dainty xylophone notes, methodical wind instruments, and lazier pipe sounds – creates an airy atmosphere for the slice-of-life scenes. And the occasional jazz tune, with saxophone and light cymbal tapping, dots the show during certain montage moments. The OST may not stand as tall as the ED, but, melody or no, it stands tall nonetheless throughout the season.And not to be ignored, the voice acting involved, while not exactly special, has a couple of examples worthy of pointing out. Hitomi Ohwada as Sana stars in her first major main role, doing well in making Sana not only sound like a young girl but also dabbling into different emotions for her. Not to mention the overall cuteness of her cadence. Likewise, Akio Ootsuka as Zouroku also deserves a shoutout. His gruff tone and respectful anger give his lectures and yells their stern and compassionate edge.All in all, with just the OP not leaving too much of a mark on Alice to Zouroku, the music and sound contain some of the best parts to this show even when the other parts available were somewhat of a letdown.ENJOYMENTMy feelings are conflicted on this one. I like it for two specific reasons, and I don’t like it for one specific reason.One of those likes goes to Sana. She is curious, silly, and happy-go-lucky. In other words, she’s a really fun kid character. Her impatience causing her to summon a giant pancake during breakfast to demonstrate the law of conversation of energy. Riding a rocket to chase after the twins in a high-speed, high-flying chase. How she talked about the proper way to drink milk. Quite regularly, her antics and reactions got me laughing.The other like goes to her relationship with Zouroku, for she cares a lot about this old man who she randomly ran into. She brings him with her into the nighttime sky for a spectacular view of the world below, and she gleefully goes out of her way to try and show him her new bobbed haircut. In turn, his intentions were always sincere, and her happiness while around him was always infectious.Which leads to my number one dislike: Hatori. I get that she’s depressed from living in a household where her parents fight and do not value her much. But she got on my nerves very quickly regardless: all of the drama with her powers, being even slightly mean to Sana. Plus, she’s apparently between eight and ten years old, making her adult behavior about her entire situation difficult for me to take seriously. She’ll choose which kiddy backpack to wear to school but then complain about her philosophical existence or how her mother is “…looking in from a universe of endless darkness.”Besides my likes and dislikes, the rest of the show somewhat counterbalances itself. Shizuku and Ryuu from the protection agency were cool, but Hatori’s best friend Ayumu was similarly as annoying as her. The magic from the Dreams of Alice seemed interesting, but the powers present didn’t receive a ton of variety or usage. Sanae was a lot of fun, but she took a heavy backseat within the show beyond the second episode.Given that my bigger likes and my big dislike also counterbalance each other, my personal takeaway from this anime is neither super positive nor super negative. Overall, it’s just a whole lot of neutral.Alice to Zouroku unfortunately cannot make its dreams a reality. Misplaced focus on a narrative level, early artistic errors, not enough attention spent on particular characters, and annoying details prevent the show’s heartfelt bonds and nice musical repertoire from materializing. A legacy that falls far short of amazing.SUMMARYStory: Bad, a lack of focus in its structure and purpose, alongside larger grievances, get in the way Sana and Zouroku’s relationship, arguably the most important part of the narrativeArt & Animation: Fine, while the first episode raises a red flag, the majority of the visuals depict charming designs, nice background art, and okay movementCharacters: Fine, Sana grows as a kid and as a human through individual experiences and the help of others, especially Zouroku, but he himself does not have much of a presence or an impactMusic & Sound: Good, a whimsical ED, a melodious OST, and a couple of solid VA performances stand above a passable OPEnjoyment: Fine, Sana and her relationship with Zouroku are pluses, Hatori is a big minus, and the rest of the elements counterbalance each otherFinal Score: 5/10 to be a part of the love that he shares.Alice to Zouroku isn’t about birthdays and legacies, but it is about a relationship that spans a couple of generations. Sadly, whatever love it does have to share is lost along the way.STORYIt takes watching all of Alice to Zouroku to realize that its narrative construction isn’t exactly linear. Not in the one-event-after-another sense but in the how-it-coalesces sense. Because, at first, it seems as though the show will follow a strict, singular plotline. Instead, it goes for separate arcs and episodic content, jumbling together both approaches to achieve its story.If this content were half-arc-half-episodic or fully one or the other, then the anime would have had some merit, following through on a foundation or keeping consistent in its plot. Instead, this jumbling comes off as the anime having little to no focus. Many of the people in the first half do not carry over: Minnie C., the director dude, that one kid who can draw items into existence. Much of what goes on in the second half doesn’t tie back too well: Hatori’s dilemma, the explanation of her powers, the newfound government watch program. And sandwiched in-between are the show’s episodic morsels.Not that the two slices of bread on either side of the season are completely inedible. Sanae and Sana’s interactions in the second episode make for a fun, lively sequence of events that push the plot along while building the cast. And the exploration of Wonderland in the final couple of episodes, after it had been alluded to here and there for quite some time, demonstrates a follow through on Alice to Zouroku’s part.Still, the breads’ moldy focus heavily curtails the show’s most important aspect: Sana and Zouroku’s relationship. With the initial outing worried mostly about a research facility and the evil people chasing Sana, and with the last outing putting a ridiculous amount of emphasis on a couple of last-minute characters, there just isn’t enough time given to what the anime literally titles itself around.That’s why, when these moments between the old grandpa and the young granddaughter do pop up, they immediately capture the audience’s attention. It can be something as small as him pulling open a wrapper around some candy for her to eat or as big as her clinging onto and refusing to let go of him when he gets back home safe and sound. No matter the scale, their grounded moments together represent Alice to Zouroku at its absolute best.Indeed, all of episode six – with her tagging along during his job, their intermittent conversations, and her eventual adoption – make this aforementioned morsel the tastiest of the bunch. It can even be argued that the very, very last scene also deserves such praise. An older Sana fondly reminisces about Zouroku in a future timeline while clutching a set of beautiful flowers that no doubt remind her of him. The thematic implications alone here make this snippet infinitely more interesting than whatever the first and second halves of the show dished out. If for no other reason than it actually relates to the anime’s main goal.Besides the strange lack of focus, the anime contains even stranger decisions. Sana’s kidnapping isn’t so much shocking in an entertaining sense as it is downright uncomfortable to watch given how over-the-top the anime goes with it (when she soils herself, the potential drugging, literally shooting her in the leg with subsequent muffled screams and cries). Moreover, one of the story’s themes on humanizing remains restricted to the Dreams of Alice users as opposed to explored and contrasted through regular people as well. And, speaking of the Dreams of Alice, the premise never truly takes hold, acting more as a caveat to the narrative rather than a vital piece worth extra attention.A lot of the comedy does work in the anime’s favor thanks mostly to Sana’s inquisitiveness. Plus, to reiterate, her moments with Zouroku demonstrate that this story has heart. But, without tangible storytelling focus and with those few speedbumps along the way, the show’s total execution rots more than it would prefer.ART & ANIMATIONAlice to Zouroku’s first episode spells doom for the series when it trips up with error after error in its artistry. Asynchronous audiovisual production when a character sounds like he sits down and sighs but not really. Low-quality CG all over. Moving backgrounds when the characters themselves have stopped. Improper detail locations. While none of these specific issues exist for any longer than a few seconds at most, their frequency raises a red flag immediately for the rest of the show’s artistic integrity.Thankfully, the flag lowers quite a bit once moved beyond the first episode. Yes, the CG is still not ideal when it does appear, but it isn’t around as much or at least as prominently. And yea, the rare weird cut can rear its ugly head, like when Zouroku moves to attack Minnie C. for harming Sana. But, in general, the anime doesn’t wave that flag around with vigor anymore afterwards.Instead, Alice to Zouroku likes to draw one’s attention to the effort put into the designs of its characters. Their blocky nature adds some much needed charm to this story, and their looks capture their personalities well.For example, Zouroku’s furrowed gaze, white beard, and red sweater paint him as a stern yet likable grandpa. Sana switches from a princess dress and crown to a hoodie and short hair without ever losing her blonde strands and pink coloring, giving her a childish, cute appearance with ease. And Shizuku’s business attire contrasts with her magical maid outfit to complement work with “play” and to help accentuate her doubly helpful behavior.Sana’s Wonderland and the background artistry also deserve some praise. Her world away from the world contains all manner of depicted oddities: flying seals, giant turtles, crazy technology, piano bridges, shoe plants, ducky boats on a tea river. All it’s missing is a loony (read: mad) guy with a hat and some cards.The background art in Wonderland wows with its blue skies, pink clouds, and levitating isles. But the local city, Zouroku’s pretty floral shop, and the smaller locations visited (his house, the alley restaurant) also do their part in building the show’s appeal.By comparison, Alice to Zouroku’s actual animation does not reach as high as the designs and the background art, but it does not reach as low as the first episode’s wary mistakes either. Instead, it treads a middle ground. The characters’ imaginative summons, like Shizuku’s array of “weapons”, up movement for the duration of their stay, and the everyday actions of the characters don’t scream fluidity but get the job done regardless.That red flag never leaves the mind of the audience because of the stark nature of the errors committed. However, with the nice designs, pretty backgrounds, and passable animation, the show at least tries to hide that flag as best as it can.CHARACTERSOf the two main characters in Alice to Zouroku, Sana evidently earns the most screen time.Without knowing anything about her, Sana seems like any other child. She pines after tasty food she cannot afford. She isn’t afraid to state her honest opinion despite the situation. She loves to have fun without worrying about the consequences. Yes, she has her own personal quirks, like commenting on the smells around her and singing made-up songs any chance she gets. But she’s no doubt like any other kid through and through.At least, until one discovers that there’s more to her than meets the eye. As a sentient Dream of Alice, Sana isn’t human. She’s a construct of the people and the emotions she experienced very early on.

It wasn\'t all that bad (Umaru-chan is worst).There\'s no spoilers, so don\'t worry.--Story (6/10)--The first episode was 46 minutes long, which means that the story was going to be complex, with much to explain. What I think that ruined the story, was because of that. The 11th (next-to-last) episode ended suddenly, with nothing really happening, and then I thought that the final episode was going to have 46 minutes long too to end the story with a thrilling sensation, with a...good climax to finally end the anime. But I was wrong. The 12th episode was only 23 minutes.Regardless of that, I still felt hope that it would happen something really thrilling, and then the climax. But the end was really superficial, like if the staff of this anime ran out of creativity.The story of Alice to Zouroku presented something interesting in the beginning, but in the end, it ended too cliché and too happy. I\'m not opposed to happy endings, but it\'s because some characters were having hard problems to resolve. And it ended as if the problems didn\'t ever existed.--Art (9/10)--The art remembered me of Madoka Magica, and it was beautiful.--Sound (9/10)--The opening song of this anime is catchy, but the thing is that the song was a little strange to put in the animation.--Character (7/10)--The characters are charismatic, but during some episodes, the title started to lose sense. The name of the anime means ""Alice & Zouroku"", meaning that Zouroku and the main character have a strong connection with each other (I know that the main character isn\'t called Alice). The thing is: Zouroku isn\'t that present in the anime. He appears sometimes, but most of the time is only Sana (main character) and the other ""Alice\'s Dream Girls"". So I think it fits best as ""Alice & Sana"".--Enjoyment (8/10)--The anime was dark and filled with mystery, like Madoka Magica. The first episode was longer than the others, but I didn\'t realized it much, it was very interesting and I couldn\'t stop watching it. The thing that ruined was that ending.--Overall (7/10)--Alice to Zouroku is a good anime, I spent a good time keeping up with it on crunchyroll.

So either they wanted it to seem super eventful or they just gave up on the initial idea? The story itself is very confusing... Why was there an antagonist type character that seems to vanish mid series without much explanation? I would have...enjoyed it more if they focused on one idea and went with it till the end.

I\'m going through my entire watchlist and watching as much as I canAlice and Zoroku is a slice of life mixed with si-fi magical girl aspects.

Without a doubt probably one of the most wholesome animes because of the found family aspects!Animation: 6/10Its not anything ground breaking but I gave it an extra point simply because of 1.The eye candy color scheme 2.I really like the way they made some of...the scenes flow so its a little above averageMusic: 6/10The OP is definitely NOT a skip , its catchy and I like it , the lyrics make sense for the show and its a upbeat song with ACUAL upbeat lyrics!

Ai Yori Aoshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53/Ai_Yori_Aoshi,"[""The story itself isn't out of the ordinary......boy meets girl, falls in love and another 4 girls do the same. However, it is good the way the story develops around the two main characters. The male lead isn't an asshole nor an idiot and that makes him a likable character. The female lead is.....interesting......She doesn't know anything else besides her love for the male lead and it's kinda interesting to see how the story develops around her.There is no tragedy to make the plot a little more complicated (except the facts concerning the past of the main male character which I won't spoil for you),...so all you can expect is love-love in every episode.The motivation of each character is explained and you get to identify with the situation of a few characters, however there are some that only do what they do because they want and that leaves you with the feeling of emptiness.I would recommend this anime if you want a light story of love.... so all you can expect is love-love in every episode.The motivation of each character is explained and you get to identify with the situation of a few characters, however there are some that only do what they do because they want and that leaves you with the feeling of emptiness.I would recommend this anime if you want a light story of love...."", 'Ai Yori Aoshi is a very straight forward one dimensional anime. There isn\'t anything else i could say to describe this anime other that. It\'s a typical lovey dovey through and through, but nothing else.It\'s story is incredibly simple. It\'s a typical harem anime in the sense that the main male character is surrounded by five or six females who all have feelings for him. However it is very evident in the beginning who he will end up with. The story it\'s self does not know what it wants to be. It doesn\'t know whether it wants to be a romance anime that specifically focuses...on the two main characters or a harem anime. Sadly because of this the series takes the horribly awkward approach and tries to do both things, but fails miserably at it.It\'s harem elements are never flushed out enough to ever bring anything to the table, other than two or three episodes, most of which are filled with echhiness rather than the actual problem at hand. The feelings just linger throughout the series with nothing to make note of.The two main characters are forced to hide their relationship, and thus have to ""sneak"" around in order to get any alone time. But this is incredibly misleading, because the backyard is like a different dimension of which no other character is ever allowed to step foot in. Even though the scene\'s done with the two main characters are done correctly and are very nice to watch, there are very few of them and very spread out through the series.It\'s characters however are the weakest part of the show. Most of the characters in this series are plot devices use to simply keep the harem plot moving. They never try to confront their own feelings, they are barelly even aware of it throughout the series.The main characters are just flat, nothing more. They aren\'t deep. Aoi is a character with very little emotion at all, expect that of the love she feels for our main protagonist Kaoru. Kaoru is a character i had hope for. He is the only character that even has a chance of development with the fact they actually take the time to explore his past. But instead of having him confront his past, the allow him to run away from it the entire series, and use the same three clips to show his ""awful"" child hood. He remains flat, undeveloped and almost unlikeable.The art is nothing spectacular. It uses many still frames, and focuses on the characters faces a lot. Not to much attention to detail, at least nothing popped out to me. The characters have a very moe feeling, which is fine since they are really well done, with a lot of detail in their facial features. It\'s not bad but not great either.The sound track of this anime is different. It\'s music when it\'s upbeat is pleasant and easy to listen to. However when every there is anything remotely bad happening it uses the most dramatic and mysterious music ever. I found myself thinking i was watching a murder mystery at many parts rather than a romantic comedy. It\'s original Sub is fine, but avoid the dub at all cost. Despite some decent English VA\'s it is awfully done, one of the worst dubs i have personally come across.Overall if you are in the mood to see a lovely dovey anime with echhi scenes in it than you should give it a try. However if you are looking for an anime with any sort of substance than steer clear of this. on the two main characters or a harem anime.

It's an awesome show!  In my own personal taste, in what I liked to see in an anime, this was what hit the spot.  I'll review this as I have a few others, by category then by my overall take on it.**Story**First of all, the story.  In my opinion, one of the 2 most important aspects of any anime.  You can have crazy action, you can have ecchi-ness and nudity, whatever, but without an actual story that...makes sense and that is fun to follow, there's nothing to be had from watching it.  When I first heard of this anime, I thought it sounded silly - a man who's had some girl devote herself to him since she was little who plans on marrying him and giving herself completely to him.  Who does that?  But as I watched more and more into the show, I began to realize that it was exactly that point that made this story so unique and fresh.  Karou already has Aoi-chan.  She's his, will be his wife one day.  But then you've got a twist that they have to hide it.  Suddenly Karou is surrounded by other girls, and you've got yourself what appears to be a typical harem anime.  However (I won't spoil) there's so much more that happens here and much later into the anime that just makes you root for everyone; Karou and Aoi and all the other characters.**Art**What can I say?  This one is beautiful.  Attention to detail everywhere, from the outfits to the floorboards and walls.  It would see that every scene is fully animated and given great care.  There are several of those &quot;awww&quot; moments with the gorgeous backgrounds, the shading and texturing on the faces, all that jazz.  I really can't say more here, as you just have to see it.**Sound**The only category I did not give a 10.  It takes a lot for me to give an anime a 10 in sound.  In this category I include the music as well as every little sound effect and noise and speech and everything else.  The music was alright, nothing too special, nothing that blew me away.  The sound quality, likewise.  But it was the character's emotions in the voices that made me rate this as high as I did.  You can feel true emotion pouring out.  So well voice acted that at times, you want to cry right along with a character.**Character**The other most important aspect to an anime.  Without a good set of characters and the way they interact, what's left?  A narrative about the beautiful landscape?  No, especially in this show, the characters are a major driving factor.  I would even go so far as to say that characters are what determine, develop and drive a story.  That being said, Ai yori Aoshi brings us some of the most interesting and lovable characters I've seen in an anime.  You've got crazies, you've got adorable cuties, you've got sensitives, hard-asses, uptights, lowlives, and nearly every imaginable kind of character, all represented amazingly well.  The only other thing I can say about this category is that when you have such high quality characters interacting with each other, you're bound to have an emotional response, be it laughter, crying, anger, frustration or something else.  I experienced all these while watching.**Enjoyment**Well, as you can tell thus far, I enjoyed this anime.  Like I mentioned before, I've watched it three times.  There's just something about Aoi-chan that keeps bringing me back to watch this.  Karou, likewise.  He's a great guy.  He genuinely cares for those around him, and especially Aoi-chan.  The same parts that made me cry and laugh and get frustrated the first time had a similar effect the second and third time.  I wouldn't doubt it if I watched it again, I had the same responses.  Not much else to say, other than mentioning that the dialogue and story are what make this so enjoyable to me.**Overall**How do I feel about this anime overall?  Well, obviously I loved it.  One of my favorites.  I rated it a 10 overall.  Why?  As I stated above, all these categories shine out.  I truly enjoyed every aspect of this anime.  I love watching the ending as it feels so resolved (even though they made a sequel, which is also good).  I get such a good feeling after finishing this anime.  If you at all enjoy romance and slice-of-life genres, then you must give this anime a try. makes sense and that is fun to follow, there's nothing to be had from watching it.

The ending is quite good but was quite predictable, but i didnt see no wedding which is what i wanted to see but maybe its in the next season.A nice mix of how the girls all get to like Kaoru was nice development and also the way its portrayed and stuff was amazing overall a MUST for any romance fans. was looking for.This is all in the 1st episode (which i have to say is one of best opening to an anime i have seen) then the rest of episodes are like Love Hina with the day to day life.I would put no more but with the great voice acting of all characters like Tina (whos voice is perfect for that character) and also Aoi and etc....The animation skills are top notch and with a great story and music this is a perfect anime, unlike Love Hina there are a couple straight away but have to hide it from the world due to some reasons you will find out.

Its the kind of anime you don\'t want to end, because you want to watch more of it lol.  Its a great story of a guy and a girl who has pretty much been waiting her whole life to be with him. It is technically a ""harem romance"" but it is really close to just a pure romance, because even though the main character is surrounded by girls, it is very clear who his love is.Like i said earlier, the story is very good about a girl who has been waiting...her whole life to be with the guy she loves and how they interact with each other and the things that they have to go through to be together. It has lots of fun and interesting characters. Unlike traditional harem romances, they main character knows who he loves and wants to be with, unlike the usual premise where he has to decide by the end of the show. The main female character has no doubt of who she wants to be with also. The other girls are also fun and likable, in as much as you don\'t really find yourself rooting against them, even though you know what the primary outcome is going to be.The art and music are also very well done. The art is drawn very well and is bright and colorful. There is a lot of good music in the anime, not just the opening and closing scores but also in the episodes themselves.basically I really enjoyed watching it, to the extent that i have re-watched it 3 times.

What?What makes this story different is that the main male character, Kaoru, is really sweet and he is a one girl kind of guy. True, he is tempted by his housemates a lot but at the end of the day he still truly loves his fiancé and it’s not hard to tell either.As for the main female character Aoi, she’s basically obsessed with her husband to be and has spent basically her whole life training to be a perfect...wife for him. She’s devoted herself to making him happy and she is constantly thinking about him, making it extremely hard for her to hide her undying love for him from the others. (I feel her character pushes the image of what a ""typical women"" should be and I some what dislike her character for that, you\'ll see what I mean.)The plot isn\'t very complicated and is easy to follow, but that doesn\'t mean you’ll know exactly what’s going to happen during the whole course of the anime. The series ends on sort of a cliffhanger so the outcome of their relationship and what happens with their little family is unknown, but it’s not too hard to guess what will happen.Over all this anime is truly beautiful. You learn so much about each character and it’s not hard to notice how happy and loving they all are towards each other.

Watching how quickly they all go from strangers to practically brothers and sisters is truly amazing.', 'In a nutshell, Ai Yori Aoshi is a ""feel good"" kind of anime. It\'s primary strength resides in its pure, innocent and lighthearted storytelling that revolves around the unconditional love shared between 1 man and his 5 female companions. While this kind of story is naive (slice of life tag, what?) as in real life a scenario like this would be highly unlikely and accompanied by more impure feelings (such as lust), I still think that this anime has plenty of good points which I will go over section by section in this review.STORY (7/10) :As outlined in the synopsis, the story follows the...life of the male lead - Kaoru Hanabishi and his fiancee Aoi Sakuraba. Early on in the show we are also introduced to a lot of other [female] characters that will accompany the male lead in virtually every episode. The nature of the story is very episodic and the plot progresses extremely slowly (think To-Love ru). The episodes themselves are mostly based on the adventures (or in some cases shenanigans) of the main cast.Despite the show\'s romcom nature there is still some breathing room for a bit of drama but that aspect is unfortunately curtailed by this show\'s prime flaw - lack of realism. I can say this straight away - your investment in this series will be on a purely abstract basis. Real life harems are a rare thing indeed and difficult to achieve I imagine, not to mention that they would carry a lot of consequences with them (School Days anyone?). As such, the story is slightly detached from reality.That said, there are plenty of positive aspects in the plot - it is extremely straightforward and doesn\'t require much thinking. It almost feels like an accomplishment to be able to understand every single plot point. The major strength however and prime entertainment value resides in Ai Yori Aoshi\'s comedy. While you will certainly find a lot of cliched slapstick moments here, you will also be surprised at the sheer amount of unorthodox comedic content, so to speak. As an example I can say that this is the first anime where I\'ve seen the male lead successfully infiltrate and escape from a women\'s bath house UNDETECTED. Who would have thought that?CHARACTERS (6/10):The characters are definitively likeable. The male lead shows a lot of kindness and understanding to the world around him, hence the rest of the cast is drawn to him like a moth to a flame. The female characters are diligent, hard working bunch of people and rational too. And so in a way you will like the cast simply because they are good, virtuous people.However, the problem with this section is that there is little to virtually no character progression, something that has troubled me tremendously while watching Ai Yori Aoshi. Kaoru and Aoi start off as a shy couple and 12 episodes in (half way through) not much really changes. In the first season, at least, their development is minute and falls short of what I\'d expect to see in a romance themed series. The writers of Ai Yori Aoshi could have definitively squeezed in a lot more focus on those 2 characters.Likewise the rest of the cast stays tremendously underdeveloped and for the most part - shallow. I feel that the time that was used for some of the plot insignificant episodes (there\'s a lot of those) could have been used better to give the cast more substance and depth. More flashbacks, character exclusive episodes that focus more on the plot etc.ART (8/10)The animation in Ai Yori Aoshi is exceptionally good when you consider that it aired 12 years ago. Everything is fluid and crisp through the entire length of the series. The studio has paid attention not only to the characters but also static backgrounds and such.For today\'s standards the quality of art in this anime would probably be considered average or sub-par. In comparison with recent animes I would have to drop 1 or 2 points from this section however I am being lenient here because I\'m rating this anime in comparison with other works from around that time. Bearing that in mind, the artwork IS pretty good.SOUND (8/10)Likewise, the sound department of Ai Yori Aoshi maintains a high standard. The OST is truly original and features some really heartwarming pieces. The quality of the music is good, the music itself fits in perfectly with the overall tone of the series and additionally, there is a tune for every single occasion.The only two minuses here would be the opening and ending song. They were fairly bland and I found myself skipping them after hearing them once.ENJOYMENT (9/10)The strongest aspect of Ai Yori Aoshi. I have enjoyed this anime a lot. Despite the numerous pitfalls (especially the underdeveloped cast) I liked the story for what it was. A stress free, easy to follow love story that is sure to cheer up even the most depressed individuals. Watching this anime is good for the soul. I\'d prescribe Ai Yori Aoshi to any individual who feels that the weight of life is turning them into a cynical and harsh being. The sheer innocence and purity of the romance contained in here is staggering. I\'m not delusional however and I realise the naivety of the plot, but that doesn\'t make it any less enjoyable. Who doesn\'t like to immerse in a fantasy every now and then?OVERALL (8/10)A truly appropriate rating for this anime would be 7,5. However MAL\'s rating system is rather limited and 7,5 would round up to 8 anyway so that is the grade I will go with.To recap, the strengths : Heartwarming tale, good comedy, good art, good soundtrack, high enjoyabilityWeaknesses : Shallow characters, slow plot progression, nearly non-existent character progressionAll things considered however, it is still a very good anime. Solid 8 points. life of the male lead - Kaoru Hanabishi and his fiancee Aoi Sakuraba. Early on in the show we are also introduced to a lot of other [female] characters that will accompany the male lead in virtually every episode. The nature of the story is very episodic and the plot progresses extremely slowly (think To-Love ru). The episodes themselves are mostly based on the adventures (or in some cases shenanigans) of the main cast.Despite the show\'s romcom nature there is still some breathing room for a bit of drama but that aspect is unfortunately curtailed by this show\'s prime flaw - lack of realism. I can say this straight away - your investment in this series will be on a purely abstract basis. Real life harems are a rare thing indeed and difficult to achieve I imagine, not to mention that they would carry a lot of consequences with them (School Days anyone?). As such, the story is slightly detached from reality.That said, there are plenty of positive aspects in the plot - it is extremely straightforward and doesn\'t require much thinking. It almost feels like an accomplishment to be able to understand every single plot point. The major strength however and prime entertainment value resides in Ai Yori Aoshi\'s comedy. While you will certainly find a lot of cliched slapstick moments here, you will also be surprised at the sheer amount of unorthodox comedic content, so to speak. As an example I can say that this is the first anime where I\'ve seen the male lead successfully infiltrate and escape from a women\'s bath house UNDETECTED. Who would have thought that?CHARACTERS (6/10):The characters are definitively likeable. The male lead shows a lot of kindness and understanding to the world around him, hence the rest of the cast is drawn to him like a moth to a flame. The female characters are diligent, hard working bunch of people and rational too. And so in a way you will like the cast simply because they are good, virtuous people.However, the problem with this section is that there is little to virtually no character progression, something that has troubled me tremendously while watching Ai Yori Aoshi. Kaoru and Aoi start off as a shy couple and 12 episodes in (half way through) not much really changes. In the first season, at least, their development is minute and falls short of what I\'d expect to see in a romance themed series. The writers of Ai Yori Aoshi could have definitively squeezed in a lot more focus on those 2 characters.Likewise the rest of the cast stays tremendously underdeveloped and for the most part - shallow. I feel that the time that was used for some of the plot insignificant episodes (there\'s a lot of those) could have been used better to give the cast more substance and depth. More flashbacks, character exclusive episodes that focus more on the plot etc.ART (8/10)The animation in Ai Yori Aoshi is exceptionally good when you consider that it aired 12 years ago. Everything is fluid and crisp through the entire length of the series. The studio has paid attention not only to the characters but also static backgrounds and such.For today\'s standards the quality of art in this anime would probably be considered average or sub-par. In comparison with recent animes I would have to drop 1 or 2 points from this section however I am being lenient here because I\'m rating this anime in comparison with other works from around that time. Bearing that in mind, the artwork IS pretty good.SOUND (8/10)Likewise, the sound department of Ai Yori Aoshi maintains a high standard. The OST is truly original and features some really heartwarming pieces. The quality of the music is good, the music itself fits in perfectly with the overall tone of the series and additionally, there is a tune for every single occasion.The only two minuses here would be the opening and ending song. They were fairly bland and I found myself skipping them after hearing them once.ENJOYMENT (9/10)The strongest aspect of Ai Yori Aoshi. I have enjoyed this anime a lot. Despite the numerous pitfalls (especially the underdeveloped cast) I liked the story for what it was. A stress free, easy to follow love story that is sure to cheer up even the most depressed individuals. Watching this anime is good for the soul. I\'d prescribe Ai Yori Aoshi to any individual who feels that the weight of life is turning them into a cynical and harsh being. The sheer innocence and purity of the romance contained in here is staggering. I\'m not delusional however and I realise the naivety of the plot, but that doesn\'t make it any less enjoyable.

Solid 8 points.', 'When I watch this anime, I feel touch by the way the romance goes, this is probably the only anime (that I know of) were the lead male character actually ends up with his childhood friend ( he only met her once as kids) and the lead male did actually lived up as to what he is about. Also,I really do admire the lead female character for living up as a ""Yamato Nadeshiku,"" the two are a perfect match. So how do I rate this:Story: Very Good 8I like the romance on which the lead female character is so in love with the male lead...that she herself went out of her way to look for him and also despite of other temptations of the other ladies involve he remains true to the female lead.Art: Very Good 8The art is ok so there is nothing more to say.Sound: a decent number 4.I hate the opening theme.Character: a fair number 6.There isn\'t much to say about the characters and about their roles, but I do have a lot of awkward questions about them- OK  I know it\'s just an anime but I  just like asking it anyway,so  let\'s start:Karou- Ok,so he\'s a college student, but what was he taking up in college? We do know that he and his grandfather never got along and he always ends up beaten with a bamboo cane in the back, good thing that he was still able to maintain his sanity and not sustained any spinal fracture. So for him to have those whip marks on his back  his grandpapy  should be using a whip not a bamboo cane or a some kind of kendo stick thing whatever.Aoi- my question for this character is:-Did she had a normal teenage life or was she just confined to learned how to cook, do origami, sing, do  household chores or any other stuffs that traditional  Japanese women do?-Is she younger than Karou or are they at the same age?-Did she actually attend school or was she just home schooled?-Does she ever wore any other clothes other than a  Yukata?-Since she\'s rich,I wonder as to why didn\'t she enrolled in the same college as Karou?Miyabi- my question for her is:-Did she also enjoyed a normal teenage life or was she confined to be Aoi\'s Babysitter/bodyguard/ playmate?-I wonder as to how old is she and if she\'s gonna get married?Tina-- Now why does she have to attend college in Japan when she can go to any of the top universities in the US?Taeko--If she\'s so clumsy, I wonder if she\'s as clumsy with her grades?Enjoyment: a fair number 6So far, even if this anime has a comedy tag in it, it is still the romance and drama part that is more profound.Overall: It is a very good number 8.No need for me to discuss. that she herself went out of her way to look for him and also despite of other temptations of the other ladies involve he remains true to the female lead.Art: Very Good 8The art is ok so there is nothing more to say.Sound: a decent number 4.I hate the opening theme.Character: a fair number 6.There isn\'t much to say about the characters and about their roles, but I do have a lot of awkward questions about them- OK  I know it\'s just an anime but I  just like asking it anyway,so  let\'s start:Karou- Ok,so he\'s a college student, but what was he taking up in college?

What\'s happening in his life right now is nothing to complain about, why would he even dare to complain when at his doorstep a lovely & very charming girl is claiming that he is her husband to be? But it all goes down to a clan he left for a painful memories of his childhood...Can Aoi make him forget that past?

Don't know why but , whenever i watch Ai Yori Aoshi , i always feel like i have seen this type of characters , storyline etc. Just can't put my brain into it . Then , i suddenly realise that what i was thinking about is that this anime is so cliche .The story is like any other romance genre where a guy named Kaoru Hanabishi goes to college and then went home . On his way to the train station , he then meet a...girl wearing a kimono and that is our lovely heroine , Aoi Sakuraba . She suddenly fall to the ground because she was push by someone . Then , you guess it . Her shiny knight came to rescue her . See ? It's like the same kind of stuff that happens a lot in anime . Girl in distress . Hero came to the rescue . Though i admit that this kind of stuff happen on other anime quite often . I can't say more on the storylines because im afraid that it will be like a spoiler .The arts and animation here are average . Some sceneries and animation on Ai Yori Aoshi are beautiful and some are dull . Thats what you get from watching an anime that was from 2002 . I admit that because its from that kind of year , i was expecting this kind of arts and animation . But , it could have been better because other anime that was from 2002 has better arts and animation . Why can't this anime be like that ? I don't really know actually...Moving onto the sounds , i won't lie that the voice actors here does sometimes annoyed me , but for me it was good . It doesn't annoyed me too much or too often to the point that i just wanted to drop the series . It tends to annoyed me where they try to make a comedy but fail because of the voice actors . The opening theme song and ending were good . Not too good . Nothing i like or didn't like about the opening and ending theme songs . All i can say is that the sounds for this are average .The characters here does have its background and stuff . the girls in this anime tends to fall for the mc either its because she is a childhood friend or because he was so nice to her or to something that i don't even know . It could have been a better harem genre where at least give a true reason on why she likes him . Just because he was nice doesn't hold a true purpose here . The backgrounds of each characters also need to be improve because it just look like they were lazy to think about a background that they just put on whatever they can think off . All i can say is that it need some improvement .Onto the enjoyment . I can't really say that i enjoy it too much but i can say that i enjoy it too little . Of all the comedy they were making , only some of them did make me laugh . Others didn't even reach me because it tries to hard to make jokes but fail to do so . I also didn't enjoy the story plot here because of the clicheness that exist in this anime . Either way , i didn't enjoy most of them .Overall , i can say that this anime does need a lot of improvement on the characters , the story plot etc. If you were into a romance genre , this is for you . But , don't get your hopes up on other genre that exist here or hoping that this anime is not like any others out there . If you simply want to watch old animes that have romance in it , then give this anime a try . I must warn you that this anime is very predictable Where you can actually predict whats gonna happen next . Just like me . girl wearing a kimono and that is our lovely heroine , Aoi Sakuraba .

Yes, there are several other female characters, all of whom seem to have feelings for the male lead, but he (as I said) is pretty kind about things. The female lead is positively beyond human--patient, kind, and generally perfect to a point that is impossible for a real person.  It's a happy, uplifting show. Absolutely wonderful. "", ""You really can't judge an anime based on the synopsis and reviews alone because there will be anime out there that everybody hated but you actually will like. I myself have experienced this many times hence I always give all anime a try. Ai Yori Aoshi is a good example of this. The synopsis sounded like it was written by a pubescent virgin and the reviews weren't that good either, but after finishing the series I found out that there is more to this anime than what it looks like in the outside and I ended up enjoying it more than I should have.Ai Yori...Aoshi or Bluer than Indigo is adapted from a manga with the same name and back then it was a actually a pretty popular manga for older guys. The story revolves around Kaoru Hanabishi, a college student with a traumatic childhood. Kaoru is from the wealthy Hanabishi clan, albeit an illegitimate child. His grandfather hated him resulting in very abusive treatments, until one day he finally decides to cut off all his ties with the Hanabishi clan and start living on his own. Kaoru has been living peacefully on his own but that will all change when a person from his past appears again. Who is it? well it's none other than his ex-fiancé Ai. Sounds cheesy and cliché? it is.The story and characters of Ai Yori Aoshi is pretty much a rip-off of Love Hina, only without the tsundere bitch and the wimpy main protagonist instantly making it a hundred times better. I found Ai yori Aoshi's characters more likeable especially Ai who's basically the perfect wife that doesn't exist in real life. I really like how the series shows how Kaoru and Ai grew their relationship together. They really are perfect for each other. This is something I always look for when watching romance - a brilliant chemistry between the main couple.I like watching harem anime, it's just one of my guilty pleasures. However, this is a harem anime I would have much preferred if it's just a standard love triangle because I only really cared about the relationship between the two main characters Ai and Kaoru and the other characters were pretty much non-existent to me.The biggest flaw of this anime is the pacing which is generally slow. Being a slice-of-life romance anime it was kind of expected. There weren't much conflict in the series but the little drama that it has was pretty well done in my opinion. The animation and art style is okay, it's something you would expect from a series that aired in 2002. There's nothing noteworthy in the music department maybe except for ending theme song which I really liked.Overall I would say I really enjoyed watching this anime but I will understand if the majority of viewers will find this to be one boring shit. If you like slow-paced romance anime where it focuses more in growing the relationship of the main couple rather than throwing conflicts and drama left and right then you might want check out this one.

Both Kaoru and Aoi faced many obstacles that prevented their happiness, but in the end the true feelings are much stronger than obstacles.The message is very clear here and to me always staying true to ones feelings will overcome almost any obstacle that is put to prevent happiness.Story: I liked the first part of the introduction story regarding the Sakuraba and Hanabishi family. It was interesting to see every character's background story covered in detail. In my opinion the story did not lack anything, it had comedy, romance, and serious moments as...well.Art: For an anime made around 2002 the Art was pretty good. Every character didn't look overused, and the animation was very well done. My only complaint has to be Chika-chan's tanning because she has lighter skin tone in the ares where she has clothes on. I honestly found it annoying with Chika-chan's skin tone lighter in different areas because it made it seem that she had some sort of pigment problem or she wasn't getting her skin vitamins.Sound: Both Opening songs were fantastic. Honestly the way the Opening songs showed the past of the characters was very well done also. The second opening song is slightly different and in the end it compliments the  true feelings of Kaoru and Aoi in the ending.Character: I was surprised with the way Kaoru behaved throughout the entire series. I was expecting some type of multiple lover issues but that's not the case. Kaoru is a guy who is respectful, has true feelings for someone, and despite being surrounded by girls every day he doesn't let his manly emotions get the best of him. Every character's personality was very well done too. There was a lot of balance in this anime regarding personalities. I was also impressed with Tina because she was a very energetic girl who was open for any adventure, and to see her behave properly at home an not act all hyper was simply impressive.Enjoyment: Every episode I enjoyed to the fullest. Comedy + Romance make it very interesting to watch in my opinion. The story also played a role because I wanted to know how things were going to end.Overall: Even if there wasn't a 2nd season the ending was very well done and in my opinion this first season lived up to my expectations. I expected an anime that would make me laugh, keep me wanting for more, and also thinking about the message being sent: Stay true to your feelings and do not lose hope on what you are working for. well.Art: For an anime made around 2002 the Art was pretty good.

I may come out as being cynical towards it but yet I got every reason to and I don’t know about this one, as I don’t feel that cynical towards this title mainly because of its story. So what is it about, you ask? Oh, did I mention that the title in English is actually...called Bluer than Indigo?Kaoru Hanabishi, a college student who lives alone, met a beautiful but bewildered girl dressed in kimono at train station. He volunteered to guide her way to the address she was looking for, which looked like in his neighborhood but turned out to be an empty lot. Not knowing what to do next, Kaoru invited the devastated girl to his apartment and asked for additional clue -- a photo with two children whom Kaoru immediately identified as himself and Aoi Sakuraba, his childhood friend. It turned out that the girl in front of him is Aoi Sakuraba herself, his betrothed fiancée who came all the way to Tokyo to marry him. Her revelation was not only surprising but also reminded the deepest part of Kaoru's memory for why he left the Hanabishi family in the first place.Well, what can I say? The romance between Aoi and Kaoru is really the heart of the show and I was really rooting for those two to get together and make it last with the drama of their families keeping them apart makes it more interesting, like a rendition of a classic love story……….BUT………unfortunately, as the series starts strong, it limps into almost Love Hina/any harem category when the main plot is sidestepped by the additional characters of the story. I get that reason for their existence is that Kaoru can have someone as family to him considering his mother abandoned him and his family kicked him out of his home and I would be fine with that, if the characters weren’t just the basic harem archetypes…but then again, it could be worse.Also, I’m impressed with how long they kept the secret of Aoi & Kaoru being together from the tenants as some other shows would have somebody knowing about it halfway….that or some of the tenants aren’t that bright.But like I said, the only interesting characters in the show are Aoi and Kaoru and yet, there are some things that I don’t like about them. For example, Aoi is about as adorable as a character can be, but she is more like an otaku’s waifu dream and that’s not a good thing. She’s more of a fantasy self-insert character that only wants to be that guy’s wife and nothing more. Kaoru is the more reserved character but not the generic passive, simpering moron you see in most harem shows although that does lead to the next problem of why so many of the girls in the show are attracted to him. First, there’s the token American character Tina Foster, the very energetic and loud character whom loves animals, drinking a lot of booze, and can often play grabby hands once it comes to Taeko, the accident-prone and ditzy bespectacled girl who’s only purpose in the anime is being either cosplay fetish…..oh, did I forget to mention that she has big breasts? Miyabi, Aoi’s bodyguard, is the one character who at first, I thought I would hate but actually she’s one of the better characters of the show….well, her and the pet ferret. Mayu, the prodigy, is the worst offender of them all as she is the most annoying character of the show, up to Love Hina levels, as she keeps going on and on about being with Kaoru and often fights with Tina, which makes her more bearable in comparison and last is Chika, Taeko’s cousin, who looks up to Kaoru as an older brother, but thankfully, not in a creepy way.The animation by J.C. Staff is very artsy in its own way. The scenery is like what most amateur painters would want to capture in their own canvas. There were a few mishaps in some parts of it, mostly the gag-based animation, but it still holds to being alright. The music is sweet and gentle as the show fits although the opening and ending themes do nothing for me other than skip through them.The Pioneer (Geneon) / Bang Zoom dub was more of a miss than hit. Michelle Ruff as Aoi was convincing enough to enjoy it and Dave Wittenberg was listenable as Kaoru but Wendee Lee’s portrayal of Tina Foster was just unbearably obnoxious and grating as she tries to sound like a drunken Texan; Karen Strassman (or Kirsty Pape) and Sue Beth Arden’s performances were a bit too high with their voices and mostly irritating, coming from Strassman’s performance. There is also an unrecognizable Kari Wahlgren (Kay Jensen) as Chika and honestly, I thought it was some other actress doing that voice….and I checked the VA’s of this show beforehand.FINAL VERDICT: The show does feel like another harem clone in the making if it weren’t for the romantic love story angle that kept the show from being bad, but you should give the show a chance to look at before judgment. called Bluer than Indigo?Kaoru Hanabishi, a college student who lives alone, met a beautiful but bewildered girl dressed in kimono at train station.

Kaoru is the more reserved character but not the generic passive, simpering moron you see in most harem shows although that does lead to the next problem of why so many of the girls in the show are attracted to him. First, there’s the token American character Tina Foster, the very energetic and loud character whom loves animals, drinking a lot of booze, and can often play grabby hands once it comes to Taeko, the accident-prone and ditzy bespectacled girl who’s only purpose in the anime is being either cosplay fetish…..oh, did I forget to mention that she has big breasts? Miyabi, Aoi’s bodyguard, is the one character who at first, I thought I would hate but actually she’s one of the better characters of the show….well, her and the pet ferret. Mayu, the prodigy, is the worst offender of them all as she is the most annoying character of the show, up to Love Hina levels, as she keeps going on and on about being with Kaoru and often fights with Tina, which makes her more bearable in comparison and last is Chika, Taeko’s cousin, who looks up to Kaoru as an older brother, but thankfully, not in a creepy way.The animation by J.C. Staff is very artsy in its own way. The scenery is like what most amateur painters would want to capture in their own canvas. There were a few mishaps in some parts of it, mostly the gag-based animation, but it still holds to being alright. The music is sweet and gentle as the show fits although the opening and ending themes do nothing for me other than skip through them.The Pioneer (Geneon) / Bang Zoom dub was more of a miss than hit. Michelle Ruff as Aoi was convincing enough to enjoy it and Dave Wittenberg was listenable as Kaoru but Wendee Lee’s portrayal of Tina Foster was just unbearably obnoxious and grating as she tries to sound like a drunken Texan; Karen Strassman (or Kirsty Pape) and Sue Beth Arden’s performances were a bit too high with their voices and mostly irritating, coming from Strassman’s performance. There is also an unrecognizable Kari Wahlgren (Kay Jensen) as Chika and honestly, I thought it was some other actress doing that voice….and I checked the VA’s of this show beforehand.FINAL VERDICT: The show does feel like another harem clone in the making if it weren’t for the romantic love story angle that kept the show from being bad, but you should give the show a chance to look at before judgment."", 'Ai Yori Aoishi is good, if you\'re looking for a light-hearted happy anime where two people basically chase each other down, to what appears to be at no avail.Aoi is basically your typical hopeless romantic, prepared to give her heart and soul to Kaoru-sama, who is much less than interested, with sporadic bursts of feelings for her at his own convience. The characters aren\'t very well developed in terms of their personalities and what makes them so in love, all we really know is that Kaoru has many girls attracted to him, and Aoi is relentlessly competing for Kaoru\'s attention. You know where it\'s...going to end up, though, right? Yeah, because it\'s very typically Shoujo.The plot is only as well-developed as the characters are, and at times it can be very good - just light hearted and fluffy. It\'s basically a typical boy-meets-girl harem Anime.The art is very good, but it\'s more a Moe or ""Kawaii"" style than detailed. The men look somewhat Bishounen, and the girls just look ""cute"".Overall, it\'s a very good anime, but very fluffy. going to end up, though, right?

The men look somewhat Bishounen, and the girls just look ""cute"".Overall, it\'s a very good anime, but very fluffy.', 'Note: This will be a review of both seasons.Overview:""Ai Yori Aoshi"" is a slice-of life romance anime that first aired nearly two decades ago, and since then has faded into almost complete obscurity. As someone who happened to come across and watch it myself, I think that is a real shame, as it has many strengths that set it apart from most of its genre while also lacking many of the things that make many other examples annoying. The result is a very mature and nuanced romance story that, while by no means perfect, should definitely appeal to any older person who enjoys the genre.Story...(7.5/10)Set in Tokyo, college student Kaoru Hanabishi comes across a young woman wearing a kimono, and offers to help her find the person she has been looking for. After a series of events, however, he discovers that the man she has been trying to find is actually him, and the woman in front of him is actually his childhood friend Aoi Sakuraba, whom he hasn\'t seen in a whopping 18 years. While that would be surprising enough, the truly shocking thing about his meeting is that Aoi is engaged to be his wife, a role she has spent her entire life preparing for. Unfortunately, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem, as Kaoru left his family a long time ago as a result of constant abuse, as well as the fact that he was never really one of them since his parents never married. Ultimately, when it\'s clear that Aoi won\'t give up on Kaoru, her family reaches a compromise with her- they will allow them to be together, but in the meantime they will live in a summer mansion owned by the Sakurabas, with various people joining them as the series goes on. During this time, Kaoru and Aoi must keep their relationship secret, with Aoi posing as the landlady, in order to avoid shaming the Sakuraba family.I can\'t say that there\'s an awful lot to the plot, but there doesn\'t really need to be. Rather than having a group of extremely dysfunctional people, the story is instead focused on developing the relationship between Karou and Aoi, and it does so in the most realistic way possible. Overtime, they are joined in the summer home by various other girls, and while this does result in a harem, it\'s by no means the focus, as Aoi has already won within the first few episodes. The focus instead is the story of two people who will not only to anything for each other, but will do absolutely anything to be together, no matter how much the world seems to be attempting to keep them apart from one another, which makes for a really sweet and heartwarming love story.Unfortunately, the pacing of the series could definitely be better. It takes three-and-a-half episodes for the story to really start, a lot of which consists of Kaoru and Aoi talking in the former\'s old apartment. While this does provide exposition regarding the two\'s relationship as well as Kaoru\'s troubled past, I still couldn\'t help but feel that it didn\'t need to be as long as it was. And while things do get better once the rest of the cast are introduced, the main obstacle regarding Kaoru and Aoi\'s relationship is more or less resolved at the end of the first season, making the second season, ""Enishi"", feel like little more than a sequence of side stories since none of them to anything to resolve any other of the plot points. That\'s not to say these are necessarily bad, however, as episode 9 in particular has probably the single most romantic moment in the entire show. Ultimately, though, the story ends incomplete, which will leave you believing the series needed a few more episodes to really wrap things up.Art & Animation (8/10):""Ai Yori Aoshi"" has very good art for its time that still manages to hold up even to this day. The characters are all very well drawn and the environments don\'t look bad either. The fanservice is also kept to a decent level, as the series definitely knows when do use it and when not to. It can get a bit odd during comedic moments, however, such when a character\'s facial expression gets wacky and their nose disappears for no reason, which I have always found to be an unnecessary feature in anime.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):""Ai Yori Aoshi""\'s soundtrack is best described as unconventional, but great. While there were no tracks in particular that stood out, the music as a whole has this very romantic, Japanese feel to it that really fits the tone of the story, and especially emphasizes the most romantic moments in the series. The voice acting is great as well, with Dave Wittenberg and Michelle Ruff delivering great performances as Kaoru and Aoi, respectively, and Wendee Lee giving Tina a hilariously exaggerated Texan accent that somehow fits her perfectly. Overall, I would definitely call this the best part of the whole series.Characters (8/10):On the surface, Kaoru may seem like your typical nice guy protagonist, albeit a few years older than the norm. However, his usually cheerful demeanor is largely just a front, and he\'s secretly very hurting with plenty of scars, both emotional and physical as a result of being abused by the Hanabishis. While he\'s definitely kind-hearted, he\'s also prone to a mixture of anger and depression whenever he\'s reminded of his past. After meeting Aoi, he slowly grows to realise that he had nothing to live for before he reunited with her, and now he can stop wondering why he was born to begin with. All in all, he\'s a very well-written and sympathetic character, and later episodes show him slowly start to heal and change for the better. Besides that, he\'s also very mature and refreshingly loyal, as whenever he starts to show attraction to someone besides Aoi, he\'s just as quick to shrug it off, reminding himself that Aoi is his only love and the other girls who surround him are just friends.My favourite character, however, would have to be Aoi herself. As kind as Kaoru is, Aoi gives him a run for his money, as she is never seen getting angry or saying something bad about anyone. While such behaviour is perfectly normal in Japan, some Westerners may find the idea of a girl preparing their whole life to be someone\'s wife as sexist, and I\'ve even seen some complain that whenever a girl acts tough in anime, it\'s always a cover-up for some insecurity. But really, how many pieces of Western media portray traditional feminine traits as being worthless and imply that women must masculinise themselves in order to be taken seriously? The answer is \'more than I can count\' so it\'s good to know that there are at least some people out there who understand the value of feminine traits and that while your gender may not define you as a person, it\'s rather childish to believe it doesn\'t matter at all. While Aoi starts off very shy, she\'s definitely not weak, as she defies her family time and time again to be with Kaoru, showing that it\'s something she wants and will make HER happy rather than the will of someone else. Her character doesn\'t revolve solely around Kaoru, either, as she interacts plenty with the rest of the cast and goes through some genuine character development, showing that Kaoru is just as good an influence on her as she is on him.The rest of the cast aren\'t quite as good, but they\'re still far from bad. One example is Tina Foster, an American woman who attends the same university as Kaoru. She and Kaoru met in the past when he first started college, and she joins the Sakuraba summer house due to not having a place to stay, having just come back from a trip around the world. To sum her up, she\'s very loud and outspoken, and often greets women by groping their breasts, basically making her the complete opposite of Aoi. While she\'s mostly comic relief in the beginning, she becomes a much more serious character when her insecurties come to light, particularly those in regard to her hopeless crush on Kaoru, which would probably be returned if it weren\'t for Aoi. There\'s also Miyabi Kagurazaki, Aoi\'s caretaker and the manager of the summer house who is the only one besides them who knows the truth about Kaoru and Aoi\'s relationship. While she starts off quite cold to Kaoru, it\'s mostly because she wants what\'s best for Aoi and she eventually accepts Kaoru upon realising just how good a match he and Aoi really are.Next up is Taeko Minazuki, a woman who attends the same university as Kaoru and Tina and is in the same club as them as well. She soon joins the Sakuraba household as the maid, though she\'s not that good at it due to being very clumsy. Along with Tina, she serves as the main comic relief of the series, perhaps even more so as she doesn\'t become more serious later on, even if she does have quite a sad backstory. My least favourite of the major cast would have to be Mayu Miyuki, a spoiled rich girl who, like Aoi, has been in love with Kaoru since she was young. Unlike Aoi, however, her crush is very unrealistic, and more often than not she is very bratty and rude, though she does at least have a sympathetic excuse and some rare cases of being kind. There\'s also surprisingly few incidents of Kaoru getting beat up by girls, as whenever he ends up in a compromising situation, he\'s nearly always given a chance to explain himself, as they know he\'s not the kind of person to be doing that sort of thing. Overall, I really liked the characters, though some far more than others.Enjoyment (8/10):Mature it may be, ""Ai Yori Aoshi"" remains a very lighthearted series throughout. When it\'s not being sweet or heartwarming, it\'s being really funny. This is in no small part thanks to Tina and Taeko, but Kaoru also gets in on the fun whenever he has perverted fantasies about Aoi, which can get pretty hilarious. The slow pacing may hurt the enjoyment for some, but hopefully not so much that it ever gets boring, as that wasn\'t the case for me.Overall:""Ai Yori Aoshi"" is a deeply touching, very heartwarming and extremely mature love story that has been sadly overlooked by the newer generation, to the point that nowadays you\'ll hear people talk about it once in a blue moon. It definitely requires a good understanding of Japanese culture to truly enjoy, if you get past that you will be rewarded with very likable characters and a great soundtrack, and a number of really touching, heartwarming moments. While the story may feel somewhat incomplete, I nevertheless believe that any romantic drama fan will walk away satisfied.Score:7.5+8+9+8+8=40.5/50=8.1/10 (7.5/10)Set in Tokyo, college student Kaoru Hanabishi comes across a young woman wearing a kimono, and offers to help her find the person she has been looking for.

A boy who isn’t liked because he denounced his name and a girl who wishes nothing more then to be with him even against her parents wishes. It’s a rather romantic story, and then they have to add everyone else into the mix and well, we get this. Not to say this show is bad, its just… it gets dull after a while with pretty much every trick in the book being done to keep the two apart from roommates that get in a way to time they have separated from each...other and even the family problems. I’m happy it’s not a slice of life in a school (and it’s not… technically…) but it sure feels like one. I most of the time wanted to bash a couple heads together and yell ‘GET TO THE POINT!’ but yet, I have to sit through some of the slowest moving pieces until someone finally gets to a punchline and then I feel myself sitting there sometimes asking ‘how the heck did that happen and where was the fun?’ I do have to mention now that this is one of my favorites of the genre, its just does have a lot of flaws though the good points.Ai is so adorable though her personality is a little two innocent. She seems way to matter of fact and logical. She also sounds like a broken record in that she keeps going on about becoming his wife. She feels much like a Mary Sue character in that with almost everything she does, she does well and the stuff she isn’t good at is done in a way that makes her more Moe (and now I’m thinking about Konata’s saying from Lucky Star ‘Clumsy is sexy…’) to the point where I just want to smack her. Luckily, she doesn’t go into the realm that I would want her to be attacked by one of the girls from When They Cry, but she sometimes gets close to it. Kaoru though seems well put together or else it’s because he is around crazy people. Sometimes I even wonder if they put him in the middle of all these crazies just to show how bland he really was. There are times though that I wish he wasn’t so easily pushed into doing things he didn’t want to do or would hurt Ai if she took it the wrong way. Unfortunately, both main characters are actually less interesting then the characters around them and the story just seemed to become dull just because I wanted to learn more about the characters and it wouldn’t let me. The arrange marriage thing is hard for me to think of in the modem day sense and makes me wonder if it actually happens still. There is a lot of fan service in this and it makes me feel really sad because it really didn’t need it!Now we go into the extras and the reason why I call them extras and not supporting characters is this… they do not support anything. They are there to tear the two main characters apart and bring comedy into what could be even more boring story plot. I think without them, I would never have been able to get into the story. Their fun antics, although annoying at times, made me smile and laugh to break up the tension of a hard core sad areas. I do believe without them, the ending would not be as heart retching as it was because it seemed to have more meaning.The artwork is so beautiful and shows a lot of detail throughout the show. The backgrounds are rich in detail for the most part but there are times that it looks rather low in contrast. The comical points are really odd looking, where most of the artwork during that time pretty much lacks. The opening is rather nice in following the sweet music for that. But seems almost like Ranma’s opening in how they made it.The Voices are interesting, and Ai’s seems way too breathy. The English is a little off, almost like it’s a exact translation and I wish they would change it a bit. Some characters were a little creepy in voice and I was a little disappointed in that. The Japanese is alright even if it’s pretty standard for this type of show. The Japanese and English Ai sound very close to each other. It’s a little nice that way but also somewhat bothersome.The music is so pretty for the opening and closing that I actually looked for the opening music on its own. The other background music is a little to sappy even for the happy moments and sometimes breaks the mood. other and even the family problems. I’m happy it’s not a slice of life in a school (and it’s not… technically…) but it sure feels like one. I most of the time wanted to bash a couple heads together and yell ‘GET TO THE POINT!’ but yet, I have to sit through some of the slowest moving pieces until someone finally gets to a punchline and then I feel myself sitting there sometimes asking ‘how the heck did that happen and where was the fun?’ I do have to mention now that this is one of my favorites of the genre, its just does have a lot of flaws though the good points.Ai is so adorable though her personality is a little two innocent. She seems way to matter of fact and logical. She also sounds like a broken record in that she keeps going on about becoming his wife. She feels much like a Mary Sue character in that with almost everything she does, she does well and the stuff she isn’t good at is done in a way that makes her more Moe (and now I’m thinking about Konata’s saying from Lucky Star ‘Clumsy is sexy…’) to the point where I just want to smack her. Luckily, she doesn’t go into the realm that I would want her to be attacked by one of the girls from When They Cry, but she sometimes gets close to it. Kaoru though seems well put together or else it’s because he is around crazy people. Sometimes I even wonder if they put him in the middle of all these crazies just to show how bland he really was. There are times though that I wish he wasn’t so easily pushed into doing things he didn’t want to do or would hurt Ai if she took it the wrong way. Unfortunately, both main characters are actually less interesting then the characters around them and the story just seemed to become dull just because I wanted to learn more about the characters and it wouldn’t let me. The arrange marriage thing is hard for me to think of in the modem day sense and makes me wonder if it actually happens still. There is a lot of fan service in this and it makes me feel really sad because it really didn’t need it!Now we go into the extras and the reason why I call them extras and not supporting characters is this… they do not support anything. They are there to tear the two main characters apart and bring comedy into what could be even more boring story plot. I think without them, I would never have been able to get into the story. Their fun antics, although annoying at times, made me smile and laugh to break up the tension of a hard core sad areas. I do believe without them, the ending would not be as heart retching as it was because it seemed to have more meaning.The artwork is so beautiful and shows a lot of detail throughout the show.

The elements Ai Yori Aoshi are wonderful.Anyway lets talk about those really great parts. Ai Yori, is all about wonderful characters. All of them are wonderful, and most are pretty damn believable with the possible exception of Aoi who may well be too perfect. The series even manages to create layer after layer of detail. What are initially anime stereotype characters...all become marvelously complex. By the end of the series they are all well fleshed out and feel like old acquaintances.The comedy is also pretty good, it\'s not at side splitting belly laugh level but it is definitely there and you will find yourself smiling and chuckling quite a bit.The story is rather mediocre but that isn\'t a negative. It\'s definitely a sitcom and in a sitcom the story is just there to provide a vehicle for the characters to interact with each other. Ai Yori\'s story manages this very well. Just don\'t expect it to go anyplace in the anime.On the presentation side Ai Yori does a pretty solid job. Regarding the English Dub, the voice acting was very solid. While there could have been more emotional range the characterization was spot on. Music was also very on target.The art, oh my the art. The faces and facial expressions are just wonderful There\'s no trying to remember hair and eyecolor combos with this anime. People are distinct and memorable. Unfortunately the rest of the art is really crude. 1960s or 1970s American cartoon level. It still works well and doesn\'t detract from the enjoyment.What did detract from the enjoyment ? Not sure I know. Maybe it just wasn\'t bingeable ? Maybe it was despite the fact a story really wasn\'t needed, it still needed a little resolution ? Maybe a little change in their situations ?  Despite the difficult to pinpoint problems this was still very well worth the watching all become marvelously complex.

It will not be based on events that take place in the second season.)OK, so while I\'m rather late to the party with this anime, I feel like I should share my thoughts on it because I don\'t think the reviews made so far have really done the show justice. Apparently this is either the best, worst, or most mediocre romance anime ever, all in the extremes. In reality, this show isn\'t as black and white as that.Ai Yori Aoshi has two devastating problems at its core, and these problems together only intensify in the damage they do....First of all, Ai Yori Aoshi thinks that having a ""secret romance"" is excuse enough to focus totally on the harem aspect of the story, and second of all, it thinks that romantic feelings towards the male protagonist counts as character development. This is ultimately why Ai Yori Aoshi is sitting at a 7 for me; when the supporting female characters take the limelight in their pursuit of Hanabishi we don\'t care about the female because we don\'t know anything about them, and since Hanabishi only receives screen time when talking to these females we don\'t know enough about him to care about the relationship. This creates a large amount of episodes that might as well be referred to as ""filler"", elaborating on no previous thoughts / emotions and creating no lasting effects or impressions for future episodes.It is understandable that in a harem anime the male character should be easy to relate with, but goddamn, Hanabishi just feels like a cardboard cutout. Sure, he has had events affect his life in negative ways, but these events are not reflected in his thoughts or actions. Unless he is actually talking directly about the past events, his behavior is totally generic and standard of male leads in harem anime. We never feel (amongst other feelings) the crushing loneliness of having no loved ones around because Hanabishi never reacts to reminders about it, never shows any differing emotions when alone, never even THINKS about it except in snippets of dreams designed to remind you that this totally isn\'t your ordinary harem. A characters past should be consistent with their personality or else character development won\'t happen (ESPECIALLY with protagonists); Hanabishi is just a male character template with a big ol\' sappy background story stapled onto his back.Luckily, this means he can serve his purpose, which is basically being an emotional battery for the similarly poor character development cursing the female supporting characters. Tina, Mayu, Chika and Taeko are simply tools for creating awkward situations with Hanabishi, trading the romance promised by the shows beginning for a dry slapstick that proceeds in an episodic fashion of rinse and repeat relationships. Tina is blessed with about 2 minutes of background info in the form of some quick flashbacks, but beyond that you will know no more about the characters at the series finale than you did at the start. The romantic relationships they attempt to establish with Hanabishi feel forced in conception, cringe inducing in execution and undefined in conclusion. Also, half of the time these relationships will also lead to Aoi having concerns about her relationship with Hanabishi, and speaking of which...Aoi was the reason I didn\'t give this show a 6 (or less). She is an awesome character; the likable part of her personality lies in her motivation and commitment to achieving love with Hanabishi rather than the love itself (see: any other character in the anime), and her attitude / personality is dynamic and changes according to whether she\'s speaking with friends, Hanabishi, strangers or relatives. She has clear and understandable emotions and has dreams and aspirations that we see her actively striving to achieve.The criminal part is that for the better half of the show she is barely even seen.Quickly fading into the background as nothing more than an observer of Hanabishi\'s interactions, Aoi is brutally forgotten by the shows story as it plows ahead and tries to force us to root for each individual female rather than the one we already love (or are meant to love at least). She had so much potential in the show, and not only is it squandered by the lack of focus on her, but the focus she does get (also the shows actual romance) is so repetitious it is infuriating. Every sparse romantic counter between her and Hanabishi simply involves them uttering each others names, discussing no pressing issues at great length and giving very vague reassurances when they do discuss these issues. The encounters then seem to be wiped from both parties minds, because sure enough next episode Aoi will experience heartache for a very similar (if not the same) reason and Hanabishi will be as predictably oblivious and non committal in his actions as always.Basically, this show is an experience in wasted potential. Aoi was a great character and the last few episodes actually gave her a lot of the attention that she deserved and needed, but it is hard to overlook the stiflingly bland Hanabishi and the generic, under cooked personalities of the other girls. Perhaps the second season will have greater things in store for me, but for now I consider Ai Yori Aoshi rather disappointing.

', ""Beautiful love story.The plot is simple.We have 2 childhood friends with arranged marriage but even from the start we can see that there is much more drama and hidden story then i tough.It really is nice to see that both main characters are in love even doe it was a type of political arranged marriage between 2 well known clans but since there are many complications involved like for instance that male MC isn't part of his clan anymore and what kind of reaction would people have is she marries someone beneath her.This is what i love to see.When main characters are fighting with everything...they have for the ones they love and when they are even ready to lose everything they have just to be next to person they love.Like i said the story has a lot of romance and hardship and it is quite nice to see so i recommend you to watch it. they have for the ones they love and when they are even ready to lose everything they have just to be next to person they love.Like i said the story has a lot of romance and hardship and it is quite nice to see so i recommend you to watch it."", 'Story:I enjoy the story for Ai Yori Aoshi. Basically, a young girl from a rich family is betrothed to a young man from a rich family. She likes him a lot even at such a young age, but he eventually disappears from his family. She goes to try and find him and ends up succeeding. They end up living together in a large house and many of their friends also end up living there. Of course, that are all girls and they all fall for the main male protagonist. The show basically follows their daily lives and the growth of Kaoru\'s and Aoi\'s relationship.Animation:The animation...is nice and bright. I think it looks good and is drawn well.Sound:I love the music in this anime, especially the opening song, Towa No Hana, it is very beautiful. I very rarely skipped this song while watching. They also do very well with the music during the episodes.Characters:I really enjoyed the characters, there really wasn\'t any that I disliked. They are all different with different personanlities. The main male protagonist, Kaoru, is a little bit too nice though. I enjoy watching the growth of the love between him and Aoi.  Aoi is probably my favorite female protagonist in a harem anime.I think Aoi gets alot of flak because of her supposed ""weakness"" about wanting to cook and clean for Kaoru. No one makes fun of Martha Stewart for being good at cooking, entertaining and cleaning. Aoi is good at what she does and she knows what she wants, going after it with a rather single minded determination. She is actually one of the tougher anime characters out there. Everything she does is because of a dilberate choice, no one is making her do anything.The other girls are also pretty fun, like I said before, with their own different personalities. Only thing is, like any other harem anime, I fell sorry for the girls falling in love and not being the one picked by the male protagonist.Overall:One of my favorite animes, in part because its one of the first ones I ever saw and probabaly only the 2nd or 3rd of the harem genre.

The ending was pretty standard i saw it coming miles away. The characters were all unique as they each added something to the never ending harem. Best girl i think would be Aoi or miyabi as i quite liked her. The animation was pretty standard for the time. Although aoi\'s eyes at times looked too big almost like a goldfish. Kaoru and his backstory was actually really great and sad. Made me hate the hanabishi. The ""PLOT"" was also pretty good. The anime was a rollercoaster of emotions at times i hated the MC for...not saying outright how he felt about certain things.

I have always loved this art style and have been a big fan of it since N.G.E. BUT! The best part of Ai Yori Aoshi, is the story. It actually fulfills plot points and ties them together like all great stories. Yes, this is a love story and there is no need to be hesitant about it. It's actually a story and less of a love drama. There are several entrancing moments of laughter, anticipation and tear jerking moments. I'm not much for love stories, but I can't help myself when the story is quality...and the characters are soo likable.In a nutshell, give it a watch. Even if you aren't big on romance.

I came into this series in the 1st couple of episodes and i loved the concept country girl out of her element in the big city and meeting of childhood sweethearts add in the trauma faced by the male lead and it has all the ingredients needed to tell a great love story.  What is the finished product Cliche and bland.I was hoping for Aoi that away from the live she always had in the country we would see her struggles maybe have to get a job to make ends meat.  None of...this happens and she takes to the city like a bird to flying.  I like all kinds of female leads tsundere, sporty, nerdy etc and this one had potential at the start but there is only ever 1 thought on her mind our male lead.  Nothing wrong with being in love but this is the kind obsessive, can't live without you kind.  The manager also mentions this point towards the end of the series.  I don't mind love but i need character depth.  What does she care about besides him? who are her friends?  What are her hobbies?  Whats her goal for the future?  The answer to all that is our male lead or have his friends.Kaoru is our male lead and he's as dull as a plank.  We see so much potential from him in the start with all the problems he's faced and they go nowhere with it and any time he's facing difficulties with his past they run the same scenes over again.  Does he deal with this trauma to overcome it, face his past and move on.  Nope every chance from beginning to end he runs away from his past never facing it.  He seems to be in college but there is no direction to his life i mean he wants to take care of Aoi but he never once mentions what job he'd like.  He has a hobby in the photo club but he puts 0 effort in and the series never gave the impression he even cared about his hobby.  He love Aoi supposedly but what's not to love when a gorgeous woman is practically throwing herself at you.  They set up the reason why she loves him but never really why he loves her just always there for him that's about it.As for the other characters when they started being introduced is when it really went down the drain and turned into a harem situation with our ML sometimes having perverted thoughts about them.  The series spends 90% of it's time on side stories, minor characters or slice of life episodic moments that don't add up to much.  Only 10% is good quality story stuff so if you can stick out the boring for the occasional sprinkle of good, go ahead.When coming to my conclusion i'd like to mention a manga series i enjoy Hajimete no Gal.  This is 100% what i wanted this series to be - ecchi stuff such a good story that focuses on the main couple despite there being many other characters.  What we get reminds me of when the same series go an anime adaptation it went to hell focusing all it's attention on the minor characters much in the same way Ai Yori Aoshi   has.  There's nothing special about any of the characters here, nothing of note in the story you can say it's average and that's about it. this happens and she takes to the city like a bird to flying.

Maybe just as a movie?I didn't care for most of the side characters. They were all more annoying than funny to me, and I spent a lot of my time rolling my eyes. I would have been happier watching just the first four episodes, and then the last few. Even though romance isn't really my thing, I would have at least enjoyed it more.The animation was okay. I don't like how they did the eyes in this...anime, though. The opening and closing songs weren't too bad. The main character has a really cute hairstyle.Overall, the only reason I finished this anime was because I started it. anime, though. The opening and closing songs weren't too bad.

Since Tatsuma Suguro decided that he would not join the True Cross order due to being busy with the Right eye and sealing the Impure King as learnt in the series. She however doesn't know this...and has built large doubts in her head that made her easy to be manipulated. It shows also how during the times of school her Tsundere personality has made it difficult to make friends from her childhood also growing up in a sect. However Juuzou has no such trouble and is adored by girls making him also popular with an outgoing personality.It is a nice OVA that shows the backstory of the two a bit more. It shows her struggles during school and his kindness to her showing his feelings were long set. She acts very much Tsundere during it or as Juuzou describes as not cute at all. (a lie obviously). She eventually has him help her out when injured much to her dissatisfaction which causes her eventually to come around to his friendship and feelings grow.We also see the initial stages of Toudou manipulating her and see how Juuzou was one of the other choices he was looking at.As per the final episode of the series we see again the marriage proposal scene slightly adapted to get the story for them closed off.Overall it is a great OVA that does develop the backstory a lot more. You learn a lot about both of them. It would have been nice to see maybe the wedding but you also see Shima Renzou reacting to the proposal confirmation and talk of children etc.The Art and Music is still top quality for the series.The Second OVA is about Shima Renzou and Mephisto. Mephisto talks about the desire for a spy by getting Renzou to perform 3 missions for him. The first two sit around Yukio. First they go to purify a factory filled with bugs Renzou's nightmare of a creature to deal with. Yukio given instruction to ensure he does the job or face a pay cut.The second part is that Renzou must go and eat the dinner awaiting Yukio who missed breakfast and Rin did not have time to prepare him lunch. Renzou struggles to get Rin to look away so he can eat it whilst being told about Yukio and his rage when hungry. Ultimately, he does it with dire consequence.The final mission is to infiltrate the girls dorm without being noticed. A girls uniform and a wig are put on but before the mission goes ahead he is caught with hilarious results.Amaimon points out in the after scene with Mephisto how all missions were failed but he looks happy still. Mephisto points out that Renzou regardless is true to his heart and his goal which was a limited release uncensored version of a pornographic magazine that Mephisto had already placed in his bag which was unbeknownst to Renzou until he got caught dressed as a girl.Subsequently a shot is shown where the magazine has been repaired (Ryuuji destroys it blaming it for the school girl outfit reason) showing his desire to follow through for his goal.This although not massively on the story line it is a very good OVA full of laughs after a more serious first OVA.

Anime Sanjuushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2333/Anime_Sanjuushi,"[""What can I say... It's my favorite anime!There's adventure, action, suspense, romance, drama, comedy - it has it all. It made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made my heart beat faster. I think this is why I love this series so much: it's extremely complete.Although it mixes several genres, the main one is definitely adventure. Almost every single episode has some exciting experience, where the musketeers (particularly D'Artagnan) are exposed to danger and have to take risks and show their bravery. It's really impossible to get bored while watching it.The characters are awesome. Even though my...favorite is the main character, D'Artagnan, I don't know who i like the most: the good guys or the villains. All of them are great and those who have their past and secrets revealed are even better. I haven't found one annoying character.The OST is outstanding! The &quot;drama&quot; songs, the &quot;danger&quot; songs and specially the &quot;action&quot; songs are absolutely perfect for each situation. Most of them are only instrumental and I must say that the orchestra is beautiful. I take a bow to Kouhei Tanaka.This anime also shows great values like friendship, loyalty, courage and honor. Nowadays it isn't paid much attention to values - there are lots of series with no depth at all, so I think this is a plus. The characters' feelings are profound and the balance between them and their actions is coherent and realistic.The fact that this anime is from the 80's might be a turn-off to some of you, but let me tell you this: this series is timeless. No matter how many years will go by, I really think that the people who watch it will continue to enjoy it.Now listen closely: even if you read Alexandre Dumas's book or watched any of the movies about the three musketeers, that's NOT a reason why you shouldn't watch this anime, because even though it's obvious that there are similarities, this series brings new stories and very different twists (and one of them is sooo amazing - if you watch it, you'll know what I'm talking about).Well, I could go on and on about how awesome Anime Sanjushi really is, but the only way for you to find out the true greatness of it is to watch it.

Now, it\'s 2023 and i decided to watch and review yet another Three Musketeers anime that was aired in 1987 (6 years later), under the name ""Anime Sanjuushi"".Anime Sanjuushi is, as you can see, also an anime adaptation of the novels by Alexandre Dumas, animated by studio Gallop of the Kochikame, Rurouni Kenshin and Yu-Gi-Oh fame. Now, rather than being another kid friendly version like how Dogtanian turned out to be, this one happens to be more serious, more darker and more mature...than even your average adaption of The Three Musketeers. It wasn\'t nowhere near as popular as to the likes of Dogtanian, but it did gained a cult following thanks to the airings in a few countries. Including my country, Portugal, for example. Like most countries, Portugal also had an european portuguese dub of this anime when it first aired in 1988, almost a year after the anime started airing in Japan. It received reruns on RTP2 in 1992 under the program ""Agora Escolha"", a portuguese program that shows reruns of previously aired and older shows that aired on RTP1.Now, even though it\'s nice that my country manage to get this anime to air in my country, i unfortunately never got a chance to watch this anime. I was born in 1995 and by the time i was born, the anime was no longer airing on television. Or at the very least i haven\'t heard from it before for years. The only few adaptions of The Three Musketeers that i was mostly familiar with was, like i said, Dogtanian and The Three Muskehounds, which i enjoyed that anime quite alot, and Mickey, Donald and Goofy: The Three Musketeers, which the latter sucked donkey ass. So to hear that this anime manage to exist in the 80s and getting to hear about it for the first time through some videos on Youtube, i\'m surprised that there would be another one made in Japan.But at lead us to this question: Is this one the best version of The Three Musketeers and probably even better than the likes of Dogtanian and that shitty Disney Direct-to-DVD film? Well, now that i finished watching the Japanese dub of this anime, let\'s see what this version has to offer:Now before i start the review, i want to let you know that this review might contain some spoilers. I highly recommend to watch the anime first before reading this video, because there are a few things that i want to mention this time around. But first things first, let\'s  hear the story:In this one, the story starts with D\'Artagnan fighting againts the bullies over which animal is the tallest on the planet. And D\'Artagnan\'s answer was the elephant, even though he never saw an elephant before in his life, while others say it\'s a cow. Of course D\'Artagnan is still determined that the tallest animal in the world is an elephant, he decided to tell his grandparents that not only he wants go to paris to find the elephant just so he can prove those bullies that the elephant is taller than a cow, but also decided to work and serve to King Louis XIII as an musketeer. Throughout the anime, he encounters many people around him for the first time. He meets Constance, who would later become his love interest, Jean, who would go on to become his friend, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Aramis and Porthos and eventually, his enemies. Rochefort, Milady, Richelieu and of course, The Iron Mask.There are atleast three arcs in total. One is about his encounter with the musketeers and Richelieu\'s minions, who try to stand in D\'Artagnan\'s way of becoming an musketeer, while the second arc is surrounding his rivalry with Milady and her ways of facing againts him and finally, the third arc focus on Iron Mask and his plans to end King Louis XIII\'s life by switching him with the king\'s twin brother and starting a war againts the entire Paris as a whole.For an anime from 1987 to have such a story like this, i loved how it turned out to be. Unlike most versions of The Three Musketeers that i\'ve watched, Anime Sanjuushi manage to take an simple story about a young lad becoming an musketeer and make it more than just that simple story. It has more interesting action scenes, as expected for an action show, there\'s more dramatic moments in each episodes, there\'s the romantic relationship between D\'Artagnan and Constance and of course, there has been some numerous changes made in this anime. While there were a few changes like for example, D\'Artagnan becoming 16 years old rather than being much older. Then there\'s two Iron Masks appearing in this anime. One being the bandit while the other being the king\'s brother, who would later become an replacement for the king\'s disappearance. But the most radical change made in this anime is Aramis, who now became a girl in this version. And in this version, Aramis also had her own sad backstory that not only will be explained in the later episodes of this anime, but also in the 1989 movie, Aramis\' Adventures.While there\'s alot more good to this anime than anything negative, there were a couple of issues in which i think it could\'ve been better. For example, i wished the ending had an definitive epilogue to this story rather than stopping the anime abruptly. Luckily, there\'s the 1989 movie that did give an solid conclusion to that and to find out whether or not Jean\'s mother is still alive.Other issue that i had with the anime is that sometimes, Jean can go a bit out of character and end up being jealous at D\'Artagnan after becoming an musketeer. I don\'t know what is it about it, but i don\'t like how Jean acts like a jerk towards him when he should\'ve been happier about D\'Artagnan becoming an musketeer. But sadly, it was never explained why Jean was like this in just a few episodes. I know that Jean does calm himself down a bit and becomes friends with D\'Artagnan again, but still, it\'s annoying to see this instance happening. But hey, it\'s just an nitpick of mine. But aside from those instances, i think the story is wonderful and a perfect option for those who want to see the story of The Three Musketeers told in a much more mature and serious manner.Now let\'s take a look at some of the characters in this anime:Since this is Studio Gallop\'s own adaption, we not only get the previously established characters, but also a few more introduced to this anime.Just like the others, you have D\'Artagnan, the hero with strong sense of honor, although a bit inexperienced, but with courage and strong will. Still the same as before, but now even more likable than ever before.You then have Athos, the older of the three musketeers, who\'s calm, considered and he\'s the wisest of the group. he\'s quite an awesome and badass character anytime he fights, too, thanks to his personality and his voice by Akira Kamiya.Aramis, the character whose Gallop changed the character\'s sex in this version, is kind and brave for a woman who hides her wounds and her secret revenge for her beloved fiancée. She\'s basically the best character in this anime and probably one of the best and most unique versions of the character thanks to her kindness, bravery and how she respects her friends as actual people and not treat them like garbage like most today\'s modern movies, shows or video games where women are treated like powerful human beings with no personalities or interesting factors to them other than acting like tough guys and having their sad and pathetic backstories just to try to make us love them, only for us to pity their stupidity. Aramis is not like Rey from the shitty ass Disney\'s Star Wars sequels or Ellie and Abby from ""The Woke Of Us Part 2"" or even that ugly as fuck Alloy from those shit-tier Horizon games. Aramis is just her own character. And does set up a really good example of how you make an woman just as interesting, unique, fun and diverse as the male counterparts.And then there\'s Porthos, who... Well... He\'s Porthos. He\'s kindhearted and loves eating food. he\'s not really the best character in the show, but he can also have his own moments, as well.Other side characters like Constance and her father, the queen of Paris, Treville and King Louis XIII aren\'t much to write about, but again, just like Porthos, they can also have their own moments, too.The villains like Richelieu, Milady and Rochefort are also fun characters to watch. Especially Milady and Rochefort. With Milady being an sexy and gorgeous lady who knows how she deals with people who stand in her way and with the help of Pépe, while Rochefort, he\'s a fun, goofy, entertaining and sometimes, even badass of an character to watch.Then you have Iron Mask... Holy shit, Iron Mask. I know the guy never revealed his face since his life ended at the end of the anime, but man, this villain is one of the best i\'ve seen and probably the reason why i kept watching the show just to see him in action. This guy is menacing, he\'s evil, he\'s an badass gentleman and even a smart person who knows what he wants and what he wants to do. And when he fights againts D\'Artagnan or the musketeers, this guy knows how he fights like a man and is in now way, shape or form, even messing around. And with him being the smartest of the cast, helping the fact that he attempted to replace King Louis with the king\'s twin brother, Philipe, just so the real king can get executed to death, this makes Iron Mask as one of the most menacing, most badass, most ruthless and of course, most smartest villains i\'ve seen in anime.And as for Jean, who is, in fact, an original character made exclusively to this anime, is an nice addition to the anime. Sure, like i said, he can go out of character a bit when D\'Artagnan finally became a musketeer, but i appreciate the little guy and his good intentions and his goal to find his long lost mother after being separated by the soldiers. He is mischevious, but definitely a good companion to have on your adventures. Even if he does get jealous every now and then.Now that\'s done, what do i think about the production of the anime?For the animation, it looks pretty good for 1987 standards. The character designs look much more unique and sometimes gorgeous for its time, the background animation is beautiful to look at and the animation movements, whether the characters make facial expressions or when the musketeers fight, they look pretty smooth and polished than most of the animated adaptions of The Three Musketeers. I honestly don\'t know what else is there to complain here, honestly. Maybe Constance\'s design is the only one that i didn\'t like that much, but even then, she looks okay as it is. But yeah, for Studio Gallop in 1987, the animation looks good. No issues here.The music is also great as well. It\'s nice to hear some different and unique renditions of Anime Sanjuushi\'s opening theme song and loved the use of some instruments for some background musics. Whether it has the Saxophone involved when a fight scene happens, or a very slow and beautiful music is played. The opening theme song by Noriko Sakai and the ending theme songs by PumpKin, are very good songs to listen to, too. Especially Noriko Sakai\'s song in this anime. One of the most underrated anime songs i\'ve heard in a long time.And as for the voice acting in the Japanese dub (Because i didn\'t watched the European Portuguese dub to be honest, but i\'ll check it out, later), is pretty good. Loved some of the more obscure seiyuus like Tatsuya Matsuda as D\'Artagnan, who is perfect for an young character like him. Aramis\' voice actress, Eiko Yamada, is very wonderful to hear. Especially when she does a great job making an tomboyish voice. Other seiyuus like Akira Kamiya (Kinnikuman and Kenshiro\'s voice), who like i said, is the voice of Athos, is yet, another great voice performance from the legend himself and one of his more underrated roles in anime. Also shoutouts to Noriko Hidaka (Who voices one of my favorite waifus, Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster) for her great role as Constance, Mayumi Tanak (The voice of Krillin and Monkey D. Luffy) for a pretty good voice of Jean, Fumi Hirano (Lum\'s voice) for her sexy and gorgeous voice for Milady, easily one of the hottest i\'ve heard, Shigeru Chiba (Who voices Raditz, Buggy The Clown and Kazuma Kuwabara), who gives an outstanding role as Rochefort and last and certainly not least, Shigezo Sasaoka, who gives an extraodinary voice as Iron Mask and easily his most memorable role in anime. May him rest in peace.Well... What can i say about this anime? IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!!! Not only this is one of the best, if not, the best version of The Three Musketeers that i have ever seen, but also, one of the most memorable ones at that. This is easily the most underrated version of the classic novel that i\'ve seen, too. Like i said, it took an simple underdog story of a young man becoming an musketeer and not only add a few more to it, but also making it the most definitive version of The Three Musketeers that it has to offer. While not exactly 100% faithful to the books, it definitely respects the story with dignity and honor. It goes to show that you can do more with an classic novel than it meets the eyes.If you\'re a fan of anime or The Three Musketeers, Give this anime a shot, man. This version manages to make even an simple story just as awesome as you may expect from Gallop. After me finishing watching this anime, i can comfortly say that this anime easily clears that shitty Disney\'s Direct-to-DVD film and probably, even good ones like Dogtanian and The Three Muskehounds. Don\'t get me wrong, though. I love Dogtanian. It\'s an absolute classic for many reasons. But this version, man... There was no competition between these two. I think Anime Sanjuushi is the best version of The Three Musketeers out there. Give this anime a watch in japanese dub or whatever dub languages you use, whatever may be, give Anime Sanjuushi a second chance. Trust me. You won\'t regret watching this awesome show.For my final score for Anime Sanjuushi will be an 9 out of 10. I think it\'s an absolute gem. A gem that i will not forget for years to come.This has been my review of Anime Sanjuushi. My name is José Diogo and i\'ll see you guys again real soon with whatever more obscure shows i can find. than even your average adaption of The Three Musketeers. It wasn\'t nowhere near as popular as to the likes of Dogtanian, but it did gained a cult following thanks to the airings in a few countries. Including my country, Portugal, for example. Like most countries, Portugal also had an european portuguese dub of this anime when it first aired in 1988, almost a year after the anime started airing in Japan. It received reruns on RTP2 in 1992 under the program ""Agora Escolha"", a portuguese program that shows reruns of previously aired and older shows that aired on RTP1.Now, even though it\'s nice that my country manage to get this anime to air in my country, i unfortunately never got a chance to watch this anime. I was born in 1995 and by the time i was born, the anime was no longer airing on television. Or at the very least i haven\'t heard from it before for years. The only few adaptions of The Three Musketeers that i was mostly familiar with was, like i said, Dogtanian and The Three Muskehounds, which i enjoyed that anime quite alot, and Mickey, Donald and Goofy: The Three Musketeers, which the latter sucked donkey ass. So to hear that this anime manage to exist in the 80s and getting to hear about it for the first time through some videos on Youtube, i\'m surprised that there would be another one made in Japan.But at lead us to this question: Is this one the best version of The Three Musketeers and probably even better than the likes of Dogtanian and that shitty Disney Direct-to-DVD film? Well, now that i finished watching the Japanese dub of this anime, let\'s see what this version has to offer:Now before i start the review, i want to let you know that this review might contain some spoilers. I highly recommend to watch the anime first before reading this video, because there are a few things that i want to mention this time around. But first things first, let\'s  hear the story:In this one, the story starts with D\'Artagnan fighting againts the bullies over which animal is the tallest on the planet. And D\'Artagnan\'s answer was the elephant, even though he never saw an elephant before in his life, while others say it\'s a cow. Of course D\'Artagnan is still determined that the tallest animal in the world is an elephant, he decided to tell his grandparents that not only he wants go to paris to find the elephant just so he can prove those bullies that the elephant is taller than a cow, but also decided to work and serve to King Louis XIII as an musketeer. Throughout the anime, he encounters many people around him for the first time. He meets Constance, who would later become his love interest, Jean, who would go on to become his friend, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Aramis and Porthos and eventually, his enemies. Rochefort, Milady, Richelieu and of course, The Iron Mask.There are atleast three arcs in total. One is about his encounter with the musketeers and Richelieu\'s minions, who try to stand in D\'Artagnan\'s way of becoming an musketeer, while the second arc is surrounding his rivalry with Milady and her ways of facing againts him and finally, the third arc focus on Iron Mask and his plans to end King Louis XIII\'s life by switching him with the king\'s twin brother and starting a war againts the entire Paris as a whole.For an anime from 1987 to have such a story like this, i loved how it turned out to be. Unlike most versions of The Three Musketeers that i\'ve watched, Anime Sanjuushi manage to take an simple story about a young lad becoming an musketeer and make it more than just that simple story. It has more interesting action scenes, as expected for an action show, there\'s more dramatic moments in each episodes, there\'s the romantic relationship between D\'Artagnan and Constance and of course, there has been some numerous changes made in this anime. While there were a few changes like for example, D\'Artagnan becoming 16 years old rather than being much older. Then there\'s two Iron Masks appearing in this anime. One being the bandit while the other being the king\'s brother, who would later become an replacement for the king\'s disappearance. But the most radical change made in this anime is Aramis, who now became a girl in this version. And in this version, Aramis also had her own sad backstory that not only will be explained in the later episodes of this anime, but also in the 1989 movie, Aramis\' Adventures.While there\'s alot more good to this anime than anything negative, there were a couple of issues in which i think it could\'ve been better. For example, i wished the ending had an definitive epilogue to this story rather than stopping the anime abruptly. Luckily, there\'s the 1989 movie that did give an solid conclusion to that and to find out whether or not Jean\'s mother is still alive.Other issue that i had with the anime is that sometimes, Jean can go a bit out of character and end up being jealous at D\'Artagnan after becoming an musketeer. I don\'t know what is it about it, but i don\'t like how Jean acts like a jerk towards him when he should\'ve been happier about D\'Artagnan becoming an musketeer. But sadly, it was never explained why Jean was like this in just a few episodes. I know that Jean does calm himself down a bit and becomes friends with D\'Artagnan again, but still, it\'s annoying to see this instance happening. But hey, it\'s just an nitpick of mine. But aside from those instances, i think the story is wonderful and a perfect option for those who want to see the story of The Three Musketeers told in a much more mature and serious manner.Now let\'s take a look at some of the characters in this anime:Since this is Studio Gallop\'s own adaption, we not only get the previously established characters, but also a few more introduced to this anime.Just like the others, you have D\'Artagnan, the hero with strong sense of honor, although a bit inexperienced, but with courage and strong will. Still the same as before, but now even more likable than ever before.You then have Athos, the older of the three musketeers, who\'s calm, considered and he\'s the wisest of the group. he\'s quite an awesome and badass character anytime he fights, too, thanks to his personality and his voice by Akira Kamiya.Aramis, the character whose Gallop changed the character\'s sex in this version, is kind and brave for a woman who hides her wounds and her secret revenge for her beloved fiancée. She\'s basically the best character in this anime and probably one of the best and most unique versions of the character thanks to her kindness, bravery and how she respects her friends as actual people and not treat them like garbage like most today\'s modern movies, shows or video games where women are treated like powerful human beings with no personalities or interesting factors to them other than acting like tough guys and having their sad and pathetic backstories just to try to make us love them, only for us to pity their stupidity. Aramis is not like Rey from the shitty ass Disney\'s Star Wars sequels or Ellie and Abby from ""The Woke Of Us Part 2"" or even that ugly as fuck Alloy from those shit-tier Horizon games. Aramis is just her own character. And does set up a really good example of how you make an woman just as interesting, unique, fun and diverse as the male counterparts.And then there\'s Porthos, who... Well... He\'s Porthos. He\'s kindhearted and loves eating food. he\'s not really the best character in the show, but he can also have his own moments, as well.Other side characters like Constance and her father, the queen of Paris, Treville and King Louis XIII aren\'t much to write about, but again, just like Porthos, they can also have their own moments, too.The villains like Richelieu, Milady and Rochefort are also fun characters to watch. Especially Milady and Rochefort. With Milady being an sexy and gorgeous lady who knows how she deals with people who stand in her way and with the help of Pépe, while Rochefort, he\'s a fun, goofy, entertaining and sometimes, even badass of an character to watch.Then you have Iron Mask... Holy shit, Iron Mask. I know the guy never revealed his face since his life ended at the end of the anime, but man, this villain is one of the best i\'ve seen and probably the reason why i kept watching the show just to see him in action. This guy is menacing, he\'s evil, he\'s an badass gentleman and even a smart person who knows what he wants and what he wants to do. And when he fights againts D\'Artagnan or the musketeers, this guy knows how he fights like a man and is in now way, shape or form, even messing around. And with him being the smartest of the cast, helping the fact that he attempted to replace King Louis with the king\'s twin brother, Philipe, just so the real king can get executed to death, this makes Iron Mask as one of the most menacing, most badass, most ruthless and of course, most smartest villains i\'ve seen in anime.And as for Jean, who is, in fact, an original character made exclusively to this anime, is an nice addition to the anime. Sure, like i said, he can go out of character a bit when D\'Artagnan finally became a musketeer, but i appreciate the little guy and his good intentions and his goal to find his long lost mother after being separated by the soldiers. He is mischevious, but definitely a good companion to have on your adventures. Even if he does get jealous every now and then.Now that\'s done, what do i think about the production of the anime?For the animation, it looks pretty good for 1987 standards. The character designs look much more unique and sometimes gorgeous for its time, the background animation is beautiful to look at and the animation movements, whether the characters make facial expressions or when the musketeers fight, they look pretty smooth and polished than most of the animated adaptions of The Three Musketeers. I honestly don\'t know what else is there to complain here, honestly. Maybe Constance\'s design is the only one that i didn\'t like that much, but even then, she looks okay as it is. But yeah, for Studio Gallop in 1987, the animation looks good. No issues here.The music is also great as well. It\'s nice to hear some different and unique renditions of Anime Sanjuushi\'s opening theme song and loved the use of some instruments for some background musics. Whether it has the Saxophone involved when a fight scene happens, or a very slow and beautiful music is played. The opening theme song by Noriko Sakai and the ending theme songs by PumpKin, are very good songs to listen to, too. Especially Noriko Sakai\'s song in this anime. One of the most underrated anime songs i\'ve heard in a long time.And as for the voice acting in the Japanese dub (Because i didn\'t watched the European Portuguese dub to be honest, but i\'ll check it out, later), is pretty good. Loved some of the more obscure seiyuus like Tatsuya Matsuda as D\'Artagnan, who is perfect for an young character like him. Aramis\' voice actress, Eiko Yamada, is very wonderful to hear. Especially when she does a great job making an tomboyish voice. Other seiyuus like Akira Kamiya (Kinnikuman and Kenshiro\'s voice), who like i said, is the voice of Athos, is yet, another great voice performance from the legend himself and one of his more underrated roles in anime. Also shoutouts to Noriko Hidaka (Who voices one of my favorite waifus, Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster) for her great role as Constance, Mayumi Tanak (The voice of Krillin and Monkey D. Luffy) for a pretty good voice of Jean, Fumi Hirano (Lum\'s voice) for her sexy and gorgeous voice for Milady, easily one of the hottest i\'ve heard, Shigeru Chiba (Who voices Raditz, Buggy The Clown and Kazuma Kuwabara), who gives an outstanding role as Rochefort and last and certainly not least, Shigezo Sasaoka, who gives an extraodinary voice as Iron Mask and easily his most memorable role in anime. May him rest in peace.Well... What can i say about this anime? IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!!! Not only this is one of the best, if not, the best version of The Three Musketeers that i have ever seen, but also, one of the most memorable ones at that. This is easily the most underrated version of the classic novel that i\'ve seen, too.

I think the best part of this season was how it illustrated how the characters have grown since the first batch of episodes with occasional exception.

Normally when weighing a show you add up all the elements and get your number, but in this case it seems like all the elements are opposed to each other and can’t be seen together. Like liquids with different densities. My general range would be around 4-6, which is what I rated it on MAL.Now the details. Firstly, there is very little change at all from the first season. The personalities, the art, the theme, the structure, the tropes, the rampant over the top fanservice, the horrible music ALL OF IT. But this isn’t a...bad thing. It feels like what it is. A continuation. And in that regard it keeps you interested in an odd sort of way with its lack of change from the first season. I didn’t even write a review for the first season, because literally everything I’m about to say would be the exact same for that too. That’s just about where all the praise ends.The first complaint is the just insane level of lewdness. Ontop of the constant groping, sexual angles and nudity comes outright sex scenes too. This was present in the first season too, but guys, come on. Do better.The second is about the characters. There are far too many. Dark Schneider (possibly the worst name in all of anime) and his close circle are all easy to recognize and understand, but by the end of the show there are like 20 something people, all with some kind of role and it’s just completely unnecessary. They just add confusion to the already hard to follow story, and leave you wondering who is who from their generic designs. They’re also completely invincible. If you’re not just a normal human (who the writers love slaughtering) it is nearly impossible to die. The plot armour is at an overwhelming level.

But instead of having them be completely invincible maybe you could write scenarios in which they don’t always end up in inescapable peril which they manage to survive every time.The story broadly is very difficult to follow and only gets harder as you get towards the end. The oddly named characters, the very large amount of landscapes and landmarks, all of it. But when you change your perspective, that doesn’t matter. I was viewing the show through a serious storytelling lens which is why I was so negative about it, but about halfway through the second season I realized I was looking at it wrong.

This season isn't about immediate gratification; it's about building a grand narrative that promises even greater adventures in the future. The groundwork laid here is nothing short of brilliant, making us hungry for what's to come.One of the standout aspects of this season is the character development, particularly for Yoko. If you were enamored with her in the first season, you'll be delighted to see her take center stage here. Her growth and evolution are beautifully portrayed, adding depth to her character and solidifying her appeal.However, it's important to note that not all characters receive the same level of attention.

If you were enamored with her in the first season, you'll be delighted to see her take center stage here. Her growth and evolution are beautifully portrayed, adding depth to her character and solidifying her appeal.However, it's important to note that not all characters receive the same level of attention.

Yoko has her moments where she has to be a tough fierce leader and her moments of soft vulnerability. And DS has a soft loving side underneath his cocky exterior. The characters are diverse in representation and design; Arshes & Gara having darker skin and hair and using fashion styles and fighting styles unique from the other characters. I truly believe they react to situations in a realistic way given the setting and world building. But I shouldn't have to sing the praises of characters, setting and world building...that haven't changed in-between seasonsTL:DR everything good about season one is present in season two.My huge issue here is with the characters standing around expositing the story to us and each other.

Speaking of source material, MAL won't let me post this review without mentioning there are overt sexist and misogynistic scenes and themes in this series. Again something you'd know if you watched the first season. I cannot imagine why I have to mention that in a review for season two of a show when all those sexist and misogynistic element were present in the first season.

Schneider is still boringly OP and what little plot emerges is too little too late. In fact, season 2 actually manages to exacerbate these problems. For example, a large number of new characters are introduced yet they receive little to no characterisation. However one of the most annoying problems with this series was its treatment of the female cast. The show had always\xa0 been fanservice heavy but its ramped up to eleven in some scenes in season 2, and not in a good way. Fanservice can be done well however bastard s2 is...not an example of this. One notable example comes in a bathing scene where Tio Noto Yoko is bathing alone. Schenider comes in gets physical with her. She says no. Repeatedly. He continues and receives no real comeuppance or punishment outside of the usual anime comedy tropes. On the subject of badly written women, Arshes Nei, who was introduced in season 1 as an impressive General, a powerful figure in her own right, has since then degenerated into little more than a simp for Dark Schneider who does little other than cry over her relationship with him and pine for him on her own, in forest hut, for two whole years (the series takes place after a time skip) just because Schneider once told her do this, when she was a child!Overall, the writing and characterisation is just as bad, if not worse, than previous season. If you want a fantasy themed villain protagonist anime that's better written. Watch Overlord instead. not an example of this.

Chikyuu Bouei Kigyou Dai-Guard,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1312/Chikyuu_Bouei_Kigyou_Dai-Guard,"[""Ah Daiguard. What to really say? This is less of a mecha anime than more of a comment on the plight of the working stiff dealing with the corporate world. Working for a corporation myself, I see first hand the red tape and paperwork and hoop jumping that seems to involving doing absolutely anything.If the corporation can make a form for it, you get to fill it in triplicate and woe beunto thee if you write with anything but black pen.The mech action scenes themselves are simultaneously awesome and hilarious. Daiguard is trying so hard to be a super robot, but it just isn't. But...hey, theres nothing some hot blood and yelling can't fix.The characters themselves are highly believable and likeable, unless you're not supposed to like them and then they were simplely bastards. There were several scenes that I actually wept during because A. They were touching and B. I'm deep down a softy. But tell no one.In the end, Enough Super Robot Hot Blood Action with just the right amount of Drama and corporate parody to make this a worthwile romp. hey, theres nothing some hot blood and yelling can't fix.The characters themselves are highly believable and likeable, unless you're not supposed to like them and then they were simplely bastards.

After several hours of \'hurry up and wait\' the pilot of Dai Guard sighs and says ""I\'ve been watching giant robot anime all my life and they never mentioned this part.""That one line struck such a cord with me, and sold me on Dai Guard, and Dai Guard immediately became my all time favorite mecha anime the moment it was uttered.  XEBEC and director Seiji Mizushima did a wonderful job injecting a lot...of hard core reality into the fantasy genre of mecha anime, and they did it with a lot of humor and a lot of heart.Hard core reality like all that paper work that needs to be done after a mission, or bickering among the best pilots ruins the mission, or what does the military do when they see an insurance company doing their job with military surplus equipment? (They get jealous... big time.)Dai Guard was built as a military robot to fight Hetrodynes by the 21st Century Defense Corporation, however when Dai Guard was finished the Hetrodyne threat stopped and the military allowed 21st Century Defense Corporation to keep Dai Guard as a cooperate mascot. 13 years later the Hetrodynes return and only 3 office workers can pilot Dai Guard who is in serious need of maintenance.Some of the show cracks me up like no other; at first they  have to truck Dai Guard across Japan in pieces in a multiple truck convoy, assemble it in the path of the enemy only to have the enemy change course and they have to tear down Dai Guard and load it back on the trucks to the next anticipated battle site. If you\'ve ever been in a mobile military outfit you know how painful that is. But a lot of the show is very touching too, it\'s not all giant robots and evil monsters, there\'s a lot of human drama going on and quite often Dai Guard doesn\'t make an appearance.I give the story a 10 - it\'s intriguing, humorous, and very fair; meaning there\'s no deus ex machina waiting to spring out and ruin the plot. What you see is what you get: there\'s no super powers, no alien interventions that will change the story, no hidden back plot to spring out at the end and change everything.The art I gave an 8 - the animation could be smoother, but there\'s no long still shots with the camera rotating to denote action, there\'s no inappropriate chibi or super deformation when a character becomes embarrassed, and there\'s no jiggling... actually no fan service what so ever. Hey! This is a large Japanese corporation, I\'m sure they have fan service rules.The Sound is an 8 - surprisingly good for a mecha anime. Mostly I like the music, and the opening and ending songs are very very catchy.The Characters are solid 10s, every one of them. The characters are very individual and they always stay true to their nature. There\'s no sudden epiphany that creates a complete and total personality change in any characters, although several do have an epiphany - they end up handling it like any normal person would. There\'s a few characters there for humor but they\'re not clowns. Just about every character is very likable and each for a different reason. Even the characters you detest are detestable for appropriate reasons.Enjoyment is a solid 10 - every episode was and is a celebration.Overall - a big 10.

Something that I quite appreciate is the treatment of the characters. They start out seeming fairly archetypical, but some realistic portrayal keeps them from becoming two-dimensional. Furthermore, they avoid several cliches, such as the leading female falling for the leading male.The producers could have made this a very dark show, but despite the circumstances, everything remains somewhat happy-go-lucky. Actually, my initial...impression was that this was a shameless Evangelion clone. This similarity however, is only skin-deep. The monsters may be interchangeable, but the story-telling and tone are completely different, as are the mechanical designs and level of violence. Even for 1999 the design of Daiguard seems a little dated, but this along with the PG action creates a somewhat nostalgic experience.All the characters a very likable, and have surprising realism. I feel it would have been very easy for each of them to stick to their archetypes, but they all have a little depth and development, except perhaps for Akagi. Maybe I just feel this way because I'm a car nerd, but I think that even Aoyama's blue Impreza was a likable character. Unlike Ibuki's book, it's never introduced, talked about, or even really focused on, but it's always there. They could have given Aoyama something non-descript, easy-to-draw, but they chose this specific model of car, and I feel that adds something to the depth of Aoyama's character.---Minor Spoilers---I think my favorite piece of this puzzle though, is the lesson that anyone can be your ally. Shirota and Saeki, who are both introduced as unbearable assholes, eventually become very likable. Shirota may have even become one of my all time favorite characters. Even Busujima, playing the villian up until the last minute, is mentioned as siding with Shirota in the end.---End Spoilers---Overall, Daiguard is a pleasant experience, if not a completely novel one. If you want a mech anime that's more about the people than the fighting, and that leaves you feeling warm inside, watch Daiguard. impression was that this was a shameless Evangelion clone.

Overall I view this show as a 7 but don't take the score at face value.  The show has been around for over 20 years after all and in all honesty, after watching it I don't know why more people haven't seen it.On the surface, this show is primarily about a kid named Akagi and his 2 friends Aoyama, and Momoi who pilot the mecha Dai-Gaurd and prevent Tokyo from being attacked by Heterodyne.This show is so much more than that...though.  It has a monster of the week feel for over half of the series, but as the series goes on we learn more about what it truly means to fight.  You see the fight isn't just happening against the monsters.  There is a fight between Dai-Gaurd and the military, and the fight against our past.This show is more than just the pilots of team Dai-Guard. What makes this show awesome is the entire ensemble of characters.  The creators of this series put a lot of time into developing the background characters.  There is such a large variety of characters here that I can't name them all, but here are a few.  We have a sweet, but eccentric scientist in Rika, a gruff military man with a heart of gold named Shirota, and the rest of 21st Century Defense Security, who are all normal everyday office workers that are just as much a part of the fight as everyone else.In team Dai-Guard you come for the Mecha fights, but you leave with a family. though.

This sentence does well to sum up the general storyline of Dai Guard. Imagine a show like the Office but with no comedy and every episode has a new monster to fight. On the surface this may seem bland and boring, but it actually is refreshing to see a show tackle the real world elements of having a giant robot fighting to save you. Other mech shows tend to gloss over the logistics of things such as insurance and property damage. But in Dai Guard there is a constant pressure on the pilots...to not only win, but to do so with as little damage done to the city as possible. Corporate power struggles along with an ideal that true justice is saving people vs. fighting the enemy holds together the tense moments of the show when the main characters are not having to fight off each new threat. Some deep psychological theories and ideas are presented as well, and through these some characters display growth, which greatly helps fight against the episodic nature that this show has. Science also has a backing with the story, with characters learning about ways to manipulate energy and some real world concepts that they use to fight effectively. Very minor romance scenes in this show, so if you like more concrete romance stories, this is not the show for that.

It’s simultaneously a comical take on the classic formula and a tribute to some of the most iconic old school titles in the genre.Visually you can tell the series is outdated, even by its time it isn’t very good. The artwork is kinda weak, the character designs are simple, the coloring has several issues to the point that one character has two different hair colours throughout the series, one seemingly...done digitally while the other seems to be done by hand, why’s that? The special effects look cheap and old even for its time, and there is some crude CGI here and there as it was common back then. The motions are also not very good, but at least there is a lot of weight behind them, which is a nice touch, adds to the aesthetics, and fits within the setting and story presented. The backgrounds, especially the inside of the robots, are the best part of the show for the most part, except for the moments when CGI is used.The audio department is very weak, easily the worst part of the whole series. The music? Generic, forgettable, simple, repetitive, just there most of the time, and that includes the opening, which at least fit the atmosphere of the action part of the show just fine. Both are meant to have that retro and classic feel that the show aims to mimic, and they succeed at that, but the results are still weak on their own. The ending is a cute song that fits the slice of life part of the anime with lyrics that both reflect those bits and are aimed directly to the audience. Not amazing in the least nor very memorable, but the best part of the soundtrack as far as I’m concerned. The voice acting is ok, every seiyuu did their work just fine, it’s just that the series and characters themselves didn’t allow any of them to shine in any particular way, as what was required of them was pretty standard and typical. Akiko Hiramatsu was the best out of the whole cast and showed her range once more, simply by playing the most emotional and explored character in the whole series. The sound effects are laughably weak even by 1999 standards, almost nothing has a fraction of the impact it should.The plot is about a public relationships team from a security company using the giant robot titular of the show to fight against the token monsters of the series, classic monster of the week formula with a comical spin on it, not only because of the people piloting and repairing it, but also because of its approach itself to it. The mecha doesn’t really look cool, it wasn’t used for so long that it is rather obsolete and broken, it doesn’t have any cool super attacks, all of its said attacks are down to Earth and comical copies of iconic attacks from classic mecha titles, all of its upgrades are simple weapons, it constantly malfunctions, it has to be repaired or refueled in battle, the monsters it fights against have very simple and uninspired designs that range from a freaking giant baseball to a Mega-Man boss reject, minus the last two which came out of Evangelion or something, and in general the characters are reluctant to fight or care more about their daily lives and relationships, their salaries and vacations and the funding to do all the repairs the giant robot needs, than about the fights and the monsters themselves.Not to say that the battles aren’t given the importance they deserve, despite the comical approach, the same outcomes and weapons used and the low level fights, every monster is different from the others despite having the same weakness, thus every fight requires a certain strategy and a certain field tactic, and it’s cool to watch Dai-Guard itself being affected by the different terrains on which the fights take place and having to adjust to them.The plot structure follows the typical monster of the week formula, but several elements are added to it to add realism and flavor. Because of all the destruction and funding issues caused by the characters, they eventually have the military controlling what they do and even placing a tactical advisor for them, who of course has another mission behind that position, which eventually leads to the creation of another robot and the army becoming an antagonist of sorts on its own. There is also a member of the board of the company wanting to take over its presidential position and change the division of the main characters, themselves included, new pilots and a new tactical advisor trained by the army taking over the Dai-Guard at some point, political issues with another country and army, and of course evolving monsters, and the everyday things the characters have to deal with. All of that enriches an otherwise dried out formula, even with its own funny spin.The pacing is good in the initial episodes, as you are shown the concept, premise, main characters, the personal drama of the main ones, the army and board members slowly taking over, new members that are troublesome, changes in the mecha that make things more difficult, the discovery of what the heterodyne (the monsters) are and their natural formation, and there is a bit of character development especially for Shirota the first military advisor, who learns how to talk with common people and do needed things on the fly in the battlefield, as well as for Akagi, the hot-headed, idealistic and impulsive main character who wants to be some kind of hero of justice because of the mecha anime he watched as a kid. The relationships between these two couldn’t be worse in the beginning, yet they are together so much time they come to find a common ground and noticing what the other has that they themselves lack, thus improving the cooperation during the battles against the heterodyne. The series also bothers to show how the common people are affected by the fights, albeit with a lighthearted approach, nothing really tragic in it. So, it does everything that Bullbuster, which finishes tomorrow, does, but better, and with a much better pacing (Dai-Guard does in, let’s say 4 or 5 out of 26 episodes, what Bullbuster does in 10 out of 12).The middle episodes (let’s say 6 to 18) are the weakest, not so much of the everyday lives of the characters is shown, thus there is no character fleshing, and the fights are weak and silly, to the point of even contradicting the information that was initially provided and having the cast acting out of character at times. There are some good bits in it, like the second robot being made and the army and second advisor becoming a problem, as well as a good message (the public relations division help out people even when they don’t use the robot, giving a new meaning to the catchphrase of the teasers of the next episodes), but in general the plot points presented during this portion of the anime are somewhat poorly handled and not even last long enough.The army and the board member take over, but everyone is incompetent or an asshole, which goes against the cooperation and common ground presented earlier with Akagi and Shirota, there is a heterodyne that contradicts the earlier information, even if it refreshes the formula for one episode, on which the characters act out of character, a second robot appears but disappears soon after for the damage it receives, when Dai-Guard has taken worse time and time again, there is a really unneeded recap episode (aired first week of the year 2000), the division is dissolved but reformed soon afterwards, and you star questioning yourself why aren’t more pilots being trained and how can it be that there is just one scientist in the whole show. Yes, those things are like that on classic mecha as well, but Dai-Guard was supposed to be a comical and down to Earth spin on it, things should be different in this series.The final episodes (19 onwards) have some issues, such as the political conflict being resolved easily in just two episodes, a so-so emotional montage, some characters acting differently than they did during the rest of the show, and the directing of episode 20 being way too experimental to the point of being weird, but in general the last bunch, especially after episode 20, are the best portion of the anime, with more character immersion and even a bit of development (especially for Ibuki, the main girl of the show), heterodyne that actually feel like a threat and that you can take seriously, the second robot reappearing with a proper explanation, the feeling and message of cooperation between the civilians and the military for the sake of the country being recovered, a more serious approach to the destruction caused and how the common people is affected, actual evacuations being made, the best directing of the whole series during episodes 21 and 22, and one hell of a final showdown in the last three episodes.Of course, at this point you ask yourself why they didn’t evacuate on earlier episodes during other attacks, and there definitely was need for some actual deaths at some point, while the ending is not conclusive because there is no actual end for the heterodyne (they are a force of nature), but for the type of lighthearted action show that Dai-Guard is, the final third of the anime is pretty well done.As for characters, I already talked about Akagi and Shirota, Ibuki is the most and best explored one in the whole show, from her backstory and personal drama, her family wanting her to stop piloting because of it being dangerous, the different pressure she has to face for being a woman, how she slowly becomes a bit more like Akagi, and of course two episodes dedicated to her psyche, repressed memories and development near the end of the show. The third main character is Aoyama but he isn’t explored as much besides his personal drama and slowly taking his job more seriously. The interactions between these three and the side characters are otherwise strong, bouncing off each other during the humorous parts, which I wished more anime had and knew how to make. Development and catharsis are otherwise simple and a bit inconsistent, but fine for this type of show.As a whole I found Dai-Guard to be both a cool comedy in the likes of Patlabor on its earlier episodes and a cool tribute to classic mecha thanks to its main character and the final third of the show, and a series that’s worth the watch at least once, but it could have been far better if the middle episodes were better handled or some of them skipped entirely.Similar stuffPatlabor-Real robot mecha and slice of life comedy franchise (except for the movies that turned into crime thrillers and are far more serious).Martian Successor Nadesico and Gekiganger 3-Parody and tribute of old school super robot type of mecha titles.Kenzen Robo Daimidaler-Lewd super robot mecha parody.Gravion-Lewd and goofy super robot tribute mecha title.Bullbuster-Very similar but inferior 2023 title done digitally while the other seems to be done by hand, why’s that?

The backgrounds, especially the inside of the robots, are the best part of the show for the most part, except for the moments when CGI is used.The audio department is very weak, easily the worst part of the whole series. The music? Generic, forgettable, simple, repetitive, just there most of the time, and that includes the opening, which at least fit the atmosphere of the action part of the show just fine. Both are meant to have that retro and classic feel that the show aims to mimic, and they succeed at that, but the results are still weak on their own. The ending is a cute song that fits the slice of life part of the anime with lyrics that both reflect those bits and are aimed directly to the audience. Not amazing in the least nor very memorable, but the best part of the soundtrack as far as I’m concerned. The voice acting is ok, every seiyuu did their work just fine, it’s just that the series and characters themselves didn’t allow any of them to shine in any particular way, as what was required of them was pretty standard and typical. Akiko Hiramatsu was the best out of the whole cast and showed her range once more, simply by playing the most emotional and explored character in the whole series. The sound effects are laughably weak even by 1999 standards, almost nothing has a fraction of the impact it should.The plot is about a public relationships team from a security company using the giant robot titular of the show to fight against the token monsters of the series, classic monster of the week formula with a comical spin on it, not only because of the people piloting and repairing it, but also because of its approach itself to it. The mecha doesn’t really look cool, it wasn’t used for so long that it is rather obsolete and broken, it doesn’t have any cool super attacks, all of its said attacks are down to Earth and comical copies of iconic attacks from classic mecha titles, all of its upgrades are simple weapons, it constantly malfunctions, it has to be repaired or refueled in battle, the monsters it fights against have very simple and uninspired designs that range from a freaking giant baseball to a Mega-Man boss reject, minus the last two which came out of Evangelion or something, and in general the characters are reluctant to fight or care more about their daily lives and relationships, their salaries and vacations and the funding to do all the repairs the giant robot needs, than about the fights and the monsters themselves.Not to say that the battles aren’t given the importance they deserve, despite the comical approach, the same outcomes and weapons used and the low level fights, every monster is different from the others despite having the same weakness, thus every fight requires a certain strategy and a certain field tactic, and it’s cool to watch Dai-Guard itself being affected by the different terrains on which the fights take place and having to adjust to them.The plot structure follows the typical monster of the week formula, but several elements are added to it to add realism and flavor. Because of all the destruction and funding issues caused by the characters, they eventually have the military controlling what they do and even placing a tactical advisor for them, who of course has another mission behind that position, which eventually leads to the creation of another robot and the army becoming an antagonist of sorts on its own. There is also a member of the board of the company wanting to take over its presidential position and change the division of the main characters, themselves included, new pilots and a new tactical advisor trained by the army taking over the Dai-Guard at some point, political issues with another country and army, and of course evolving monsters, and the everyday things the characters have to deal with. All of that enriches an otherwise dried out formula, even with its own funny spin.The pacing is good in the initial episodes, as you are shown the concept, premise, main characters, the personal drama of the main ones, the army and board members slowly taking over, new members that are troublesome, changes in the mecha that make things more difficult, the discovery of what the heterodyne (the monsters) are and their natural formation, and there is a bit of character development especially for Shirota the first military advisor, who learns how to talk with common people and do needed things on the fly in the battlefield, as well as for Akagi, the hot-headed, idealistic and impulsive main character who wants to be some kind of hero of justice because of the mecha anime he watched as a kid. The relationships between these two couldn’t be worse in the beginning, yet they are together so much time they come to find a common ground and noticing what the other has that they themselves lack, thus improving the cooperation during the battles against the heterodyne. The series also bothers to show how the common people are affected by the fights, albeit with a lighthearted approach, nothing really tragic in it. So, it does everything that Bullbuster, which finishes tomorrow, does, but better, and with a much better pacing (Dai-Guard does in, let’s say 4 or 5 out of 26 episodes, what Bullbuster does in 10 out of 12).The middle episodes (let’s say 6 to 18) are the weakest, not so much of the everyday lives of the characters is shown, thus there is no character fleshing, and the fights are weak and silly, to the point of even contradicting the information that was initially provided and having the cast acting out of character at times. There are some good bits in it, like the second robot being made and the army and second advisor becoming a problem, as well as a good message (the public relations division help out people even when they don’t use the robot, giving a new meaning to the catchphrase of the teasers of the next episodes), but in general the plot points presented during this portion of the anime are somewhat poorly handled and not even last long enough.The army and the board member take over, but everyone is incompetent or an asshole, which goes against the cooperation and common ground presented earlier with Akagi and Shirota, there is a heterodyne that contradicts the earlier information, even if it refreshes the formula for one episode, on which the characters act out of character, a second robot appears but disappears soon after for the damage it receives, when Dai-Guard has taken worse time and time again, there is a really unneeded recap episode (aired first week of the year 2000), the division is dissolved but reformed soon afterwards, and you star questioning yourself why aren’t more pilots being trained and how can it be that there is just one scientist in the whole show. Yes, those things are like that on classic mecha as well, but Dai-Guard was supposed to be a comical and down to Earth spin on it, things should be different in this series.The final episodes (19 onwards) have some issues, such as the political conflict being resolved easily in just two episodes, a so-so emotional montage, some characters acting differently than they did during the rest of the show, and the directing of episode 20 being way too experimental to the point of being weird, but in general the last bunch, especially after episode 20, are the best portion of the anime, with more character immersion and even a bit of development (especially for Ibuki, the main girl of the show), heterodyne that actually feel like a threat and that you can take seriously, the second robot reappearing with a proper explanation, the feeling and message of cooperation between the civilians and the military for the sake of the country being recovered, a more serious approach to the destruction caused and how the common people is affected, actual evacuations being made, the best directing of the whole series during episodes 21 and 22, and one hell of a final showdown in the last three episodes.Of course, at this point you ask yourself why they didn’t evacuate on earlier episodes during other attacks, and there definitely was need for some actual deaths at some point, while the ending is not conclusive because there is no actual end for the heterodyne (they are a force of nature), but for the type of lighthearted action show that Dai-Guard is, the final third of the anime is pretty well done.As for characters, I already talked about Akagi and Shirota, Ibuki is the most and best explored one in the whole show, from her backstory and personal drama, her family wanting her to stop piloting because of it being dangerous, the different pressure she has to face for being a woman, how she slowly becomes a bit more like Akagi, and of course two episodes dedicated to her psyche, repressed memories and development near the end of the show. The third main character is Aoyama but he isn’t explored as much besides his personal drama and slowly taking his job more seriously. The interactions between these three and the side characters are otherwise strong, bouncing off each other during the humorous parts, which I wished more anime had and knew how to make. Development and catharsis are otherwise simple and a bit inconsistent, but fine for this type of show.As a whole I found Dai-Guard to be both a cool comedy in the likes of Patlabor on its earlier episodes and a cool tribute to classic mecha thanks to its main character and the final third of the show, and a series that’s worth the watch at least once, but it could have been far better if the middle episodes were better handled or some of them skipped entirely.Similar stuffPatlabor-Real robot mecha and slice of life comedy franchise (except for the movies that turned into crime thrillers and are far more serious).Martian Successor Nadesico and Gekiganger 3-Parody and tribute of old school super robot type of mecha titles.Kenzen Robo Daimidaler-Lewd super robot mecha parody.Gravion-Lewd and goofy super robot tribute mecha title.Bullbuster-Very similar but inferior 2023 title', 'this is More of a real robot than a super Robot show, i liked this it because it show the struggles of a every day working class person in the office, or more like into the cockpit, i think an adult person would enjoy this show more than a studentthe animation and art style is good enough to last the test of timeits very grounded the characters are regular peopleso if you like real robots stories without the deep plot but instead then not getting overtime pay.  you might like this show, but if your into screening power moves OP laser blast then your...in wrong page buddy. in wrong page buddy.']"
Digimon Adventure 02 Movies,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2962/Digimon_Adventure_02_Movies,"[""Out of all of the Digimon movies, this particular one is probably my favorite. The fighting scenes are great, the plot is delivered well, and the music is... Passable, at least. It is, of course, much better than the thirty minute version of it from &quot;The Catastrophe,&quot; as many call it.However, I have ONE small problem with it. Unlike the horrid English version, the original never really gives you a sense of closure. It doesn't explain entirely why Chocomon went crazy, or, if it did, It was too confusing for me to understand. And the fact that it's named after something that happens late in...the movie, and doesn't seem to have a really supreme effect on anything is also a bit confusing. All in all, though, It was-No, IS a great movie. the movie, and doesn't seem to have a really supreme effect on anything is also a bit confusing. All in all, though, It was-No, IS a great movie."", ""This has got to be the WORST Digimon movie ever!!! I really couldn't be more bored than this.First of I really really hated that guy named Wallace, he literally made me scream a couple of times out of anger for how annoying he is.But what was also really annoying was the music. . .  the ELEVATOR MUSIC ruined the whole fighting experience. . .Only thing I could enjoy were the visuals, but still . . .  3/10 "", ""Likewise with most anime movies, it seems, Digimon movies tend to split fans on whether-or-not they should be considered or treated as canon. When it comes to the original series, “Our War Game” and its supposed-sequel “Revenge of Diaboromon” get the most debate, but no one seems to really question about the Zero Two movie—well, technically twin movies, “Digimon Hurricane Touchdown!!” and “Supreme Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals”. There's probably a good reason for that, but it would depend on the fan.This movie has the unfortunate luck to be the last part in the English dub of the Digimon movie, and thus labeled a black sheep....“Our War Game” is admittedly hard to top, but when Saban Entertainment made the attempt to link that movie to this, things got messy and more confusing rather quick. I have to at least throw them a pity bone that they had their reasons for why they did this, and they made do with what they had. Nothing they could've done would've made this any better, although it definitely could've been a lot worse. Both versions of the movie have problems, it's just the English dub gets bashed more even though I personally feel they at least made it slightly more tolerable. I'll explain when I get there.Note: the English dub definitely has a different plot than the original does, but I will bring up both versions here, even if it's to point out differences.Story (6): A young American boy named Willis (a dub rename from “Wallace”) has twin Digimon, Gummymon and Kokomon, but the latter vanishes under mysterious circumstances while they're playing in a field of flowers at a summer home in Colorado. Years later, the DigiDestined are taking a much-deserved break after the defeat of the Digimon Emperor when Kari and T.K., visiting Mimi in New York, witness her disappearance. The other five of the original DigiDestined still in Japan also vanish, being spirited away by a corrupted Kokomon, now Endigomon. After running into Willis and Terriermon's confrontation with Endigomon, T.K. and Kari begin their long travel across America to Colorado, and they tell Davis and the others to meet them there. The trio also run into Willis, and have their own run-ins with the corrupted Digimon, who has been chasing after the boy without recognizing the grown-up Willis, all while going on hitchhiking road trips to Colorado in the hopes to confront and calm the increasingly-berserk Digimon. In the meantime, the disappeared DigiDestined have found themselves in a cold, presumably-nonexistent environment and are slowly decreasing in age as a delusional Kokomon searches for his friend among them.The movie is really nothing more than a road trip across America to the West with the occasional scuffle with Endigomon before having the final, climatic battle in the second half. It honestly doesn't feel like a Digimon movie with this sort of plot/execution, even though it's not a bad idea to show corrupt Digimon, especially one that's partnered with a DigiDestined. It's just that unfortunately (whether this is a good thing or not), we don't get an explanation for why Kokomon became corrupted. The dub, in attempt to link this with “Our War Game”, explained in Willis' exposition that the DigiEgg that came out of the computer had been infected with the same virus that corrupted Diaboromon, and Kokomon caught it, even though Endigomon in actuality came to being because of its loneliness. It's lame, but it's at least an explanation for why Kokomon had gotten spirited away in the dub.Speaking of what the dub did, remember how I said I felt Saban made it a little bit more tolerable, even IF the pacing felt a jumpy? Well, that's because most of the padding was removed—and “Hurricane Touchdown!!” has more padding than the “Golden Digimentals”. Looking at the original, most of it could've been left in, especially when it came to the six DigiDestined disappearing into the void and when Willis and Davis are talking in the forest (although that moment in the dub just feels like a funny Davis moment, and I secretly love those), but it must not have “fit in” with the “virus link”, or they just HAD to put in the Angela Anaconda short and felt no more could be added to the duration. Even so, some of that padding didn't add much to Willis and Terriermon's characters even though some of that padding was them talking about things that don't really go anywhere. Slow moments are fine, but when it goes nowhere, it's hard to sit through, and they could be cut from the film and nothing would be lost. And to briefly point this out, the hitchhiking was rewritten to be the result of “relatives of Yolei” running into them, since hitchhiking has become discouraged, at least in America (and I imagine in 2002 it was still common even in the countryside which is where most of the film takes place, but it was slowly being more and more frowned upon).The second half of the “Golden Digimentals” are what people remember most when thinking back to this film, and it's truly the most memorable part, mainly when the final evolved form, a corrupted Cherubimon, comes in. The fight scenes aren't bad, probably could've been more balanced out between the Digimon, though they at least showed how much difficulty there was when it came to fighting Cherubimon. But that's not what everyone remembers, no. It's the deus ex machina involving Angemon and Angewomon briefly Warp Digivolving to their Mega levels for the sake of activating the Golden DigiEggs; I don't know how, but they do. So in the movie, we got to see Magnamon again, and that's cool, but at least in the series, there was build up to it. There was nothing in this film that at least foreshadowed the Golden DigiEggs to come into play (unless you want to stretch it out and say “Well, Cherubimon's a Mega!”). But who cares, it's Magnamon, and he and Rapidmon save the day!Oh, and while we occasionally cut back to the original six DigiDestined in the nothingness, even getting to see them as young children (back to the same age as when they witnessed the Greymon and Parrotmon battle at Highton View Terrace), we don't see them again after Kokomon checks them out. Apparently they went back to normal after all was over and done with, but we don't even get an after credits scene of them. So I'm just going to assume they were all erased from existence. Thanks a lot, movie.Art/Animation (8): This was the visual red flag in the English dub that it was an entirely different movie. The previous two were all directed by Mamoru Hosoda, whose art-style is distinctive. That's not to say Shigeyasu Yamauchi's is all bad, it's still smooth, and the characters are animated rather well. The style was just indeed vastly different, and somewhat jarring, but with the movies by themselves, it fits fine. There are no complaints here about how it looks, and the sceneries all look nice with either the majority or all of the backgrounds done in watercolor. I can't say for sure if it fits the Colorado/Midwestern look, or at least back in 2002, but it's definitely not Japan, nor the Digital World.Sound (6): The English dub's soundtrack mostly consists of pop/rock songs, it's standard Saban dub-fare. Whether those songs fit the movie or not rests entirely on the viewer; I personally don't care for them in most cases. The original score consists mostly of Western-style atmospheric music that's remindful of Trigun. And that was distracting, to be honest, as it never goes beyond this style. I get it, the setting's in America, particularly in the Midwest-further-West, and it has a nostalgic feel to it. However, when that same piece of music is being used for the fight scenes, it was hard to tell if it fit the mood. There was one moment near the end where a song does come in while the Digimon are proclaiming they'll always protect their partners and Magnamon and Rapidmon release Cherubimon, but I can't tell you if it works, especially when the music style is still the same.At least the song during the ending credits is by Ai Maeda, and she was stellar as always. That song fits better than the “Kids in America” cover in the English dub.Characters (6): While Davis is in more of the movie than the others, the DigiDestined and their Digimon are the same as in the series, so the only ones really worth mentioning here are Willis, Terriermon, and Kokomon. To get Willis out of the way, he's boring, both in the original and in the dub, even though there's apparently character development that I couldn't catch. There's nothing to his character that makes him really stand out other than he had twin Digimon and he lives in America where he goes back-and-forth between Japanese and English (in the original—it's rare for him to slip into Engrish territory, actually, have to give the voice actress credit for that). He did crack more sarcastic quips in the dub, but that's to be expected with Saban, and he doesn't stand out from that, either. Willis also had this thing for Yolei and apparently Kari because I guess he likes Japanese girls? He had a Japanese girlfriend, but that was his only reasoning, even though that was how he learned Japanese (which is funny because at least one time on the phone to his mother, he was speaking Japanese when he normally spoke English). Oh, and Terriermon kept making remarks he's a momma's boy even though we can see that each time he calls her up. We can assume he's the same age as Davis and the others, so why his mother let him travel by himself is beyond me.Terriermon is your typical Digimon partner, always saying he'll be by Willis' side no matter what, and that he'll always protect him. Voiced by Aoi Tada in the original and Mona Marshall in the dub, they're both good performances and probably the best in the film (and weirdly coincidental, they both would reprise their roles as another Terriermon in Tamers). What makes him a little different is he's a twin, so he would talk about Kokomon here and there in trying to assure Willis that he did nothing wrong, and that it was no one's fault Kokomon became corrupt. Like with the other Digimon, Terriermon's pretty much Willis' foil, so I suppose they balance each other out fine. Keeps Willis from being a nobody, that's for sure.Kokomon is the antagonist who came to be probably not of his own free will, but from his loneliness. Well, at least when he was Endigomon, he was lonely, it's not known how it extends to when he was still Kokomon. He just all of a sudden gets corrupted, and he has no memories but of him playing with Willis as a child. Apparently he was kidnapping anyone with a Digivice in the search for Willis, but we only get to see the original six DigiDestined get spirited away by him (or by whatever's actually possessing him). He Digivolves up into his Mega level during the course of the second half when he becomes threatening, consumed by a “dark heart”, as Kari mentioned. This could make for an interesting villain, or at least a lackey of whatever was the true evil behind it all, but when you pit him up again Diaboromon, he's not as threatening, or even as memorable outside as Cherubimon. He suffers this in the English dub because of it, whether he deserves it or not. But by himself, he's okay, albeit tragic.Enjoyment (5): Even with the cheesiness of the Saban dub, I don't care for this one. The original may only be an hour long total, but from the way I kept looking at the clock the entire time, it felt longer due to its padding and slow moments. I don't hate it, I just don't like watching it in either version. I know it's not a good idea to compare it to “Our War Game”, however, the English dub didn't really give much of a choice in that regard. And considering the twin films aren't considered canon to the timeline, nothing will be missed, let alone gained. Sure, there was a CD drama that DID take place in the same “canon”, but I have no personal interest to seek that out even if things get explored more.Really, this was more for Digimon fans than the average movie-goer, and that could've been the biggest contributor to why the English dub of the movie doesn't have good reviews (ignoring the splicing of the three movies). I found “Revenge of Diaboromon” a better Zero Two movie than this, to be frank, but there are still fans who do like this film, and I can't take that enjoyment away from them. I just personally couldn't really get into it, and I'd more-or-less advise a “skip if you want to” than a recommendation. “Our War Game” is admittedly hard to top, but when Saban Entertainment made the attempt to link that movie to this, things got messy and more confusing rather quick. I have to at least throw them a pity bone that they had their reasons for why they did this, and they made do with what they had. Nothing they could've done would've made this any better, although it definitely could've been a lot worse.

But by himself, he's okay, albeit tragic.Enjoyment (5): Even with the cheesiness of the Saban dub, I don't care for this one. The original may only be an hour long total, but from the way I kept looking at the clock the entire time, it felt longer due to its padding and slow moments. I don't hate it, I just don't like watching it in either version. I know it's not a good idea to compare it to “Our War Game”, however, the English dub didn't really give much of a choice in that regard. And considering the twin films aren't considered canon to the timeline, nothing will be missed, let alone gained. Sure, there was a CD drama that DID take place in the same “canon”, but I have no personal interest to seek that out even if things get explored more.Really, this was more for Digimon fans than the average movie-goer, and that could've been the biggest contributor to why the English dub of the movie doesn't have good reviews (ignoring the splicing of the three movies). I found “Revenge of Diaboromon” a better Zero Two movie than this, to be frank, but there are still fans who do like this film, and I can't take that enjoyment away from them. I just personally couldn't really get into it, and I'd more-or-less advise a “skip if you want to” than a recommendation."", 'I’m one of those few people that prefer 02 over Adventure. Maybe it’s because I saw it first, maybe it’s because of what a deep and complicated character Ken was. Anyway, you can imagine that I was very happy when I saw there was a film (and I mean film length film not a double episode wannabe film). Of course, I knew how horrid dub is, so I watched the subbed version. More golden Digimentals, must be amazing, right? As long as one of the doesn’t go to a new character that was never mentioned before, sure. Too bad that happened here.Story: 6/10This was a...huge let down. If for nothing else then because it had a lot of promise and could have turned out truly epic if done right. Or if done at all. We get a build up for a very dark story and if you manage to sympathise with a character you’ve never seen before, it’s actually very dark and sad. Then you keep wondering how the hell did that happen since what is happenning could in no way be natural. Well, don’t expect anyone to tell you anything directly.By the way, the dub version actually gave it a slight reasoning and it shortened the film by a half so it might not be as bad. Well, ignoring hinting at couples that make no sense and scenes that... well, make even less sense.Art: 7/10I’m not a huge fan of the art in this film. It felt kind of… lazy but it wasn’t bad.Sound: 7/10Not a complaint, though nothing really epic or amazing, kind of boring. Basically, 02 bgm. If there was something new, I missed it what doesn’t really make it a good music.Characters: 5/10We get our 02 characters minus Ken (since it’s set before his arc ends) plus a new character, you’ve never heard of before (unless you watched the dub). The new character Willis/Wallace wasn’t a highlight. Most of his screentime (and there’s a lot of it) he spends either being depressed and shouting at digimon to stop fighting (not at the right one either) or travelling and constantly calling his mommy… or both. I really couldn’t feel with him, I found him very annoying and stupid. He also somewhat prefers one of his Digimon a lot (even before he disappeared) what also isn’t a really likeable trait. Especially when the less liked one keeps risking his life for him through the whole film and never complains.Enjoyment: 6/10This was very boring and since Wallace takes about 50% of screentime (25% gets Daisuke and 25% the rest) the only entertainment I got was at the end. The ending battle and scenes were amazing and truly worth wasting my time with the film.Overal: 6/10This wasn’t bad but for me it takes the place of the worst Digimon film (I haven’t seen any Savers films yet). It had much promise, I just wish it got explained properly how and why it happened. They could have also made Wallace a bit more likeable. Not to mention cut about 40% of the film that everyone just spends traveling (no kidding) and nothing really happens. Aside from that, it was fun to watch. huge let down.

Sound and art is superb, but that alone does not save this snore fest. It's just an all around uninteresting and unsatisfying experience from a Digimon movie.

The character Wallace is the most boring and annoying guy ever and the music and sound effects are just pathetic. Why the hell would you use elevator music in the main fight scene of the movie?

Adachi to Shimamura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39790/Adachi_to_Shimamura,"['Shoujo Ai/Yuri is a somewhat controversial genre. Most people I have seen are quite indifferent when it comes to Shoujo Ai and often try avoiding it; partly because same sex relationship has always been a sensitive topic, but mostly because of the fact that a lot of Shoujo Ai anime have been very ineffective lately.I\'m not a big fan of Shoujo Ai either. While I\'m definitely not against the concept of lesbian relationships being depicted in anime, among the few Shoujo Ai anime that I watched, not a single one managed to appeal to me. Rather, because of poor storytelling and particularly bland characters, I...thought they were mediocre to say the least. Suffice to say, my experience with the Shoujo Ai genre hasn\'t exactly been great.Until I found Adachi to Shimamura, that is.I won\'t lie, I was a bit skeptical about watching Adachi to Shimamura at first. Having had a bitter experience with the Shoujo Ai genre in the past, my first impressions of the show weren\'t very promising. I thought it was just going to be another generic Shoujo Ai anime—it didn\'t seem like something I would enjoy. I probably couldn\'t have been more wrong, though, as I fell in love with the series right from the get-go.Adachi to Shimamura, or shortly AdaShima, is built on the relationship of two high school students, namely—you guessed it—Adachi and Shimamura. The story of the anime is told from the perspectives of these two young girls, as they spend precious time together and try to figure out what they truly mean to each other. And I have to say, this show does such a beautiful job at portraying their relationship.Adachi and Shimamura are introduced as typical buddies who merely hangout with each other during class time. We are given the early impression that they don\'t see each other as more than somewhat close friends. However, as the distance between the two continues decrease, they begin to realize that their relationship might not be as simple as they initially thought. When I\'m saying ""they"", I\'m mostly referring to Adachi. I will get to that in a bit.Adachi and Shimamura are rather unalike, I would say. On one hand, we have Adachi, an unsociable and shy girl who prefers avoiding any social interaction and skips almost all of her classes. On the other hand, we have Shimamura, who also skips classes; but unlike Adachi, she seems sociable and outgoing (which isn\'t entirely true). Shimamura, in many ways, is vastly different from Adachi. However, when they are together, their dissimilarities cease to become relevant and don\'t matter at all.Since AdaShima explores the minds of both Adachi and Shimamura individually, we get insights into their thought-processes and their feelings for each other. Because of this, we are quickly informed of any kind of development in their relationship, even if it may seem minor or insignificant to most. This is one of the many aspects that separate AdaShima from other Shoujo Ai anime, and this is also where Adachi\'s excellence shows in my opinion.Adachi is easily the shining star of the show for me. Don\'t get me wrong; I love Shimamura too, but Adachi is truly special. Her prowess as a character probably lies the most in her relatability. Yes, she might be very reserved, timid and unsociable. Yes, she might even be a little clingy, jealous and possessive at times. But knowing her circumstances, pretty much all of it is justifiable. Adachi, just like any other person, wants to make a lot of friends. She wants to talk with them, hangout with them, go to various places with them, and simply have a lot of fun with them. And Shimamura is just the person who can help her do that.Insightful explorations into Adachi\'s mind is another aspect that makes her such a great character. Through these explorations, the anime lets the viewers know more of Adachi\'s thoughts, internal struggles, insecurities—or to put it simply, Adachi herself. This greatly fleshes out her character and makes her a nuanced person. Her monologues about herself and her feelings for Shimamura are also nothing short of beautiful, making her even more appealing as a character. Adachi\'s seiyuu Akari Kitou\'s contribution here is undeniably vital.In a way, among the two, Adachi plays a more—for lack of a better word—mature role in the relationship. Despite rejecting her feelings toward Shimamura at first, she gradually learns to accept it. While Shimamura stays kinda oblivious of her feelings for considerably a long time, Adachi becomes aware of her feelings rather quickly and tries her best to advance their relationship, even if she doesn\'t always succeed. This explains what I said a few paragraphs ago (about ""they"" mostly referring to Adachi).As I said earlier, though, Shimamura is not a bad character by any means. She is rather one of the most essential parts that make AdaShima so great. She seems ordinary upon first impression, but it is soon apparent that there is far more to her than meets the eye. Shimamura keeps up the appearance of a normal, friendly and outgoing girl, but in reality, she is a self-aware person who has built an imaginary shell around her that most people, including her ""friends"", can\'t get through. She always stays cautious of others when she interacts with them and never puts much trust in them, which explains her oblivious nature at times. Again, adeptly dissecting Shimamura\'s mind through monologues like Adachi is very effective in this regard.Shimamura\'s contribution in Adachi\'s development is irrefutable. It\'s because of Shimamura that Adachi is starting to change for the better. Like Adachi said, Shimamura is her sun—someone who makes her everyday life a lot brighter and a lot more exciting. Because of Shimamura, school has turned into something Adachi now looks forward to everyday. Contrary to her past self, she has become a lot livelier and a lot more cheerful. And that truly is a remarkable achievement.That isn\'t to say Adachi didn\'t have any affect on Shimamura at all. In fact, she did. Shimamura may not have realized it right away, but Adachi is one of the very few people who have broken through her shell and have directly affected her. While some viewers might say that Shimamura\'s change isn\'t very apparent, it isn\'t negligible by any means. Rather, Adachi\'s arrival is a very crucial event in Shimamura\'s life that helped her change herself for the better.Some people may have complaints about the slow progression of Adachi and Shimamura\'s relationship, but I don\'t think it\'s an issue at all. It\'s true that their relationship progresses at a rather slow pace, but the progression is indeed steady and consistent for the entirety of the series. In most romance anime, this slow progression would get annoying after a while, but here, it\'s completely believable if you take their personalities and their circumstances into account (for example, the fact that both of them are girls, for which they are likely to have a more difficult time understanding their emotions).Another aspect that is worth looking into is how their relationship progresses—or more specifically, what helps their relationship progress. As I said earlier, the romantic advancement in AdaShima is rather slow-paced, but it is purposeful and not done in an unrealistic way for the most part. A lot of thought and consideration has been put into almost all of their interactions and dialogues to make them meaningful and relatable to all the viewers.An example of this can be found in episode 4. At the end of the episode, Shimamura buys Adachi a juice can, which Adachi decides to keep to herself instead of throwing it away and cherishes it as a gift from Shimamura. This may seem stupid to others, but I think every person who has ever been in love, irrespective of their sexuality, can relate to this. Yes, it is stupid. But that doesn\'t make it wrong or meaningless any way. No matter what others may say, it is, in fact, quite meaningful.This, again, shows how much care has been given to make Adachi and Shimamura\'s relationship genuine and convincing. Even seemingly trivial things are actually impactful on the twl, but it is almost never unrealistically portrayed. As time passes on like it always does, Adachi and Shimamura grow closer to each other as, to simply put, things happen between them. And we, as the viewers, can\'t help cheer them on for their ever-budding relationship. At least I couldn\'t.Although the main focus of the series is Adachi and Shimamura, other characters do get a fair amount of screentime. The most notable one of all is, of course, Yashiro Chikama.I find Yashiro\'s role in the show to be rather bizarre and ambiguous to be honest. Early in the anime, she is seen wearing a full-body spacesuit and introducing herself as an ""alien"" who has come to Earth from outer space to look for her compatriot. And even after 12 episodes, that\'s basically all we get to know about her. Though her physical appearance is shown later, her actual identity is never revealed, which makes you doubt the plausibility of her character. Despite this, though, Yashiro is mostly a charming individual. While her antics might come off as weird to a lot of viewers, and there are times when she can be slightly irritating, it\'s pretty hard to dislike her.Aside from Yashiro, Hino and Nagafuji appear regularly in the anime. They are introduced as childhood buddies who are friends with Shimamura since middle school. However, later in the series, it becomes apparent that their relationship may involve romance. While Hino and Nagafuji aren\'t nearly as nuanced and developed as Adachi and Shimamura, they are given enough screentime to make the viewers actually care about them. Some might argue that removing these two entirely would have no effect on the story, but I don\'t think it\'s true. Hino and Nagafuji are, in some ways, impactful on the relationship of Adachi and Shimamura, and thus they are impactful on the overall story as well.Moving on to other supporting characters, they are all likeable and, more importantly, behave in a consistent and reasonable manner which makes them all believable. Occasionally, they help the story move forward, but it doesn\'t feel redundant at all. Adachi\'s mother, Shimamura\'s sister and mother—everyone plays their role consistently and contributes to the progression of the story when needed. (There is one problem, however, which I\'ll bring up again a little later.)AdaShima doesn\'t fail to impress me in terms of its production quality either. The animation is very beautiful. The artstyle is rather distinct, colorful and vivid, immediately leaving a memorable impression on the viewers\' mind. What is more noteworthy, though, is the clever use of visual metaphors and how helpful they are in regard of subtly depicting Adachi and Shimamura\'s thoughts and emotions. Though, there are a few fanservice scenes involving some of the characters (specifically bath scenes), which are quite unnecessary and can feel a bit bothersome. But other than that, there isn\'t much to complain about.The soundtrack of AdaShima is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. The background music is mostly upbeat, resembling the rather light-hearted nature of the show. There are a few melancholic tunes as well, that are played during the more serious scenes and add more immersion to them. The opening song ""Kimi no Aeta Hi"" is quite cheerful, while the ending song ""Kimi no Tonari de"" has a sort of sombre tone to it. Nonetheless, both of these songs are very remarkable. The voice acting is also impressive. Notably, the seiyuu of Adachi and Shimamura, respectively Akari and Miku, performed extraordinarily well and added more depth to their respective characters through their voice acting.Now, although AdaShima is mostly brilliant, there are a few issues....The first issue of the anime, as I mentioned earlier, stems from Yashiro. While she herself is not a bad character, the ambiguity and vagueness surrounding her may make it difficult to find her presence in the show significant. This can be overlooked in some cases; however, the second problem is rather severe and problematic. It won\'t be hard at all to notice that there isn\'t a single named male character in the cast, which alone makes the secondary cast kinda weak and vigourless. There are also occasional bath scenes, a few out-of-place plot elements (the fortune teller, for example), and the random appearance of a lolicon in episode 4 which was completely unnecessary and devoid of any logic whatsoever.What perhaps will irk the viewers the most, though, is how the show concludes.Many people probably won\'t be fully satisfied with the ending of AdaShima, as it feels sort of incomplete and leaves you wanting for more. This isn\'t inherently a flaw of the story, however, considering the light novel of AdaShima is still being published and a lot of it is yet to be adapted—which gives hopes for a second season. But the problem is, the anime industry has a tendency to leave anime adaptations incomplete. Simply, many anime adaptations are never given a second season. Unfortunately, this is even likelier to be the case with AdaShima, taking into account that it hasn\'t gained much popularity. Even so, I will be waiting patiently.It\'s not often that you find a genuinely compelling Shoujo Ai anime, which is why Adachi to Shimamura is truly special. It isn\'t free of flaws, and it isn\'t the most serious portrayal of same sex relationships, but it\'s nonetheless a spectacular anime. Adachi and Shimamura are simply outstanding. They are greatly nuanced and realistic characters that I believe almost anyone can find relatable. Combine this amazing main cast with consistent and likeable supporting characters, well crafted story, alluring artwork and beautiful soundtrack, and you\'ve got yourself a marvelous anime.It\'s just a shame that not many Shoujo Ai anime are like this. thought they were mediocre to say the least. Suffice to say, my experience with the Shoujo Ai genre hasn\'t exactly been great.Until I found Adachi to Shimamura, that is.I won\'t lie, I was a bit skeptical about watching Adachi to Shimamura at first.

But that doesn\'t make it wrong or meaningless any way. No matter what others may say, it is, in fact, quite meaningful.This, again, shows how much care has been given to make Adachi and Shimamura\'s relationship genuine and convincing. Even seemingly trivial things are actually impactful on the twl, but it is almost never unrealistically portrayed. As time passes on like it always does, Adachi and Shimamura grow closer to each other as, to simply put, things happen between them. And we, as the viewers, can\'t help cheer them on for their ever-budding relationship. At least I couldn\'t.Although the main focus of the series is Adachi and Shimamura, other characters do get a fair amount of screentime. The most notable one of all is, of course, Yashiro Chikama.I find Yashiro\'s role in the show to be rather bizarre and ambiguous to be honest. Early in the anime, she is seen wearing a full-body spacesuit and introducing herself as an ""alien"" who has come to Earth from outer space to look for her compatriot. And even after 12 episodes, that\'s basically all we get to know about her. Though her physical appearance is shown later, her actual identity is never revealed, which makes you doubt the plausibility of her character. Despite this, though, Yashiro is mostly a charming individual. While her antics might come off as weird to a lot of viewers, and there are times when she can be slightly irritating, it\'s pretty hard to dislike her.Aside from Yashiro, Hino and Nagafuji appear regularly in the anime. They are introduced as childhood buddies who are friends with Shimamura since middle school. However, later in the series, it becomes apparent that their relationship may involve romance. While Hino and Nagafuji aren\'t nearly as nuanced and developed as Adachi and Shimamura, they are given enough screentime to make the viewers actually care about them. Some might argue that removing these two entirely would have no effect on the story, but I don\'t think it\'s true. Hino and Nagafuji are, in some ways, impactful on the relationship of Adachi and Shimamura, and thus they are impactful on the overall story as well.Moving on to other supporting characters, they are all likeable and, more importantly, behave in a consistent and reasonable manner which makes them all believable. Occasionally, they help the story move forward, but it doesn\'t feel redundant at all. Adachi\'s mother, Shimamura\'s sister and mother—everyone plays their role consistently and contributes to the progression of the story when needed. (There is one problem, however, which I\'ll bring up again a little later.)AdaShima doesn\'t fail to impress me in terms of its production quality either. The animation is very beautiful. The artstyle is rather distinct, colorful and vivid, immediately leaving a memorable impression on the viewers\' mind. What is more noteworthy, though, is the clever use of visual metaphors and how helpful they are in regard of subtly depicting Adachi and Shimamura\'s thoughts and emotions. Though, there are a few fanservice scenes involving some of the characters (specifically bath scenes), which are quite unnecessary and can feel a bit bothersome. But other than that, there isn\'t much to complain about.The soundtrack of AdaShima is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. The background music is mostly upbeat, resembling the rather light-hearted nature of the show. There are a few melancholic tunes as well, that are played during the more serious scenes and add more immersion to them. The opening song ""Kimi no Aeta Hi"" is quite cheerful, while the ending song ""Kimi no Tonari de"" has a sort of sombre tone to it. Nonetheless, both of these songs are very remarkable. The voice acting is also impressive. Notably, the seiyuu of Adachi and Shimamura, respectively Akari and Miku, performed extraordinarily well and added more depth to their respective characters through their voice acting.Now, although AdaShima is mostly brilliant, there are a few issues....The first issue of the anime, as I mentioned earlier, stems from Yashiro. While she herself is not a bad character, the ambiguity and vagueness surrounding her may make it difficult to find her presence in the show significant. This can be overlooked in some cases; however, the second problem is rather severe and problematic. It won\'t be hard at all to notice that there isn\'t a single named male character in the cast, which alone makes the secondary cast kinda weak and vigourless. There are also occasional bath scenes, a few out-of-place plot elements (the fortune teller, for example), and the random appearance of a lolicon in episode 4 which was completely unnecessary and devoid of any logic whatsoever.What perhaps will irk the viewers the most, though, is how the show concludes.Many people probably won\'t be fully satisfied with the ending of AdaShima, as it feels sort of incomplete and leaves you wanting for more. This isn\'t inherently a flaw of the story, however, considering the light novel of AdaShima is still being published and a lot of it is yet to be adapted—which gives hopes for a second season. But the problem is, the anime industry has a tendency to leave anime adaptations incomplete. Simply, many anime adaptations are never given a second season. Unfortunately, this is even likelier to be the case with AdaShima, taking into account that it hasn\'t gained much popularity. Even so, I will be waiting patiently.It\'s not often that you find a genuinely compelling Shoujo Ai anime, which is why Adachi to Shimamura is truly special. It isn\'t free of flaws, and it isn\'t the most serious portrayal of same sex relationships, but it\'s nonetheless a spectacular anime. Adachi and Shimamura are simply outstanding. They are greatly nuanced and realistic characters that I believe almost anyone can find relatable. Combine this amazing main cast with consistent and likeable supporting characters, well crafted story, alluring artwork and beautiful soundtrack, and you\'ve got yourself a marvelous anime.It\'s just a shame that not many Shoujo Ai anime are like this.', ""Humans are social animals, meaning we interact with other humans and experiment how we live with our lives. Adachi no Shimamura’s storytelling feels like a social exploration of two female characters and how their interactions influences each other. Hitoma Iruma’s light novel getting an anime adaptation brings together this unforgettable slice of life, romance tale.Everyone in this world has their own story. Regardless of race, gender, social status, or any other factor, each one of us lives in our own story. However, our own story sometimes intersects with others and that’s how relationships are built. Among relationships, one of the most dynamic and complex is...romance. Not every romance story begins with a pair of characters falling in love. From the very first episodes, we meet Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura. With a habit of skipping school classes, both girls meet by what seems to be a red line string of fate. On that special day, their story would come together and become one they won’t ever forget.At their age, teenagers are the most common form of social animals in society. Adachi and Shimamura exemplifies what it means to be youthful and growing up. They may not have endgame goals in life yet but they have to opportunity to discover their future. Adachi no Shimamura carries a relationship bond that can be simple to understand or complex as you want it to be. Adachi’s encounter with Shimamura isn’t anything out of the ordinary but there’s already something special about them from the very first episode. From there on, the two builds on their relationship beyond the classroom doors as they each discover similarities and differences between each other.Indeed, this anime’s roadmap has it settled together with the beginning, middle, and to the end. It would seem that while the anime adaptation handles itself at 12 episodes, it knew what road to follow with its pacing. Every episode throws in a new opportunity in some shape or form for Adachi and Shimamura to bond. It all feels so realistic because these opportunities exist in real life such as going shopping, sharing presents during the holidays, or simply just hanging out together at school. Do you remember your teenage years? It was a time to learn more about just school. It was a time to learn about how to be who you want to be in society. Adachi and Shimamura's personalities are also amplified whenever they are together. When you see the two interact, it looks like two curious animals playing with each other. This is unusual for the case of Adachi, as she is introduced with a rather reserved personality. On the other hand, Shimamura is somewhat of a scatterbrain with trouble socializing with others. From the first few episodes, you can tell that both characters aren’t exactly classroom leaders or the first person to raise their hand in class for a school play. They keep to themselves and skip classes to avoid social interaction.Despite the small cast of characters, the show maintains important relationships between its cast. Outside of our titular characters, there’s also Hino and Nagafuji. With their strong connection, we learn about their commitment as close friends, and perhaps even more. It’s through their bond that carries the intimacy of a relationship. Further down the road, we are introduced to self-proclaimed alien girl Yashiro Chikama, one of the most unusual characters in the show. (don't worry, she's not an actual alien). Often wondering around and about, Chikama displays the innocence of a social animal. Unlike most of the main cast, she loves interacting with others and trying to sell her image as an alien. This type of personality represents the opposite of Adachi and Shimamura, who tries to avoid dealing with other social animals. Nonetheless, Chikama’s addition to the show brings in the comedic side of the anime. Let’s face it, if this show is melancholic throughout the entire duration, it could feel stale. And indeed, be prepared for a lot of melancholic moments ranging from the very first episode to the end. Like I said before, it would seem this show had its roadmap planned from the start. It knew where the anime would begin and how it would end.Watching this show from start to finish also felt like living in their world with the cast. Adachi and Shimamura are designed with delicacy and feminine charm. This is especially true for Adachi with her icy dark hair while Shimamura has the look of an innocent young woman. On the other hand, Chikama has the unusual look of her skin, almost as if shining as an otherworldly being. Regardless, all the characters are believable humans and it’s not hard to see why. Their character expressions reflect how normal people would interact regardless of their personalities. Furthermore, there’s an elegant degree of tranquility with the visual backgrounds of the show. This applies to scenes with bike riding scenes to the intimate moments we see so often throughout each episode. No, you won’t get to see girls having sex but you will definitely see how curious social animals such as Adachi and Shimamura come together like destiny.I’m just going to throw it out here and say that regardless how you feel about lesbian relationships, there’s a chance to learn something about the show altogether.

It’s not often that animanga/LN’s portray Yuri in a realistic manner. Often times the girls are heavily sexualised and the romance feels like pure fanservice for horny guys.

While there’s certainly some traditional Yuri and romance tropes going on in the series, for the most part the storytelling is grounded and natural.On top of handling romance well, I think Adachi to Shimamura does a great job of handling adolescence and the challenges of sexual identity.

Not only is the normal setting just good to look at, but some of the visuals, are just truly stunning. I highly praise the anime for that.

What more could a girl want? For all of that to go somewhere, probably.I have not read the manga, so I don't know if anything was resolved further there.

Believe it or not, I was actually interested in watching this show mainly because I am a fan of the seiyuu cast, and character designs look aesthetically pleasing.  I decided to watch this, and thankfully, it piqued my interest.  It has become one of my favorite yuri series, and it\'s my personal favorite anime in Fall 2020.The main duo of the aforementioned names, Adachi and Shimamura, are the highlights of the show, and I would say that they are some of the best written and most relatable out of...all the yuri series I have watched so far.  Both are extremes of emotional states all of us have felt at one time or another, and both are fundamentally flawed human beings in different ways.  Both of them called themselves as ""delinquents"" because they had a habit of skipping class. It is their gradual emotional development that makes up the substance of the series, both in general and to each other.Hogetsu Shimamura is a reasonably functional, sociable girl who just has no real attachment to life. She is unwilling to put relationships beyond the bare minimum effort towards them because she feels that human relationships are bothersome and require too much effort to maintain such balance.  She is passive, she\'s never takes the initiative, and she doesn\'t speak her preference about where the flow of time carries her.  She\'s also a bit of an airhead, as well as being an indifferent kind of girl, and it made her to skip class as well as not being aware of Adachi\'s own flaws initially.  Shimamura has two of her other friends, who are Hino and Nagafuji.Sakura Adachi, on the other hand, is both shy and unsociable.  She\'s so introverted, she finds herself incapable of connecting with others because she can\'t clearly speak what\'s on her mind, and it make the entire situation difficult for her.  She is very lonely in every sense of the word, she didn\'t even have much of a relationship with her family. It\'s this suffocating loneliness that has made her to also skip class.  Adachi has finally met her first partner, Shimamura, the first person she ever truly wanted to interact with.  Then they eventually became friends and started getting into the relationship together.Shimamura was my favorite because she\'s actually pretty sweet and humble, albeit she\'s indifferent, & she likes to tease sometimes.  Also, she\'s voiced by Miku Itou who is my personal favorite seiyuu because of her sweet voice.  Then I noticed that Adachi has an introverted personality that is similar to mine because she and I have had some emotional problems.  It makes her especially relatable to me, and it also makes her such an interesting, well-written character.  If I\'m Adachi, I would feel pretty similar when I get to have a relationship with someone because I\'m pretty introverted myself, and I wouldn\'t mind at all if I can meet a person like Shimamura.  Both characters are very likable with different kinds of flaws, and both end up in relationship in a pure, simple way at a slow, but steady pace.Hino is a bubbly, petite girl who enjoys fishing, and she often complains not having friends who have a similar interest.  Her childhood friend Nagafuji is a busty, mature girl who\'s also an airhead, and she slaps Hino whenever Hino touches her chest.  Those two are both very lovable and entertaining, and they even give some helpful advice to Adachi and Shimamura to balance out their conflicting relationship.  Yashiro, the mascot of the series, is a girl in the astronaut suit who turns out to be a glowing blue-haired alien girl.  She really loves sweets and she can even eat them under her helmet!  Personally, I find her annoying, and she\'s the only part that I don\'t like in the anime.  She seems to be out-of-place, and I can tell that Shimamura feels irritated when she meets this alien loli.The artsyle of this is both crisp and beautiful, and I would like to give props to Tezuka Productions, which is the same animation studio that made The Quintessential Quintuplets.  I\'m really impressed on how beautifully illustrated the animations and character designs are, and the lighting helps highlighting the emotion scenes well. The voice acting is incredibly well done, and Akari Kito, Miku Itou, Manami Numakura, and Reina Ueda all have done an amazing job portraying their characters.To me, a plot doesn\'t have to be ground-breaking to make the anime enjoyable.  Adachi to Shimamura proves itself to be a highly entertaining romance anime without wasting the viewer’s time bringing up typical, nonsensical tropes, although there are some fanservice in some scenes.  The main characters are relatable and well-written, and their relationship gives me a wholesome feeling.

Both characters are very likable with different kinds of flaws, and both end up in relationship in a pure, simple way at a slow, but steady pace.Hino is a bubbly, petite girl who enjoys fishing, and she often complains not having friends who have a similar interest.  Her childhood friend Nagafuji is a busty, mature girl who\'s also an airhead, and she slaps Hino whenever Hino touches her chest.  Those two are both very lovable and entertaining, and they even give some helpful advice to Adachi and Shimamura to balance out their conflicting relationship.  Yashiro, the mascot of the series, is a girl in the astronaut suit who turns out to be a glowing blue-haired alien girl.  She really loves sweets and she can even eat them under her helmet!  Personally, I find her annoying, and she\'s the only part that I don\'t like in the anime.  She seems to be out-of-place, and I can tell that Shimamura feels irritated when she meets this alien loli.The artsyle of this is both crisp and beautiful, and I would like to give props to Tezuka Productions, which is the same animation studio that made The Quintessential Quintuplets.  I\'m really impressed on how beautifully illustrated the animations and character designs are, and the lighting helps highlighting the emotion scenes well. The voice acting is incredibly well done, and Akari Kito, Miku Itou, Manami Numakura, and Reina Ueda all have done an amazing job portraying their characters.To me, a plot doesn\'t have to be ground-breaking to make the anime enjoyable.  Adachi to Shimamura proves itself to be a highly entertaining romance anime without wasting the viewer’s time bringing up typical, nonsensical tropes, although there are some fanservice in some scenes.  The main characters are relatable and well-written, and their relationship gives me a wholesome feeling.  Adachi to Shimamura is one of my personal favorite yuri series I\'ve watched, and I recommend this to the fans of the slice-of-life shoujo-ai series.', 'Cutesy (albeit cliche), pure and wholesome (albeit tropey) Yuri, the Animation. ""It takes two (hands) to clap/tango"" as they say.A story of two ""magical fairy-tales"": a girl and a girl (how else am I gonna say?), the former very closed up on her feelings and goes on the attacc when being able to open up to people; the latter already well acquainted with people and getting along with fellow friends at the norm. A simple dose of wishful thinking and a safe haven that the two always frequent to, starts their uncanny ""relationship"" of being simple hang-out friends. Progressing at an atypical slow burn of...questioning their own individual morals and values that could jeopardise their ""status"" if altercations were to happen, this is the light-hearted ""friends or lovers"" Yuri relationship story of Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura.As a straight male, and having watched some Yuri high-school setting of slice-of-life shows in the past (of which Yagate Kimi ni Naru (a.k.a Bloom Into You) is one of the recent and finest examples) to having a clear expectation and perception of the genre, I still don\'t know what to think of this one...until this weird turquoise-haired self-proclaimed alien girl Yashiro Chikama appeared in the show, and donning an astronaut suit of her first impressions. That was when I realized that there was something interestingly magical about this, and yeap: it\'s Hitoma Iruma, the same mangaka/novelist that created Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko back in 2009 (anyone remember the futon-wrapped ""alien"" Erio Touwa?). As usual, Hitoma Iruma\'s ""masterful"" work of the sci-fi genre always leaves me hanging on what to make up for the ""convenient"" alien sub-plot (that always seems like his go-to to create some easy-going atmosphere that doesn\'t contribute a lot to the main plot, but whatever), and it\'s mostly the same here, so TL;DR: Yashiro\'s mostly an eccentric extra for adding into the mystical aspect.On a sidenote, if you\'re referring to the manga adaptation of the LN, there\'s actually 2 different versions of different illustrators: Mani and Moke Yuzuhara. The former, a largely condensed version (with an open ending) and the latter, what the adaptation mostly follows (because that route is the best in terms of fleshed-out content and character development). Be aware that the anime constantly fluctuates the sequence of contents between both manga (sometimes both manga will have the same event, just represented differently from time to time) to capture the feel of the series in its entirety. That\'s something rare to see though, and props for the follow-up.With the clarification of the source materials outta the way, you might be wondering what\'s up with the main cast of (count not 1, but 2) Yuri relationships. Yes, Adachi and Shimamura are the main Yuri couple, but I just feel that I\'ve gotta give a shout-out to their classmates Taeko Nagafuji and Akira Hino (whom are also another Yuri couple and friends since kindergarten times), just sliding in for additional character effects of being casual and helping the main couple be relaxed in the school setting (and the provocative teasing goes on privately behind closed doors).Referring back to both Adachi and Shimamura though (as with Bloom Into You), going deep into the character ""mantra"" lore of the POV perception just makes the both of them feel humanly connected, and not for the sake of just being cardboard cut-outs (unlike the horrible drama-esque Citrus, that one is just too sour and salty). Going through school life and hanging out together to the realization of feelings for one another, both Adachi and Shimamura have to make big strides in keeping their ""romantic"" relationship intact (well, mostly Adachi anyways).In life, it\'s just like the sensitivity of friends in general, and walking into the next big step of a transitional relationship can be tough. Watching both characters dig deep into their POV world, and imaginations of how various situational circumstances could have played out (par for the course) of making headways, along with the ""one step closer"" rhetoric to fulfilling their own defining desires of ""friendship"". Of course, not everything is ""a bed of roses"", and the insecurities of both Adachi and Shimamura start to pop up: the former\'s sustained mood swings of her loner status, and puppy-like doggone loyalty to the latter from ""friends to lovers"", and the latter\'s other life circumstances (from her family, to a past ""burden"" (a.k.a elementary school friend Tarumi, and with nicknames to match (Shima & Taru) before being very distant growing up and heading to different schools)).The TL;DR is this: every moment of the main duo\'s life of reason feels very human, very real and relatable amongst all the interactions. A relatively simple premise, yet doesn\'t all that contrived, and an overall better execution of magnificently well-written and realistic characters.Having produced the 1st season of Go-toubun no Hanayome (a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets), the legendary ""Godfather of Manga"" Osamu Tezuka\'s self-creation of his production studio may have fallen from grace as one of the prolific anime studios of the late 20th Century, but it\'s not all that bad. Having said that, the production of said series (even the co-production of Dororo with MAPPA) truly was an eye-opener to see a resurgence of the studio under a new generation of staff that could compete with the likes of Shaft in both the animation department and depiction of Yuri shows, and this show is no different. With rich, detailed backgrounds and soft-coloured palettes of art that oozes the contrast between both (imaginary) expectations and reality, add in the extraordinary transitional effects of life and dreams abound, and this has got to be one of Tezuka Productions\' finest attractive and alluring work of recent times.Also, some pretty good sound and music across the board, and I swear that the well-talented VA Akari Kitou (after Kimetsu no Yaiba\'s Nezuko) is REALLY laying down her suss and on a trail-blazing roll for 2020 alone: Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun\'s Nene, Kyokou Suiri\'s Kotoko, Love Live! Nijigasaki\'s Kanata, Tonikaku Kawaii\'s Tsukasa, and now this show with Adachi, ALL of which are MC roles (and that\'s one impressive heck in established popularity). Of course, not forgetting Miku Itou (Shimamura), Reina Ueda (Nagafuji) and Manami Numakura (Hino) on their respective roles. A spectacular job from veteran Seiyuus, no surprises. The OST is also well-refined to the likes of cheery, jovial tunes, it\'s as if it was made for this show. and once again, both Akari Kitou and Miku Itou\'s collaborated OP pairing really did wonders (the former doing BOTH OP and ED, as if to punch our hearts with the perfect-feeling gut-wrenching emotions even further).More than just another recommended show, it\'s another great show to add into the line-up of the illusively Yuri genre of ""non-cringefest"" and ""pure as white snow"" feels.

Eating, Chatting or just fooling around with a person we like makes us happy. Our story here is about Adachi and Shimamura, two high school girls who found each other in an unusual way to build a deep friendship… or is there even more behind it?Imagine you don\'t feel like attending classes and just want to crawl into your regular place upstairs in the gym where nobody can disturb...you. But one day you meet another girl there who has the same thoughts as you. This was the way our two main protagonists met each other and began to spend a lot of time together. From the atmosphere you can feel the harmony between them was perfect, they instantly took a liking for each other.What is a ""friend"" for you?Before meeting Shimamura, Adachi never had someone whom she can call a friend. She had an extremely introverted personality and was cold towards other people. She didn’t even attempt to make friends with other girls in the past. Shimamura changed her life in that point. Through her, Adachi found a true friend and Adachi would like to spend all the wonderful time with her alone. That’s the reason why she is also a generally, very jealous person towards Shimamura when she is together with her friends and as a consequence usually ends up running away. Beginning with a friendship, she gradually realizes that she definitely wants more than “normal friends”. She wants to be with Shimamura forever.Shimamura on the other has always been quite popular and gets along with other girls. She is polite and open for everything. Although she spends a lot of time with other people, Shimamura finds human relationship as bothersome since she feels that it requires too much effort to maintain such balance. She is a bit slow when it comes to feelings and love, but she also feels the emptiness when Adachi is not around.Besides our two main characters, the supporting characters Yashiro, Taru, Taeko and Akira also appear in the series. They don\'t play a major role, but Shimamura gets along with them as well. They are good friends.What really catches your eye are all the beautiful scenes where the light contrast is unusual. There is often also a slow-motion effect applied as well which makes everything even more beautiful. The art style in general goes perfectly with a story about friendship and love. The beautiful moments they spend together are emphasized in color, but also the sad and lonely ones can also be recognized by the slightly darker backgrounds. Regardless of whether it is raining, sunny or just a touching scene, the visual effects are used perfectly. It is always stunning and beautiful.There are 7.8 billion people on earth, how can you meet THE person of your life under such circumstances? Still, Sakura and Hougetsu managed to meet each other. With the OP ""Kimi ni Aeta Hi"" both show this must have been fate. Only through the other person their world become brighter and colorful. In addition to the lyrics and the beautiful music, the visual representation also shows that they will never let the other person vanish away.The ED song, performed by Adachi only, underlines again how important Shima is being as a part of her life. Adachi would give everything for her, she will always be there for her. The music is very nice to listen to here as well.In addition to the songs, some short but beautiful melodies that are played during certain scenes are also perfectly fitting.As a big Yuri fan, I was really looking forward to this anime and was not disappointed. Besides the wholesome and cute story, it\'s just enjoyable to follow our characters. What really surprised me in a very positive way are the visual effects, which make everything even more color- and beautiful.Everyone who is a fan of slice of life in combination with Shoujo Ai will surely love this anime.

Enjoy a pure and beautiful friendship!I am sure we will see more of “Adachi to Shimamura” in the future!', ""Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Adachi to Shimamura and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers present within character analysis. You have been warned.Based on a popular light novel of the same name Adachi to Shimamura otherwise better known by its Synonym Adashima is a slice of life, romance, school, and Yuri genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a quiet and socially awkward girl who has few friends and was a virtual outcast within her assigned...class, were to one day after ditching class and in the midst of heading to her one refuge within the school where she can be herself in the form of the rarely trodden second floor of the school’s gym was to encounter for the first time in a long time in the form of another person that shared her desire for a place that can serve as a refuge. Despite the two being on virtual ends of the school spectrum the two slowly but gradually begin to hit it off forming a strong bond between them that serves to not only open up the near closed-off hearts that both possess by showing them the power that friendship and acceptance can bring but also in the process begin the journey that both must embark upon if they want to step back into society not just as friends and cats licking each other’s wounds but maybe something that transcends that of friendship if both can play their cards right.Traditionally the school-based setting when used in conjunction with the modern-day setting that we see here in Adachi to Shimamura is one that has seen great success in replicating both the slice of life and romance scenarios due to a combination of both the unique society that schools present to its occupants as well as the innate social pressure that comes from being a person living in the 21st century a timeline that has stress, aspirations, and responsibilities by the bucket load. With such a heavy burden on their shoulders combined with the unique tension that can come from the unique societies that exist within schools the danger of being labelled as an outcast and ostracized by your classmates as well as being forced to try hard to maintain existing ones to forget past pains are constant issues that many high school students have to live with. While the premise and the setting of this series is one that’s common to a degree I felt that its core theme of healing one's heart by meeting and making genuine bonds with others and relearn what its actually like to have friends that aren’t fake and whose feelings and care for you are genuine was one that was paired relatively well with the romance aspect of the series that served to create a tale that was both compelling but also heartwarming to see an aspect that I felt was one that served to brighten our days in the wake of the crisis that’s sweeping through our world IRL. The first episode of the series I felt was an excellent one that while showing well the kind of world that Adachi and Shimamura view the world around them as also did well to showcase the kind of unique relationships that both the main leads have established between them while foretelling the kind of struggles that both will have as their journey to recovery begins a tale that I felt quite compelled to follow on as I was curious as to whether will they succeed in their endeavour and a decision that I felt was really justified.Sakura AdachiSakura Adachi portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Akari Kitou of Youkoso and Grancrest Senki fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two protagonists. A high school freshman Adachi from her initial appearances was seen to be a quiet, calm and confident person by nature that while intelligent and composed and someone that will have no trouble making friends was instead someone that seemingly preferred to stay away from the established groups within her class preferring instead to keep her heart firmly closed and finding refuge outside of the class. For a time this sense of finding refuge in places within the school that did not have much footfall by the rest of the school's occupants served Adachi well allowing her to find a sense of peace within the school where she can still remain herself and not needing to force herself to change her attitude to reflect that of her friends and classmates something that was all too common within schools.While itself an admirable attempt to retain one's independence of will high school life like the society that it serves is not one where one can exist in without making friends a fact that soon earned her a certain amount of notoriety within the class and saw her being labelled as a troublemaker by both her peers and the school. That is until one day when within her refuge she was to encounter another person who while was the total opposite to her in both class hierarchy and temperament was not only sharing her desire to find a place of refuge from which to shelter from the stresses that come from modern society but also surprisingly was able to get on well with Adachi and from there kindle the spark that will serve to allow Adachi to take the first steps in re-entering society by forming her first real friendship since entering high school. Though the first steps of their friendship was a shaky one due to her nervousness as well as her social awkwardness around others that she knew nothing about which was in turn supported by her reluctance to open her heart to others easily thanks to Shimamura’s kindness, patience and her desire to listen the relationship between the two rapidly progressed and soon formed into the solid foundation that served to define the core relationship that was between them.As the series progresses and we get to see more of Adachi’s personality get expanded upon it can be seen that unknown to everyone but herself that Adachi as a result of her nature and unwillingness to mix with her classmates had a fair share of issues that she was suffering from.  As a result of her reluctance to get involved with others Adachi while having no trouble in maintaining her academic performance within the class was seen to view it not with a sense of elation but rather saw each of her days in school as being one that was filled with boredom and each day being a trial that proved ever harder to surmount. While the meeting with Shimamura and later with her friends Hino and Nagafuji served to spice things up for her and make her days in school much more bearable this was only when Shimamura was present within the class. However, after meeting not only Shimamura and later Hino and Nagafuji Adachi for the first time in her life as a high school girl was to experience an aspect of life that while being a fundamental aspect of a high school girls repository was something that was until then something completely alien to her which was a sense of genuine friendship and bonds that are formed between true friends who care nothing for false modesty and instead value honesty and sincerity in their relationships. For Adachi long resigned to the fact that she will not have any close friends within the school this meeting served well to open the closed-off heart that until now had been firmly closed by her own will in a quest to protect herself and introduce her to the unique interactions and heartfelt emotions and feelings that can only come from meeting with and bonding with likeminded friends that you can rely upon for both advice and that unique warmth that only close friends can bring to one another. While hesitant and fearful of taking the first steps into re-joining the very society that had burned her in the past thanks to the interactions that Adachi had experienced with Shimamura and wanting to both repay her as well as be strong enough to be able to enjoy more time with her Adachi resolves to take the one step that she never thought she be able to take which was to enter into the stressful and cruel society that she for so long had avoided by taking part in more social activities with Shimamura and her friends and in the process relearning what it meant to be a high school girl in the modern world namely outings with friends that pass the time in the blink of an eye, visits to restaurants and cafes that served to present the cutest but also the funniest moments between friends and lastly attending special events that served to be both magical and yet also potent opportunities that allow the bonds between friends to grow ever stronger as you enjoy the magical moments together while learning something deep about them from their heart.Overall the character of Adachi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a quiet, reclusive girl that had few if any friends to someone that was not only more assertive but also one that was brave enough to re-join the society that had inflicted such profound damage to her heart in a desire to get close to the one girl that had not abandoned her and instead bonded with her as a comrade and friend being especially heartfelt. While Adachi’s role within the relationship that she establishes with Shimamura was not as large as Shimamura’s in terms of impact I felt that the quiet sense of determination and bravery that she injects into her role within it served well to balance out the bond that exists between the two girls.Hougetsu ShimamuraHougetsu Shimamura portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Miku Itou of 5 – Toubun no Hanayome and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two main leads. A high school freshman and a fellow classmate of Adachi Hougetsu who we better know as Shimamura was from her initial appearances seen to be a quiet, calm, and perceptive person by nature that as a result of possessing both beauty and intelligence in equal measure was someone that was well-liked within the class and was noted to have many friends within her peers with Hino and Nagafuji being counted as among her closest. However unlike the great majority of her classmates who got by with false modesty and kindness geared towards joining one of the classes many circles of friends Shimamura was shown to have none of that being someone that was kind and caring and honest and direct with both words and feelings towards others aspects that while serving to push fakers away served to allow her to forge strong bonds with those that respect her for it in the form of Hino and Nagafuji. While a quiet girl for the most part Shimamura was shown to be someone that was relatively carefree in nature and was someone that was shown to have quite the sense of humour a fact that is seen well in her teasing of Adachi when they are together a fact that while cute to look at was also an aspect that I felt contrasts nicely with Adachi’s quiet and sullen self.However, as the series progresses and we get to see more of Shimamura’s personality it can be seen that Shimamura like her dear friend Adachi was also someone that had her fair share of struggles that transpired in the past that had wounded her heart greatly. While on the surface Shimamura was someone that was positive, friendly, energetic and enjoyed the company of numerous friends within her peer group beneath this it can be seen that she like Adachi was someone that had great trouble in opening her heart to others and was someone that preferred to stay away from others as much as she possibly can. However, despite this, she was shown to treasure the strong links that she has forged with those that she trusts and despite her desire to stay away from people tried hard to maintain this small redoubt within society that she uses as both a refuge and as a source of advice and amusement for her in her everyday life. While Shimamura’s core arc and struggle within the series is similar to Adachi in that it focused on her reopening her heart to others and learn to experience the sense of joy that can be found in relationships between friends that genuinely understand you I feel that this was also used well with the sense of loneliness and sense of regret that Shimamura secretly battled with within her heart. Though Shimamura was someone that was well accustomed to hiding her true feelings from others the sense of loneliness that she felt in her heart as a result of this was something that she can never use too, as try as she might in not becoming a burden to others this only served to ensure that her days before Adachi was not only long but also days that were filled with grey and boredom that almost made her days impossible to get through.However, these endless days of boredom soon vanished when Shimamura in her quest to find a place of refuge where she can pass her days without interruption was to encounter a classmate who despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum within the class hierarchy was also surprisingly someone that shared the same kind of pain that came from being an outcast that had few if any friends within the class and lacked anyone that they can trust to show their true selves too. It is after this meeting between Shimamura and this mysterious girl that calls herself Adachi that the life of Shimamura was to change profoundly for she for the first time in her life was to not only encounter someone that she was able to show her true face too but also serve as an excellent vehicle that will allow her to improve herself as a person a goal that while a hard one that has a high chance of failure was one that she was willing to try not only because she wanted to improve herself and be able to enjoy this world of colors with her own eyes and honest feelings but also because she wanted to also help bring into the world the one person that she was closest too and one that she can always rely upon to tell her the truth. While on the surface Shimamura’s relationship with Adachi and her desire to bring Adachi into the real world that is society can be seen to be one that’s almost self-satisfying in nature from an external perspective I feel that on the contrary, Shimamura’s actions and desires to improve herself by interacting with and bringing Adachi into the real world was a genuine attempt to help someone that had like her had been affected by the unique nature that modern-day society had served to create. While the teasing aspect of their relationship was one that served well to highlight the increasing closeness that their bonds have served to create between them it is within the events within the series such as Shimamura’s confrontation with Adachi’s mother as well as the Christmas date and the valentines events that serve to really show just how determined Shimamura was in not only helping herself break out of her frozen heart but also in the process reintroduce the feelings of trust and love that until meeting Adachi had never quite existed when interacting with her friends within the school.Overall the character of Shimamura I felt was an interesting one that while matching Adachi’s inner struggles relatively well with her own also served to balance out the relationship between the two by making use of her more expressive and emotional nature that really served to draw out both the sweetness and the cuteness that came from two cats licking each other’s wounds as both sought to use each other to improve themselves and break free of the chains that had until now held them back from the fun, joy, and colour that existed within the real world.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were both well designed and developed that made great use of both simple animation techniques and soft colors that served to enhance the series already excellent animation by adding a sense of clearness to it and allowing it to display natural phenomenon that much more effectively. While the designs of the characters school uniforms that within the series served as their main hub that allowed both to meet each other without fail were relatively simple ones I felt that this sense of simplicity worked well in combination with the sense of relatability that we as the viewers were able to easily relate too as no matter which country we are from we all attended school at some point and have experienced the sense of pressure that our two heroines were seen to struggle with. Location variety wise though the series only featured a handful of locations that the cast served to visit I felt that each of these locations while simple in design were also ones that were paired well with the events and significant moments within the relationship that is established between Adachi and Shimamura with notable examples being the school gyms second floor that served as the twos sacred refuge and the place where they first met and forged their bond, the family homes of both Adachi and Shimamura that served to allow both to not only see what their own home environment was like but also in Shimamura’s case allow her to determine the true cause of Adachi’s nature that stemmed from the inattention of her mother to her daughter’s needs.Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Kimi Ni Aeta Hi which was performed by veteran seiyuu singers Akari Kitou and Miku Ito in the guise of their assigned characters in this series and Kimi no Tonari de which was performed by Akari Kitou. While both of these songs were excellent ones I felt that the kind of feelings and emotions that they invoked when used in combination with their accompanying visuals were very different with the former giving off a sense of a destined meeting between two girls who despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum within the class hierarchy had numerous things that they can easily relate too and their desire to use this meeting to break out of their respective shells no matter how hard the journey will be. On the other hand, the feelings that the ending theme served to invoke was one that while calm also served to showcase just how much the fruits of their labours together had served to introduce and enhance the bonds that the two have formed with the people around them in the form of Yashiro, Hino, Nagafuji and Shimamura’s little sister. While often neglected when compared against the series gorgeous animation I felt that the series OST was a calm and relaxing one that served to enhance the series scenes as the girls go by their life day by day.Voice acting-wise I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Akari Kitou and Miku Itou really served to pull off a most excellent performance portraying their respective characters of Adachi and Shimamura by infusing their characters with not only their innate skill as seiyuu’s but also a sense of chemistry within them that was both heartfelt and easily relatable to anyone that saw it. In terms of the supporting cast, while I didn’t cover their characters within the series, I felt that Iori Saeki, Manami Numakura, and Reina Ueda all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Yashiro, Akira Hino, and Taeko Nagafuji respectively.In overall Adachi to Shimamura, I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points a unique premise, excellent story, characters, animation, voice acting, and a unique take on the idea that romance between two damaged girls who had both been affected by the unique pressure that modern-day society forces on you can serve to not only heal them but also serve to allow them to rediscover the path that will allow them to once more re-enter society and start their life anew.In the modern-day the life that we as inhabitants of this age live in can be ones that are incredibly stressful no matter what role we have in it. Whether we’re high school students or professionals that work in the adult world society is something that places plenty of pressure on our shoulders and while the majority of us can bear them effectively many might not be able to handle them and in the process suffer grave mental damage from them that will serve to dramatically alter their life as a result. In my eyes, while Adachi to Shimamura’s core story was one that was well-trodden within the anime world I felt that when used in combination with the feelings and emotions that the main and support cast experience as well as the impact that this has on their bonds that I feel that the story become something that was truly magical as when used in this capacity it served to both highlight and enhance the many sweet and cute moments that transpire between Adachi and Shimamura as well as their friends Hino and Nagafuji that was not only heartwarming but also serve as potent reminders to both them and us that even in this hard and high pressured world that can feel oppressive and scary there are still plenty of people who are like you that you can confide in and bond with and move forward together a fact that in this new deeply pained world that we live in is a lesson that is worth remembering.In times of a final overall score, I would say that Adachi to Shimamura easily deserves a final score of 9/10. While 2020 may have been a rather bleak year due to the pandemic I feel that this series in partnership with the equally excellent Tonikawa Over the moon for you served well to remind us of the kind of power that heartfelt feelings and bonds can have in helping us get through the harsh realities of life a lesson that we all should take heart from. class, were to one day after ditching class and in the midst of heading to her one refuge within the school where she can be herself in the form of the rarely trodden second floor of the school’s gym was to encounter for the first time in a long time in the form of another person that shared her desire for a place that can serve as a refuge. Despite the two being on virtual ends of the school spectrum the two slowly but gradually begin to hit it off forming a strong bond between them that serves to not only open up the near closed-off hearts that both possess by showing them the power that friendship and acceptance can bring but also in the process begin the journey that both must embark upon if they want to step back into society not just as friends and cats licking each other’s wounds but maybe something that transcends that of friendship if both can play their cards right.Traditionally the school-based setting when used in conjunction with the modern-day setting that we see here in Adachi to Shimamura is one that has seen great success in replicating both the slice of life and romance scenarios due to a combination of both the unique society that schools present to its occupants as well as the innate social pressure that comes from being a person living in the 21st century a timeline that has stress, aspirations, and responsibilities by the bucket load. With such a heavy burden on their shoulders combined with the unique tension that can come from the unique societies that exist within schools the danger of being labelled as an outcast and ostracized by your classmates as well as being forced to try hard to maintain existing ones to forget past pains are constant issues that many high school students have to live with. While the premise and the setting of this series is one that’s common to a degree I felt that its core theme of healing one's heart by meeting and making genuine bonds with others and relearn what its actually like to have friends that aren’t fake and whose feelings and care for you are genuine was one that was paired relatively well with the romance aspect of the series that served to create a tale that was both compelling but also heartwarming to see an aspect that I felt was one that served to brighten our days in the wake of the crisis that’s sweeping through our world IRL. The first episode of the series I felt was an excellent one that while showing well the kind of world that Adachi and Shimamura view the world around them as also did well to showcase the kind of unique relationships that both the main leads have established between them while foretelling the kind of struggles that both will have as their journey to recovery begins a tale that I felt quite compelled to follow on as I was curious as to whether will they succeed in their endeavour and a decision that I felt was really justified.Sakura AdachiSakura Adachi portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Akari Kitou of Youkoso and Grancrest Senki fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two protagonists. A high school freshman Adachi from her initial appearances was seen to be a quiet, calm and confident person by nature that while intelligent and composed and someone that will have no trouble making friends was instead someone that seemingly preferred to stay away from the established groups within her class preferring instead to keep her heart firmly closed and finding refuge outside of the class. For a time this sense of finding refuge in places within the school that did not have much footfall by the rest of the school's occupants served Adachi well allowing her to find a sense of peace within the school where she can still remain herself and not needing to force herself to change her attitude to reflect that of her friends and classmates something that was all too common within schools.While itself an admirable attempt to retain one's independence of will high school life like the society that it serves is not one where one can exist in without making friends a fact that soon earned her a certain amount of notoriety within the class and saw her being labelled as a troublemaker by both her peers and the school. That is until one day when within her refuge she was to encounter another person who while was the total opposite to her in both class hierarchy and temperament was not only sharing her desire to find a place of refuge from which to shelter from the stresses that come from modern society but also surprisingly was able to get on well with Adachi and from there kindle the spark that will serve to allow Adachi to take the first steps in re-entering society by forming her first real friendship since entering high school. Though the first steps of their friendship was a shaky one due to her nervousness as well as her social awkwardness around others that she knew nothing about which was in turn supported by her reluctance to open her heart to others easily thanks to Shimamura’s kindness, patience and her desire to listen the relationship between the two rapidly progressed and soon formed into the solid foundation that served to define the core relationship that was between them.As the series progresses and we get to see more of Adachi’s personality get expanded upon it can be seen that unknown to everyone but herself that Adachi as a result of her nature and unwillingness to mix with her classmates had a fair share of issues that she was suffering from.  As a result of her reluctance to get involved with others Adachi while having no trouble in maintaining her academic performance within the class was seen to view it not with a sense of elation but rather saw each of her days in school as being one that was filled with boredom and each day being a trial that proved ever harder to surmount. While the meeting with Shimamura and later with her friends Hino and Nagafuji served to spice things up for her and make her days in school much more bearable this was only when Shimamura was present within the class. However, after meeting not only Shimamura and later Hino and Nagafuji Adachi for the first time in her life as a high school girl was to experience an aspect of life that while being a fundamental aspect of a high school girls repository was something that was until then something completely alien to her which was a sense of genuine friendship and bonds that are formed between true friends who care nothing for false modesty and instead value honesty and sincerity in their relationships. For Adachi long resigned to the fact that she will not have any close friends within the school this meeting served well to open the closed-off heart that until now had been firmly closed by her own will in a quest to protect herself and introduce her to the unique interactions and heartfelt emotions and feelings that can only come from meeting with and bonding with likeminded friends that you can rely upon for both advice and that unique warmth that only close friends can bring to one another. While hesitant and fearful of taking the first steps into re-joining the very society that had burned her in the past thanks to the interactions that Adachi had experienced with Shimamura and wanting to both repay her as well as be strong enough to be able to enjoy more time with her Adachi resolves to take the one step that she never thought she be able to take which was to enter into the stressful and cruel society that she for so long had avoided by taking part in more social activities with Shimamura and her friends and in the process relearning what it meant to be a high school girl in the modern world namely outings with friends that pass the time in the blink of an eye, visits to restaurants and cafes that served to present the cutest but also the funniest moments between friends and lastly attending special events that served to be both magical and yet also potent opportunities that allow the bonds between friends to grow ever stronger as you enjoy the magical moments together while learning something deep about them from their heart.Overall the character of Adachi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a quiet, reclusive girl that had few if any friends to someone that was not only more assertive but also one that was brave enough to re-join the society that had inflicted such profound damage to her heart in a desire to get close to the one girl that had not abandoned her and instead bonded with her as a comrade and friend being especially heartfelt. While Adachi’s role within the relationship that she establishes with Shimamura was not as large as Shimamura’s in terms of impact I felt that the quiet sense of determination and bravery that she injects into her role within it served well to balance out the bond that exists between the two girls.Hougetsu ShimamuraHougetsu Shimamura portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Miku Itou of 5 – Toubun no Hanayome and Ryuuou no Oshigoto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the series two main leads. A high school freshman and a fellow classmate of Adachi Hougetsu who we better know as Shimamura was from her initial appearances seen to be a quiet, calm, and perceptive person by nature that as a result of possessing both beauty and intelligence in equal measure was someone that was well-liked within the class and was noted to have many friends within her peers with Hino and Nagafuji being counted as among her closest. However unlike the great majority of her classmates who got by with false modesty and kindness geared towards joining one of the classes many circles of friends Shimamura was shown to have none of that being someone that was kind and caring and honest and direct with both words and feelings towards others aspects that while serving to push fakers away served to allow her to forge strong bonds with those that respect her for it in the form of Hino and Nagafuji. While a quiet girl for the most part Shimamura was shown to be someone that was relatively carefree in nature and was someone that was shown to have quite the sense of humour a fact that is seen well in her teasing of Adachi when they are together a fact that while cute to look at was also an aspect that I felt contrasts nicely with Adachi’s quiet and sullen self.However, as the series progresses and we get to see more of Shimamura’s personality it can be seen that Shimamura like her dear friend Adachi was also someone that had her fair share of struggles that transpired in the past that had wounded her heart greatly. While on the surface Shimamura was someone that was positive, friendly, energetic and enjoyed the company of numerous friends within her peer group beneath this it can be seen that she like Adachi was someone that had great trouble in opening her heart to others and was someone that preferred to stay away from others as much as she possibly can. However, despite this, she was shown to treasure the strong links that she has forged with those that she trusts and despite her desire to stay away from people tried hard to maintain this small redoubt within society that she uses as both a refuge and as a source of advice and amusement for her in her everyday life. While Shimamura’s core arc and struggle within the series is similar to Adachi in that it focused on her reopening her heart to others and learn to experience the sense of joy that can be found in relationships between friends that genuinely understand you I feel that this was also used well with the sense of loneliness and sense of regret that Shimamura secretly battled with within her heart. Though Shimamura was someone that was well accustomed to hiding her true feelings from others the sense of loneliness that she felt in her heart as a result of this was something that she can never use too, as try as she might in not becoming a burden to others this only served to ensure that her days before Adachi was not only long but also days that were filled with grey and boredom that almost made her days impossible to get through.However, these endless days of boredom soon vanished when Shimamura in her quest to find a place of refuge where she can pass her days without interruption was to encounter a classmate who despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum within the class hierarchy was also surprisingly someone that shared the same kind of pain that came from being an outcast that had few if any friends within the class and lacked anyone that they can trust to show their true selves too.

While on the surface Shimamura’s relationship with Adachi and her desire to bring Adachi into the real world that is society can be seen to be one that’s almost self-satisfying in nature from an external perspective I feel that on the contrary, Shimamura’s actions and desires to improve herself by interacting with and bringing Adachi into the real world was a genuine attempt to help someone that had like her had been affected by the unique nature that modern-day society had served to create.

The little details on how they act and what they say all completely represent a high school gay relationship.

I would love to specifically point out these moments but they probably count as spoilers, so message me and we can talk about it. that no one else would now of.

However, Adachi begins to see Shimamura with different eyes and, little by little, the friendship between the two begins to become something much more complicated to deal with.It is very noticeable how Adachi to Shimamura tries to express himself with a more sensory approach in a very intimate way. The entire good level of anime production (of course, together with Artistic System thought by the director) is committed to causing sensations that have relations with the elements of the plot, but which, unfortunately, does not progress as...expected.The first episode at least shows this very well, it has many organic elements that guide our look while we get to know a little of the story and the characters. Whether they like it or not, the characters act in ways that leave clues as to how they feel about this relationship, but that never open up to each other, it is a somewhat mysterious relationship. And the anime tries to explore a sensory side of it.The anime also makes quite a lot of very expressive details. Sometimes small gestures or experimentation. There is a commitment to show us small details and actions that cause an effect, that have an impact through the visual in an intimate way as these characters face each other, talk, play etc.With the passing of the episodes, the anime follows this same approach until the end, which would not be a problem, put following the progress of the plot (which becomes more complex, desolate and subtle) the anime in theory should improve, but the what happens is just the opposite. The big problem that gets in the way of this whole system of the director, is an unnecessary verbiage. The characters speak very expositively as they are feeling in relation to these feelings, and this causes a creative conflict in the work. Let's see. While the aesthetic interest of the work is to pass on such sensations and feelings to us through a more organic and sensory approach, all of this loses its meaning and the work tells us how they feel. There is a scene that is so self explanatory that the character even explains the analogy in the middle of it. Almost all of the more experimental value is thrown away, and the anime is almost just that.There is another scene of even more significant value that also loses much of its meaning due to this verbiage. We know that for Sakura Adachi's character, walking hand in hand has a very strong value (or at least it should have). Later in the anime, when Hougetsu's childhood friend Shimamura takes her hand, there is a very evident detail in this action. This act of walking hand in hand should have a very strong value, but it is also wasted.Another choice that didn’t make any sense, and that perhaps was purely formalistic, are the transitions between 16: 9 for Cinemascope. Cinemascope is such a proportion of the screen more vertically closed. I might even think that this is a representation of the characters being submissive in some way, but the anime only uses it at random.In short, Adachi to Shimamura is a work that tries to deal with a conflicting plot in a very expressive and innovative way, but that prevents the viewer from feeling such emotions due to differences in the way it is staged. expected.The first episode at least shows this very well, it has many organic elements that guide our look while we get to know a little of the story and the characters.

It's a very fine anime in the demonstration of the discovery of the feelings of love, without locking itself in clichés quite specific to anime of this genre. He reminds me a little of Tsuki ga Kirei in this realistic awkwardness of the protagonists.Shimamura is really interesting because she has kept a background of innocence and naivety despite her precocious maturity. It often creates a comical discrepancy with Adachi (like when she hands her a piece of...her cake without realizing that it results in a possible indirect kiss ; a classic anime situation but very enjoyable here). She's aware of having flaws and decides to let herself go, trying to enjoy his youth. She's a sophisticated person but prefers to hide this side of personality. A sociable girl at first sight, one quickly notices the mask she wears, which shows a lack of confidence in herself and in others. Her thoughts are addressed to us through monologues, often after her interactions with Adachi. The questions she asks herself are mostly about the relationships people have with each other. This is treated with accuracy, without falling into the trap of a character whose thoughts are too elaborate for her age.Adachi is kawai and I appreciate her a lot, but she's already a more classic character. She has the role that highlights her friend in my opinion, a more twisted character.Really, a nice surprise. I am a fan of anime romance and would highly recommend it to anyone. It's not heavy and we have side plots, including this funny astronaut, which allows us to drift a bit from the love story. I look forward to the following episodes.8/10. her cake without realizing that it results in a possible indirect kiss ; a classic anime situation but very enjoyable here).

Her thoughts are addressed to us through monologues, often after her interactions with Adachi. The questions she asks herself are mostly about the relationships people have with each other. This is treated with accuracy, without falling into the trap of a character whose thoughts are too elaborate for her age.Adachi is kawai and I appreciate her a lot, but she's already a more classic character. She has the role that highlights her friend in my opinion, a more twisted character.Really, a nice surprise. I am a fan of anime romance and would highly recommend it to anyone. It's not heavy and we have side plots, including this funny astronaut, which allows us to drift a bit from the love story. I look forward to the following episodes.8/10."", ""Sit back and watch this anime as your remember how f***in' weird you were as a teenager. This anime is basically just an awkward and quiet teenage girl having her first lesbian thoughts and going about it exactly how you'd expect a teenaged baby-gay to go about it along with another girl who is way too apathetic to care about anything.This makes me realize how absolutely f***in' creepy I was a young lesbian and I feel very uncomfortable.This is more of a coming of age than a romance. Do not act this weird and unhinged towards your crush. Everyone has those points in their...life, especially baby-gays that have nobody to teach them how to not be a creepy lesbian. It's still an enjoyable anime, but, we do not act like this, kids.This is unhealthy and making your life revolve around a crush that hasn't returned your feelings is only going to hurt you. Even then healthy relationships are not about being this clingy. You need to be okay on your own, too. That doesn't mean you can't want to be with almost all the time, it means you need to make sure you aren't erasing your own identity in the process.Adachi, it's okay to being true to yourself and love Shimamura at the same time.

Also, please set boundaries. Omf"", 'During the late afternoon, as classes ramble in the background, two girls sit together in the shade of their school\'s gymnasium. Boxed in by a fence, and the threat of being found, they take solace in each other\'s company, both being loners who feel distanced from those around them. Perhaps they read, or just talk, or play ping pong, or rest in each other\'s laps. In some ways, this place is a cage, but in other\'s it\'s more like a sanctuary, shared with someone truly special, someone who gets them. It\'s this feeling of distance yet warmth that begins Adachi and Shimamura.The first thing...to note about AdaShima is that it is SLOW. Like, as slow of a burn a slow burn romance can get. It\'s atmosphere is quiet and melancholy, and it\'s in anything but a hurry to make progress. It stars two characters who are each in a form of stagnation, and the pacing highlights that to a palpable degree. Adachi loves her time with Shimamura, and wants to make their relationship even more special. But she\'s awkward, insecure, anxious, and grapples with a bit of internalized homophobia. She is the one who has the ability to initiate progress, but she struggles to express her feelings, out of a fear of rejection, insecurity of being seen as a weirdo, and generally being terrified of not being a special person to Shimamura, nervous of going too far too fast. Meanwhile, Shimamura holds the most power in the relationship. She is ultimately the one who is capable of allowing for progress, but she is detached, emotionally distanced, and terrified of intimacy. This conflict is what drives Adachi and Shimamura. Two characters who both want to make progress, who want to be closer to each other, who each have to overcome stagnation in order to do so.But the way I\'ve described it, this almost makes it sound like a very generic romance story. A shy character trying to express their feelings to someone they feel is out of their league, or with who they don\'t want to distort an already existing relationship. And while this is a part of the narrative, I don\'t think it paints a fully accurate picture of the series. For one, while Adachi is the one who initiates progress, it is Shimamura who holds power in this relationship, by means of consent. Shimamura is extremely depressed and emotionally detached. She has an inability to form long-term relationships, and she justifies this to herself as a natural fact of how life works; that relationships will inherently break off. When people try to get close to her, she instinctively pushes them away. She\'s lonely and scared, and in her internal monologue undergoes a constant push and pull of wanting to get closer to Adachi but wanting to avoid intimacy. She has some, as she calls them, ""superficial relationships,"" but that\'s as far as she knows how to go. This is her stagnation, and it\'s also the key to her and Adachi getting into a relationship, no matter how much Adachi might attempt to make advances.To highlight the dichotomy between these character\'s very different mindsets, AdaShima constantly switches between their perspectives, having most episodes led by one of their internal monologues. And there is a sharp contrast in their perspectives. Adachi\'s perspective is generally light-hearted and awkward. She\'s a dorky character struggling with endearing and relatable fears of being rejected by the person she loves. She tries to plan out the right words, she imagines silly scenarios in her mind about potential interactions with Shimamura (ranging from sweet to sexual), and she obsesses over even the tiniest amount of progress, going as far as to keep pieces of garbage if they are tied to a special moment between them. In contrast, Shimamura\'s perspective is always melancholy. Her internal monologue highlights her internal conflict: her isolation, loneliness, and desperation. She comes at you with these genuinely deep, sad lines about the nature of relationships for her, and they hurt to say the least. She paints this picture of someone suffering under the weight of her own loneliness, who feels like they\'re drowning, or breaking apart, and are desperately fighting to overcome that no matter how much pain the solution may come with. Adachi\'s perspective is very romantic, and captures all the adorable dorky awkwardness, insecurity, and most importantly, wonder of being in love, while Shimamura\'s perspective is more poignant, and drives the series themes. Of these two perspectives, I generally find Shimamura\'s to be the most engaging. Adachi\'s is very fun and sweet, but Shimamura\'s digs at the core that serves as the series beating emotional heart. Almost all of most resonant moments come from Shimamura\'s internal monologue, and I find her journey to be the most powerful thing about the series. Shimamura has become a very special character for me, one who I painfully relate to, and who brings to light some of the most frustrating things I hate about myself in a way that is simply raw.I\'ve heard it said by people frustrated by the series that they wish Shimamura figured out Adachi\'s extremely obvious feelings at some point. But I believe that to think she doesn\'t figure it out is a gross misinterpretation of Shimamura\'s character. In fact, I would go as far as to say that she is acutely, consciously aware of Adachi\'s feelings at least as early as episode 5. Shimamura is perhaps a tad dense, but she\'s also very observant, and keenly aware of her relationships with those around her. She knows that most of her relationships are superficial, and it is Adachi who struggles to figure that out, only realizing that the smile she gets from Shimamura is the same as the one given to those around her relatively late into the series (a very sad realization that says a lot about both characters). But Shimamura shows that she knows something is up with Adachi pretty quickly. When Adachi invites her to hang out in episode 3, and Shimamura runs into Yashiro (who I will talk about later), Shimamura brings Yashiro with them to ease the tension and make the moment less intimate. When Adachi invites Shimamura out on Christmas in the most awkward way imaginable in episode 5, she grapples in her internal monologue with the idea that Adachi sees her as special. In this scene, she almost refuses the date because she can\'t handle the idea of being seen as the only person Adachi wants to be with, and when Adachi tries to make the scene less awkward, Shimamura twists her next lines to justify to herself that Adachi would want to go out with anyone, and that it doesn\'t matter that it\'s her. This is the nature of Shimamura\'s character. She clearly wants to be with Adachi, but she\'s too afraid to be seen as special and be let into others lives, and she constantly finds ways to justify their relationship and it\'s inability to progress, despite the fact that she is ultimately the one who refuses to allow that progress to occur. I find her extremely compelling for this reason.I\'ve been mostly talking about Shimamura, and that\'s simply because I find her to be the series strongest asset. Adachi is a wonderful character, she\'s immensely endearing and adorable, and her perspective drives quite a few of my favorite moments. In particular, their Christmas date in episode 6 is a standout episode that captures the wonderful joy of being in love better than most romances I\'ve seen, culminating one of the series most memorable moments. But ultimately, I don\'t have a whole lot to say about her. This isn\'t because she\'s not a compelling character, but Shimamura is just more complex. Adachi is wants to be seen as someone special to Shimamura, and is grapples with the fact that Shimamura is extremely distant and detached from basically everyone. Adachi is also starved for affection, likely due to her distant relationship with her mother, and like Shimamura she feels distant from everyone around her, though in her case it comes from feeling like an outcast. She is genuinely fantastic, I just have less to say about her much more straightforward arc.I think the thing that makes this series so slow is that there isn\'t a straight line for their progress. Each of them constantly progresses and regresses. Shimamura will finally let Adachi in just a little bit more, before slipping back into old habits almost instinctively. Adachi will finally find the guts to confess, but immediately take it back just a little bit to ease the awkward tension. This means they never make large strides together, but instead make small steps towards personal growth which ultimately contribute to the progression of their relationship. What keeps me invested is that the two just share astoundingly good chemistry. Their dialogue is understated, but believable and has a really addicting rhythm to it. I just adore the times where they simply talk, just the two of them sharing a mundane moment together. Combined with the series strong atmosphere and effective direction, it manages to be a moment-to-moment delight just as much as the more poignant moments hit.Compared to the main cast, the side cast is decidedly more of a mixed bag. I mentioned Yashiro before, who is a little alien girl taken as a cameo of sorts from another of this author\'s works. She gives the series a bit of magical realism, and at times is something of a mentor for Shimamura, incidentally providing goofy metaphors about drifting through life while fishing together. That being said, she drops out of that role pretty quickly and ends up relegated to being a side character who shares an admittedly pretty cute relationship of her own with Shimamura\'s younger sister. Shimamura\'s two friends Hino and Nagafuji don\'t make the strongest impression, with the first thing Hino does being to grab Nagafuji\'s boobs in public. Actually a lot of her dialogue early on has to do with grabbing boobs now that I think about it. Thankfully she calms down quite a bit after that, and her and Nagafuji get their own little side arc which I also found to be pretty cute. They still play a small part in the main story as Shimamura\'s ""superficial"" friends, and I do find their (post episode 1) personalities to be endearing enough, but I wouldn\'t say I particularly love them, and I\'m happy they play a relatively minor role in this story.The most noteworthy side character is Tarumi, who is Shimamura\'s old friend from elementary school. As Shimamura is grappling with her feelings for Adachi, Tarumi comes storming back into her life during the latter half of the series, and they start to rekindle their old friendship. At first I thought she would be more of a romantic rival, but really her presence serves to make Shimamura realize just how much she loves Adachi, as their relationship fails to resemble what they had as childhood friends. ""Reality ages far less gracefully than memories"" she thinks to herself after hanging out with her. She has her own personality and character arc as well, and is a very solid addition to the series cast. Easily the series strongest side character.Visually, Adachi and Shimamura is a mixed bag. It\'s biggest visual strength lies in its cinematography and storyboards. It\'s not rewriting the wheel, but it\'s conventionally very well shot, and utilizes the medium of animation effectively. Weather it be caging the girls in their sanctuary of the gym, which contrasts the time when they outgrow that and finally rejoin their class, or highlighting their isolation and loneliness with effective color changes and framing, it nails every emotion it seeks to highlight. When Adachi revels in a small moment of intimacy, the colors change to something totally joyful and the camerawork becomes equally intimate, allowing me to sink into the mood and enjoy Adachi\'s small step just as much as she does. But when Shimamura falls to the bottom of a pool and monologues about how detached she is, the visuals genuinely make it feel like she\'s drowning. It\'s Shimamura\'s monologues that bring out some of it\'s most striking visual moments. I particularly appreciate how it uses it\'s lighting. It has some very particular lighting quirks, with a saturated yet faded style to it\'s color palette, and background lights highlight some super memorable moments, such as the wonderfully romantic end of the couple\'s Christmas date. The series biggest visual failing comes in its animation, which is often stiff and moves only just enough to not be a slide show. The character designs occasionally struggle to stay on model even in the most mundane visual moments, and it sometimes feels like the character designs are too detailed for the production to keep up with. The series also has some really awkward and jarring male gaze shots of the girls thighs, highlighted by the exceptionally short skirts of their school uniform. It\'s not exactly a huge issue and it\'s not too common, but that only makes it even more distracting when it does come up, and there are times where the shots are just so intentional about including fanservice that it feels completely at odds with the series grounded approach, occasionally taking from the atmosphere. Thankfully it only happens occasionally.The series soundtrack is really wonderful. Like the series itself, it\'s grounded and down to earth. It\'s littered with light piano tracks and percussive tracks, and utilizes strings bring out the best of it\'s melodies. The whole OST screams ""melancholy adolescent coming-of-age,"" which makes it a perfect fit for this series of adolescent anxiety, angst, and warm romance. Tracks that play during it\'s more intimate and romantic encounters tend to highlight the strings more than anything, and make those moments feel just that much more romantic. It\'s probably my favorite 2020 anime OST, always highlighting the mood and with quite a few tracks that stick out in my mind. It\'s a delight to listen to (hell I\'m listening to it right now), just as the show itself is to watch. The show is also blessed with really fantastic vocal performances from Akari Kitou and Miku Itou as Adachi and Shimamura respectively. They both nail their characters so perfectly, giving more grounded performances than most shows, dialing back all the cutesy anime talk for something more real. They\'re exceptionally emotive yet also subtle. They\'re standout performances in my opinion. Saeki Iori\'s performance as Yashiro also deserves some mention, perfectly capturing her eccentric, excitable personality.Relationships are a complicated beast to get into. Few things take as much effort to build, as much work to maintain, and as much pain to navigate. Adachi and Shimamura is, at it\'s core, a work centered around this dilemma. Each of it\'s titular characters struggles to overcome stagnation in some form, to move beyond their awkwardness, insecurities, and fears of intimacy, and ultimately to find the wonderful warmth of love and belonging. In presenting how scary it is to grow closer to a person, and let more of each other into your lives, it nails it in a way that\'s raw and poignant. But Adachi and Shimamura is also a deeply romantic series. It reminds me of how wonderful it can be to fall in love, how it\'s worth all the fear and awkwardness for that small moment of triumph, like someone has heard your feelings and responded in kind. AdaShima can be sad, it can be angsty, it can be poignant, but the ultimate feeling I take is that it\'s warm. It is empathetic to it\'s characters fears of intimacy, and so revels in it every time they find some solace in a small victory. Adachi and Shimamura is about two lonely people navigating the complicated feelings of adolescence and loneliness, and by the end, they\'re still on their journey. But the progress they\'ve made, the relationship they\'ve forged, it warms my heart in a way few series do. It\'s a show that didn\'t just remind me the joys of being in love, but also made me fall in love with it in the process. For all of its visual and writing shortcomings, the strength of its titular couple, their (particularly Shimamura\'s) internal monologues, and it\'s most memorable moments, have etched their way into my heart, cementing Adachi and Shimamura as one of my favorite anime romances. to note about AdaShima is that it is SLOW. Like, as slow of a burn a slow burn romance can get. It\'s atmosphere is quiet and melancholy, and it\'s in anything but a hurry to make progress.

In many ways, it is a refinement of Denpa Onna's ideas and themes, polished to a mirror sheen and given incredible focus to its subject matter.Adachi to Shimamura stars the titular couple, a pair of socially awkward introverts (though Shimamura makes an effort to seem outgoing) with copious amounts of inner monologues throughout the whole series. What makes the show so relatable, is that, in spite of the heavy narration, Adachi and Shimamura feel like real people....It's very easy to empathize with either of them and the strong writing does wonders to make these people seem so natural in their behaviour and in their conversations with each other and with others. It's honestly refreshing to watch the very first episode and be impressed with how the conversations turned out, i.e. it's very much something you would have with someone else, a very realistic and natural conversation, about nothing at all, yet entirely encapsulating nonetheless.The series gives a strong focus to Adachi and Shimamura's progressing relationship, with the irony that Adachi becomes more awkward and embarrassed around Shimamura the more she starts to realize her feelings for her. Unlike the scatterbrained Denpa Onna, AdaShima is comparatively razor sharp in its focus, with the occasional digression to look at the lives of Hino and Nagafuji (itself a foil to Adachi and Shimamura's relationship) as well as Shimamura's sister and Denpa Onna canon immigrant Yashiro (a different one, but related to the Yashiro from Denpa Onna). Adachi's dorkiness is incredibly adorable and her turning into a puppy or spilling her spaghetti in front of Shimamura is really cute. But I do enjoy how both characters do slowly work towards building their romance with each other.Refreshingly, there is little to no drama or substantial love triangle in this show, unlike the very similar YagaKimi where Touko going through an identity crisis built into the main drama/conflict of self-identity and discovery. AdaShima is very relaxing and comfy by comparison, offering very pleasant visuals paired with a soothing soundtrack as you witness the two go through their day-to-day. The surprising thing is that there is never a dull moment in the show, glacial as the pacing may be, every moment centered around Adachi or Shimamura does something in progressing or exploring their relationship with each other or with the outside world. Tarumi's inclusion does raise Adachi's jealousy by a fair bit, but she never becomes a rival in the same way as say, Sayaka from YagaKimi (which coincidentally received a spinoff spotlight LN by the same author, and of which Tarumi heavily resembles in voice and in role), at least this far into the show.There's a somewhat ethereal flow to the conversations and their depictions in the show. Very dreamlike, sci-fi-like, or floaty. The kind of conversations that make your mind wander off, yet pay close attention to in the same time. Maybe Yashiro's presence is rubbing off on me with her alien-like abilities toying around with the cast every so often.If you're ever tired of cliched will-be-wont-be's or drama-heavy romance series, AdaShima may just be the cure for you. Its pace is incredibly slow, but it does work for the kind of series it is: A relaxing thought-provoking look into the minds of two introverts who fall in love with each other, with a very real approach to its dialogue and inner monologues.7/10 It's very easy to empathize with either of them and the strong writing does wonders to make these people seem so natural in their behaviour and in their conversations with each other and with others.

This anime has a good production value. The animation is great, the characters look adorable, the direction is good - which just made suffering through it disappointing on top of unentertaining.This anime starts off very strong. The relationship between Adachi and Shimamura is enticing and it made me want to see where it would go - and I was promptly handed my comeuppance for this transgression.There's a certain point in the show when watching Adachi and Shimamura's relationship goes from adorable to excruciating. It's...during the day when the kid joins them at the mall. While the scene made me very angry, it was for a good reason. I relate heavily to Adachi, and I absolutely hated that kid because I understood exactly what it's like to be in that situation. I was so happy when it ended and Adachi got to go back to being alone with Shimamura - except the only problem was the show found out how to make me feel the same form of anguish even without the kid.Very soon after the scene I described ends Adachi's character absolutely plummets. She goes from being shy and closed off from everyone except Shimamura, to shy and closed off from everyone, including Shimamura. I absolutely know that her feelings are realistic, but it's so hard to watch. We never get any release from Adachi's social anxiety. There are no islands where she's truly able to bond with Shimamura. It's nothing but her running away, not knowing what to say, etc. Again, these things aren't bad when the conflict they bring is resolved - but there just is none in this show.Up until the very end Adachi never grows past her anxiety, and even this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that she didn't start off so socially inept. She's perfectly competent at the beginning, but after a few episodes she just becomes hopeless. I get that it's realistic, but there is such thing as being too realistic. Besides, despite being realistic, there's still plenty of fanservice, so that took away any brownie points I could give it for realism.There are some cute moments in this show, but overall it was just suffering past a certain point. If it weren't for the amazing animation and tiny amounts of cute moments, I'd find this show horrid, but thankfully there are redeeming qualities. during the day when the kid joins them at the mall.

Perhaps you\'ve chuckled at a funny memory for no reason in particular, or found a cherished item you could have sworn you lost years ago. That feeling describes how I feel about ""Adachi to Shimamura,"" or Adachimura for short. I aimlessly stumbled across the show while looking for a quick seasonal to watch, and left having seen one of my favorites all-year. Why is that? Because Adachimura is enamored with that same special feeling - of...meeting someone you never knew you needed, and seeing your life change forever. This review is meant to be spoiler-free, but feel free to skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you\'d like to go in blind.Adachimura is centered around two self-proclaimed delinquents, who in skipping class find themselves hanging out on the second floor of the school gym. Our partners-in-crime form a fast friendship, which grows into something more meaningful. The show explores the uncertainty that comes with having a first crush, the nuance in navigating social dynamics, and what it means to find someone special in your life. Adachimura achieves this by frequently fleshing out the individual perspectives of our leads. At times it goes as far as to retrace its own steps, switching places to the other main character prior to a shared event. It\'s all about perspective. Getting into the headspaces of our girls is what Adachimura does best, with thoughtful observations providing the audience with plenty to relate to and think about. However, such perspective would be pointless if both girls were too similar, and thankfully Adachi and Shimamura are about as distinct as night and day.Meeting Adachi was like meeting myself; the only difference between her and yours truly is that I don\'t happen to be a ""kawaii"" high-school girl who\'s good at ping-pong. A habitual introvert closed off to the world around her, Adachi\'s walls come crashing down as Shimamura barges in. The hopeless romantic I am connects with Adachi effortlessly; I know all too well what it\'s like to fall for someone way out of your league. Lazy afternoons in the gym hall take on new meaning, as Adachi discovers a need in Shimamura. The smitten ""delinquent"" and her tumultuous feelings closely represent thoughts I\'ve had for special people that changed my life. And no, I\'m not just referring to the rampant hormone-induced horniness Adachi indulges in. Rather, the element that makes her arc so endearing are the changes she undergoes during this relationship. Watching Adachi\'s journey through her own eyes lets me know just how much her feelings for Shimamura influence her decisions. She second-guesses every tiny interaction, because Shima matters and is worth the extra thought. She trepidly tests the waters with moving the relationship forwards, because she wants to draw closer to Shima. She celebrates every small victory with excitement and relief, because knowing you need someone and are needed in return is the greatest news in the world. The way Adachi relays my past experiences back to me is just shy of a personal attack; at times her goofy naivety and awkward mannerisms leave me laughing as I hold my head in embarrassment. Having been in her shoes not too long ago, I empathize with her and root for every W she can find. Adachi discovers herself in someone else, and seeing her grow alongside her precious bond felt wholesome and rewarding.If Adachi is a character I relate to, Shimamura then is someone I\'ve learnt a lot from. She\'s charming on the outside, and caring on the inside. Shimamura has her own reasons for killing time at the school gym. While her close friend is only just looking at life through rose-tinted glasses, Shima is one who\'s seen it all. She\'s never had problems clicking with peers around her, in fact she\'s almost spoilt for choice when it comes to picking cliques. But despite her ability to find her place amongst a sea of people, she feels lost, having yet to experience a bond that goes beyond the superficial. And it\'s not for lack of trying, as evidenced by her attempts at investing in relationships that didn\'t pay off. Her once excited, optimistic approach to life now carries a tinge of tiredness and world-weariness. Giving her all to others and putting on a likeable image has taken its toll on Shima. Her thoughtful introspection throughout the series shed some insight into interpersonal relationships from the perspective of my loved ones. In the past, my happiness over the notion that I\'m liked by my friends sent my expectations of them sky-high and clouded the truth - that these people are just… people. Individuals, with wants and needs, just as I am. Shimamura showed me what it\'s like to be on the receiving end of those expectations. The show goes at length to depict how tiring it can be to keep up with changing dynamics, when the status quo works so well. Her caring nature is at odds with the idea that getting too attached to people is an exercise in futility. That is, until Adachi proves her wrong. Once again, Adachimura celebrates what it means to meet someone special, gradually bringing color back to Shima\'s world. It\'s a joy to watch her slowly open her heart to Adachi and welcome those innocent feelings of youth once more.Adachimura glitters its coming-of-age story with charm and wide-eyed whimsy. Don\'t worry about the character introspection being nearly as dry as the essay I\'ve put together, as the show strings together its melancholic musings with some great, witty dialogue. The show is brimming with thoughtful quotables about the human condition, as well as characterization through dialogue that gives attentive viewers plenty to chew on. Adachimura also shares the various ways people share their love through its side characters, with pals Nagafuji and Hino taking the show to new, adorable heights of gay. Speaking of side characters, we are introduced to a literal ALIEN who holds no significance to the plot other than comic relief and playing the occasional deuteragonist. IDK about you, but I find that concept incredibly funny. The Alien joins a looney astrologist and a hack fortune teller as a group of oddballs that occasionally make appearances in an otherwise grounded show, perhaps suggesting that relationships between people are as mystic and mysterious as the zany stuff I just mentioned. In any case, a playful, fantastical charm permeates every aspect of the show, depicting the mundane through cute visual motifs and a vibrant sheen. The art style is quite literally shiny, but not all there for flashy effect; strong direction and versatile stylistic choices amplify the message being shared. All-in-all, the show is just gosh-darn beautiful.As much as I\'m in love with Adachimura, it\'s not a show for everyone. One issue is how the show disobeys the adage ""Show, Don\'t Tell."" It spells out most of its metaphors out for the viewer. While some who struggle with reading subtext would appreciate the clarity, others might find that this adds to the series\' struggle with repetition. Adding to that weakness is the constant use of anti-climax. Sure, using that device a story isn\'t always a bad thing, but the very nature of it inherently robs the audience from catharsis. Adachimura often succumbs to repetition and a lack of ""real"" progression. Adachi\'s frequent compromises are seen as the same rinse-and-repeat plot structure we\'ve grown to dislike. Given my biases and personal experiences, all I can say is that such anti-climax is as real as it gets. \'Cause even if things stay mostly the same, there\'s always joy to be had in sharing that special bond. And who knows? Perhaps life has more miracles in store, and more ways to open us up to new experiences. Whether you\'re coming into the world with fresh eyes or have seen all there is to see, life will find a way to surprise us through the people we love.Tl;Dr:Adachi to Shimamura is enamored with the concept of love. About what it means to find yourself in someone else, about seeing the world around you in a changed light. It explores how two girls from different places in life stumble upon love, and how that love changes them. Thoughtful use of perspective creates a deep sense of empathy, as a couple of young delinquents open up to each other. Filled with charming interactions and melancholic introspection, Adachimura offered me a connection that\'s truly special. 8/10~***STRAY RAMBLINGS: (SPOILERS):- Unpopular opinion: I kinda think that Adachi getting rejected would make for a strong story decision. Sure, it\'d tear my wee little heart to shreds and go against everything I\'ve talked about so far. But as an exploration of a dynamic that I\'m surely not alone in experiencing firsthand, the pair being separated seems like a natural place to be. Adachi\'s actions could admittedly be seen as unhealthy, so the story heading in that direction and exploring Adachi\'s recovery could make a lot of sense.- How the hell did the author know I don\'t celebrate Christmas?

Not only did she provide Adachi with a great character moment, but she also made the most out of her 3 minutes of fame with some hilarious line delivery.- BEST GIRL: Tough pick, this just isn\'t fair.

Happy Holidays, and expect more ill-informed takes, from me to you. Peace~', '(TLDR Review at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)Let\'s get the important questions over and done with.Is AdaShima a yuri anime the community knows and loves with excessive kissing and other unholy actions?No.Is AdaShima a wholesome love story that will inevitably take part in fuelling various wholesome forums and anime boards across the internet?Yes....Now for the review.AdaShima is a pleasant anime to arise from what is now a playground consisting of generic isekai, hyped (but by no means bad) shounen anime, and other heavily anticipated anime deriving from popular manga and creators. I won\'t lie, this year has given some other decent romance anime to remember, but I don\'t think they had the same touch as AdaShima, as in the touch of youthful school romance you usually get from your average school shoujo non-comedy anime such as Kimi ni Todoke and Say ""I Love You"". It is a nice addition to go forward with, whether it be with the romance genre or the Shoujo Ai genre or the anime seasons that awaits us. Every now and then a simple school story that doesn\'t converge with what else is in the air won\'t hurt. It acts as an equalizer, if you like, that doesn\'t usually appear in this day and age.Narrative:I said AdaShima is a simple school story, to be more precise, a simple school love story. And yes. It is quite literally that. There isn\'t any quality of the anime to fish out as majorly impressive or distuginging to sit through, albeit there were elements from the characters that did annoy me slightly which I will get onto later. In watching this story though, one thing that did get out to me was the presentation and execution. Something about AdaShima made me feel like I was reading a story, as in if it were in a book format, whilst concurrently watching an anime. If you don\'t already know, AdaShima originated as a light novel if I am not wrong. In my time of reading light novels, I must say, the detail into character thoughts and the viewpoints of surroundings and behavior is greatly enhanced. The anime does this through countless amounts of internal monologue, and not in a way that it was like the narrator from Peppa Pig, it is just the simple yet perplexing thoughts of your teenage girls that have fallen in love. Such a technique isn\'t new. But it does allow for interesting perspectives and looks into the behaviour of our protagonists. It makes them more human to look at rather than characters that exist to do things in some plot. Honestly, not a bad way to go around with such a simple story. With the pacing of the story, it wasn\'t too slow, but it wasn\'t fast either, if I had to say, it leans more onto the slow side of things, which in turn gave it that mood of realistic growth in the atmosphere rather than something that comes out of a 13 y/o teen relationship that exists just to get that street cred from classmates. Whilst it is a little slow, it is nothing that will make you fall asleep.The characters are somewhat interesting to focus on. I don\'t like dumb characters. I just don\'t know why someone would do dumb things. But the preception of what is \'dumb\' and not all boils down to relativity, especially with emotions. Adachi is a good example of this. To me, Adachi did quite a lot of stupid things, though looking at the romance genre and everything it has given, her actions are to be expected and, not surprisingly, liked to some extent. In other words, she is your average romance protagonist. However, that doesn\'t excuse her from the stupid actions that you may be tired in seeing constantly. She is a jealous girl, and an iffy one too. Not that I have many emotions to begin with, but damn, I have seen this Adachi-kinda-girls more times than I have seen shounen plot armour. It is annoying to view nevertheless. The number of times Adachi gets jealous of whoever the hell Shimamura interacts with, or the silly amount of times she stops talking to Shimamura or runs away from her. It is undoubtedly some of the most generic plot devices for a dramatic atmosphere. But as I said, the story is simple, it is to be expected. Though, recalling back to my earlier statement of humanisation, it makes her more human, I mean half the times she has some of the most innocent of wet dreams when it comes to thinking about Shimamura. She is a loner. A teenager. Wouldn\'t be surprised if she hated \'insta normies\' too. But yeah, she is what you would expect of someone who just fell in love. She has all the stupid qualites and the redeeming ones too. Even though I have said some negative things about her, she does fine as a character for this story.Shimamura is another engaging one to focus on. One could say she is denser than Osmium, or she is CEO of confused.com. Though in seriousness, I thought that she was indeed slightly dense and confused when it came to her tremulous relationship with Adachi. You see Shimamura\'s feelings towards Adachi are fogged. You can\'t say she has the same feelings as Adachi to her, however, you can\'t say that she is looking at her as just a friend. Friendzoned, if you like. I can never really tell what Shimamura truly thought about Adachi other than someone she really enjoys being with. You can tell what she will do next, but I was not convinced about her true motives in the event something went in a peculiar fashion. In her presence of taking up screen time, she has shown that she does question quite a bit of things mostly revolving around the people she spends time with, whether she has spent time well or not. But other than that, and her relation with Adachi, she isn\'t one that can be easily deciphered. Not a bad character, but not the star-of-the-show. Just a really thoughtful (the thinking kind) girl.Side characters, you could do without, their presence and impact on the story means little hence why I said that, they are not anything vile, but given how most of the story is focused on Adachi and Shimamura (surprisingly, as if the title wasn\'t enough), it felt as if that the side characters didn\'t need to exist in the slightest. It probably would have made for a more bland anime, so I give thanks that the side characters do exist, though they are indeed just useless to anything to push the plot forward, even Yashiro who was this alien from out of nowhere didn\'t mean much after episode 3 or somewhere close to it. A sad loss. But I wouldn\'t mourn over it.Audiovisuals:The visuals were good. Very good. Polished and detailed so much so that it actually feels like something from this generation of anime. I mean, don\'t tell moi u don\'t luv dem lips, u know u want dem close ups. Although, if you pictured a random scene as if they were landscapes, background visuals don\'t hold up to the character designs, which is kinda disappointing. Animation-wise, it felt slow, like the writer got so immersed with the slow pacing that they decided to jump onto one of the animation PCs and start animating. It has this slightly choppy flow to it which made for a few scenes that would trigger for a few giggles to come out unintentionally, like when Adachi physically runs away from Shimamura. Nothing appalling or unwatchable, but it is just a slight hiccup that disenchanted the experience.I swear I binge watched AdaShima and I have come out not remembering any of the OST, I really believe that it was that ""in the moment"" kind of OST being played as supposed to something intentionally made to stay in your head. Saying this, I will admit that I don\'t have the best memory in the world. However, not even one soundtrack has stuck with me since. I wouldn\'t say the sounds are bad though, as I willingly try to recall sounds played, for that, I would probably remember more than not. OP and ED were different, they stuck with me and were actually very nice to hear, it had that smoothing feel everytime you listen to it. Seiyuus were good. Basically what you would expect from anime like this. Nothing too deep or enlightening to report on that matter.Enjoyment:Hey, I love me a good romance. Regardless of how cliche or foolish the characters are. I literally used to live on r/wholesomeanimemes at one point, so you can get where I am coming from. The enjoyment was splendid. The pair were going out bowling, feeding each other, holding hands, resting on each other\'s thighs. You can\'t tell me that isn\'t wholesome. Simple things like that were very enjoyable for me, and maybe will be enjoyable for those who watch this. The whole light novel presentation idea was very enjoyable for me as well, diving into character thoughts does make for some well played enjoyment. Tells me to get back to reading soon lol.Overall - 6.8 (7)----------TLDR Review:Story - 7: Simple love story, played as if it were a light novel.Visuals - 7: Good character design, but somewhat choppy animationAudio - 6: Good OP and ED, though nothing memorable from OST, most are made for ""in the moment""Characters - 7: Adachi is slightly dumb, but an expected character. Shimamura is mysterious. Side characters mean nothing at the end of the day.Enjoyment - 7: Very wholesome romance, execution if really fun to immerse in as well.Overall - 6.8 (7)----------Really can\'t say I have final words for AdaShima, I mean, everything I have been meaning to say has been covered. I have every intention of reading the light novel, so I should enjoy that hopefully. I am just going to say I recommend this to anyone who wishes to watch this. It is nothing groundbreaking, you probably won\'t get much out of it, but it is there if you are either new to the genre or just want more decent anime to watch. Now for the review.AdaShima is a pleasant anime to arise from what is now a playground consisting of generic isekai, hyped (but by no means bad) shounen anime, and other heavily anticipated anime deriving from popular manga and creators. I won\'t lie, this year has given some other decent romance anime to remember, but I don\'t think they had the same touch as AdaShima, as in the touch of youthful school romance you usually get from your average school shoujo non-comedy anime such as Kimi ni Todoke and Say ""I Love You"". It is a nice addition to go forward with, whether it be with the romance genre or the Shoujo Ai genre or the anime seasons that awaits us. Every now and then a simple school story that doesn\'t converge with what else is in the air won\'t hurt. It acts as an equalizer, if you like, that doesn\'t usually appear in this day and age.Narrative:I said AdaShima is a simple school story, to be more precise, a simple school love story. And yes. It is quite literally that. There isn\'t any quality of the anime to fish out as majorly impressive or distuginging to sit through, albeit there were elements from the characters that did annoy me slightly which I will get onto later. In watching this story though, one thing that did get out to me was the presentation and execution. Something about AdaShima made me feel like I was reading a story, as in if it were in a book format, whilst concurrently watching an anime. If you don\'t already know, AdaShima originated as a light novel if I am not wrong. In my time of reading light novels, I must say, the detail into character thoughts and the viewpoints of surroundings and behavior is greatly enhanced. The anime does this through countless amounts of internal monologue, and not in a way that it was like the narrator from Peppa Pig, it is just the simple yet perplexing thoughts of your teenage girls that have fallen in love. Such a technique isn\'t new. But it does allow for interesting perspectives and looks into the behaviour of our protagonists. It makes them more human to look at rather than characters that exist to do things in some plot. Honestly, not a bad way to go around with such a simple story. With the pacing of the story, it wasn\'t too slow, but it wasn\'t fast either, if I had to say, it leans more onto the slow side of things, which in turn gave it that mood of realistic growth in the atmosphere rather than something that comes out of a 13 y/o teen relationship that exists just to get that street cred from classmates. Whilst it is a little slow, it is nothing that will make you fall asleep.The characters are somewhat interesting to focus on. I don\'t like dumb characters. I just don\'t know why someone would do dumb things. But the preception of what is \'dumb\' and not all boils down to relativity, especially with emotions. Adachi is a good example of this. To me, Adachi did quite a lot of stupid things, though looking at the romance genre and everything it has given, her actions are to be expected and, not surprisingly, liked to some extent. In other words, she is your average romance protagonist. However, that doesn\'t excuse her from the stupid actions that you may be tired in seeing constantly. She is a jealous girl, and an iffy one too. Not that I have many emotions to begin with, but damn, I have seen this Adachi-kinda-girls more times than I have seen shounen plot armour. It is annoying to view nevertheless. The number of times Adachi gets jealous of whoever the hell Shimamura interacts with, or the silly amount of times she stops talking to Shimamura or runs away from her. It is undoubtedly some of the most generic plot devices for a dramatic atmosphere. But as I said, the story is simple, it is to be expected. Though, recalling back to my earlier statement of humanisation, it makes her more human, I mean half the times she has some of the most innocent of wet dreams when it comes to thinking about Shimamura. She is a loner. A teenager. Wouldn\'t be surprised if she hated \'insta normies\' too. But yeah, she is what you would expect of someone who just fell in love. She has all the stupid qualites and the redeeming ones too. Even though I have said some negative things about her, she does fine as a character for this story.Shimamura is another engaging one to focus on. One could say she is denser than Osmium, or she is CEO of confused.com. Though in seriousness, I thought that she was indeed slightly dense and confused when it came to her tremulous relationship with Adachi. You see Shimamura\'s feelings towards Adachi are fogged. You can\'t say she has the same feelings as Adachi to her, however, you can\'t say that she is looking at her as just a friend. Friendzoned, if you like. I can never really tell what Shimamura truly thought about Adachi other than someone she really enjoys being with. You can tell what she will do next, but I was not convinced about her true motives in the event something went in a peculiar fashion. In her presence of taking up screen time, she has shown that she does question quite a bit of things mostly revolving around the people she spends time with, whether she has spent time well or not. But other than that, and her relation with Adachi, she isn\'t one that can be easily deciphered. Not a bad character, but not the star-of-the-show.

I really was. The first few episodes made it seem like it was going to be a pretty excellent, character driven coming out romance between two girls unsure of their sexuality but committed to their relationship. I was ready to go to bat for the eccentric Adachi and her somewhat troublesome behavior, but by episode four, one of our lead's personalities had changed from being mature, if self-doubting, to a stereotype. The other is presented as dense as platinum, but without the shine… more and more irrelevancies and contrivances kept cropping up, and episode 7 brought as...a rival love interest, and I was done. So incredibly done. I never watched 8 and I never will.I don’t like clichés very much when they’re taken seriously and used as genuine points of drama, and that’s all this show has after about episode three. I sure do like some shows that lean heavily on tropes, but those series by and large use them appropriately or at least with a soft enough touch for me to overlook them. A to S doesn’t do that. What had a chance to be a unique, fun show opted instead to follow the same, damn-tired pattern of so many before it. I’m not saying Ore Monogatari is a masterpiece, but at least it resolves its romantic tension early and gives its characters time and space to explore themselves and each other in the context of their relationship. Shows like Adachi to Shimamura, by contrast, use contrivance and cliché as a way of avoiding dealing with the actual relationship for as long as possible in order to string the audience along with drama. Screw that. It’s pure manipulation at the cost of good storytelling, and it’s both old as dirt and equally unappealing. Making your characters “conveniently” oblivious or altering their personalities in order to protract drama isn’t satisfying at all, and makes me resentful. If it played itself for laughs, I could forgive it a bit, but nah, Adachi to Shimamura plays itself straight all the while.Let’s not get into the fanservice. I actually don’t mind fanservice if and when it fits the story, or honestly even if that’s just what the show is about, but it feels as thrown in as possible in this show. I must repeat, fanservice doesn’t offend me when it doesn’t feel like a blatant ploy to hide other flaws, but guess what it feels like here?Anyway, I’m done with this. Serves me right for having a little faith in a yuri romance anime that takes itself seriously. They always end up like this, but I always take the bait. Clearly this contrived emotional torture porn has an audience, but I’m sure not part of it. a rival love interest, and I was done. So incredibly done.

This one gives you false hope initially, before degrading in to cliché filled mediocrity.Spoilers from this point on.The show keep up a decent façade in the first half, but suffers from ""why am I still watching this?"" syndrome midway, when you realize nothing really happened so far and probably will not. And that\'s exactly the case. Ending pretty much gives up on the romance aspect, and the entire second half is pointless. All in all this is your typical one-sided love story with a...yuri twist on it, but it fails to explore either of the subjects, and ends up wasting your time.Even something as blatantly fan-service focused like Sakura Trick had more value as a romantic anime, so don\'t waste your time here. yuri twist on it, but it fails to explore either of the subjects, and ends up wasting your time.Even something as blatantly fan-service focused like Sakura Trick had more value as a romantic anime, so don\'t waste your time here.', ""Story:8Art:10 (some people might be bothered by camera angles BTW)Sound:10Character:10Enjoyement:10Overall: 10Story:8 -- adachi to shimamura is a slow yet pleasantly pased romance set in school, this is not the ambitioust part of the anime, nor it is the main reason to watch it, BTW; the storytelling, something usually overlooked is great, the inner conflicts of characters drive at least 50% of the plot.Art:10 -- beautiful character design, specially how vivid eyes are, backgrounds usually vary colors to fit the feelings of scene and characters, slow motion scenes to fit dialogue, the only questionable part is light fanservice, I'm not bothered by it but some people...can find it disgustingSound:8 -- sound fits perfectly with scenes, it's definitelly not innovative, but it works perfectly, opening and ending are fine, but not something to remember laterCharacter:10 -- best part of the anime, they look like real and normal people, the internal conflicts are seriously taken, the self-acceptance is a strong driver for character development, there are also theories around about a main character suffering a disorder, I'll not spoil here, but novel readers have a point there, and is trully incredibly well drivenEnjoyement:10 - slow romance showing in credible ways such life transitions and self-acceptance conflicts, I have to say, I couldn't believe who the author of the novel was... this is just too good compared to his previous work...Overall: 10 -- all that said, I'm really enjoying this anime can find it disgustingSound:8 -- sound fits perfectly with scenes, it's definitelly not innovative, but it works perfectly, opening and ending are fine, but not something to remember laterCharacter:10 -- best part of the anime, they look like real and normal people, the internal conflicts are seriously taken, the self-acceptance is a strong driver for character development, there are also theories around about a main character suffering a disorder, I'll not spoil here, but novel readers have a point there, and is trully incredibly well drivenEnjoyement:10 - slow romance showing in credible ways such life transitions and self-acceptance conflicts, I have to say, I couldn't believe who the author of the novel was... this is just too good compared to his previous work...Overall: 10 -- all that said, I'm really enjoying this anime"", 'It should be important for me to mention at the start of this review that I love yuri. There\'s just a certain level of comfort and happiness that yuri brings me when I see it. And I especially love it when I see it done well. And one of the biggest problems I\'ve had since becoming a weeb has been finding yuri that feels well-written.There\'s not a lot of yuri that\'s been made, but of what is already out there, the best yuri stories is usually side-stories in more general romance. Bloom Into You is good, but something like Sweet Blue Flowers is boring and...unremarkable and Citrus is a whole other beast that I hate. So when Adachi to Shimamura fell into my lap, I realized that I found something special.From the start, it\'s about an unlikely friendship that develops out of convenience. Both girls sneak out of class to meet up in the gym to hang out. The dialogue in this show is so different from what I always see in other yuri. It feels natural. Or at least, it feels more clever than most other stories. The conversations they have up in that second floor of the gym feels like I\'m watching ""Yurimonogatari"" and the art matches it.In fact, I just want to talk about the art even more for a second. Do you know how hard it is to find a yuri anime with good art? It\'s next to impossible. Studios don\'t really waste budget on yuri, which is why something like Sweet Blue Flowers is incredibly forgettable. The lighting and shading make these characters stand out in contrast to a lot of other yuri.Of course, there are some slight issues in the story. I\'m not writing this review right after watching, I watched it as it was coming out and now I\'m two anime seasons past it. I might have some goggles on and forgetting about the weird alien girl that shows up and doesn\'t really seem to have a purpose. In fact, this show could get a 10 without the weird added mystical stuff with that alien girl. There\'s no explanation for her and I\'m just left confused.But at its core, at the center, what is most important is if the love story feels good and believable and if the animation and art looks good. And those two things were absolutely knocked out of the park.Is a good anime. unremarkable and Citrus is a whole other beast that I hate.

it\'s blank, there\'s literally nothing in it, although they did have faces in several scenes in the classroom, but leaving a blank face instead of animating even the tiniest detail, feels a bit unacceptable, but i am myself amazed about how well the environment was animated, especially the makoto shinkai-ish scenes, it fits perfectly with the environment.And then what else... oh yeah, the theme song.I love it so much, the theme of the song fits the theme of the anime, and what\'s interesting, the openng theme was sung by Akari Kito and Itou Miku, the vas of the main characters, and the ending theme was sung by Akari Kito herself.Character DevelopmentThere\'s nothing much i could say about the characters, i want to explain it, but it\'ll be full of spoilers and i don\'t want that, just 1 thing that bothers me, the character Yashiro, feels like it was a character whose appearance is forced, she has nothing to do with the story line, and what\'s worse, no one knows who she really is, she just explains that she is an alien named Yashiro, and she is 800 years old.EnjoymentIf i\'m being honest, such a good yet simple title, ""Adachi to Shimamura"" or ""Adachi and Shimamura"", but the storyline is not about about the love story between Adachi and Shimamura, the whole 12 episode was basically full of Adachi being too nervous around Shimamura and unable to tell Shimamura her true feelings, i enjoyed it, but caused a bit of disappointment.OverallIt\'s a 9/10 from me, i can change it to 10/10, i really liked it, too bad, my expectations was too high, it left me a hole nside my feelings, like something was missing, and things that adachi should\'ve done before the anime ends.Thanks for reading my Adachi to Shimamura review!!!- YetiSsimo, 06/03/2021 Shimamura without a good reason behind it.What i meant by ""acceptable"", is how Adachi\'s feelings was increasing as time flows, and still increasing even though there are conflicts, until the story reached it\'s climax.About other aspects, let\'s talk about the art, shall we?About the art, there really is something to be criticized, even though i could guess the main problem about the art is that not everyone\'s face got animated, only everyone who\'s involved in the story is perfectly animated, but everyone elses face?

Clearly, shoujo ai anime do not share my own sentiment. Apparently, milking the genre for what it\'s worth by providing non-stop fan-service is their interpretation of making a shoujo ai show.I\'d like to point out that this show really is more about fan-service than it is about the relationship between Adachi and Shimamaru. It\'s more than just that, though. It really milks the ""girl on girl"" trope real good. It\'s a good rule of thumb that just because its a girl...doing it, doesn\'t make it any less worse than if it\'s a guy doing it. In fact, that is precisely what sexism is. Look, if anyone switched the gender of Adachi to a guy, her actions would be indicative of a creepy stalker and a control freak. Her actions shouldn\'t be perceived as ""cute"" because she\'s a girl, yet this is exactly what happens.Imperfections in her personality suddenly become a quirk that doesn\'t get explored. Just because you\'re in a relationship doesn\'t mean you\'re happy: you need to have a sense of self satisfaction and happiness before being able to find happiness with others. Adachi clearly is a flawed character that should have been set on self improvement while progressing through her relationship with Shimamura. Any sane person would see that the idea how Adachi is a loner that skips school and socially inept is a problem, not something that gets brushed past like it\'s a totally normal thing to do. The idea that Adachi has some problems doesn\'t ever cross Shimamura\'s mind, and nor does the narrative construct or focus on this idea at all.  Again, if this show was a guy that was a loner that skipped school, that would be a critical point of the plot. Gee whiz, this guy needs to get some help. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\'s beginning is exactly what I\'m thinking of. Look, I\'m really not a fan of that series, but it does illustrate the point that I\'m trying to make.What I\'m trying to say is that something that should be explored by both Adachi and Shimamura get ignored in favor of progressing their relationship, both unaware or just plain uncaring of this fact. Is it not a red flag when Adachi is extremely jealous of Shimamura\'s friends, and tries to make sure that Shimamura doesn\'t get approached by anyone? Adachi is clearly childish, self-centered, and immature in regards to making relationships with others, and with her own personality.Pacing in this story is horrendous as well. Not only is everything extremely uninteresting, but it\'s really slow going. It\'s like I\'m reading the event log of Adachi and Shimamura\'s relationship, but these events aren\'t even close to being meaningful. I really don\'t care if a show is slow paced. However, it doesn\'t give it a right to illustrate bland and unimportant events in which I\'m supposed to grind through in hopes that ""it will get better later."" The fact that their relationship progresses through such arbitrary events and lack of anything of substance is a means for me to worry.I\'ll read the novel just to see whether or not the original material is good, but truth be told, I\'m not expecting much. doing it, doesn\'t make it any less worse than if it\'s a guy doing it. In fact, that is precisely what sexism is. Look, if anyone switched the gender of Adachi to a guy, her actions would be indicative of a creepy stalker and a control freak.

Adachi clearly is a flawed character that should have been set on self improvement while progressing through her relationship with Shimamura. Any sane person would see that the idea how Adachi is a loner that skips school and socially inept is a problem, not something that gets brushed past like it\'s a totally normal thing to do. The idea that Adachi has some problems doesn\'t ever cross Shimamura\'s mind, and nor does the narrative construct or focus on this idea at all.  Again, if this show was a guy that was a loner that skipped school, that would be a critical point of the plot. Gee whiz, this guy needs to get some help. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\'s beginning is exactly what I\'m thinking of. Look, I\'m really not a fan of that series, but it does illustrate the point that I\'m trying to make.What I\'m trying to say is that something that should be explored by both Adachi and Shimamura get ignored in favor of progressing their relationship, both unaware or just plain uncaring of this fact. Is it not a red flag when Adachi is extremely jealous of Shimamura\'s friends, and tries to make sure that Shimamura doesn\'t get approached by anyone? Adachi is clearly childish, self-centered, and immature in regards to making relationships with others, and with her own personality.Pacing in this story is horrendous as well. Not only is everything extremely uninteresting, but it\'s really slow going. It\'s like I\'m reading the event log of Adachi and Shimamura\'s relationship, but these events aren\'t even close to being meaningful. I really don\'t care if a show is slow paced. However, it doesn\'t give it a right to illustrate bland and unimportant events in which I\'m supposed to grind through in hopes that ""it will get better later."" The fact that their relationship progresses through such arbitrary events and lack of anything of substance is a means for me to worry.I\'ll read the novel just to see whether or not the original material is good, but truth be told, I\'m not expecting much.', 'Yuri/Shoujo ai anime isnt for everyone. But i like some of them, and this anime is one of Yuri anime i like. The story isnt heavy and maybe related to some ppl for communication thing with others.Adachi and Shimamura is wholesome show, its heartwarming and the art is beautiful. For the characters, i can related myself to Adachi somehow lol. The story isnt heavy like other similar anime genre, but Adachi and Shimamura are adorable and cute.The opening song is nice and the ending song is good too, so you wont skip this. Overall i enjoy the show and hope theres season 2 to complete...Adachi and Shimamura development relationship.If youre looking for ""friendship"", a bit of shoujo ai with beautiful graphics and arts you will like this. My final verdict is 9/10 coz the excecution of this anime is great imo.

My final verdict is 9/10 coz the excecution of this anime is great imo.', ""Shoujo Ai/Yuri-themed light novel/manga sources usually have to be popular to a certain extent for there to be an anime adaption.I personally have read the 18-chapter manga that has been released for quite awhile now, and I loved the story progression and character development. So when I heard Adachi to Shimamura is getting adapted as an anime, I was ecstatic. Not only does the plot follow the source material quite closely, it does it quite well. It is easy for these type of genres not get the proper care by the production team, but it was well done. It's on par with another of its...kind, the popular Yagate Kimi ni Naru.Story: The two MCs, Adachi and Shimamura, met on a day where they both skipped class and ended up in the same place. The story is about the interactions they have with each other at various different places and situations. All the typical stuff that couples do to each other is basically present in the anime, but the two MCs are basically doing couple-like stuff as friends.The story is slow, but the pacing is perfect. It's doesn't feel rushed and feels genuine, like something that could happen IRL. That part is present in the source material, and adapted well as anime.Art: I usually suck at evaluating art, but I can say for a fact that the art here is simply wonderful. It's vibrant, colourful, beautiful. The production quality is unbelievably good. The quality did not drop throughout the season even due to the current health crisis.Sound: The OST simply fits with every scene as great environmental background. I thought the OP was ok, but the ED was a bop for me. Maybe I'm biased because I do like Adachi's seiyuu, Kitou Akari.Character: The character development and design is great. The emotions and thoughts that each character feels and reflects on are true and genuine, again something that could easily happen IRL. The anime explores the character's internal conflict as the events progressed, something that, if not done well, can feel like a monotone inner-self speech. However, the anime doesn't overwhelm you with those as it fits with the flow of the episode quite well.Enjoyment/Overall:All components that make up the anime - story, art, sound, character - all mesh together nicely to create a nice, 24-minute relaxing episode to watch every week. While one has to be quite attentive to appreciate all the elements of the anime, it's well-worth it. It may not be so great for binge-watchers (should spread out watching the episodes I think), but for people who loves pieces in this genre - Shoujo Ai/Yuri - and who liked Yagate Kimi ni Naru, this is an easy recommendation and something they should not miss watching.(Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, Overall - 9) kind, the popular Yagate Kimi ni Naru.Story: The two MCs, Adachi and Shimamura, met on a day where they both skipped class and ended up in the same place.

I think this is even better than Bloom Into You. So far there haven\'t been many high caliber shoujo ai/yuri anime which usually tend to be get overshadowed with heterosexual romance stories like this season\'s Tonikaku Kawaii overshadows this one. I think this is way better than Tonikaku Kawaii even if you can\'t compare these directly.This is slow burn romance between two girls which is very realistically done. Excluding that annoying ""alien girl"" or whatnot which popups time to time. Both Adachi and Shimamura seems to have...their own problems which are causing them to slow to become dropouts. They first meet each other at their secret hiding place while they skip classes. First it starts as friendship which slowly is blossoming to be something more.I really like how Adachi\'s and Shimamura\'s inner feelings and conflicts are highlighted. As teens they don\'t know how to express their feelings to each other and there is always fear of rejection hanging around and fear of losing that fragile friendship. Overall their interactions are so darn cute which makes one to wish to be in their shoes.There aren\'t many shoujo ai/yuri anime with this quality and if you like romance stories in general this really is one you should be watching.So far this is 9/10 anime. I might rate this 10/10 depending how rest of the show goes. their own problems which are causing them to slow to become dropouts.

Two students, Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura, cross paths on the second floor of the school gymnasium while skipping classes. Their friendship gradually deepens as they grow closer to each other throughout the story. This had the potential to be something truly special, but the potential feels a bit wasted.There\'s two major issues which feel out of place and have no reason to be part of the plot. First, the story includes an alien who randomly appears dressed in a space suit, and the characters react to this bizarre occurrence as...if it were completely normal. As much as I wish I was making that up, the alien then takes the form of a blue haired child. Her only purpose towards the early parts of the season is to be annoying and intrude into the alone time of the two main girls, preventing them to truly develop their relationship. As the show progresses, her existence is neither explained nor does it serve a greater purpose like helping a character figure something out about themselves or moving the plot along. Luckily, she gets shifted into the background in the later stages of the season. Without a clear reason for her existence or any explanation, her character feels unnecessary, and completely out of place. I can\'t understand how the other characters react to a girl who has glowing blue hair, emits light particles, and claims to be a centuries-old alien as if she\'s the most normal thing ever. The other thing which just felt completely out of place is that the first time a male character gets introduced and gets screen time, he\'s a pedophile peeping on little children at a swimming pool..... This scene serves ZERO purpose and just sort of exists, which makes it even more of a headscratcher.The relationship feels one-sided for most of the season. One character appears almost obsessed with the other, even going so far as to ignore her for days just because she talked to another girl for a few seconds. This creates an unhealthy dynamic where one character is deeply in love while the other seems to go along with it just to avoid loneliness. Adding to this, the character in love makes her feelings quite obvious, while the other is either completely oblivious or pretends to be, resulting in content which can tend to feel awkward . Despite the significant growth in the emotional bond between the characters throughout the season, it concludes on an unfulfilling note, leaving more questions than answers.This anime has its high points and several qualities that make for a pleasant viewing experience. The drawing style is pretty and the music is well chosen alongside a good voice cast. The romantic moments feel organic and genuine, and the interesting premise allows it to stand out in a genre with limited options. However, it does have glaring issues that range from minor disturbances to elements that become, quite frankly, extremely annoying. Ultimately, while the anime has moments that redeem it, making for an overall positive viewing experience, these flaws add an unfulfilling element that somewhat taints the experience. if it were completely normal.

Especially towards the one half of our titular cast, Adachi. I do not wish to say that their frustration is missing the point of the entire show because we all interpret things differently. And because that would be invalidating towards their frustrations, but what I do wish to say is that perhaps their frustration is a bit misguided and I at...least want to provide an alternative perspective to Adachi as a character so that people may understand her a bit better. So, allow me to explain.It\'s a bit of a cliché at this point, but one of the things we humans obviously are not is, perfect. And obviously the same can be said about Sakura Adachi the 15 year old school girl a lot of this story is centered around. Adachi is a very flawed human being. Maybe I am a bit too empathetic towards Adachi as a person but a lot of the frustration people seem to have with her is how toxic and manipulative towards the girl she is madly in love with Shimamura. That Adachi is incredibly jealous if Shimamura spends any time with anyone else. And yes, while these emotions of jealousy and betrayal aren\'t healthy ones Adachi feels throughout the show. I think perhaps it is a bit misguided and unfair to not empathize with her plights even a little. She is a teenager growing up in the most social and emotional point in her life. I think it is a bit unfair of us to assume that teenagers during this time, especially a teenager who has grown up with nobody, no friends, who has a mother who to be quite frank did not help her development growing up very much, to be a bit clingy and jealous when they find someone they really enjoy being around. Try to be a little more understanding and empathetic towards that.To reiterate, this sort of jealousy is one that a lot of people experience, actually. It\'s a pretty normal human thing to feel and while it obviously is NOT the most healthy way of thinking about things. It makes sense within the context of a teenage girl experiencing the most emotional time of her life and falling in love with someone after having nobody.Furthermore, it is not like it is never shown or implied that Adachi tries to change herself, or attempt to take action for Shimamura\'s sake. Adachi has done things in the light novel and anime that are completely out of the realm of her comfort entirely because she doesn\'t want Shimamura to hate her and because she wants Shimamura to be happy. Adachi is self-aware of how she acts. She is aware that her behavior isn\'t healthy. She takes a look at herself and thinks, ""Hm, maybe I should actually try my best to work on my problems, to try to not be insane so I\'m not a burden to the people around me."" That sort of thing. This development happens a lot more in the light-novel than it does in the anime obviously, but there are still a few moments like this in the show.I think it was pretty blatantly obvious to me anyways that when reading the light-novel, and in some parts of the anime, a lot of the messaging was, we as humans sometimes have a lot of complex negative emotions. And even though they may not be healthy, if we have any desire to reform and become better people, we struggle through them and try to get through them the best we can in the hopes that we get better. Especially for the people we love and for ourselves. I really loved watching Adachi\'s character for this exact reason. I rooted for her, I wanted her to try her best to reform and improve as a person. She struggles a lot. And if you are an anime only watcher I can understand your frustrations towards her as a character, without spoiling much though she does improve in the light-novel, she improves a lot of her problems a lot later on. It requires a lot of reading and time to get to that point, but that\'s how human beings are. We don\'t fix things immediately. If we have un-healthy, negative emotions. Which Adachi certainly has. It takes time to improve ourselves and become better people. It takes years even. And within the context of the light-novel, this is the span of her improvement.I am not defending Adachi\'s actions throughout the light novel or anime if you still don\'t like her as a person. That\'s completely fine. I understand that she is clearly not for everyone. But I don\'t necessarily think it\'s fair to be unfair towards her efforts. I hope this review was at least a little bit illuminating for her as a character.You may also be wondering why I gave the anime a \'7\' then if I seem to love this media so much. Fair question, it is because even though I found the anime to be pretty enjoyable. Adachi To Shimamura\'s anime did not do the light-novel justice to me as it is a fairly hard source material to adapt. Why is that? It\'s because a lot of the important factors of the Adachi\'s and Shimamura\'s character come from the very frequent inner monologues they have in their heads. These provide a lot of insight and context into their character and how they think as people. Their beliefs, dreams, random thoughts about how they feel about something. There are a few inner monologues in the anime but nothing that even comes close to the level of Adachi To Shimamura\'s light-novel. I empathize with the anime creators though, because if it was the case that they would of adapted these inner thoughts. It would of taken a lot of time and resources because they are quite long monologues sometimes. However, I believe these to be vitally important to the story, almost entirely necessary to understand adachi and shimamura as characters. So for the reason of the anime cutting out important details. I\'m unfortunately giving it a 7 despite their best efforts.This was my first time writing a review.

I was so invested in their relationship, I felt like I was Adachi and I might have developed a crush on Shimamura! :P Seriously! My heart fluttered so many times! I related so well to Adachi's anxiety and intense love for someone else. I also related to Shimamura's struggle to maintain relationships and what seems to be mild depression. Not to mention their introversion and difficulty communicating whatthey want with others.I enjoyed every second of the show! Absolutely everything I love, including the music and sound effects.

Adachi and Shimamura is closer to a friendship/romance than a full blown yuri anime where kisses every episode are expected from the audience and anything less than a confession of love is written as ""going nowhere"". It\'s content to take its time and allow the characters to move about the story without some drama to force them forward. Their progress is minute, but it is there.The direction is...sublime without resorting to unneeded drama. The struggles happen internally, both girls know how they feel about each other, one fully aware of it, the other refusing to accept it. It doesn\'t need over the top drama to be engaging, their monologues are well-written and conveyed in a way that doesn\'t make light of it. No tonal whiplash as it goes for a one and done joke. They talk like awkward friends would. The shot composition and use of colors is great, often when coalesce their thoughts, it\'s framed beautifully that shows how hard it is for these characters to make friends, but it\'s never done in a way that feels melodramatic. They accept reality as it is.Adachi and Shimamura succeeds at showing the struggles of breaking out of your own shell and the fear of the future. It\'s glacial but always engaging, and endearing without being saccharine and treating the audience like they don\'t know what love is. If you came expecting a kiss or confession, then you will be disappointed but I struggle to find romance anime that captures teenage awkwardness that feels empathetic rather than pedantic, allowing quiet moments to make the biggest splash. sublime without resorting to unneeded drama.

They accept reality as it is.Adachi and Shimamura succeeds at showing the struggles of breaking out of your own shell and the fear of the future. It\'s glacial but always engaging, and endearing without being saccharine and treating the audience like they don\'t know what love is. If you came expecting a kiss or confession, then you will be disappointed but I struggle to find romance anime that captures teenage awkwardness that feels empathetic rather than pedantic, allowing quiet moments to make the biggest splash.', ""If you're on the fence about watching yuri, you're probably wondering what the genre can offer you that straight romance anime doesn't.  There's more to it than being about love between girls.  In the best recent examples, like Bloom Into You, Kase-san, and now Adachi and Shimamura, the difference is all about the main character.  Straight romance anime tend to fall into the same old tropes, time and again: the main character is a bland stand-in for the viewer, he's constantly being insulted and punched by girls, sometimes it's not even clear which girl he's really in love with until the end,...etc.  With yuri, the main character isn't stuck being the viewer's avatar, and they tend to be written as much more interesting characters as a result.Adachi and Shimamura is surprisingly well summed up by that promotional image of them gliding through the air on a bike together.  It's a story that unfolds at a gentle pace, about two girls who are close, but it's an awkward, uncomfortable kind of closeness.We're given equal insight into the thoughts of both girls.  Adachi is clingy and dependent on Shimamura, and is only beginning to understand the true nature of her feelings.  Much of the story revolves around Adachi's attempts to reshape their relationship into something both closer and more equal, though she nervously stumbles at every hurdle.  Shimamura doesn't understand what Adachi wants from her, is distant and self-critical, and it's strongly implied that she has depression.  The thoughts and feelings of both girls feel convincing, and the slowly shifting dynamics of their relationship make the show an engaging watch.The series only has two weaknesses.  First, there's a little alien girl running around throughout.  She seemingly has nothing to do with the main story, and is just... there.  I get the impression that she was the Unique Selling Point that the author used to get the light novels noticed, but then he didn't really know what to do with her.  Thankfully, she appears less and less frequently as the series progresses.The other problem is just the ever-present one for single-cour adaptations of ongoing light novel series: there's no real ending; it just stops.  Despite that usual frustration, this series is definitely worth watching for its sympathetically written characters, beautiful art, and gentle story-telling. etc.  With yuri, the main character isn't stuck being the viewer's avatar, and they tend to be written as much more interesting characters as a result.Adachi and Shimamura is surprisingly well summed up by that promotional image of them gliding through the air on a bike together.

The original material is beyond the scope of this review and is not a factor for consideration.Story: The story had a simple premise and a simple promise, but was executed brilliantly. The progress was clearly marked, but the payoff was a little underwhelming. The pacing is deliberately slow to support the slow-burn romance that this series offers. One of the support characters, a self-proclaimed alien with actual superpowers, is something of an oddity, however, and her existence sometimes intrudes on the otherwise grounded plot.Character: Both main characters were written and portrayed very well. Both main characters...had a small, but appropriate, amount of character growth. The side characters are also generally likeable and are given plenty of screen time, relatively speaking, with a little bit of character development to call their own. The character interactions are superb. The dialogue is extremely natural and well-written.Visual: The show was visually stunning and makes use of visual metaphors to great effect. On a technical level, the small amount of 3D visual assets were integrated remarkably well. For example, Adachi's bicycle is rendered in 3D in multiple scenes, but most viewers would be hard-pressed to notice this detail.Audio: The sound design was great and the show used audio metaphors extremely well. The music was great with the opening theme, 'Kimi ni Aeta Hi', and 'Merry Go Round' being standout tracks due to being sung by the two main voice actresses. The (Japanese) voice acting was particularly exceptional, with standout performances by Kitō Akari as Adachi Sakura and Itō Miku as Shimamura Hougetsu.Enjoyment: Personally, I loved almost everything about this show. My only two gripes are that I was a little underwhelmed by the final payoff and I'm not fully sold on Adachi's character design.

Like something didn\'t feel right. Then it sorta dawned on me why it just wasn\'t as good as I thought it was going to be. Don\'t get me wrong, I thought it was a decent anime. However, if you asked me ""would you watch this again in the future?"" I\'d say no, it didn\'t really grasp a like connection where I want to watch it over and over.What felt off to me is that they introduced characters, and I have no clue why they are in the story.For me, it\'s the alien. Sure it...could be the fun goofy aspect of the anime to makes things a bit enjoyable but in my opinion, the alien was somewhat in the way and kinda annoying... Unless there is more information in the manga, I think the alien is pretty much useless.I also like to point out that the anime/character development seemed slow to me, when I was watching episode 6 and further, it just felt like a chore to even watch it.

When it could have been executed better.', 'When we think of the Shoujo Ai genre, it is common for him to be connected in a relationship between two girls, what is known as Yuri. Such a subgenre is usually exposed with an intensity that is not yet easily moderated. Some shows call for scenes that are too sensual and have little content in the story, while others curl up in presenting it. There are also those who seek to gain credibility in a very large sentimental drama, where the couple\'s relationship is shaken. Adachi to Shimamura was a show that tried to be many of these things at the same time, but...in the end, it failed to convey anything more than a boring experience and without any charisma.First of all, it is necessary to mention that the show does not propose to raise Yuri right away. He\'s gentle about it, so much so that it ended the same way he started: a pair of girls who decide to skip class together, just because they don\'t feel like studying. Such a start gives an idea that random encounters at school and on the street will be important for the development of the characters. But here is already a problem that bothers many people, the precariousness and the repetitive cycle of banal dramas. In that case, Adachi is the cause of everything. She is introspective from start to finish and does not know how to deal with her feelings. Her discomfort with a possible passion is visible in her heart, especially when each new dialogue is difficult for her, whether it be asking her and Shimamura to go out together, or to spend time at her friend\'s house. All of these situations create a character who needs attention and who cannot leave his selfish side, from the moment when other characters approach Shimamura. Adachi\'s insecurity is prevalent throughout the show. And Shimamura? Well, you can\'t say that she is despicable, but she doesn\'t like it either. With her constant coldness, Shimamura does not understand her friend and cannot understand her signs of affection, wondering at the times when Adachi asks for more attention.This is not a problem, after all, it is just the demonstration of a friendship maturing into a possible love. But the very conception of this situation leaves the anime full of moments like ""I have to invite her to go somewhere with me on this date"" or ""I had a dream about her, does that mean anything?"". This set of scenes is ridiculous and does not present anything that was already built at the beginning of the show. In addition, the secondary characters are nothing but personifications of problems that affect the friendship of the two protagonists, because as one issue is resolved, another comes in the next episode, without any rest. Sometimes, the anime does not make an effort to coherence, nor does it even try to hide it, as each new character creates a strange atmosphere and always leaves some uncertainty in the next step of the anime\'s main friendship. Again, a problem is followed by insecurity and ends in a large number of unfinished dialogues, which are resolved over time. Sometimes, I feel sorry for Adachi, for always being the most insecure girl on the show.The anime tries to save itself in visual metaphors and utopias of the dreams of each character, in addition to presenting a decent cast of characters that, as much as they are used as obstacles to the friendship of Adachi and Shimamura, manage to produce a good comedy and even leave the show problems aside, in order to mask the show. The main one is the child who dresses up as an astronaut and calls himself an alien. Whenever she appeared, it was a smile that I gave off. In addition, the anime is visually beautiful (except for the excessive brightness of the image, which is annoying), which added to the music, managed to make a competent production and deserves applause.In addition, it is possible to trace a promising future for the show. If you have a sequel, maybe something makes the show more enjoyable and really exciting. Existing characters can become more important and friendship can advance further in the story. It is a large amount of possibilities, which create a possible improvement for the franchise. It remains to be seen if this is what the author wants, because if it does not happen, everything already presented will be eternally damaged.Overall, Adachi to Shimamura does not present a new thing in its genre. As much as I have not seen much about, Shoujo there has better things taken advantage of. The experience with the show is not totally bad, but it also does not get good, since the anime\'s own problem is its weak construction and that tires eyes. As I mentioned before, the show proposal is null, does not present an important message, nor can it emit something different from a disinteresting casuality. The show can have a prosperous continuation and I really want to accompany, if they definitely adapt, because the story has flashy elements, but that so far they have not built anything more than empty bodies and silly resolutions. The show ended up being a disappointment, however, if you like an anime that explores things like insecurity and jealousy and does not care about repetitions, this show can be perfect for you.

How those people struggle dealing with their own feeling? etc. Adachi Shimamura pictured them all beautifully here. Vivid visuals, soothing sounds, lovely story. Akari Kito voice is fine but personally I really love Itou Miku unique voice here. For this kind of relationship, we can’t really tell the story pacing is fast or slow. If you consider it slow, you won’t realize that the development already started. If you consider it fast, actually it’s not going anywhere. So let’s just enjoy their daily life, each episode won’t be as boring as our life anyway. Maybe...it’s simplicity that can hook you up waiting for next ep, just like I did. At first I only give score 6, but as the show goes on I’m starting to looking forward to it. Then I realize that my anticipation is worth as other 8 scored shows this season. Like I said, maybe it’s simplicity that can hook you up.Not sure about other country but here between close friends, we used to call each other using bad nickname like mtherfker, ash*le, baka-yarou, kuso, etc for boys. Even if we didn’t really mean it. But if that boy get irritated, usually it will be solved in barbaric ways and in the end they become friends again even closer. Same for girls, they call each other darling, sweetheart, my love, etc, Even if they didn’t really mean it as well. The side effect for girls’ case is what we can call L.The more you watch, it might change your perception of this phenomenon. This girl is just unlucky, need more attention, longing for affection, shy & timid. And that girl is just pure kind & caring while innocent & insensitive at the same time. As the show goes on, we might start yelling at them, ""Can you stop being so thirst for love!"" (actually no, please keep timidly chasing your feeling), ""And you too, please stop being so innocently kind!"" (I mean no, please keep insensitively making her misunderstand even more).From general people view, we don’t want them to get separated but they don’t need to be in that kind of relationship. We start to look for a solution to them but nothing pop up. At least we wish they keep on getting along like this. Wait, does it mean we are supporting L? We just don’t want any of them to get hurt, that’s it. it’s simplicity that can hook you up waiting for next ep, just like I did.

Most people would probably find this boring, I would say it's not for everyone. But now, if you want a reason for what makes this show so great despite it seeming utterly simple, look at the title. Yes. These two characters' personalities and chemistry are so masterfully done, I could read 3,000+ pages of just them talking inside their heads and enjoy it. In fact, that's what I just did.Story: 7/10Not mindblowing or anything, it's a coming of age story, about the budding romance between two girls trying to come to terms with...themselves and their feelings as they continue to spend time with each other. This show is very light on drama, which is why it feels really slow. To others, painfully slow even. But personally, the slowness is justified and part of its appeal because how this show deals with romance is on the realistic side. It's funny because there is another romance this season, which is its complete opposite regarding those terms, Tonikaku Kawaii. But both, both is good.Art and Sound: 8/10The visuals, aesthetic, and sound, I dig it. I'm not a fan of the art style of the characters at times, but it's aight. Considering that the source material is monologue heavy, they did a great job making those more enjoyable with the creative visuals and music.Characters: 9/10This is where AdaShima truly shines. The main characters are very unique, relatable, and have depth; they feel and act like real teenagers.You have Adachi, an extreme loner but not because she's shy or some sort, it's because she lacks interest in anything. Now, people will say that the way she acts is creepy. And yes, she is! Sort of. But I'm not too hard on her because this girl is really deprived of affection. You see that she is trying her best, is forward about what she wants, earnest, and quite polite. It's these things that make you want to cheer for her throughout the anime despite the cringe that comes with it. Oh, Adachi... you'll get there!Then Shimamura is who I believe is the less popular one of the two. Though more adept at social situations, deep down, she's detached, apathetic, resulting in her passivity and tolerance. Her denseness is due to her very frustrating rationalizations and excuse for Adachi's suspicious behaviors. Despite her indifferent nature, she's actually sweet and conscientious, only she can handle a troublesome person like Adachi lmao. She's certainly a difficult girl, interesting nevertheless.The side characters are not as interesting as the leads, which is sort of a flaw but forgivable. Since this is Adachi and Shimamura, not four dorks and an alien.Enjoyment: 10/10Though an incomplete adaptation, the anime gives a sort of satisfying closure and leaves it at a not so awkward place, unlike Bloom into You. I see these two always being compared, and I discourage it because they're dissimilar in many ways. But I understand why because these two are the pinnacle of yuri IMO. Overall, I love the anime, it got me looking forward to it every week, and it gives me that serotonin boost every time.Finally, I would give this 8/10. Now, if only they made season two *sigh* themselves and their feelings as they continue to spend time with each other. This show is very light on drama, which is why it feels really slow.

Also watch out for lurking parents when the OP is playing as it gets pretty sus for whatever reason.Sound:Not much to say for the sound of this show,...the opening is fine, though if you were to hear it a month after finishing the show you would probably forget it's even from it.

It is just a vaguely romantic slice of life."", '*Spoiler warning!*Alright, this Yuri is definitely centered around more of a fluffy/adorable romance rather than like hardcore kissing or stuff like that. The show is definitely on the more realistic side of Yuri romance, as it moves at a fairly slow and realistic pace. As well as the fact that both girls aren\'t 100% sure if they have romantic feelings for each other. If you like more fast-paced romance than this definitely wouldn\'t be for you. In all 12 episodes the most ""romantic"" thing we\'ve seen between the two would either be Adachi sitting between Shimamura\'s legs, or them holding hands. Yes that\'s it. So...for that I\'d give the story a 6/10, it was slow but it was fine. One thing that I absolutely loved though was the art style and color pallet! It was so full of life! The art was beautiful, and matched with the colors, it was astounding! Definitely is some art I would LOVE to see in some other Animes! The personalities of both Adachi and Shimamura are perfect and realistic. Adachi is very shy around Shimamura, which I definitely do see people in real life being shy around there crushes, so its fitting! Shimamura doesn\'t really ""notice"" her crush on Adachi, which is also very realistic. With that, I\'d say it was a 6/10. Reason being, I feel like the show did stop way to early. We didn\'t really see THAT much ""romance"" in the last few episodes. And I feel like we didn\'t have enough time to learn too much about the characters. I\'d definitely recommend reading the Light Novel if you want to learn more and keep looking into there adorable ""love"" life! :D for that I\'d give the story a 6/10, it was slow but it was fine.

If you came for the lesbian (Giggidy) story then you came to the wrong place. While it is implied something may happen, it does not happen here. I won\'t spoil the actual story but I will say don\'t get your hopes up.This anime is about Shimamura, who doesn\'t do well to hang on to friends or interact as sociably as she may want as she just doesn\'t care to, and Adachi, who only needs one person to be with to be happy and isn\'t sure if that connection leads to love or...not. The two meet while being a couple of delinquents and skip class. They play ping pong, they talk and eventually grow close. According to Adachi. To Shimamura, they are just two people who happen to meet and may drift apart someday and she may not care. You get the story in both perspectives and honestly it was good. So good that I actually became invested.I wanted to see them become a couple, or kiss, or confess but... The anime ends around volume four of the LN or so I hear. So this feels like build up to better sections of the story that may come in a season 2. If it does get one... It will be awesome. For now, this is an enjoyable romcom? Slice of life? Yuri? I guess? As long as you know what you are getting into, then this is enjoyable. If you feel ""Blocked"" like I did... Then you might not enjoy it as much.Art: 10. Very Beautiful. Very Powerful.Sound: 10.

(it was actually the reason I clicked on it in the first place)But now here are some flaws I find that are keeping this show from being a 10 in my mind. (I’ll be comparing it to yagate kimi ni naru which is a 10 on my list)As I’ve said this show is very similar to yagate kimi ni naru (bloom into you) but I see this as a bit of a worse version.In yagate kimi ni naru there is plenty of character growth all the way till the end such as in the last episode you can see Koito starting to like Nanami and actually start having fun compared to the blank expression she had for almost the whole series.(A bit of a spoiler for when Adachi confesses in this paragraph)Whereas in Adachi to Shimamura there’s a lack of character development and it’s more like a cycle of Adachi asking to hangout with Shimamura, Shimamura saying yes and then Adachi becoming a nervous wreck around Shimamura. We don’t see Adachi confess until reading 2 short novels after the end of the anime which is honestly the first point where I see her develope as a character.Due to this cycle the show which is only 12 episodes becomes rather repetitive and feels a bit like a drag as a result of the dynamic not changing much in the latter half of the series. If the pacing was a bit better I’d like it more (by pacing I mean just speeding up the boring parts, as a one piece fan I’m happy to watch a show with slow pacing as long as it’s just not boring) and a shy Adachi who tends to get jealous and protective of her seemingly first friend (I haven’t fully read the rest of the story so I may not know something or a I may have forgotten something but Adachi has always been know to be shy and alone among her peers so I’m assuming that)I also love the art style of Adachi to Shimamura so that’s also a bit of a plus.

There\'s a lack of commitment and direction missing from this show. From the synopsis, you might think there will be a lot of interaction between Adachi and Shimamura.Instead, what you get is Adachi vs Adachi, and then a side of Shimamura afterwards with no real resolutions or growth between the two.And that\'s where I think the show loses itself. It feels as if it\'s trying to focus on the struggles of young love and the volatility of emotions that comes...with trying to understand it. But there really is no lesson given by the end of it. It\'s a frustrating cycle of presenting an obstacle for the relationship to grow, (Adachi is completely unable to progress past said obstacle, and the other usually has no clue it even exists) a scene where each character goes ""this is frustrating, I don\'t know what\'s going on!"" and finishes with both characters ignoring it and pretending nothing happened.To add to the lack of MC development, a good chunk of each episode focuses on the side characters and their personalities/relationships. But with such a dearth of growth from the MC\'s plus the fact that they both state within the show that they really don\'t care for the side characters makes me truly wonder why they even existed at all? I think they are supposed to add a Slice of Life feel and provide respite from the frustrations of the plot...instead of just fixing the pacing and character development issues.Story and development aside...A to S has some redeeming qualities.The ART and SOUND design both fit the style of the show perfectly. The usage of cool and warm colour contrasts emphasize the feelings and personalities of the characters. The music and is calming and quiet, never the focus or distracting. The Seiyuu\'s also fit the characters very well, which is especially important here as the show heavily focuses on dialogue.The downside of the dialogue is that the majority of it goes like this:Adachi has 5 minute internal dialogue struggle trying to process her emotions before finally starting the conversation.-A: ""H-h-h-hey, (stumbles over words and refuses to explain herself)how do u feel about me/random thing?""-S: ""Uh, what?""-A:  (random gibberish before completely giving up on what shewanted to actually ask) "" Ahhh never mind, want to hang outwith me?-S: ""Sure, I guess I have nothing else to do.""Adachi has another long ass internal dialogue where she talks about all the things she should just say to Shimamura.Shimamura has a short internal dialogue which boils down to ""I don\'t understand what Adachi is thinking, and I guess I\'m too apathetic to ask""The emotions that both Adachi and Shimamura feel and show are very real, and in my opinion the strongest quality for the show. I truly resonated with both characters feelings and their weaknesses. The stress of not knowing if you should say something and whether your feelings are real and valid. And complete apathy towards life and struggles that result in not knowing if you\'re able to, or even want to change it.There was so much potential for Adachi and Shimamura to explore these emotions and give a valuable lesson or any type of meaningful resolution to the show, yet...it just doesn\'t. The potential is lost due to the lack of focus I mentioned at the start. You have well designed, voiced, and relatable MC\'s, and an early focus on the development of their relationship. And then they went, ""Ah crap, it\'s too much work to actually develop these characters, let\'s just stuff in a bunch of side characters and internal dialogues and end the show ASAP""It baits in the committed fanbase of romance and Shoujo Ai anime, and then completely lets you down by just being a bad Slice of Life with no lesson learned or development shown by the time it ends.If you\'re someone who enjoys character growth and feeling like you learned something from what you watched, then pass on Adachi to Shimamura.If that doesn\'t bother you, and you\'re just looking for cute girls sometimes doing things together then you might find some enjoyment here! with trying to understand it.

Go, lesbians!I like girls. So. Shoujo-Ai/Yuri is my to-go.This was definitely a wholesome watch. As the synopsis states, the story follows two ""delinquent"" girls who come to be acquainted after skipping class and hiding together on the second floor of the gymnasium.The romance between the two girls in this show felt real despite the fact that Hitoma Iruma, the writer of this story, is male. This is common among the WLW/Yuri novels in the Japanese industry. He also wrote Bloom Into You, another popular Yuri series that I enjoyed.Aside from the light romance that Adachi conveys toward our other protagonist, another element of...this anime that boosted score from a 7 to an 8 was the realism.Shimamura, going through her own adolescent years, is thinking about the relationships in her life.The feeling of sonder is the realization that everyone around you has their own lives, their own stories. Shimamura is focused on her own story and understands that the more people she allows to intrude into her daily life, the more her life will change. When considering Adachi\'s intrusion, she is content. Shimamura believes that Adachi will open her life towards a good path.She enjoys the relationship she has with Adachi, but instead of viewing her as a love interest, she sees her as a friend. Puppy-like, even. Does this mean she is completely oblivious to Adachi being head-over-heels for her? No! It is apparent that she considers it as a possibility.And it feels real. There is no fantasy-like romance. The two girls don\'t instantly fall in love with each other. One starts with ambiguous feelings and as they spend more time with their person, they begin to grow those feelings. That person is also ambiguous with their feelings and is dealing with their own thoughts on relationships. this anime that boosted score from a 7 to an 8 was the realism.Shimamura, going through her own adolescent years, is thinking about the relationships in her life.The feeling of sonder is the realization that everyone around you has their own lives, their own stories.

It looks like a typical yuri-bait/shoujo ai that\'s been really picking up in popularity since Yagate Kimi ni Naru came out but it seems to go for a more surrealist and conceptual feeling rather than a heartfelt story that Yagate wonderfully executed (in the manga. RIP to the anime watchers who had the show end midway through an arc). Adachi to Shimamura goes all in on teenage angst and the troubles of love between the two titular characters. Whilst there\'s a lot to like about the show there\'s also so many glaring...flaws that need addressing but, if I\'ll be honest, I quite like this show.The anime starts off like a typical shoujo-ai between two girls with seemingly complete opposite personalities. Through a shared disregard for schooling our main heroines find themselves in an odd relationship after meeting each other while ditching classes. The anime then seems to snort a few grams of cocaine and bounce off in whatever direction with no regard for anything that looks like a coherent story. So we meet this alien...why? Does she do anything? Apparently sh\'s here to look for her comrade? Hold on let me look at the last episode for a bit...nope nothing here. Just another one of the loose plot threads that seem to pop up with the viciousness of a whack-a-mole with no hammer to smack them back down. This includes but is not limited to: the friend from Shimamura\'s kindergarten years (yeah good luck trying to be a main character), Adachi\'s mom who appears in one episode then is never seen or even mentioned from again, the serious baiting from Hino and Nagafuji etcetera etcetera. Yeah you can always put he argument of ""It\'s explained in the manga"" sure but I\'m not reading the manga. These plot threads seem to just be haphazardly thrown in without much thought. The anime itself is already snail-paced slow and scenes that don\'t focus on the main meat of the show further break up the pacing. Since none of these threads get any wrap-up it just feels unnecessary to have them get in the way.What it gets in the way of is the relationship between the main characters; Adachi ""why are you gae?"" Sakura and Shimamura ""99 problems but a bitch ain\'t one of them"" Hougetsu. I\'ll be honest there really isn\'t much chemistry to be found here which is a bit of a problem seeing that the main point of watching a romance anime like this one is to see the chemistry between the couple. I can accept that the two would obviously hold some interest in each other seeing how they shared a common interest (being teenage edgelords) but how did Adachi start to like Shimamura? She just sort of...does from the first episode and the anime carries on like it\'s the most natural thing in the world. Shimamura herself doesn\'t really have too much of a personality (from in-universe Adachi\'s point of view) to latch on to. It doesn\'t break the show but there\'s some trouble if a fundamental aspect of your genre doesn\'t exist.At least the relationship itself is surprisingly well-presented. There\'s a lot of nuance in it that I feel could really fly over people\'s heads seeing that the anime doesn\'t actually focus that much on romance whenever it concerns the two together, but rather it uses their relationship to explore aspects of their personalities. I\'d say a good 80 percent of all the dialogue in the anime is the two characters monologuing their thoughts on whatever situation they\'ve encountered that scene. Whilst a more thoughtful and grounded approach is not uncommon in similar anime (Aoi Hana and Yagate have roughly the same tone and approach) this anime takes a leaf out of Nietzsche and loves to go on long though-trains on extremely complex metaphors. I\'m not an expert but is this how high-school girls think these days? I recently watched After the Rain which also goes on long philosophical tirades but that made sense in context seeing how literature played a large role in that anime. The dialogue is actually quite interesting at times and sometimes does a good job reflecting the character\'s thoughts but it\'s so distracting knowing that no one actually talks and thinks like this. Anyways, the main relationship. There\'s a lot of focus on building the characters and showing aspects of their personalities whenever they interact. And that I think is the strongest point of this show: the showing. From watching a seemingly superficial one-sided romantic relationship we get to see some genuine nuance from the characters and I started to appreciate the character writing that I think got overshadowed a lot by the perceived generic story. Shimamura is a pretty interesting character who appears open and composed but is really just lonely and aloof. The anime does a great job showing how she perceives the world around her as someone on the outside looking in. Because of this she sees most relationships as superficial. She forgets a childhood friend\'s nickname, she finds herself unable to hold a friendship with Nagafuji and Hino, and she struggles to find anything meaningful in her new friend group after going up a grade. We also see her inability to commit and hold on to things in her dialogue with kindergarten friend and, in a more nuanced way, her changing her hair dye job back to her natural hair colour. Because the anime is so slow we get to be shown a lot of aspects of her struggle with having such a cynical personality.This is contrasted by the seemingly quiet and reserved Adachi who deep down is emotional and holds complex feelings for things which she has a bad habit of bottling up inside her. This focus on the mindset of the two characters define their interactions which, in turn, fuel their thoughts of each other. Shimamura may be observant but her fundamental inability to relate to others prevents her from reading between the lines of Adachi\'s actions. Adachi herself only bottles up her feelings thus making her look like a small puppy in Shimamura\'s eyes. Being the more imaginative one of the pair, she often has scenes of her just daydreaming about Shimamura often in sexual ways. And you know what? I\'m okay with that because I can accepet this is how teenagers think and feel whenever they like somebody. Of course she\'s going to be extremely awkward and clingy towards her not-girlfriend.  She\'s in bloody highschool. Highschoolers fantasize a lot. Despite a general lack of chemistry I find this aspect of their relationship to be quite endearing seeing how they both do somewhat need the other to complete each other. Shimamura needs Adachi\'s emotional pushes and commitment and Adachi needs Shimamura as a leading role in their relationship. A.k.a one to start the car and the other to drive or they both just stall as characters and as people. It feels natural whenever one of them ponders what the other would do in a given situation and it highlights how much each of them mean to the other. Despite being opposite in personality and mindset, they both see each other as a light that brings colour to their world. Heck even the first line of the OP basically sums it up. Overall the anime does a really good job delving into the mindsets of our two main characters and shows us exactly how they affect each other and their decisions. Unfortunately the anime sort of ends without resolving anything. Their relationship still feels like it stalled ten episodes ago despite having a bit of a rushed ending. Oh well. Second season I guess?The animation is mostly consistent and the artwork is beautiful at times. There are some great moments of character animation but not too much to write home about. I think the character designs are pretty cute though so that\'s half the work done. There is a lot of times where they use letterboxing and it\'s kinda strange. It\'s mostly used as a tool to emphasize certain emotional scenes but then it\'s also used to signify a flashback (though not all the time) and at other times, especially halfway through the show, it\'s just there for no apparent reason. It comes and goes without any consistency and it makes me think just not having it might have been a better idea. Who in direction though this was a good idea? There\'s also times where it changes artstyles as well as putting the "". . ."" scattered here and there which is weird to me and may have been a remnant from the manga which I have no doubt is probably more tonally coherent than the anime adaptation.The music is alright. It serves its purpose. The OP and ED are sung by the voice actors and don\'t stand out as anything more than generic anime OPs and EDs. Akari Kitou sounds really similar to ChouChou though or am I the only one? The voice acting was a standout. I don\'t know how but Miki Itou (who I haven\'t heard much of) manages to sound just disinterested enough to fit Shimamura\'s own  distant personality. If it was purposely done so then well done to her. The other voice actors were decent. Akari Kitou did a great job voicing Kyouko Suiri\'s tallkative Iwanaga Kotoko and the energetic Noa from Wataten but  is also great at voicing an awkward character like Adachi. Too bad she went on to voice in *shudders* Ex-Arm as Alma. Good job on the voice acting overall.Adachi to Shimamura is an odd anime. It\'s got a lot of good stuff going for it but there\'s a lot of glaring flaws holding it back. It\'s got a great framework for developing the characters as they interact but the dialogue feels out-of-place and the writing is too slow for its own good. It looks fantastic but then has wierd direction choices shoved in without much thought. I like the characters but I wish I could see how why they liked each other in the first place. Overall it\'s not a particularly good romance but I\'d recommend it as a character piece. If you could get past the teen angst, you\'ll find a pretty sweet look into a growing first-love. flaws that need addressing but, if I\'ll be honest, I quite like this show.The anime starts off like a typical shoujo-ai between two girls with seemingly complete opposite personalities.

Since none of these threads get any wrap-up it just feels unnecessary to have them get in the way.What it gets in the way of is the relationship between the main characters; Adachi ""why are you gae?"" Sakura and Shimamura ""99 problems but a bitch ain\'t one of them"" Hougetsu. I\'ll be honest there really isn\'t much chemistry to be found here which is a bit of a problem seeing that the main point of watching a romance anime like this one is to see the chemistry between the couple. I can accept that the two would obviously hold some interest in each other seeing how they shared a common interest (being teenage edgelords) but how did Adachi start to like Shimamura? She just sort of...does from the first episode and the anime carries on like it\'s the most natural thing in the world. Shimamura herself doesn\'t really have too much of a personality (from in-universe Adachi\'s point of view) to latch on to. It doesn\'t break the show but there\'s some trouble if a fundamental aspect of your genre doesn\'t exist.At least the relationship itself is surprisingly well-presented. There\'s a lot of nuance in it that I feel could really fly over people\'s heads seeing that the anime doesn\'t actually focus that much on romance whenever it concerns the two together, but rather it uses their relationship to explore aspects of their personalities. I\'d say a good 80 percent of all the dialogue in the anime is the two characters monologuing their thoughts on whatever situation they\'ve encountered that scene. Whilst a more thoughtful and grounded approach is not uncommon in similar anime (Aoi Hana and Yagate have roughly the same tone and approach) this anime takes a leaf out of Nietzsche and loves to go on long though-trains on extremely complex metaphors. I\'m not an expert but is this how high-school girls think these days? I recently watched After the Rain which also goes on long philosophical tirades but that made sense in context seeing how literature played a large role in that anime. The dialogue is actually quite interesting at times and sometimes does a good job reflecting the character\'s thoughts but it\'s so distracting knowing that no one actually talks and thinks like this. Anyways, the main relationship. There\'s a lot of focus on building the characters and showing aspects of their personalities whenever they interact. And that I think is the strongest point of this show: the showing. From watching a seemingly superficial one-sided romantic relationship we get to see some genuine nuance from the characters and I started to appreciate the character writing that I think got overshadowed a lot by the perceived generic story. Shimamura is a pretty interesting character who appears open and composed but is really just lonely and aloof. The anime does a great job showing how she perceives the world around her as someone on the outside looking in. Because of this she sees most relationships as superficial. She forgets a childhood friend\'s nickname, she finds herself unable to hold a friendship with Nagafuji and Hino, and she struggles to find anything meaningful in her new friend group after going up a grade. We also see her inability to commit and hold on to things in her dialogue with kindergarten friend and, in a more nuanced way, her changing her hair dye job back to her natural hair colour. Because the anime is so slow we get to be shown a lot of aspects of her struggle with having such a cynical personality.This is contrasted by the seemingly quiet and reserved Adachi who deep down is emotional and holds complex feelings for things which she has a bad habit of bottling up inside her. This focus on the mindset of the two characters define their interactions which, in turn, fuel their thoughts of each other. Shimamura may be observant but her fundamental inability to relate to others prevents her from reading between the lines of Adachi\'s actions. Adachi herself only bottles up her feelings thus making her look like a small puppy in Shimamura\'s eyes. Being the more imaginative one of the pair, she often has scenes of her just daydreaming about Shimamura often in sexual ways. And you know what? I\'m okay with that because I can accepet this is how teenagers think and feel whenever they like somebody. Of course she\'s going to be extremely awkward and clingy towards her not-girlfriend.  She\'s in bloody highschool. Highschoolers fantasize a lot. Despite a general lack of chemistry I find this aspect of their relationship to be quite endearing seeing how they both do somewhat need the other to complete each other. Shimamura needs Adachi\'s emotional pushes and commitment and Adachi needs Shimamura as a leading role in their relationship. A.k.a one to start the car and the other to drive or they both just stall as characters and as people. It feels natural whenever one of them ponders what the other would do in a given situation and it highlights how much each of them mean to the other. Despite being opposite in personality and mindset, they both see each other as a light that brings colour to their world. Heck even the first line of the OP basically sums it up. Overall the anime does a really good job delving into the mindsets of our two main characters and shows us exactly how they affect each other and their decisions. Unfortunately the anime sort of ends without resolving anything. Their relationship still feels like it stalled ten episodes ago despite having a bit of a rushed ending. Oh well. Second season I guess?The animation is mostly consistent and the artwork is beautiful at times. There are some great moments of character animation but not too much to write home about. I think the character designs are pretty cute though so that\'s half the work done. There is a lot of times where they use letterboxing and it\'s kinda strange. It\'s mostly used as a tool to emphasize certain emotional scenes but then it\'s also used to signify a flashback (though not all the time) and at other times, especially halfway through the show, it\'s just there for no apparent reason. It comes and goes without any consistency and it makes me think just not having it might have been a better idea. Who in direction though this was a good idea? There\'s also times where it changes artstyles as well as putting the "". . ."" scattered here and there which is weird to me and may have been a remnant from the manga which I have no doubt is probably more tonally coherent than the anime adaptation.The music is alright. It serves its purpose. The OP and ED are sung by the voice actors and don\'t stand out as anything more than generic anime OPs and EDs. Akari Kitou sounds really similar to ChouChou though or am I the only one? The voice acting was a standout. I don\'t know how but Miki Itou (who I haven\'t heard much of) manages to sound just disinterested enough to fit Shimamura\'s own  distant personality. If it was purposely done so then well done to her. The other voice actors were decent. Akari Kitou did a great job voicing Kyouko Suiri\'s tallkative Iwanaga Kotoko and the energetic Noa from Wataten but  is also great at voicing an awkward character like Adachi. Too bad she went on to voice in *shudders* Ex-Arm as Alma. Good job on the voice acting overall.Adachi to Shimamura is an odd anime. It\'s got a lot of good stuff going for it but there\'s a lot of glaring flaws holding it back. It\'s got a great framework for developing the characters as they interact but the dialogue feels out-of-place and the writing is too slow for its own good. It looks fantastic but then has wierd direction choices shoved in without much thought. I like the characters but I wish I could see how why they liked each other in the first place. Overall it\'s not a particularly good romance but I\'d recommend it as a character piece. If you could get past the teen angst, you\'ll find a pretty sweet look into a growing first-love.', 'This anime was simply beautiful. Adachi and Shimamura gave us an amazing animation, interesting and lovable characters, a beautiful OST, very cute scenes and brilliant character development. Still, it was frustrating and disappointing, and had potential do be way better.People complained that it didn’t have romance, but it did, what it didn’t have was a kiss in the end. The construction of their relationship was very well done, and for most of the time their development was realistic, way more than what we see in other series about romance or that have it in their story.Adachi first realized her feelings towards Shima, had to think...if they were true and then decided to make bolder moves on her. We had some cute scenes between them, and they were not out of place in the story.And Adachi is a great protagonist. The anime builds her in a way that you really love her and want her to achieve her desires.Adachi is just so lonely. She is depressed, has no friends, her only family is her mother who is a terrible person, she can’t socialize and skips class because she has no perspective of a future. Still, she has to be the one that makes the effort to build the relationship she wants and is the only one that will work to improve her life, and that’s so rare in anime. In most drama stories we will have a protagonist like this, but they will always be brought in with supportive and loving side characters who help them, and that’s not what happens in real life.Adachi grows a lot in this series, she learns how to be brave and how to fight for her dreams. And she manages to get a good friendship with Shima without any help. However, despite being the heroine, she is not flawless and can be possessive a lot of times, and this is shown as a problem that she brings into relationships, so she is not “the perfect girl” that we have with most anime heroines, thus giving her more personality. Adachi, by herself, is the best this anime has given us.So why am I giving it a 7-8? Well, if you look my reviews on other anime you’ll see that I complain about queerbaiting. Here they teased a lot their relationship, with a new bait or “too close it might happen” scene every episode, to not make it happen in the end. Adachi and Shimamura had a lot of great scenes together, and their final scenes together, sleeping under the stars and realizing that they’re not lonely anymore were really beautiful.I really wanted them to kiss and to be in a relationship and it’s disappointing how they didn’t, but I prefer a thousand times to watch an anime with this, with character development and relationships that make sense, that a generic yuri where the characters know each other for a day and one is already “deeply in love”, and by the second episode they give a forced kiss for fanservice without any build-up for it, and that people will say that it’s a great romance because they made the physical part happen without any meaning on it.Adashima is really slow-paced, and while it’s good that it’s not dead-paced like some other anime, this is also a problem because at a long therm it is forced and unrealistic. And it’s specially bad if the anime has 12 episodes and will most likely not get a second season.Shima’s character is reasonable, mostly. She doesn’t want to get attached to anyone, so she blocks herself from getting deep into relationships.However, making her being totally oblivious to Adachi’s moves is forced. In real life, girls mostly don’t need a formal declaration of love to know that you like them, they already know by your actions and the way that you look and talk to them. Here we had Shima with the intelligence of a door, always forcing another view on the situation and calling Adachi “puppy”, “little sister”, “daughter” and such.It’s also terrible the regression that we had in the last episodes. Adachi and Shima had a good progression until episode 9, with them getting closer, declaring her fondness for each other and spending christmas and valentine’s day together. Then, in episode 10, this suddenly changes out of nowhere and we are back to episode 1.They returned to that level in episode 12, but this sudden regression was just unnecessary and added anything to the story but a filler just so it would end open. It would be way better if it had continued from there and make them be together at the end, because it’s terrible how they forced them to be just friends.By the way I liked all side-characters – besides the Shimamura little sister because of that scene in the end lol – and I really loved Tarumi, would be perfectly fine if the anime ended with an ot3 of her, Shimamura and Adachi being together.So, Adachi and Shimamura was disappointing, but it wasn’t near as bad as it could be, and it was a very beautiful anime in general, surely deserving of a season 2. if they were true and then decided to make bolder moves on her.

Gorgeous art & animation, full of vibrant sequences that range from simply following the girls walking home together, to introspective dream sequences that establish mood & mental state. The tone of the series is light-hearted, but not so much so...that the emotional moments feel jarring. If you're looking for a well paced romance, this is one to check out. that the emotional moments feel jarring. If you're looking for a well paced romance, this is one to check out."", ""Adachi and Shimamura is a tooth-rottingly sweet yuri full of fluff that also contains some deeper moments of character introspection, and you know what, I'll take that. I knew going into this that it was not going to be the next Bloom Into You (which is an AMAZING yuri, please check it out if you haven't), but honestly, I was okay with that. I stray away from the yuri genre normally to begin with since it's usually so fetishized, but this one looked cute, and I, being a lesbian, cannot resist wlw content.This anime is very cute, and better yet, it doesn't shy away from...some deeper moments of introspection. Adachi is an adorable flustered gay whose gay freakouts are reminiscent of when I was 15 and figuring out my sexuality for the first time. Her developing relationship with Shimamura is exciting to watch (though be prepared for secondhand embarrassment). But even better in this anime is the deep character introspection that occurs as Adachi and Shimamura examine their social relationships and how they act around others. The more they get to know each other, the more they begin to improve each others' lives, and that is very cool to witness.And then there's...all the other characters. Look, I'd be content watching this entire show if it were just Adachi and Shimamura, as the title implies, but every time that alien girl came on screen I visibly would groan, and I would find myself ecstatic when she wasn't in an episode. I do not know why this alien girl is there. Is she cute? Yes. But...I do not see how relevant she is at all to the plot except maybe to help with Shimamura's introspection every now and then. Thankfully, she becomes less of a main character as the show progresses and Adachi and Shimamura's relationship develops.There's also Nagafuji and Hino which, quite honestly, are just cheap fanservice that made me uncomfortable. While obviously there are hints the two like each other as well, their relationship is nowhere near as developed as Adachi and Shimamura. While I think it would be wrong to get rid of their characters entirely, I really could have lived without the Nagafuji big boob jokes and deliberate fanservice between the two. That's typically what I try to avoid in yuri.Other than that though, if you're looking for something painstakingly sweet to watch as an escape from reality, give Adachi and Shimamura a watch. I don't expect a season two, and the anime wasn't good enough to leave me wanting to check out the light novel/manga immediately (especially since I've heard it's a VERY slow burn), but it was still a nice break from all the shounen anime I've been watching lately. some deeper moments of introspection.

Its,I feel,quite literally peak life,peak existence!A nice cute and comfy existence! good it feels to watch them. Its,I feel,quite literally peak life,peak existence!A nice cute and comfy existence!', 'Adachi and Shimamura\'s a tricky anime to evaluate for me.  This is the very first Girls Love anime that I tried and I wasn\'t sure how I\'d react to it.  I actually caught wind of this series when Amanda Lee, the VO for Shimamura, tweeted a clip of the series.  It didn\'t have anything super interesting in it, but for some reason, I decided to give it a try.Story: Adachi and Shimamura is the name of this anime, as well as the name of our two protagonists.  These are two truants who skipped class one day at the same time, though...we aren\'t really told why.  They both go to the gymnasium loft to kill time and quickly form a friendship.  As the story carries on, we slowly learn about how a relationship starts to develop.  Much of what we see actually happen is outside of their classes.  We see the pairing hang out and many of the interactions are actually really touching.  This includes places like Shimamura\'s house, the mall and a restaurant.  The anime focuses on our main couple and seeing if they can make a relationship work, despite some very obvious roadblocks along the way.People are going to give this anime a tough time because of how slow the story progresses and it\'s mostly understandable.  I usually welcome something like this in an anime where romance is the focal point.  I want to see the steps our characters take to get closer to each other, no matter how small.  That being said, this anime winds up being much too short for something with this slow a progression and I feel like that the negative reception could prevent this from getting another season.  Whether that happens due to the lukewarm reception is getting is up in the air - the track record of other girl-love series not getting another season such as Sakura Trick, Bloom Into You and Citrus really does it no favours.One thing that I thought was quite strong was the script.  The monologuing that frequently occurs with our two main characters get pretty deep and it lets us know what they\'re actually thinking, despite my annoyance how neither of them follow up with their actions.  It gets pretty deep at times and I really appreciate know all things because of the obvious hints on how these two feel about each other.My understanding is that the source material is still in circulation, so the studio does leave room for there to be more.  In fact, they somewhat imply it.  The ending was fairly unsatisfactory and that\'s the obvious downside to taking an anime so slow.  I hope there\'s more because it\'ll make the anime feel much more complete, but I\'m not sure the story in the first season will interest fans enough.  I\'d watch it, but I\'d hope some serious steps in the story would be taken if it continues because the relationship between Adachi and Shimamura feels like it was barely scratched, even when you consider it only ran twelve episodes. (7/10)Characters: Adachi\'s my favourite character in this series by a fairly large margin.  She knows what she wants, but she has a hard time letting people - particularly Shimamura - know that.  She\'s pretty introverted and she seems to need the right partner to bounce that off of.  The problem?  Her chemistry with Shimamura doesn\'t shine as much as I would have liked.  I internally kept cheering her on, but the anime seemed very focused on keeping their interactions fixed on very small pieces at a time.  It\'s still progression, but Adachi\'s so timid that it may not feel as such at times.  Shimamura, in stark contrast, is very outgoing and, unfortunately, pretty oblivious to how Adachi feels about her, despite the wealth of hints she gives her.  She\'s adventurous and is willing to go where her friends want her to.  Despite this, you can see she doesn\'t always want to be around just any classmates and I actually thought this was a pretty big deal because it ties our character together by another common theme.  The interactions between these two characters are touching at times, but I feel like we\'ll need another season before we see the ""bigger"" steps.  Shimamura is the kind of character that just goes about life as if it were nothing, and I can definitely see her meshing with Adachi, but she remains so dense that it makes it hard to see.As for side characters, the obvious first side character that everyone brings up is Yashiro.  She just... doesn\'t work for me.  I literally didn\'t want to see any scenes with her in it and I don\'t feel like she added enough that warrants her being here.  You see her interact with characters as the series goes on, but there\'s no reason we couldn\'t have seen more interesting side characters than her.  Nagafuji and Hino are two of Shimamura\'s friends and they\'re okay side characters for a school-based anime.  They don\'t get a ton of screen time, but they added enough that I wasn\'t seriously bothered by them.  They are two others I\'d like to see get more screen time in future seasons, should they happen.  Tarumi enters the picture pretty late and she\'s a decent character to add some minor drama to the series, just because of her past with Shimamura.  I feel like she\'s a character I\'d like long term because she\'s a little more of a mature take on the ""third person"" than Yashiro.  Both Adachi and Shimamura\'s mom also enter the picture in short spurts and I liked that they were pretty different from each other in ways that rub our characters the wrong way.  It shows the conflicting mother-daughter relationship that they have, and I wish more of that was dove into.Characters as a whole were decent.  I loved Adachi because I see a ton of potential in future seasons, should they come back to that.  But Yashiro was a very weak character here.  If I watch more, it\'ll more so be for Adachi.  Shimamura was fine, but her dense nature will bug fans.  She clearly knows she\'s missing something, but she never figures it out fully.  It feels almost like she needs that ""one"" step for her character to shine more.  (6/10)Art: Adachi and Shimamura has decent artwork going for it and pretty much at today\'s standards.  The characters looked awesome and I didn\'t notice anything terribly off with the rest. (7/10)Sound: This was another aspect that was fine.  The OST was solid with some more dramatic tracks that surprised me a little.  Amanda Lee (Shimamura) is easily the star of this show.  She\'s mostly known for her music works on YouTube and now, VTubing, but this is easily her best performance up until when this series aired.  Megan Shipman (Adachi) isn\'t an actress I\'m too familiar with, but she was barely a step down from Lee - she was great.  Voicing younger characters isn\'t easy, but Sarah Wiedenheft (Yashiro) pulls this one off quite well.  Sarah Williams (Hino) and Monica Rial (Nagafuji) were both also solid in limited screentime.  The cast generally did a really good job of what was asked of them, which is always good to see.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: An anime that decided to move as slow as this one deserves credit for trying and I\'d say I enjoyed those moments where they try and go for it.  I would likely watch this if more seasons were to get animated because I love who Adachi is, as a character, and I personally feel like I related to her personality quite well.  You\'d like to think Shimamura develops more as she learns about Adachi because it did feel like there should have been more of that in twelve episodes.  (7/10) we aren\'t really told why.

Nagafuji and Hino are two of Shimamura\'s friends and they\'re okay side characters for a school-based anime.  They don\'t get a ton of screen time, but they added enough that I wasn\'t seriously bothered by them.  They are two others I\'d like to see get more screen time in future seasons, should they happen.  Tarumi enters the picture pretty late and she\'s a decent character to add some minor drama to the series, just because of her past with Shimamura.  I feel like she\'s a character I\'d like long term because she\'s a little more of a mature take on the ""third person"" than Yashiro.  Both Adachi and Shimamura\'s mom also enter the picture in short spurts and I liked that they were pretty different from each other in ways that rub our characters the wrong way.  It shows the conflicting mother-daughter relationship that they have, and I wish more of that was dove into.Characters as a whole were decent.  I loved Adachi because I see a ton of potential in future seasons, should they come back to that.  But Yashiro was a very weak character here.  If I watch more, it\'ll more so be for Adachi.  Shimamura was fine, but her dense nature will bug fans.  She clearly knows she\'s missing something, but she never figures it out fully.  It feels almost like she needs that ""one"" step for her character to shine more.  (6/10)Art: Adachi and Shimamura has decent artwork going for it and pretty much at today\'s standards.  The characters looked awesome and I didn\'t notice anything terribly off with the rest. (7/10)Sound: This was another aspect that was fine.  The OST was solid with some more dramatic tracks that surprised me a little.  Amanda Lee (Shimamura) is easily the star of this show.  She\'s mostly known for her music works on YouTube and now, VTubing, but this is easily her best performance up until when this series aired.  Megan Shipman (Adachi) isn\'t an actress I\'m too familiar with, but she was barely a step down from Lee - she was great.  Voicing younger characters isn\'t easy, but Sarah Wiedenheft (Yashiro) pulls this one off quite well.  Sarah Williams (Hino) and Monica Rial (Nagafuji) were both also solid in limited screentime.  The cast generally did a really good job of what was asked of them, which is always good to see.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: An anime that decided to move as slow as this one deserves credit for trying and I\'d say I enjoyed those moments where they try and go for it.  I would likely watch this if more seasons were to get animated because I love who Adachi is, as a character, and I personally feel like I related to her personality quite well.  You\'d like to think Shimamura develops more as she learns about Adachi because it did feel like there should have been more of that in twelve episodes.  (7/10)', ""One of the best gl's to get an animation in a VERY long time, for anime-only's I'd recommend reading the light novel because this story is extremely investing.This anime portrays the day-to-day progression between the relationship of Adachi Sakura, and Hougetsu Shimamura. These two characters at first glance seem to be almost identical personalities wise, however, as Adachi begins seeing Shimamura in a different light, she changes. The development between these two characters (Specifically) Shimamura is incredible and definitely one of a kind. This series DEFINITELY has some of the most UNIQUE gl characters you will find. The pacing of the anime is also...great, you won't be sitting there wondering when this will happen, or that will happen, the ending also ties in directly to a potential second-season continuation Which WILL show even better character development. (read the light novel, u won't regret it.) and the side characters are literally the cherry on top, they have steady progression but they're not TOO involved to the point where the show is dang near focused on them. They're relevant, but they're not completely relevant to the point where they're stealing the spotlight. Overall I'd have to rate this a 10/10, my only complaint would be about the animation at some frames however, this is so minor that I don't even want to issue that as a complaint. Besides those frames everything else is beautiful and the world feels lively.Once again, read the light novel.

I just had to make an account to say that this is a wonderful anime and I'm glad to have seen it. The overall slow romance was actually enjoyable to watch because of the character's interaction with each other as well as the sort-of realistic mindset that they had that I can relate because I was also awkward and shy when I was young. Seeing Adachi overcome her weaknesses and Shimamura growing and realizing stuff before our eyes kept me hooked and rooting for...them. The ending was just perfect IMO. It got me all emotionally attached to both characters that I just had to re-watch the whole show immediately.

(SPOILERS)First off, the astronaut girl, I won\'t lie, i don\'t even remember her name that\'s how much i cared about...her but she was just an annoyance, i\'m not sure if they do anything with her character in the manga or in a possible season 2 but aside from the cute introduction she has, it felt so unneeded and pointless to include, not only that but also got in the way of adachi quite frequently which was just frustrating to watch in my opinion and made me wonder, what is the point of this character being here? The more i question the less it makes sense, it\'s not even like i have a problem with the fact she is possibly an alien or what her backstory is but it\'s more so what is she even building up to? It\'s almost as if they wanted to make her main character but is treated like a side character so you have this weird blend between the both which doesn\'t work well.Second is about Shimamura, I like Shimamura... Most of the time, I don\'t know why but the later episodes kinda got me a little annoyed at her because she was feeling alot more rude and mean, I understand she is probably going through alot and maybe it\'s explored more in the manga but I can\'t help but keep thinking that she has changed from the first few episodes and started acting more rude in general, I don\'t know, maybe i\'m reading too much into it but it really does feel like she is just being rude as shit for seemingly no reason.Lastly the ending, The ending is well to put it simply, lacking, i was saying the entire time when watching ""I hope she actually confesses or this doesn\'t just end with a kiss"" but not even that, it just ended with a cuddle and a talk about how they wont be at school forever, I understand if this is a thing because of making a second season however at the current moment where there isn\'t a second season, it\'s very underwhelming, I don\'t want to look at the manga because of spoilers however i\'ve seen comments of people saying they were disappointed that the anime cut short of adachi\'s confession as it was very close to where the anime ended, so i really do hope there is a second season because otherwise this ending is just kinda the same as the other episodes to be honest.but apart from those 3 complaints, i liked the anime and it was really cute. would recommend it if you\'re looking for a short cute rom anime :) her but she was just an annoyance, i\'m not sure if they do anything with her character in the manga or in a possible season 2 but aside from the cute introduction she has, it felt so unneeded and pointless to include, not only that but also got in the way of adachi quite frequently which was just frustrating to watch in my opinion and made me wonder, what is the point of this character being here?

The fact that it got like some kind of scene that shows an image of both of them loving each other from like kissing, etc. from the main character that liked the girl (which is the other main character too) made me always saying ""Ah, this is going to not be happened."" and yeah I was right. It didn\'t happened.I have spent 12 episodes watching this, hoping the main character would confess her, and the girl that got confessed would be her girlfriend and even made me saying ""PLEASE JUST TELL YOU LIKE HER IT\'S BEEN A YEAR ON THE HIGHSCHOOL."" and also ""OH SHE\'S FINALLY GOING TO CONFESS HER FEELINGS AW- WAIT WHAT?? SHE JUST CHANGED HER WORD INTO ANOTHER WORD THAT IS KINDA SOUND THE SAME AS \'I like you.\' BUT IN A DIFFERENT MEANING BECAUSE SHE\'S TOO SHY TO TALK ABOUT IT.""

It started off good with slowly setting up the environment around them as well as the two main character’s personalities. But it just seems as though nothing really happens. There are so many little details that are left unfinished or in the air. Why does a character feel this way? Does a character realize this way of thinking is not normal? Do they have any desire to curve their way of thinking? Also, one of the side characters, the little girl in the astronaut suit, was completely unnecessary. It would be different...if she had some sort of impact at the end or she made a character realize something about themselves throughout the season, but this is not the case. And how is there going to be another side-character yuri couple who completely outshine and steal the show from the main “couple”? There were many moments that were drawn out with no satisfactory or even suitable ending. But they did do a good job conveying the sort of anxiousness and nervousness that can be associated with liking someone, especially someone who can be your first crush of the same sex. This sort of epiphany and explosion of emotions can be very confusing and difficult to navigate.

All in all this makes the show more realistic and serious (which most anime lack nowadays).The show did spend slightly too much time on its side characters who were not interesting in the slightest compared to the main friend couple.

The problem with the story is that things happen because they are important dates or to create some drama, like the 3 random girls at second year or the childhood friend. It is just not that impresive.Art:...The best point of the series. The more fantasy escenarios during a speech are quite colorful and nice to see, but aside from those moments is just normal quality. Oh and the closure of the screen at the start and end of chapters is catchy, it doesn\'t add anything, but is neat.Sound: I kinda just didn\'t mind the soundtrack. The opening and ending are nice, but nowhere near something I\'ll remember. The ost I just forgor everything, but it also wasn\'t some bad tracks, so yeah.Character: I kinda just hate and weirdly relate to the two protagonists. Shimamura and the whole ""I just don\'t care about others and just accept people if they come to me"" is me during high school, but why does she not even call Adachi when she disapears from the school is still weird to me. Adachi on the other side just depends on Shimamura and if she is not there she is sad, but once again why she cannot just understand that a little girl (the alien girl) will be clingy or that shimamura has other friends and does cell phone calls with them is just toxic. Toxicity is what I can\'t like on their relationship. After them I kinda forget everyone, but the Hino was interesting for 3 minutes with her family problems.Enjoyment: I tend to watch anime on batches of 3-4 episodes per day, but with this one the last 8 chapters were tiresome and I had to force me to watch the 3 minimun, so it wasn\'t that fun to me. I have to point that the start was interesting, but well since chapter 5 it was slow.Overall: Idk if I have bad luck with yuri animes, but with this one and ""Citrus"" I just don\'t see light for this genre to me, But well is probably just bad luck and I have to search for one that matches to my liking.

It\'s a lot better than I expected.To be fair, I completely understand why a lot of people are not too hot about this brand of cliched, slow burn romance, but I think Adachi and Shimamura has a lot more redeeming qualities than people are willing to acknowledge. I find the way the actual romance is portrayed, with Adachi being unreasonably infatuated and awkward, and Shimamura kind of just going along with it without much thought is not that unrealistic or over the top. Adachi\'s relative isolation and lack of social skills, along...with slow realisation of her homosexuality would be a very anxiety-inducing mix for anyone. With no experience on dealing with such intense emotion, she becomes a bit of a tropy disaster-lesbian, but again, there\'s nothing in her behaviour I couldn\'t imagine a real person doing – it might not be particularly healthy how Shimamura dominates her thoughts, but that\'s just something for the story to work through.Shimamura, on the other hand, is a kind of person that was once very active and outgoing, and still manages to hold some friendships and blend in, but deep down is quite apathetic and aimless. She mostly goes with the flow, without much drive to put more than lowest necessary effort into things (and sometimes can\'t be bothered to even do that, which leads to her skipping classes and meeting Adachi). She accepts Adachi\'s attention without giving it much thought at first, and somewhat passively tolerates her awkward behaviour... But there\'s more to their interactions than that. The show very much shows that while Shimamura is slow to truly appreciate her friendship with Adachi and even slower to realize it can grow into something more (also because she doesn\'t think of herself highly enough to identify Adachi\'s clumsily-masked feelings), the girls draw out the best out of each other. It particularly applies to Adachi, who had literally nothing to look forward to in school and was just drowning in isolation, but they both receive something to work towards in this new relationship. It\'s a warm and hopeful story that goes beyond romantic cliches, but shows how people need each other to thrive.The show is also gorgeous and soothing, offering exactly what you\'d expect from an adaptation of such a high-profile yuri property. It also has some great attention to detail, like Shimamura\'s natural hair colour gradually showing up, or one of the friends getting tanned during summer vacation and being drawn with darker skin tone for a short while... Things you usually don\'t see in anime. Its main problems, apart from not everyone being into this kind of story, is likely the pacing and short nature of the adaptation. It would just need a few more episodes to keep the romance progression more balanced and deliver a more satisfying conclusion. As the show didn\'t exactly conquer the world, I don\'t think we\'ll see more anime from this franchise either... Still, I think both for yuri fans, and fans of cute romance stories in general, it\'s very much worth it.Edit: Oh, and the secondary yuri couple, who are the old friends of Shimamura, is really cute.

It had me after the first episodeIn fact after the first 4 episodes I would have given this an 8, but in the 5th episode which I just watched, there wasn\'t much new development. We get to hear Shimamura\'s thought process, as well as Adachi\'s as usual, but there are...no heart pounding moments like in the previous episodes, which do a good job on tugging at your emotions and the suspense of their ""forbidden love"" so to speak lolI like this anime bc again it touches on subject matter that isn\'t so politically correct, and does it in a way with creative abandon. I\'ve said this before but I feel that in Western media, even if ""taboo"" subject matter is being covered they do it in a way where they still kind of neuter it and put a damper on it, and don\'t fully dive into the complexities, and what isn\'t socially acceptable for the time.For example the prevalence of gay relationships in shows recently in the West is bc of an overall trend in media and society promoting that acceptance, however we still dont get shows about incest or other topics which are still not socially acceptable, like you get in anime.That was a bit of a tangent, but what I\'m getting at is I feel like this show somehow exemplifies a more realistic approach and take on a gay/yuri relationship.The conflicting thoughts in Adachi\'s head show more realism to me than what you usually get in western media, where gay character attributes are almost always stretched to the limit and exaggerated. Yes that obviously exists but alot of the time its a lot more subtle like depicted in this.Adachi\'s character comes off relatable bc of this and really gets you engaged and caring about the storyStory: 7It\'s good bc there\'s not too much going on for now, which provides a great backbone for their developing relationship.

Then the story gradually loses balance and becomes about a one-sided, obsessive and unrequited puppy-dog infatuation of one girl for another who doesn't seem to care much about anything but herself.Sounds familiar?

Spoiler of the original plot (its ending, yeah), so consider not readingA common reason I cannot rate any of the GLs animes I\'ve watched an 8, not because I hate this genre (opposite actually, I\'m a big fan), but because they\'re adaptations that fall short of my expectations, or to put it another way, I like the original too much that the animes disappoint me.(""Brief"" review of the original work:In the case of ""Adachi and Shimamura"", I love the novel. It is quite a slow-burnt and gentle series. The two...main characters give off a chill, wholesome vibe. The selling point of this novel, in my opinion, is the way the author delved deep into the psychological realm, the chains of thought of the characters, to deepen our understanding of the character, which ultimately made me come to sympathize with them and like them. The comedic timing of Iruma is priceless; this series sent me rolling on the floor for quite some times. Up until recently, in the latest volume 10, most conflicts have been resolved, and (spoiler) they ended up being together (end of spoiler. Anyway, what other outcome do you expect). The story is not chronological, with some time skips and alternate universe stuff. Yes, that damn alien Yashiro is annoying at first, I feel that reading some first couple of chapters, but after that not so much, I can assure you when her existence actually feels romantic and meaningful later on. The character development is solid, feels natural for me.And the illustrations from Non (who were also the illustratior of Chūnibyō demo Koi ga Shitai!) add to the enjoyment too. Look at my profile pic, that’s Shimamura. (Cute). There\'re alongside tons of sugar in form of words and picture that can make me get a Type 2 diabetes. Never bored with CGDCT.Shimamura is depicted as an airhead on the outside, with realistic and pessimistic contemplation going round in her head. She, once a carefree and energetic child, is now a person who find social interaction bothersome, wanting to keep a distance from others and trying to conceal her true thoughts. She realized Adachi definitely have special feelings for her from very early. For those who says she doesn\'t know, no, she\'s just pretending not to, very clearly so. This girl Shima throughout the LN is very ambiguous and hesitant to label her feelings, she\'s the embodiment of ""quite, maybe, somewhat, to some extent, in some way, not particular, you can say that way, I guess, etc etc"", sheesh. It\'s only until the recent chapter does she become more assertive and not beating around the bush or showing apathy. Though does not feel the same feelings and have no idea how and why people love (yet), she truly care for Adachi as her friend.Adachi is quite the opposite, her emotions are written right on her face for Shimamura to read and joke about, always act like a social freak (at first), acts awkwardly as a love-sick person and utterly conscious of her action. Behind that awkward girl is an ""unnormal"" family. She has no father, and her mother just kind of gave up caring for her emotionally since she was a child. Though she does dream of “various stuffs” about Shimamura, the story do not focus on those thoughts but rather her efforts to become Shimamura most important one. Yeah, I gotta admit she\'s way too clingy and jealous most of the time, but it\'s not like Shima and Ada herself aren\'t aware of that. This issue along with communication ones are addressed later into the story, well, you can totally read forward.)Now finally talk about the anime.The art: 7. Ok. But not quite my type. Just feel very frilly and unremarkable, so to me it\'s kinda off. A very different feel from the LN. I like the LN and manga better in this aspect. I like to imagine this anime is done by KyoAni, then the art and story will fit perfectly. But for KyoAni to adapt something like this, it\'s only in my dreams.Voice acting: 7. Ok, they did quite nice, but I don\'t think Itou-san is the best for Shimamura of all the female VA they can think of. Like, I seriously cannot get Tsurumaki Kokoro out of my head watching any characters voiced by her. I imagine Shimamura to have a slow and laid-back speaking demeanor with a low and husky tone, considering how much of an air-head and a sleeper she is.Music: 5. Average, OP and ED do not have any impression on me. Feel like watching a third-rate 2000s anime. Oh no, I feel like everything of this anime is third-rate though.Story: 2. Oh boi, I think this is where they land a knockout on me. Too fast paced but not as interesting as half of the LN, what do I even expect from a 12-ep show. Adachi lines and fantasies are sometimes too cringy I have to facepalm. Shimamura DOES do the thinking part but I feel like it was done half-hearted (all the inner thoughts of both of them are actually). After all, much thinking and little doing style of the origianl story doesn\'t really suit an anime; so it\'s inevitable it\'d turn out like this when not carefully handled. The story of the side characters are just some fan-service here and it is even more interesting than the main one. But in general, it\'s really a pain seeing my beloved story being ""butchered"".God, is the anime really that bad or just because I set the standard too high? Don’t know. It is still high in someone’s list. Lemme just go and continue with the next chap of LN. main characters give off a chill, wholesome vibe.

Oh boi, I think this is where they land a knockout on me. Too fast paced but not as interesting as half of the LN, what do I even expect from a 12-ep show. Adachi lines and fantasies are sometimes too cringy I have to facepalm. Shimamura DOES do the thinking part but I feel like it was done half-hearted (all the inner thoughts of both of them are actually). After all, much thinking and little doing style of the origianl story doesn\'t really suit an anime; so it\'s inevitable it\'d turn out like this when not carefully handled. The story of the side characters are just some fan-service here and it is even more interesting than the main one. But in general, it\'s really a pain seeing my beloved story being ""butchered"".God, is the anime really that bad or just because I set the standard too high? Don’t know. It is still high in someone’s list. Lemme just go and continue with the next chap of LN.', 'I think a good review is a short but informative review that doesn\'t have too many spoilers. But this may not be a good review by those standards I set. You see, I\'m mainly sharing my feelings about it, which in this case requires a few spoilers. Because of that, if you haven\'t seen it yet, you may want to skip this review.I know the general idea of a ""review"" is to help people who haven\'t seen it determine if they want to, but I\'m not reviewing this to promote or demote the anime. I\'m reviewing my feelings after having seen it, so for that...reason the format of this review is different, and I\'m stating that so those who want a more traditional review will not have to be disappointed by reading mine.This will be my first review for 2 reasons. 1) I have only recently decided to start contributing to anime reviews. And 2) because it happens to be the most recent anime I was watching upon making this decision. Seeing as I just finished it, and my feelings are still fresh on the subject, here seems as good of a place as any to begin.I like a wide variety of anime, though I can be particular about what I do and don\'t like in any given genre. I was in the mood to watch a ""Girl Love"" anime, and went looking for one that didn\'t seem like shameless fan-service. I wanted adorable characters and real feeling. This one has both of those things. Though I feel those features decorate a Slice-of-Life sort of element that wasn\'t among the tags of ""Girl Love"" and ""Romance"".(( This is where my review actually begins. ))It started off sweet enough, mostly in Shimamura\'s (long blonde hair) perspective. A somewhat social girl who starts skipping class, and meets a quiet not so social girl Adachi (shorter dark hair) whom often skips class. The two slowly start becoming friends, and from Shimamura\'s perspective in the beginning, she seems to place a higher value on Adachi being around, and wanting to be with her. Saying to herself that she\'s sad when Adachi isn\'t around. It seems that they\'re growing closer. But then the main perspective seems to switch to Adachi, and the story changes too. Adachi had been having feelings for Shimamura, while Shimamura suddenly starts taking their bond less seriously than she had in the beginning. Where at the start, Shimamura would go to places she seen Adachi hoping to see her, later Shimamura stops going to Adachi, and even goes days without checking on her. To me it just seemed like Shimamura\'s behavior towards Adachi changed. Becoming a little colder. The anime even briefly addresses Shimamura\'s not taking care of such things, and being the type to let things go. So what I signed up for was romance, but was I got seemed more like a story of unrequited love. With Adachi helplessly in love with Shimamura, and battling fear of rejection and hanging on her every action, while Shimamura seems completely unaware of Adachi\'s feelings, and thinks of her as a little sister.Adachi is a relatable character. She\'s a little awkward due to her shyness, and really sweet. I spent the anime rooting for her, and hoping she\'d get a measure of happiness to keep her in a good place. If that happens, I don\'t know. The anime ends before that.12 episodes of a one-way romance where the season ends before there is any kind of closure on anything really. I may have to check out the manga to see what happens next as it\'s 2023 by the time of this review, and I\'ve not seen any mention yet of a second season.I don\'t enjoy stories of unrequited love. I guess if there is eventually a pay off somewhere down the line then it will have been worth it. But unfinished it\'s a little sad. This anime will be cute, sweet, and pull on your heart strings gradually throughout the season. But the moment you are waiting for does not arrive. I know this is a tactic to get people back for another season, or to bring interest to the manga, though it\'s also something I don\'t enjoy. Following the carrot on the stick and just running into a wall at the end.The story telling is good. The animation is decent. The side characters are interesting and/or cute which is their only real purpose I think inbetween little developments with Adachi and Shimamura. I do understand of course that in real life, there are often situations of unrequited love, and that such things can\'t be helped if someone can\'t find the right way to show it, or if both involved simply do not feel the same way. Which is why I think a Slice of Life tag would be appropriate here, given this is also a relatable situation.As I\'m only reviewing the first season, I can\'t very well check to see what happens in the manga yet and let that change my impression of just watching the anime alone. I do not regret watching this anime. I enjoyed more about it than I didn\'t. I both don\'t want to go through that roller coaster of watching it again, but at the same time I think that I may revisit the anime again after some time and subject myself to the ups and downs Adachi faces for her. Her character is very sweet and enduring. I\'m giving this anime a score of 8. It isn\'t what I signed up for, and though I sort of expected to be lead around by the carrot on a stick with no reward at the end, I would have rather seen it than not in the end. I hope it gets another season someday, and I hope Adachi gets back some of the love that\'s bursting out of her heart. reason the format of this review is different, and I\'m stating that so those who want a more traditional review will not have to be disappointed by reading mine.This will be my first review for 2 reasons. 1) I have only recently decided to start contributing to anime reviews.

There is no real development between the two characters but rather a repition of the same thoughts, feelings and actions of the two main figures every episode again and again. It\'s a phenomenon I have seen in many slice of life-ish kinds of anime and it gets tiring.Story and Characters - 3/10:Adachi and Shimamura both don\'t really like to go to school. One day they randomly meet on the upper floor of the sports hall where they tend to spend their time when they skip their...classes and have since became friends. From the early beginning on, Adachi puts Shimamura on a pedestral and it\'s very clear that she has feelings for her. She only wants to spend time with her, at best alone, whenever possible. Sometimes a random loli astronaut girl comes around and disturbs their alone time (this loli character has no further meaning in the show besides that, she is literally only annoying). Over the season Adachi will struggle to express her feelings and after the 5 episodes I watched she was not able to get any closer to Shimamura apart from casually meeting up with her again and again without any real development happening between the two. The more annoying part is Shimamura. I couldn\'t quite distinguish whether or not1. She is too naive to realise that Adachi is very clearly into her2. She knows very well that Adachi is into her and teases her (there were like 1 - 2 scenes were I really thought that this was the case, 2 scenes later Shimamura seemed naive again)3. She doesn\'t want to realise that Adachi is into her because it\'s shown multiple times that she is scared of ruining the relationships with her friendsIf reason 3 = true, then this would actually be a very valid reason to have barely any progress from Shimamura\'s side in her relationship with Adachi, however since Shimamura is naive in all kinds of directions it is quite hard to believe that this is actually the reason for her behaviour.Art & Animation - 7/10:Visually the anime looks quite good and it manages to capture all the small little ""romantic"" moments between the two, just that there are too many of them and that way they loose their meaning for the viewer. It just happens too often.Soundtrack - 6/10:The soundtrack is more on a basic side, nothing to be considered a banger, however it manages to underline the scenes very well.Enjoyment - 3/10:No development, no buildup to a romantic climax, too many small little romantic moments (that are all taken platonically by Shimamura in the end) so that they loose their emotional value for the viewer, the same things are being thought, said and done episode after episode made me quit this anime earlier than I wanted to. classes and have since became friends.

If I have anything to say to anyone who wants to start this series I would definitely say get...ready for a lot of changes throughout the series with not only the characters but the series as a whole.overall I would give this anime a 7 because as I said it did have a couple holes that were left unanswered but still a great watch! ready for a lot of changes throughout the series with not only the characters but the series as a whole.overall I would give this anime a 7 because as I said it did have a couple holes that were left unanswered but still a great watch!"", ""it was cute but not really what i was hoping for.

It's very hard to come across a GL that has a good story that has nothing to do with JUST school life and the fetishized relationship. I have to say this is not the worst i have seen with gl but it's not...the best.

I remember watching this a long time ago and not really understanding it (EDIT: I just watched the last episode and I'm still confused).I can see why, it's only a small fraction of a 9 part light novel series I'm sure is still running. So it brings up the question as to why they adapted this novel instead of a shorter one. Maybe because it was popular?Either way, in the beginning it just feels like Adachi looming over Shimamura without any real climax, near the end though it just gets plain weird.I didn't realise that they...put in the bath scene from the light novels, arguably one of the worst scenes ever, into the anime. The hospital scene of Adachi and Shimamura if you will. When I tell you I yelled at my screen when I saw that, it was just plain disturbing. It was not needed in any way, seeing Adachi's disturbing fantasy outlines how weird this and the creators are.At the end it still feels one sided and creepy to me. Obviously many relationships are one sided and it can be a good thing to have it represented in an anime, but they don't really do much with this except making Adachi more and more clingy and borderline toxic.The art is okay, I see that they're replicating Hitoma's art style which is common among many anime. Personally I'm not a fan of Hitoma's art style, I much prefer the manga artist: Moke Yuzuhara's interpretation of the two. I also find that their eyes are off? Surely someone could have picked that up.The English dub is not the best. I've been watching anime in dub a lot more recently and I checked it out of curiosity, I was not pleasantly surprised. Shimamura's voice is missing the care free tone and is squeaky, though that's the only voice that I'm not pleased with.I do like the character's personalities. Mainly Shimamura as the other seem to lack depth. Though, it is based off of a first person novel about two people who know basically nothing about the others surrounding them so depth may be hard to write in that case.Shimamura has always been an interesting character to me. (Did I mention I read a few of the novels?) and her disinterest in those around her make her an intriguing person to learn more about.Adachi changed completely from not giving a damn about anyone to all over Shimamura very quickly. It was over a span of a few months I believe but it isn't really illustrated that way. To me, all Adachi's character is awkward, creepy, clingy, and just non stop Shimamura which gets annoying fast.In hindsight this anime is not as good as I remembered, just by looking at the last episode alone I can see how out of hand this got. It went from two girls meeting at the top of the gym to 'Omg I want Shimamura to bathe me' and Shimamura calling herself 'Big sis' in reference to Adachi, which is my least favourite trope in the Yuri genre.This was written by a man and I feel like I can sense it. put in the bath scene from the light novels, arguably one of the worst scenes ever, into the anime.

The impression I had of the two main characters was... well, bad... but then I remembered they\'re supposed to be teens on their first romantic adventure, and it all made sense.If they were two adult women, I\'d be put off by how utterly childish they both prove to be, but since they\'re kids, well, for them to be childish and inexperienced suddenly makes a lot more sense.Hougetsu Shimamura. This...girl... honestly creeps me out. Some of her lines (""if she disappeared, I\'d just forget about her in 3 days""... wow, you go girl...?) and attitudes would warrant her a place on a spectrum of some kind. She simply doesn\'t show to care about anyone or anything at all - she just kinda exists, but she\'s relatively emotionless and unfazed most of the time.Girl, what went wrong in your childhood? Ah, right...Sakura Adachi. She\'s been accused of being toxic and obsessively jealous. Well, that\'s unfair. She\'s just profoundly insecure and in need of affection - there\'s a fine line, but she never actively crosses it into ""problematic behavior"" territory (aka. being forceful, manipulative, or aggressive), so I don\'t see how that critique holds any water. Indeed, she, too, is quite antisocial - no friends, no will to study or do anything UNLESS Shimamura is involved. If Shimamura is passive, Adachi is actively passive: she ""builds"" the situation, she carries Shimamura, but ultimately, she wants to be carried by her, and Shimamura (sometimes) graciously seconds her.There are some hints of development by the end of the season, but not enough to talk about a full character development. And that\'s fine - people don\'t change this quickly, not even at that age. But then why am I giving this a 9? Because, from a psychological point of view, the character presentation is top-notch, I believe. It\'s a realistic, contrived portrayal of a not-more-than-friendship quasi-unhealthy relationship. They\'re complex, 3-dimensional characters, with HUGE flaws and little virtues, and I enjoyed watching their (clumsy but sometimes satisfying) interactions. girl... honestly creeps me out.

Yep, Adachi to Shimamura is pretty much your average cookie cutter yuri anime. Nothing too interesting about the characters or the story. The girls are cute, the scenes look nice, just kinda average. I will say the art style looks lovely and some of the more dramatic scenes look pretty decent! Other than that, there's nothing phenomenal about this show, but it's also not complete garbage either.Also like most shoujo-ai anime, the ending leaves a lot to the imagination. A...little disappointing, but what can you expect?If you're looking for a cute yuri anime, I'd probably recommend searching for something better, but if you still need more, give it a watch! It's not THAT bad I guess lol little disappointing, but what can you expect?If you're looking for a cute yuri anime, I'd probably recommend searching for something better, but if you still need more, give it a watch! It's not THAT bad I guess lol"", 'Disclaimer: English is not my first language!This was a fucking waste of time, complitely.First of all I wanna say that I am a great lover of romcoms, it\'s my favourite genre; so when I saw the cover art of this anime I was fascinated, it was truly original and beautiful. So I clicked it and read the plot, I was a little bit disappointed because it was a Yuri, but ""well"" I thought ""let\'s give it a try"".The starting was ok, there were the good premises for a good story, but oh boy I was wrong. Quickly I began to think that the main characters...were full of shit and that the story simply wasn\'t a story! Nothing was happening, literally nothing. The last two episodes have been a true nightmare, I just wanted to finish it and never think about it again. I really regret not dropping it immediately, but once I was at 6/7th episode it was too late and my completionist brain would struggle.Anyways at the end of the party this is what I think: the creators wanted to make a cute Yuri story were there is the depressed girl and the strong but dead inside girl, they were supposed to get along and complete each other. Well that was what they wanted to do, however what it ended up to be was a looot different: Adachi came up to be a lonely psychopath, she isin a morbid search for attention and love, as soon as she find someone not brave enough to kick her in the ass, she gets stuck with him/her and doesn\'t let go. Shimamura is a true piece of shit, not only she doesn\'t care about Adachi (that\'s not the bad thing, I didn\'t care about that blob too), actually she doesn\'t care about anything, just sitting there leaving her meaningless life. I hated her so much, even when Adachi was clearly struggling because of her shyness, she\'d always nor give a fuck or laughing in her face or giving stupid ass answers, how in the world can you be such an asshole?So please listen to me, in this show nothing happens, the starting situation is the same as the ending, there is nor character nor story progression, just two dumb girls annoying the spectator. Don\'t waste your time, watch eromanga sensei instead were full of shit and that the story simply wasn\'t a story! Nothing was happening, literally nothing.

Unfortunately, there is still a distinction between the genres and actual LGBTQIA+ representation which is why some of the titles just feel very underwhelming. There are of course very good titles that deal with romances in a satisfactory way: the classic Utena, the symbolism ridden YuriKuma or the newer generation, Bloom Into You. And then there is the second category which depicts couples with just enough chemistry and longing for the fans to give...something to get invested in, while bringing up the good ol’ anime no homo rule “we are both girls so this doesn’t mean anything (romantic)”. While I felt that Adachi and Shimamura had an interesting set up that could have made it special I felt they also ended up falling into the second category with a lackluster execution and somewhat harmful dynamics. Let me explain in detail, spoilers ahead.Adachi and Shimamura are not very similar but they have one thing in common: after entering high school they both realized they didn’t care much for it. Adachi is a loner with no friends and instead of attending classes she spends her days hiding at the PE classroom’s upstairs room. Shimamura is not really interested in her classmates or studying so one day when she skips classes she accidentally stumbles upon Adachi’s hiding spot. The two start to share the place when they are skipping classes and slowly a companionship starts to develop.As the two grow closer they motivate each other to do better at school and start to wonder what their relationship means to them. While Adachi is shocked by her realization that she wants to have a more intimate relationship with Shimamura, the other wonders if she will spend her days alone once Adachi leaves her life or if she even needs anyone to be by her side. The romance in the anime is very one sided, with Adachi putting in the effort to ask Shimamura out for romance coded events (spending Christmas together, Valentines) and Shimamura half-heartedly agreeing. The fact that Shimamura insists on calling and treating Adachi like her little sister makes the dynamic feel a bit creepy after a while.I felt that while Adachi made progress on her own, figuring out what she wants from Shimamura and asking for it, Shimamura lacked a lot in this sense. She spends a lot of time thinking how bored she is among other people, and after a while starts to think how she prefers Adachi’s company to others but still remains in a very passive state. She never seeks out Adachi on her own which is a rather big red flag even in friendships. Both of them think of their dynamic as Adachi following Shimamura along like a puppy and waiting for when she pays her any attention and that is not a really healthy thing.In the second half, Adachi’s fears come true and Shimamura makes new friends. Adachi literally runs away, instead of trying to socialize or even see if Shimamura invites her to join the group. Shimamura never actually seeks her out, despite thinking how boring the others are and wondering what Adachi is doing. I felt that this could have served as a great time to progress their dynamic, with Shimamura proving Adachi’s fears are not real. Instead, we have Adachi coming to clamor for her attention once again, and Shimamura agreeing half heartedly. She didn’t say to Adachi anything about the new friends she madenand she never spoke to them after. There is even a scene where Adachi speaks up about how the only friend she has is Shimamura, which in it self is nothing wrong but the fact that they joke about her being possessive and Adachi getting sulky after she learns Shimamura has other people to talk to is what makes it feel rather creepy.In the end I didn’t feel like the conclusion really leaves us at a better point than where we started. Adachi kept getting jealous of other people’s relationships, of others who talked to Shimamura - all stemming from the issue that she feels so insecure about her place next to Shimamura. And Shimamura while admitting to herself that she likes spending time with Adachi, still ends up saying that she will settle for this relationship for the time being, which I don’t have to say is how unhealthy. Kids, don’t settle for friendships or relationships, it never works out.The setting itself is a normal slice of life story and it focuses mainly on the internal thoughts of our two main characters. While this flow of thought can work well in light novels and even in manga, I felt it was a bit overdone in the anime and sometimes took away from the significance of certain scenes. While it is great to hear what they are thinking when you hear both a conversation going on and the characters internal thoughts at the same time, it can get confusing and takes away from the scene’s importance. I also felt that often the thoughts the kids have about the human desire to socialize, loneliness and companionship sounds like something a 30 year old depressed adult would say - which again is nothing wrong in itself, but sounds rather unbelievable coming from teenagers.The supporting characters were forgettable, albeit with more balanced dynamics. A supposed couple who were not dating officially but held Valentines together and sleepovers, which was cute but only seemed to act as a fuel for Adachi’s jealousy on what she was missing out on. We also had some distant family members, Adachi’s mom left a rather strong impression with how neglective she was. And we also had a glowing haired 800year old alien loli who I suspected to be symbolic but couldn’t wrap my head around if it really served a purpose.I hear that this is based on a light novel, so things could progress there in a more satisfactory way given that the anime was only twelve episodes, but ultimately I felt a bit disappointed with how this ended. something to get invested in, while bringing up the good ol’ anime no homo rule “we are both girls so this doesn’t mean anything (romantic)”.

Adachi and Shimamura were two girls in middle school/high school with completely different life experiences who had found eachother because of their propensity for skipping class. As the show progressed, it was pretty clear to me that the show was taking on the too-common slow burn that every straight and queer anime does, and I very quickly lost interest. There are 3 plots throughout the entire story: Adachi and Shimamura’s budding romance, Nagafuji and Hino’s strange relationship that has progressed since they were little,...going so far as to kiss one another’s foreheads, and lastly, Yashiro—our spaceman turned cute girl with glowing hair? Adachi and Shimamura get so far as to go on a date on Christmas, but only one of our girls knows it’s a date. Nagafuji and Hino are “best friends” with no outlying motive. Yashiro is an alien?? It’s not clear throughout the 12 episodes because I think they were trying to stretch it out to a multi-season show, but it came out in Fall 2020, so I’m not sure if it’s been picked up for another, and even if it is, it let me down after the first 6 episodes and I don’t think I’m interested in the second season. I had a lot of high hopes for this show because the only other gl show I’ve gotten to in the past was Citrus, and that show has a lot of issues in its main characters. Citrus is more interesting and just better than this show. The animation is pretty at times and boring at others, the introduction and closing songs were forgettable, and it’s sad to say but the show didn’t go anywhere.

I appreciate the series for showing and expressing the characters through their inner monologue; however, there wasn't much depth to why Adachi fell for Shimamura. It stems from a possessive mentality that questioned whether I was to root for her. On a positive note, Adachi's feelings for Shimamura brought in possibilities of subtle character development.The supporting characters...and childhood friend were just there.

But i was disappointed. Sure it gave me a few laughs, but every episode never failed to give me cringe or me saying ""what the f?""It\'s kinda too immature and childish. And the two characters are in 1st year junior (Japan...school system). So i at least wouldn\'t expect it to be THAT childish. The characters are even straight up plain, they weren\'t that interesting enough to the point where you couldn\'t relate nor sympathize with either of them. The other protagonist is too clingy and possessive for her crush, HER CRUSH! They\'re on that stage still and yet her character is portrayed as that. And the other character is straight up dense, oblivious and seem to just not care about anything. The relationship of the two main characters IS TOXIC AS HELL, even at that stage of ""forming a crush"" still.This story is not good for the audience, specially kids who will be watching this.

𝐒𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝this anime is a GL and I\'m not homophobic about that kind of stuff in fact i honestly don\'t care. I would of dropped this anime but at the time i didn\'t think it was okay to drop anime at all at the time. Every anime i gave a 2 on my mal would of been a one but this had to be below it, if i could i would of given this anime a negative rating.Half the things make no sense at all,first of the creators called it a slice of life...so why was there an alien kid whose hair glows? I think they tried making her cute/funny by making her like sweets and talk weird but to me she was just a nuisance.Secondly, the relationship between the main characters seems so off, like how are they such good friends the only thing that they both relate to is ditching class and most of the time things are just sexualised, if one of the roles was a guy he would instantly be called a pervert. The anime constantly made everything inappropriate and it honestly should of been an ecchi, i would of stayed away from it then.Third, how the hell is Shimamura so dense its so obvious Adachi likes her but she acts like noting happened, Adachi literally put a empty can of water in her room on display because Shimamura bought it for her. Adachi is kind of creepy ngl like why does she bring up the most inappropriate things at the worst timing like why talk about her crushes thighs? She is obsessed with Shimamura in a sexual way and its disgusting.Fourth. the animation, everything in the anime is visually stunning like how the characters eyes and hair looks even the food looked ok, BUT WHY THE HELL WHERE THERE SO MANY BATH SCENES AND UNDERWEAR CLOSE UPS WTF if someone said they watched it for ""the plot"" I\'m calling the cops that just terrifyingIf you read this and still decide to watch it good luck trying to get past the first episode and you are very stupid. so why was there an alien kid whose hair glows?

In the domain of non-politically related plots, realistic means mediocre or further, dull. The heroines talk and think about the same things in each of the 12 episodes, but no fundamental difference is made. In the end, it seems that nothing do occur. The heroines literally do nothing for their romance. The plot is only flavorless water; the climax is hot water, which is hot but still flavorless.Compared to the dull plot,...the animation is good, but this does not necessarily mean this anime is good.

Dirty Pair OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4200/Dirty_Pair_OVA,"[""Overall/Enjoyment:Not bad. Not great. Pretty average. Your enjoyment may vary depending on your age, when you see/seen this, and your tolerance for older anime. This OVA has absolutely no continuity, so you can literally watch the episodes in any order and it won't matter. You may or may not like this aspect; I personally prefer a strong central plot.Story:There was nothing inherently wrong with the stories told here. After each one I would want to see another, not because they were particularly good, but I think more so because each one left me feeling perpetually unfulfilled. The stories are just little adventures that never really...add up to anything. So they're mildly entertaining in of themselves, but always left me wanting. Also, most of the fights are cartoon army style where thousands of shots fly by, or the enemies can be shooting at almost point blank, and everything but the target gets hit.Characters:Same as the story, or maybe because of it, nothing really develops here either. The characters are neither particularly annoying, nor particularly memorable. Everyone but the main two characters are practically cameos. Even then you still only get a vague idea of the main characters personalities.Art:The art was fine, I suppose. Nothing that stood out but pretty standard for the period, I believe.Sound:I listened to about an episode and a half of the dubbing, and that was enough for me to conclude that this was some of the least enthusiastic voice acting I've heard. Neither the themes nor background music stood out to me. add up to anything. So they're mildly entertaining in of themselves, but always left me wanting.

Doraemon Movie 06: Nobita no Little Star Wars,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2669/Doraemon_Movie_06__Nobita_no_Little_Star_Wars,"[""Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Little Space War continues the trend of Doraemon movies always having extremely interested premises executed in the most basic way possible. This time around, the gang meet a tiny alien who is fleeing a war back home so they are called in to action to help. Probably my favourite portion of this movie was the opening sequence, as it featured a mix of film references to keep it interesting including Star Wars, E.T., King Kong and even the MGM intro. I found this to be an especially delightful way to open the movie and to pay respect to the key sources...of inspiration for the film, as upon watching you will soon realise that it is essentially an amalgamation of all of those films in to one. I also appreciated that the story felt more cohesive from start to finish this time around, as Papi is introduced very early on and the alien/space war remains integral to every scene. However, as usual the film falters in the second half, offering little originality to keep the movie fresh as it goes on. Instead, it returns to the safe adventure and action that has defined the majority of the Doraemon films so far. This far into the series, I would expect one knows if they are a Doraemon fan or not and this film will certainly appease those looking for another fun Doraemon adventure, but it ultimately does not deliver a satisfying experience for anyone searching for anything more than that. of inspiration for the film, as upon watching you will soon realise that it is essentially an amalgamation of all of those films in to one.

Even though the premise didn't immediately grab me, this film has a lot going for it in my book. For starters, it is one of the few in which Suneo gets a prominent role, not only in plot relevance but also in character focus. Given that he can often come across as the least sympathetic and most neglected of the main characters, that's a very welcome development.Shizuka also has some...good scenes here, despite getting forced into the damsel-in-distress role at one point. She is quickly rescued and remains an active participant in the story afterward, so I suppose I can let that slide. In fact, one of my other favorite elements of this movie is that Shizuka and Suneo share several scenes together, which is a very rarely-seen dynamic in the franchise.The villains of this film may not be the most powerful among those that Doraemon and friends have faced, but they're probably some of the most threatening. They see through or circumvent nearly every strategy that the heroes come up with, and in the end are only defeated through circumstances that they couldn't have predicted. That, however, brings me to the main weakness of this movie...Throughout the story, tension is maintained by the fact that the main characters have shrunk themselves down using Doraemon's Small Light, which gets stolen by the villains. As shown in the final battle, the Lilliputian aliens are barely a threat when the Earthlings are at their normal size. Therefore, the protagonists' primary goal for much of the film is to retrieve the Small Light so they can reverse the shrinking effect. That may sound reasonable enough, but it completely ignores the fact that Doraemon also owns a Big Light (with the power to enlarge objects, if the name didn't give that away), which should have readily solved this problem.To be fair, this is a common issue with Doraemon films. For almost every time the main characters are supposedly in some kind of crisis, dedicated Doraemon fans can probably name a gadget that could have resolved the situation. However, this example stands out in particular, because the Big Light is a gadget that makes regular appearances in the franchise (including in the previous movie!). If one can look past this apparent oversight, however, I think there's more to like about this movie than not. good scenes here, despite getting forced into the damsel-in-distress role at one point.

He's very judgemental, but with the judgement comes very funny scenes.Episode 5 is about En's misnomer of a Masquerade Ball, which is instead a tribal dance of sorts to pay tribute to devils.

I love the world and anytime they give us any new information on characters, the culture, and hell even their bedrooms I get super excited! This special gave me all of that!  The audience gets to see short bits that widen our perspective on their world and let us in on festivals, pictures, dialogue we may not have ever recieved in the series.

These are not plot-advancing stories, but rather ways to explore the Dorohedoro world and its characters in a lighthearted way.The most disappointing thing about the OVA is that it isn't fully animated. I'm sure the cost for fully animating something like this is pretty high compared to the possible return on investment, so I can't say they made a bad decision, but it is distracting that these shorts are, essentially, a parade of still images.About half the shorts feel like they give some tangible texture to the world and...its characters—the one featuring Nikaidou and how she got started in her restaurant especially stands out—while the other half are cute little concepts that are fun for their five-or-so minute duration and then leave the mind (Ebisu trying to get her photo taken).It's very disposable, even with the world/character texture, but for those who've watched through the first season, it's a nice little treat to wind down with, hence the fairly good score for something that is otherwise basically meaningless. its characters—the one featuring Nikaidou and how she got started in her restaurant especially stands out—while the other half are cute little concepts that are fun for their five-or-so minute duration and then leave the mind (Ebisu trying to get her photo taken).It's very disposable, even with the world/character texture, but for those who've watched through the first season, it's a nice little treat to wind down with, hence the fairly good score for something that is otherwise basically meaningless."", 'What makes this OVA fun for the fans is its execution which is somewhat akin to the original series. It blends action and comedy, but doesn\'t have an actual plot. It\'s more or less a collection of individual short stories involving characters from the anime, and somehow has the charm anyone who loved the show will embrace. However, the animation style can be off-putting for certain people, because it\'s not done like the show. It\'s done in a stop-motion style, which worked for me as I found it different from the traditional animation. Given it\'s a ""compilation"" that lasts only 26 minutes with the credits,...you won\'t be bored for a second. It\'ll end pretty quick, leaving you with a desire to see more of it, and that can be easily attributed to the fantastic overall execution. But if you are to see it, do watch the show first. Without doing that, you won\'t get why certain characters behave that way and why does an OVA combining mostly unconnected stories works for those who have seen the show. you won\'t be bored for a second.

Fei Ren Zai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37292/Fei_Ren_Zai,"['Short anime series tend to try new things there where full length tv series are too afraid to, and moreover, shorts more consistently succeed at these attempts than any other anime format.Intro:Fei Ren Zai is a Chinese anime series produced by the most famous Chinese backer/funder Tencent Penguin Pictures, whose most famous anime to this date is King\'s Avatar. Typical to Chinese production, Fei Ren Zai promotes Chinese culture - which I have found also typically to be rather uninteresting excuse for content. However, Fei Ren Zai focuses on older folklore that shares similarities with other Asian cultures, such as Japan\'s, and this idea...alone seems more interesting than, let\'s say, the recent Netflix release \'Flavors of Youth\'.Story:Super simple setup. 5 minute long episodes that center around the daily life of mythical creatures, deities and demi-gods who live in modern society in the human form, or a form that mildly reminds humans. The entire series consists of around 1 minute-long gags that show us fractions of the daily lives of our main characters. These follow the overall story line in a manner that makes the overall structure seem closer to continuity than episodic.The events vary greatly from our characters building snowmen in winter scenery to office parties and character specific problems that can only be solved with the help of friends. Most of the events are rather cute and heartwarming while the atmosphere is consistently comforting. That\'s pretty much the only noteworthy side of the story, and those who don\'t find this to sound interesting at all, most likely won\'t find any beauty from it.Characters:The anime is filled with bunch of original characters. We have dog and rabbit persons who form this 2cute4this world romance because apparently, dogs tend to chase rabbits for the reason that they love them. There is also a dude whose stomach is an ocean and a guy who doesn\'t have a head so instead, has eyeballs in the place of nipples. The real main character is a ninetailed fox much like seen in Naruto and the video game Okami. She, like everyone else, is based to real creatures from old folklore.The core feature behind every character is, of course, their shapeshifting ability because otherwise they wouldn\'t look/resemble humans. One of the strongest part of the series is how damn cute and happy everyone in it, is.Sounds:The series being so short, not much music was produced for it. The opening and ending songs are the most visible tracks, and both so good I skipped them not once. These are rather uplifting, traditional Chinese music. Catchy stuff that serves the overall atmosphere of the show itself.Typically, I find Chinese language dubs to be annoying as I don\'t like how the tongue sounds, and moreover, can\'t tell if the subtitles are accurate in any way or form. This time, I didn\'t have much problems with the voice acting. Ideally, there would be Japanese dubs to this, but I find it unlikely to happen due to the nature of  the series. Moreover, it was officially subbed in Japanese already.Art:Best for last, they say. Art is the main reason why the originality lacking anime industry produces so many shows that are not memorable the least. Fei Ren Zai offers uniqueness and simplicity that I cannot but appreciate. Rather than looking like an anime, the series reminds me of an indie game which has been produced under love and care, polishing those things that matter and can be polished.Our characters are the same color as the backgrounds. Mainly, their figures has been separated from the backgrounds with simple outlines. Yet, things like their hair remain never still, but instead, always showing movement and life. The color pallet is subdued and almost tender. Practically every color contains shades of grey in soft and patient sense. ""Less is more"" is a sentence I say to myself every day. Fei Ren Zai\'s art truly gives glory to this philosophy.Conclusion:The entire series is around an hour long as of currently. More is rumored to be released. There is not much you can lose by giving it a go. Not everyone will find the series so beautiful as I did, but those who especially seek beauty, should check it out. alone seems more interesting than, let\'s say, the recent Netflix release \'Flavors of Youth\'.Story:Super simple setup. 5 minute long episodes that center around the daily life of mythical creatures, deities and demi-gods who live in modern society in the human form, or a form that mildly reminds humans.

This time, I didn\'t have much problems with the voice acting. Ideally, there would be Japanese dubs to this, but I find it unlikely to happen due to the nature of  the series. Moreover, it was officially subbed in Japanese already.Art:Best for last, they say. Art is the main reason why the originality lacking anime industry produces so many shows that are not memorable the least. Fei Ren Zai offers uniqueness and simplicity that I cannot but appreciate. Rather than looking like an anime, the series reminds me of an indie game which has been produced under love and care, polishing those things that matter and can be polished.Our characters are the same color as the backgrounds. Mainly, their figures has been separated from the backgrounds with simple outlines. Yet, things like their hair remain never still, but instead, always showing movement and life. The color pallet is subdued and almost tender. Practically every color contains shades of grey in soft and patient sense. ""Less is more"" is a sentence I say to myself every day. Fei Ren Zai\'s art truly gives glory to this philosophy.Conclusion:The entire series is around an hour long as of currently. More is rumored to be released. There is not much you can lose by giving it a go. Not everyone will find the series so beautiful as I did, but those who especially seek beauty, should check it out.', ""I originally found this donghua to help me while I was learning Chinese but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's heavily based on Chinese deities and tales with a modern twist which I found really enjoyable. Episodes are short (around 5 minutes long) so each story is small and refreshing but follows the same overall storyline. The animation style is very cute too. I think donghua gets compared to anime a lot but this show is very different in art style and storyline. Chinese humour also isn't that straight forward and often the English translate struggles to capture the meaning of a joke, someone without...knowledge of the history you may struggle to understand some things.Overall I think this show is really refreshing and would be good to watch if you have some knowledge about the Chinese language or tales. My only downside is that the episodes are too short. knowledge of the history you may struggle to understand some things.Overall I think this show is really refreshing and would be good to watch if you have some knowledge about the Chinese language or tales. My only downside is that the episodes are too short."", 'Fun and imaginative, this show has been a joy to watch. A bold but unassuming spin on ancient tales, Fei Ren Zai is a paragon of opposites: it merges tradition with modernity, features a minimalistic art style and palette but also one of the smoothest animation you may ever find, and is brief but feels so full of content that you’ll want to come back for more. I myself was hooked on this show for a long time.I believe that Fei Ren Zai is one of the better slice-of-life shows you can get. No banality, no weird fan service (yay for once) - just pure...silliness and creativity. This is truly a show for everyone, and I highly recommend this. silliness and creativity. This is truly a show for everyone, and I highly recommend this.', ""I love this donghua very much. It respects Chinese culture and portrays it accurately - providing famous Chinese mythology into a modern world. It's a slice of life that honestly put me off guard at first, but then I got used to seeing traditional figures such as Ao Lie and Nezha in Fei Ren Zai.The animation style is a bit lacking, but I can't blame them - they probably had a budget for this show. Each character was fun and enjoyable. It's really not something to take seriously.Only unfortunate aspect is that some westerners may not understand the full context/backstory of these characters....However, if you like typical comedy-slice of life, this is for you!

Guilty Crown: Kiseki - Reassortment,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12419/Guilty_Crown__Kiseki_-_Reassortment,"[""I won't bother putting in the synopsis for both the original Guilty Crown anime and this, uh, 'summary' of the first eleven episodes, as it can be easily read from the Guilty Crown anime listing.Like the review before this, the overall rating I've given for Kiseki is based purely upon sound and art, which doesn't really differ from the main anime, as it's all taken out of the main anime anyway. The animation and soundtrack alone are warrant a recommendation for the actual 22 episode Guilty Crown anime, which can be enjoyed even if you don't find the story or the characters overly that interesting....Unless, you're like me, and did find both extremely enjoyable parts of the anime, then it totally just becomes kick-ass.So this attempt of a summation is, at best, only really worth viewing if you  want a really quick recap after not having seen the first half in a long time, or if haven't seen the first eleven episodes. And even then, it shouldn't even be considered as a substitute; it only makes watching this confusing, as opposed to just frustrating.Even after viewing Kiseki, the summation that they decided to leave you with is extremely short-handed in the sense that you probably won't understand the main story, most of the more minor, but equally important, parts of the story have been left out in order to cram it all in under an hour. To save yourself the confusion, and to experience the awesomeness that is Guilty Crown, I highly suggest just watching the eleven episodes.Coming from a biased viewpoint, where I thoroughly enjoyed Guilty Crown, it would make sense that I would recommend the actual anime either way, and of course I do. But even then, when I suggest not to watch this, it's not just because the recap doesn't do the anime justice, it's just really that terrible.TL;DR: If you feel as if you can't sit through the first episodes, whether it be for the first time, or as a refresher, then it does it's job at putting across the bare essential knowledge from the first half. My suggestion, however, is just to watch the first half again. Unless, you're like me, and did find both extremely enjoyable parts of the anime, then it totally just becomes kick-ass.So this attempt of a summation is, at best, only really worth viewing if you  want a really quick recap after not having seen the first half in a long time, or if haven't seen the first eleven episodes.

I have a large problem with Kiseki, because Guilty Crown is my favorite anime. The issue is that Guilty Crown is a 22 episode long anime with lots of character development, great art, an absolutely phenomenal score, and a very interesting and compelling storyline. Kiseki brings only some of what makes Guilty Crown such a great anime to the table. By condensing the storyline, you lose out on soooo much information, making it difficult to comprehend and thereby making the enjoyment...much lower.By shortening this, it all seems really all over the place and you don't really understand what's happening unless you've seen the anime, sometimes completely removing gigantic plot elements and leaving you in the dark and wondering what in the heck is going on. Kiseki tries to combat this with a narrative, but in the end that tells you very little and slightly breaks immersion. The narrative is not only an odd design choice, but it LIES to you, claiming things that, if you had seen the actual anime, you would instantly realize as wrong.Kiseki is also a waste of time for the art reasons. Even if you are a huge fan of GC like I am, do not watch this. Just watch the actual anime. The scenes they used are copy and pasted from the original piece, and therefore invalidates Kiseki as a potential way of entertaining yourself even more.Kiseki completely omits even saying some characters NAMES for the longest of times. Some of these characters being very important, sometimes pivotal, such as Ayase. You wont be able to understand why a character is important or even what they're doing unless you had seen the original.I give Kiseki a four out of ten for great animation and sound ALONE, because the storyline is non-existent. I can see no reason to watch Kiseki, because if you're actually interested in the anime, you could and should watch the whole thing for free on Hulu, or just buy the dvd.

Hatenkou Yuugi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3298/Hatenkou_Yuugi,"[""Overall I think this anime deserves an 8.5 on my scale, but unfortunately there isn't that option.Story: The story itself is fairly basic, but has some interesting back story thrown in every once in a while. However, the anime does seem rushed. I think a lot of people did not give this show a chance because the beginning is so chaotic. The first episode does not feel like an introduction at all, in fact you are pretty much thrown into the story.Art: I really enjoyed the animation. It seemed to be well done (it better for being 10 episodes). Maybe, it is the...little girl in me, but I appreciated that they changed the main characters clothes and hair throughout the show.Sound: Characters voices were fitting. The music throughout the show was very nice and enjoyable. Originally, I didn't like the intro song but it grew on me.Character: This is one of my favorite things about this show, but at the same time could've been better. Rahzel, the main character, was AWESOME. She had a great back story, was interesting, kicked butt and was everything I wanted her to be. However, the other characters could've been so much more. I really saw potential for interesting characters and there were definitely moments, but I think the anime just didn't flesh it out well.Enjoyment: Basically this show just captured me and kept me hostage. There is such a great mixture of humor, action, and friendship/love that I kept thinking &quot;I'm going to rate this a 9!&quot; I couldn't justify that high of a score overall, but the enjoyment level was definitely a 9. little girl in me, but I appreciated that they changed the main characters clothes and hair throughout the show.Sound: Characters voices were fitting.

It aired between the 4th of January and the 7th of march, 2008.The genres include: Comedy, Adventure, Drama.StoryHatenkou Yuugi begins pretty randomly, but with a lot of promise. The young woman Rahzel is thrown out of her home by her dad, because he wants her to travel and see the world. She quickly finds two traveling companions, Alzeid and Baroqueheat, and together travel from place to place, helping out people with different problems. Sounds good? Sure does, but during episodes you sometimes experience these random comedy moments that destroy the...series (I say sometimes, but in some episodes, there are like 10 minutes wasted on horrible time-fills like these). Sometimes they're so bad I actually laugh at them, but usually they're just failed attempts at making the series more enjoyable. The series did pick up pace, but way too late to affect this score.AnimationThis series has beautiful character designs. Every character is detailed and nicely drawn. The thing that fails though, is the fact that sometimes the movement looks awkward (a character cheering will only move his/her arm and the rest of the body just stays still, like a mannequin), wasting the good designs. If you take a look at the backgrounds, they're all nicely drawn, and look good. Too bad that the quality drops loads of times and negatively affect the series.SoundThe far best aspect of the series. The voice actors did a great job in this series. Since you can't really rely on body language in this series, the VA's all helped. Especially the voice actors for Rahzel(Kobayashi Sanae) and Alzeid(Sakurai Takahiro) were the best of the bunch. The OP and ED were both very good and fitting of the series, and one of my favorite voice actors(Koyasu Takehito) had a guest role.CharacterThe only interesting characters are the main trio, Rahzel, Alzeid and Baroqueheat. Other than that, you just have a lot of characters, simply used as plot-devices, and even though there's only just three main characters, they hardly get any development, except for the occasional hints of romance. Though I have to admit, that the main trio are all good characters.EnjoymentI'll be honest, I did not enjoy this series very much. Only 3 out of 10 episodes were good, and the rest were boring or worse. As I said earlier, there are many totally random events during the series. Sure, I like randomness, as long as it's kept to a certain level, but since these random events n-e-v-e-r have anything to do with the actual story going on, they're just stupid and unnecessary.Overall: 6/10I will not recommend this series to anyone. Do yourself a favor, and stay away from this, unless that you really like the things I hated with this series.I hope you found my review helpful, and if you didn't, please tell me why, so I can improve myself until next time. series (I say sometimes, but in some episodes, there are like 10 minutes wasted on horrible time-fills like these).

I think the word random is overused when describing many shows but this show is random -  random in a funny and fun way, but random none the less. Yes, I know the reading the manga would probably make it less random but that itsn't the point.What the MAL description fails to convey is that the show is really just ten episodes of following a  trio of dysfunctional people on a journey.  It definitely suffers from a lack of plot, but it redeems itself because dysfunctional people on a...semi-random journey can be really funny (the reason I stuck with it and suggest you do as well).The journey has some vauge goals like revenge or finding something, but the goals are not the focus of the show - not that there is a focus to it aside from the before mentioned journey and the people who are on it. The themes of the episodes are to repetitive - just variations on Rahzel seeing and child in need and saving him/her with the help of Alzeid and Heat again and again and again. The story is poorly developed and ends up being disjointed - partly because it is so episodic. Many good shows are episodic in nature, but in this one the individual episodes rarely connected to each other at all and there is no transition between them e.g. random.This lack of buildup leaves the show with very little tension and almost no climax. Major parts of the story are never explained (for example how or why people can use magic is never addressed), although I assume the manga which I haven't read contains more detailed explanations. The show proceeds as if there is no gaping hole and you have the needed information to understand what's going on which makes it rather confusing at points. Several times I was left wondering either what the heck is going on or why on earth would this be happening.The characters are amusing if not not well developed, and their banter will keep you laughing. Rahzel comes dangerously close to just being annoying -privileged 14 year old girl need I say more (?), but stays on the likable side by a small margin. Alzeid is a pretty great character, and really adds to the humor. The dialog is pretty fast paced and witty which is the biggest redeeming quality of the show. The lack of charter development is a little problematic, but somehow it mostly makes them seem disgruntled which adds to the humor of the show.The people introduced in each episode mostly do not have any real connection to the main characters and are only occasionally used to illuminate something about the main characters past, so in the end you have a random assortment of people who have not contributed to the plot. You find out very little about the main charters' pasts or even why they are traveling together which is kind of ridiculous.As far as the art and music is concerned it's nothing special but overall not bad. The character designs are fairly generic and a little goofy. The op and ed are pretty bad.While the lack of explanation and development of the plot (if you want to argue there is one) can be frustrating, I still enjoyed the show mainly for its humor and wit.

Just a kooky father essentially kicking Rahzel from her home to go experience the world.Rahzel is a child who by unfortunate means had to grow up very quickly and has an unusual arsenal of unique talents (magic and so forth). Her troubled past left her with a very mature outlook on life and yet still a child like optimism that keeps her and her soon companions on an never ending upward momentum.

Okay the animation and sound value of this anime are pretty standard and have appeal, but after that you would probably think that ""then again, there are thousands of other animes that suck with the same standard of drawing.""Please for the love of God, watch something else. Hell even Pokemon is better than this. Unless you are a masochist who loves to be tortured, by all means go ahead you sick pervert. LOL JKOverall 1/10, why? Because someone out there will say ""It wasn\'t that bad,"" but then I provide rebuttal with, ""yeah, but you only say that because it wasn\'t that good."" The only redeeming qualities is the fact that this anime has a plot appeal to certain types of people (God knows I\'m not one. Sorry people, I\'m not going to lie to myself.)', 'If you\'re in the mood to settle for less, this is the anime for you!Because this may very well be the most generic anime i\'ve ever seen.It doesn\'t feel like any emotion was put into the creation of this series, it feels like it was made to fill a time slot, by people who had to use every cliche in the book to make up 24 minutes of content.I felt like I\'d already seen the premise to every episode of this show done better in Fullmetal Alchemist. While I understand that it\'s hard to make an episodic series without taking ideas from different places, none...of the characters were likable enough to take my mind off of how lackluster the writing seemed.Pretty much every character has a really grating and stupid sense of humor, the kind of quirky shit that you only hear when you\'re watching something that thinks it\'s really funny but is NOT (ex:""ur stupid"" ""wat?!? i am not stupid my precious kawaii-chan!!!""). Not to mention the fact that they flip from thinking the others are stupid and annoying to TREASURING OUR PRECIOUS FRIENDSHIP whenever the plot calls for it, which is about once or twice every 2 episodes.Take Cowboy Bebop for a better example. They did plenty of ""homages"" that were pretty much ripoffs of other stories, but they had style! and characters that you could think of as people, and not just anime characters.The biggest issue I have with this show other than the annoying characters is the pseudo-philosophy that the girl spouts near the end of most episodes. The main girl speaks wisely about the emptiness of revenge and the importance of friendship, but it\'s all the same shit we\'ve heard in every other shounen anime on the planet, so it only results in climaxes that are almost as lame as the fucking jokes.The difference between this and something like Gintama is that Gintama, for one, is actually FUNNY, and manages to bring some life into these stereotypes by giving the characters that espouse them actual compelling reasons to, and bringing them out during developed story arcs, instead of just SAYING them because they might as wellIn short, you\'ll only like Hatenkou Yuugi if it\'s one of your very first anime and you\'re 12 years old. Even then, you should probably just stick with Gintama or anything else I name dropped in this review. of the characters were likable enough to take my mind off of how lackluster the writing seemed.Pretty much every character has a really grating and stupid sense of humor, the kind of quirky shit that you only hear when you\'re watching something that thinks it\'s really funny but is NOT (ex:""ur stupid"" ""wat?!? i am not stupid my precious kawaii-chan!!!"").

In the end, instead of feeling satisfied with the conclusion, i was left with more questions. The series ends as if theres a sequel that will resolve some problems concerning two of the main characters and introduce a character that popped out a quite a bit, seemed important to the anime, but in the end was never introduced. Unfortunately, there is no sequel. Also, thanks to that character that popped out alot, it felt as if there were two seperate storylines. While one of the storyline was obvious, the other was hinted everytime that...certain character came out.So yeah, I really liked it, mainly because the characters were great, but I hated being left with questions. certain character came out.So yeah, I really liked it, mainly because the characters were great, but I hated being left with questions.', ""Sometimes you end up watching an anime just because you have nothing else to do or watch. This was my case: I knew nothing about Hatenkou Yuugi, and just downloaded it out of boredom.What a delightful surprise.The story has, well, a lot of plot holes. That said, the plot is really involving and the tales told on every episode are very nice. However, there's a lack of interation between the stories and a second season would definitely be needed.The art is regular, and so is the animation. But there's an interesting sense of character design here: the clothing is never overly dramatic, and changes regularly....It seems refreshing on an adventure / fantasy series, as most are taken by over the top, never changing dressing.The instrumental soundtrack is not really interesting, although not being bad either. However, the OP and ED themes (Heartbreaking Romance and 手の中の永遠) feel quite appropriated, and the insert song Take You As You Are really shone on the series finale, making the scenes memorable.The characters, at a first impression, seem like a group of walking clichés. While Baroqueheat stays with little development through the series, one soon realizes that Alzeid and Rahzel raise out of what they look like first. This applies mostly to Rahzel: while most anime girls with similar personalities tend to fall either into being a irritating tsundere or into trying too hard to be bold, she really shines through the series with a real looking confidence and sense of independence, while keeping her flaws and frailties.Overall, Hatenkou Yuugi is a really great watch. It's not perfect, and don't market itself as being. We might never get to the destination (and, actually, we barely know what is the driving for each chracter), but it sure is enjoying to see how that weird, haphazard trio will get there.

However, when I started watching this series I was sorely disappointed. The first episode lacked character introduction. Baroqueheat just pops up out of nowhere and Rahzel already knows him. As a viewer I was confused about how that had come to know eachother. And the second episode contained many flashbacks to things that should have been shown in the first episode when Razhel and Alzeid were in the restaurant. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt the need to on...this occasion because the manga is so much better than this anime. I found this to be a disappointment. this occasion because the manga is so much better than this anime. I found this to be a disappointment."", ""I’d had some interest in Hatenkou Yuugi for a while now, but I never thought I’d get this into it. I decided to download the anime about a year ago, which was surprisingly short, but amazing. You never thought you’d hear this from the person who hates horror. Children getting sacrificed for experiments, people slitting their throats, husbands killing their wives… I never thought I’d like that. But I did. OK, not the gruesome parts, but I loved the action, and the interactions between the characters. The three colorful characters, Rahzel, Alzeid, and Barouqueheat.Hatenkou Yuugi is about three people traveling together across a land where...magic exists. There’s Baroqueheat, a brawny guy who has a crush on Rahzel, Alzeid, an albino man looking for revenge, and of course, Rahzel, who changes Alzeid’s entire life with one sentence.“I will turn your life upside-down, and make your boring life super exciting! Bang!” Rahzel forms a pistol with her hands and smiles at Alzeid, a stranger she meets in the ally, who’s extorting money from a man.One of the things that was odd in the anime was that Baroqueheat just suddenly appeared. He didn’t get an entrance like Alzeid, which tells how they meet. He’s just suddenly on the roof of the inn Rahzel’s staying at, and on top of that, talking to her! Stalker~Another bad thing about this anime is that it didn’t last long enough! There were many things left open! Who’s this guy attacking somebody with the voice of Hiro Hirono from ef: A Fairy Tale of Two? I want to know, and the manga is already licensed as Dazzle. It’s got to be translated wrong. I mean, Hatenkou Yuugi means “Descending Game”, or something like that. How the crap did they get Dazzle?!The art. It was very, very cheap. I've seen a lot of anime, and I can tell that this coloring was thrown together at the last minute. It reminded me of old Pokemon episodes. Just by seeing the anime was 10 episodes after 11 volumes (at the time of release), starting in 1999(LOOONG), it was obviously given a very shitty budget.Well, the music. The OST was pretty good, it went a certain way… More towards the dark side. Where the chocolate milk and cookies lie~ However, the remixes of Heartbreaking Romance and Take You as You Are were very pretty. I especially liked “Take You As You Are: Battle Version”. The opening, Heartbreaking Romance, was good, but it didn’t catch my ear like some songs. A previous song of Itou Kanako, the singer of Heartbreaking Romance, called “Kimi to Yozora to Sakamichi to”, which was the ending to the Myself; Yourself anime, was absolutely amazing, so great that I kind of wished that they put it as the opening. But it might sound too sad and not hopeful to put as the opening. Off topic~ The ending song, Te no Naka no Eien, was very beautiful, and the singer’s voice was very solid and crystal clear. I really liked it. But once again, the song didn’t catch my ear, but did catch it more than the opening.However, the ending really ended with a “Bang!” as Rahzel would say it, which was her last line. She repeated her line to Alzeid.“I will turn your life upside-down, and make your boring life super exciting! Bang!” This line kind of made tears come to my eyes. It really made it feel like they would be together forever, and it made me happy that Alzeid went after her. I wish my first love said those same words to me when I was forced to leave. Aw crud, so sad, oh well. An anime review is no time to be talking about this.In the end, the music by Itou Kanako, called Take You as You Are, was very touching and brought tears to my eyes (does anything not?!). It felt like it related with unconfident girls (like my self), who are sad because they are never seen for who they are, and no one will accept them for who they are. It gave some hope in my heart, somehow. I hope a new season will be aired, and I hope to see more of Rahzel and Alzeid, maybe a romantic relationship in the next season? Please?

Is better, as it were. The anime skipped an enormous amount of very key details, leaving chunks missing from the plot and changing some very nice points. They appear to have basically just cut out most of the ""filler"" stuff, but since plot development happened in many of those ""fillers"", the anime wound up rushed and incomplete and lacking a great deal of not only humor(of which there was a LOT) but a lot of the truly dark elements. The bright colors of the anime, though technically fitting to the plot, also gave a rather different...feel than the truth behind the anime, which, while certainly not a horror, is far from the ""magical girl"" feel it occasionally gives off.Rahzel is still delightful of course, and I always adore a tough girl who isn\'t mopey. And they seem to have tried really hard to keep a lot of the humor, but overall--well, I wouldn\'t watch it again. They left out some of my favorite characters even, and while it was fun, it wasn\'t something that left a lasting impression. If you\'re interested in the plot, I\'d suggest reading the manga. Though the anime is almost bland(though not boring), the manga is definitely worth a read. And, to set something straight--this manga/anime is not targeted at 14-year-old girls, unless they are quite mature ones who enjoy a lot of blood and mayhem with their manga.Oh but, to continue with the anime--it\'s not NOT worth a watch.

This is an anime that you go to if you want to waste three or so hours of your life and not feel too bad afterwards.Harsh as that sounds, let me say upfront that I do want to recommend this anime. Maybe because of their budgeting or whatever, but this anime chooses its battles very wisely. In the first half (episodes 1-4) the anime introduces its characters haphazardly and its cliche plots even more haphazardly. As such, the anime comes off as satirical and...self-depreciating without actually aiming to be a parody (like Gintama). That satire, paired with the characters\' hurried introduction and banter, gives the anime humor where none should be.The second half of the anime (episodes 5-10) has a drastically different format from the first: two episodes make up one convoluted story, while the following episode--sometimes painfully--is unrelated to it and given a lighter tone. We are granted more insight about the characters, but not much. In fact, I was mistaken about one of the characters\' relationship in the beginning until  more clarification is given in later episodes.The reason why that\'s important is because Hatenkou Yuugi thrives in simplicity. The simpler the story, the wittier the story is allowed to be. For how rushed the characters were in the beginning, we\'re given a superficial view of their relationship and thus are at least able to follow along. For the more convoluted episodes later on, it becomes terribly obvious how crammed and ill-paced the story is, even going as far as to skip transitional scenes that could have made it emotionally impactful.There\'s also the ending, which...I really shouldn\'t have expected a decent ending from an anime with only 10 episodes. Just like its opening, it ends as hurried as it starts, and even worse, it introduces characters and plot points that will never be expanded on. I feel strongly encouraged to read the manga, but from what I\'ve seen from some JP fans on the newest and concluding volume, it might be better to stick with the anime, weaknesses and all.Conclusion: With all that said, Hatenkou Yuugi was an extremely enjoyable watch. Its shining points is definitely the main characters, their (ambiguously polygamous-but-not-quite) relationship, and the anime\'s self-depreciation. Each character, while filling a certain ""trope"", has little specks here and there that might keep your interest.

I always enjoy a historical anime, so I planned to watch it immediately after I heard about it.Each episode is comprised of the three main characters helping someone out on their journey. The stories are very different and keep you hooked. One thing I enjoyed especially about this show is that it isn't afraid to be dark; sometimes everything doesn't go perfectly and things turn out unexpectedly. My one complaint regarding the episode layout was that the characters are not clearly introduced in the first episode; the second man who joins them, Baroqueheat, simply seems to appear out...of nowhere. After I re-watched that episode, I could recognize him helping out Rahzel, but it still doesn't explain how he joined them and is extremely confusing to a person who had never seen the show before, but after episode one, the story is flawless.The art is not anything too out of the ordinary, but it is pretty good. One thing to note are Rahzel's outfits, which change each episode and are always interesting and unique.The characters are where this anime truly shines. They are truly unique and endearing. Rahzel doesn't play the damsel-in-distress and is resourceful and absolutely hilarious. She views the world differently and is always optimistic even in dismal situations. Her relationships with the two men are wonderful, and they are loyal to each other throughout the series.Hatenkou Yuugi is extremely unique. The stories are complex and entertaining and you will find yourself laughing at odd moments. The characters are interesting and it is impossible to find their equals.

If you read the manga then the anime will seem way off base and all over the place though. I highly recommend reading the manga after watching this not before though.

Junkers Come Here,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1116/Junkers_Come_Here,"['Every now and then we come across an anime, that maybe nobody has ever heard of--but it really is a lot of fun to watch. Well ""Junkers Come Here"" is a perfect example of such a title.Story: 9/10This title does a great job of mixing drama and slice of life into one story, with a little bit of supernatural fun thrown in for good measure! The plot revolves around a young grade school girl named ""Hiromi"" and her dog ""Junkers."" Now Hiromi is the prime example of a bottled up child! Her parents are never around much, she doesn’t have many friends at school, and...worse, she has a crush on someone she knows she can never have. Though the beginning of the film deals pretty much in the daily life of a sixth grader, a big chunk of the plot revolves around Hiromi\'s inner turmoil in her life, and sticks very close to it’s ""drama"" aspects mid way through. So if you’re not into having a good number of sad moments to go with your movies, then you probably won’t care for this one. However if you do like them, then there is no better movie out there to pick up. Now that\'s not to say there are no happy parts to this title of course, because there are a good number of them. In fact for the first half hour or so of the movie, it gears strongly to an everyday slice of life theme, and at this point you may be unsure as to where the story is even going. As the plot progresses though you’ll see little threads be weaved together to make a truly engrossing storyline. Where not all is as it seems (ie Junkers). The finale to this movie is quite well done, and becomes quite magical near the end. It is so charming and well put together that I honestly felt I was watching a Miyazaki quality film. It\'s the kind of movie that you can tell was made with love, and the writers really went all out to make the story as believable as possible, without over doing it with the supernatural elements. And merge the two like bread and butter!Animation: 8/10Well this is a movie that was made back in 1994, even so it doesn\'t look the highest of movie quality for even back then. The backgrounds look like an unfinished coloring book at times, and can come off as quite washed out. Where this movie really wins points on though, is with it\'s character animation and design! The character\'s themselves kind of look like a simplified version of ""Kiki\'s Delivery Service."" They are complimented with good emotional facial expressions, and move with very good fluidity! So if you can get past the sometimes bland looking backgrounds, you will enjoy the art style. I do have one question for the animators: was it REALLY necessary to draw Junker\'s groin area?! Ugh!Sound: 8/10What caught my attention most with the soundtrack, was not the actual character voices (though they are very well done), but with the actual sound effects. They sounded so real; from the opening of doors, to footsteps going upstairs, to the sound of cars passing by. All of it sounds so crisp and realistic. And the character voice were very fitting to each of their roles! You get a nice lite hearted song towards the end that matches the movie to a ""T."" The weakest link in the audio was the actual background music, it sounds very ""mid-chip."" It sometimes felt like it was being played on a Casio Keyboard, which at times came off as odd.Characters: 9/10The cast of characters they offer are so down to earth and real, that they perfectly bring the emotion they want you to feel. By the half way point I really cared for Hiromi, and wanted her to be happy in the end. Now at this point I feel I should talk about the ""supernatural"" elements to this. Enter Junkers the dog; oh but this is no ordinary dog mind you, for this dog can actually talk! In fact at the very beginning of the movie, you will see Junkers go into one of the men’s restroom, and actually use the urinal! O_o Now this actually turned out to be my biggest complaint with the movie, in that it was never actually explained as to just how Junkers could talk in the first place, nor does the plot actually revolve around him. At times he almost feels like a prop in the movie, and only seems to be there (most of the time anyway) as a comfort tool for Hiromi. I also felt the connection between them not of the highest caliber for a movie, but what they do have together is indeed quite strong and touching. Even the supporting cast is very likable, and I couldn\'t find one that came off as exaggerated or out of place.Overall: 9/10This movie really was a well put together project, you get a good range of genres (slice of life, drama, supernatural, comedy), everything that makes a well put together movie. If the idea of a ""lite hearted and cute Miyazaki style film"" sounds wonderful to you, then I highly recommend checking this title out. The heavier drama moments might kill some of the enjoyment for some, and it won\'t appeal to everyone. It is however, a movie I feel everyone should at least try! worse, she has a crush on someone she knows she can never have. Though the beginning of the film deals pretty much in the daily life of a sixth grader, a big chunk of the plot revolves around Hiromi\'s inner turmoil in her life, and sticks very close to it’s ""drama"" aspects mid way through. So if you’re not into having a good number of sad moments to go with your movies, then you probably won’t care for this one. However if you do like them, then there is no better movie out there to pick up. Now that\'s not to say there are no happy parts to this title of course, because there are a good number of them.

While the story it tells is typical, the writing, soundwork, and pacing of the scenes demonstrate mastery of craft. While neither being a dramatic film nor a comedy, Junkers manages to constantly deliver scenes which are wholeheartedly funny, moving, and entertaining. The characters and story deliberately avoid feeling artificial, and even with the inclusion of a talking dog, the movie's universe feels...completely like our own.Movie gems like this are the reason I keep watching anime.

This is an anime for everyone that has sat alone at an empty table eating microwaved dinners night after lonesome night.  This is an anime for all the people that grew up in broken families, where stony silences and frigid stares were the main means of communicating. And this, sadly, is an anime for me, someone who spent the majority of his childhood, desperately trying to reconcile two hostile parents that couldn't stand to be in the same room as one another. I too spent many late nights waiting to hear that car...pull into the driveway or that key rattle in the lock. It's the reason I was drawn to reviewing this anime, because the anime resonated with me on a personal level. I'm also reviewing this anime with the hope that my words will influence a few readers to give this film a chance. It's closing in on its 20th anniversary, it's won awards for best animated film, and yet still fewer than 1000 people have completed it on MAL.Story: (8/10) Now I hope I didn't discourage anyone with my introduction. Even those that can't relate to the opening will still be touched by this remarkably poignant and moving film. Both slice of life and drama, this story tells the tale of a young girl named Hiromi and her pet dog, Junkers. With her grandmother recently deceased, her mother working deep into the night, her father constantly away on business, and a lack of friends at school, Hiromi finds herself struggling with loneliness and a feeling of abandonment.  Junkers is her only constant companion, and we quickly learn that Junkers is no ordinary dog... Junkers can talk! When people hear talking dog, instantly they pigeon hole the film as a kiddy movie, but this film tackles serious and difficult issues. Divorce, abandonment, sacrifice, and being true to oneself are each explored in this surprisingly emotional story. Importantly though, the film manages to avoid falling into the trap of being melodramatic. The drama is never overblown to the point where it becomes unrealistic.Characters: (9/10) Hiromi takes up the lion's-share of the screen time, and her character is more than up for the task. Her character is beautifully developed through out the film, and its very easy to empathize with her pain. Outwardly Hiromi struggles to convince the world that she's perfectly fine. She portrays a happy, confident, precocious girl to all who meet her. The truth behind the mask is that she's really breaking down inside, and the weight of wearing it day in and day out only makes her misery worse. Junkers is an interesting character as well. He plays the naive, well-meaning friend, but perhaps he's more than he seems... The parents aren't given enough screen time to really develop much, which is unfortunate, but fits into the theme of the absentee parents. I haven't mentioned the boarder that's living with them yet. His relationship with Hiromi becomes quite interesting, and he may be the second best character in the film. And last but not least is the housekeeper, who provides wonderful comic relief.Animation: (6/10) Even if we give the film some leeway due to its age, the animation can only be described as average. The frames per second seem to be slightly on the low side, and some of the movements lack smoothness. The character models are simple, yet effective. The facial expressions work well to aid the story. The backgrounds and sets are very plain, but this isn't the type of film that requires beautiful and detailed artwork to carry it. The simple artwork lets the story and the characters become the stars of the film.Sound: (8/10) The soundtrack for the film is decent, but not remarkable. I thought the voice acting was superb though. Hiromi's voice actor did a fabulous job, and was always able to convey her characters emotions to the viewer. I also really liked the maid's voice actor as well.Overall: (8/10) Again, I couldn't recommend this film enough to anyone that enjoys a good drama or coming of age movie.

I promise you won't be disappointed!"", ""This heartwarming family film focuses on a young girl named Hiromi dealing with the complications within her family alongside her pet talking dog, Junkers. The film believably deals with the issues of divorce and parental absence that effect Hiromi in this film, issues that you wouldn't find touched upon in many family or children's films. Both of Hiromi's parents have areas of work that require them to have days to weeks at a time away from home and Hiromi is normally cared for by her tutor and family maid. While the young girl puts on the facade of not minding the work of her family,...her dog and tutor can tell that the distance with her parents hurts her emotionally and the movie creates a coming-of-age theme out of Hiromi's situation with her parents. Hiromi behaves believably for a girl of her age and gets enough fleshing-out where one can connect with the problems she faces throughout the movie.At the same time though, the anime deals with the issues in enough of a light-hearted and mature way where the content won't alienate or insult the intelligence of its wide audience. The anime mixes in its fun moments and jokes involving Hiromi and Junkers' interactions with one another to lighten the mood at points and has some magical elements thanks to Junkers that contribute to the anime's heartwarming moments. The combination of fun and serious elements give Junkers Come Here its strong charm and excellent quality for a family anime film that some could mistaken for a Studio Ghibli film with the similar themes and animation style from the studio's films used for this movie.Speaking of animation, the backgrounds to Junkers Come Here used a soft pastel-like drawing style that are beautiful to look at, are well detailed and add to the film's gentle mood. Character designs are a bit on the simple side, but are drawn to make the characters look lifelike and not feature the big-eye or ridiculous hair styles and colors found within many popular and well-known anime titles. The soundtrack mostly consists of light and whimsical music pieces that do their part in enhancing both the fun and serious moments found throughout the film.Overall, Junkers Come Here made for quite the engaging and touching anime family film offering a nice balance of fun and serious moments in the exploration of Hiromi's family issues and the girl learning to be honest with her family in expressing her feelings on the dilemma. It is definitely worth adding to your collection and even a film worth showing to your children if you have any. her dog and tutor can tell that the distance with her parents hurts her emotionally and the movie creates a coming-of-age theme out of Hiromi's situation with her parents.

Kamisama Kazoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/990/Kamisama_Kazoku,"[""Now here's an unusual anime concept.I wasn't too sure what to expect from this series as the conecpt seemed a little unusual for an anime - the story not being about angels or gods dealing with humans, but rather the son of god learning what it means to be human.The show is well written and moves along at a nice pace. The story itself is quite intruiging, and the main characters develop quite well throughout the show.I especially enjoyed the fact that the show evolved to include darker themes towards the endThe animation is of a very high standard, and the opening music is a...very catchy rock/pop tune.Overall this is a nice series that develops the characters well. It gets a little dark towards the end of the series, but this is done very effectively.This is an enjoyable show to watch and I would recommend this to fans of Chrno Crusade, Ah! Megami-sama, Pita-ten, etc. very catchy rock/pop tune.Overall this is a nice series that develops the characters well.

And the twists that come about as he realises his feelings which he has for his life-long friend and guardian angel.I think the story is unique, it is definitely your fantasy-romance kind of anime. There was a good deal of romance in the anime and the drama was present as wellso if you are a romance-drama fan you might like it. However, the story does not have an outlying plot that encompasses the whole anime so there...are like small arcs of 2-3 episodes, only the romance is continuous throughout the story. Which i partly because it was so short i guess, had it been longer a better storyline could have been developed, thus this anime had a lot of potential.The style of drawing is different from your more popular anime style and its quite refreshing for a change. I found it quite suited for this anime, since it was a romantic comedy it was good in depicting comical scenes.The sound was so-so ,not that there was anything outstanding about it at all no insert songa either so can't say the studio did their best with the music.The characters were not very deep, but they still portrayed the typical high school lovelife behaviour to a comical degree at points. It is because of the lack of seriousness in the romance that i did not find it so captivating. There are only a few character in the anime and the supporting characters are just for comic relief with no significant roles.I enjoyed the comedy in the anime, as well as the romance but as i said earlier its not to the degree that i truly enjoy. However, the story line is quite different from your typical highschool love affair because of the dabble of fantasy in it so it makes quite an ok anime.If your up for a comedy and not so serious romance then this anime is for you, it had good potential but it was not built upon so for a 13 ep anime its quite good, so if your up for a short break from the serious tones of some horror or psychological anime then give this one a try. are like small arcs of 2-3 episodes, only the romance is continuous throughout the story.

This seems like the complete opposite of something I would enjoy but it turned out to be very well thought out, cute and tender.Story 8 It does have a bit of a juvenile feel to it, but thats what an anime like this is supposed to be like. This series did not disappoint and did not lead off with a cliff hanger or unanswered questions. Though I would love to see a second season, this stands up on it's own just fine.Art-9 Not the typical style I usually like,...the colors here are bright and unrealistic, but in a world like this it really works. Opening animation was great and while at the begining I was turned off to the character design as the series progressed I was able to just view them as another cute quirk of this anime.Sound- Op was great, ending was interesting. Voice acting was top notch. The character Meme has to be one of my favorite characters of all time, due mostly to her voice actor. The voices fit seamlessly into the animation. The male side character's voice is a tad annoying, but he is playing an annoying side character so even that worked.Characters-9 My only gripe was with the male lead, his character came off as incredibly selfish and you spent most of the anime thinking what a brat he was, or how could someone do that. While that may not have been the creators intention it didn't hinder the show too much, and by the end you grew to care so much about the other characters you didn't really notice.Tenko- Was amazing, the personality, the character design the voice acting fit together perfectly. I love that every time she gets flustered a little poof of halo smoke pops out of her head along with a little fart type noise.Meme- Just might be one of my favorite characters of all time.Misa- Proved herself to be quite essential to the plot and a valuable member of the family, I would be interested to learn more about her character since none of her personal life ever really gets discussed.Another great concept this anime had was the little people talking... thing.. Hard to describe but sort of like telekinesis, just with little minature pupets. Only the members of the family (and Tenko) have them, and it really brought alot to the show.With shows like this it can get a little crazy sometimes, random abilities constantly being introduced, a new concept in every episode etc. But that wasn't the case here, the writters clearly had a vision of what was, and what wasn't possible even in their world of the gods and they didn't stray much from the first episode, which makes it much more believable.  (Not that any of it is actually believable, but it wasn't one of the series where you roll your eyes at every episode)Enjoyment-8 it was rare that I sat at the end of my seat after an episode, but while watching them I certainly enjoyed it. I'm surprised this isn't a much more popular anime. A few times the characters seemed to be traveling down their road and you're waiting to see where they end up, when boom random sub plot kicks in, the sub plots weren't bad and while for the most part I can see why they were included, weren't really needed.Overall 8- As far as cutsie animes go, this is one of the best I've seen.

I highly recommend this to fans of the lighter side of anime."", 'As per usual, I&rsquo;m not going to bother reviewing Kamisama Kazoku like everyone else. Rating anime by categorical aspects is boring &ndash; rather, I like reviewing anime based on their perceived category. This anime is a romantic comedy and I was looking for a light-hearted romance when I came across it.Now, most anime centered around romance, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad, usually falls into a flurry of clich&eacute;d events, situations and dialogue that&rsquo;s sometimes so automatic, you can see it coming when you read the episode title. However, surprisingly, Kamisama didn&rsquo;t fall into many of those traps and, to be frank, much of the material...was completely original and the characters refused to fall into certain traps that most characters of their type fall into.The main characters for instance, Tenko and Samatarou, are as original as you can get. Samatarou loves Tenko, but not in that way, but she has feelings for him, but refuses to admit it could ever happen. However, what these characters don&rsquo;t do is fall in line with the same warped sense of thought most typical characters in these kinds of anime tend to do. They say what actual people might think and do what actual people might do. So, in the end, when everything falls into place, the romance is natural and feel-good, but most of all, it makes sense.Now, take that with a grain of salt, because the story itself is wild. Based around the everyday life of the son of a &ldquo;god&rdquo; who is living among humans in order to learn more about them all while being &ldquo;protected&rdquo; by his personal angel, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for the viewer to realize those aspects fade really quick into obscurity and it just becomes a normal romantic comedy with a few fantastical throw-ins. In fact, Tenko doesn&rsquo;t once actually protect Samatarou from any kind of danger in this anime&hellip; not once. But after a while, you forget that, because she&rsquo;s adorable and truly cares for him. What I&rsquo;m trying to get at is that if you take this anime seriously, you might be in for disappointment, but if you treat it lightly, this anime is a lot of fun! The best aspect of it are the characters. From cute Meme and Misa, Samatarou&rsquo;s goddess sisters, to a brilliantly and energetically voiced Venus (his mother), they display an entire heart-felt range of emotions, complimented by a rare art style that isn&rsquo;t afraid to take a few chances. Their faces are comical and cute in a rough way and yet their hands are so well drawn, they&rsquo;re good enough for the most top-notch anime out there.I tend to rate romance based on a number of personal factors. I demand that a happy-ending romance end with a kiss, I want the characters to be able to touch each other and hold each other close when they want to convey feelings, I want to see true happiness and passion offset drama if there&rsquo;s a lot of it and I want connection that goes way beyond awkward, pre-teen nuances. If you are going to do romance, do it right, you know what I mean? Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just slice of life and that really is for the kiddies. Well, Kamisama Kazoku accomplished a lot of what I love, and while I won&rsquo;t give anything away, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong to give away the fact that the viewer looking for a good little romance won&rsquo;t get left with a bad taste in his mouth at the end (like a lot of anime tends to do.) If you like brilliant romance anime like Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Nodame Cantabile and True Tears, you might just like this. It&rsquo;s fun to say the least and that says a lot when you consider how much crap there is out there. was completely original and the characters refused to fall into certain traps that most characters of their type fall into.The main characters for instance, Tenko and Samatarou, are as original as you can get. Samatarou loves Tenko, but not in that way, but she has feelings for him, but refuses to admit it could ever happen. However, what these characters don&rsquo;t do is fall in line with the same warped sense of thought most typical characters in these kinds of anime tend to do. They say what actual people might think and do what actual people might do. So, in the end, when everything falls into place, the romance is natural and feel-good, but most of all, it makes sense.Now, take that with a grain of salt, because the story itself is wild. Based around the everyday life of the son of a &ldquo;god&rdquo; who is living among humans in order to learn more about them all while being &ldquo;protected&rdquo; by his personal angel, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for the viewer to realize those aspects fade really quick into obscurity and it just becomes a normal romantic comedy with a few fantastical throw-ins. In fact, Tenko doesn&rsquo;t once actually protect Samatarou from any kind of danger in this anime&hellip; not once. But after a while, you forget that, because she&rsquo;s adorable and truly cares for him. What I&rsquo;m trying to get at is that if you take this anime seriously, you might be in for disappointment, but if you treat it lightly, this anime is a lot of fun! The best aspect of it are the characters. From cute Meme and Misa, Samatarou&rsquo;s goddess sisters, to a brilliantly and energetically voiced Venus (his mother), they display an entire heart-felt range of emotions, complimented by a rare art style that isn&rsquo;t afraid to take a few chances. Their faces are comical and cute in a rough way and yet their hands are so well drawn, they&rsquo;re good enough for the most top-notch anime out there.I tend to rate romance based on a number of personal factors. I demand that a happy-ending romance end with a kiss, I want the characters to be able to touch each other and hold each other close when they want to convey feelings, I want to see true happiness and passion offset drama if there&rsquo;s a lot of it and I want connection that goes way beyond awkward, pre-teen nuances.

This show is about the son of god whom is living in the human world to learn more about them so that one day he\'ll become the perfect god with the understanding of human beings, thus training. He appears to be 15, so of course; he\'s going to a high school. He has a companion, an angel who helps/guides him while he\'s training to become this perfect god. The angel appears to be madly in love with the son of god. Kamiyama, the son...of god, instead ignores these oblivious love warnings by the angel. The story follows arcs, different story\'s every 2-3 episodes, that consist of the angel and Kamiyama doing ridiculous acts together.Story: I thought the story had a unique feel to it; never had I seen such a story like this. Unfortunately, I have many times seen horrible set ups to story\'s that had potential; this show is one of them. The story set up was excessively corny, and like I had stated; I mocked the show while watching it due to it\'s unprogressive feel.Art: The art was decent, enough for me to tolerate. The shows art appeared to me as a 2003 anime with good quality. The art definitely didn\'t compare to some other anime\'s that were produced in 2006. But as I stated, decent.Sound: For the most part, the music was dreadful. A riven prying it\'s way into hell. There was only one piece of music/sound that I did particularly enjoy, which constituted this ""high"" score of 5. I\'m not sure what it\'s called, but it appeared in the later episodes. The clip of music was in the ""episode recap"" right before the actual show began.Character: We have a blue haired dumb ass, a pink haired girl who resembles a devil more than anyone in the show, a mother with a sexual attraction to her son, and a god who can\'t do shit. You\'d think being the son of god you\'d  have at least a small amount of magical power... no, of course not. Kamiyama appears to react to the exact same alarming sequences a normal human would... Kamiyama is a human. The whole entire show was compiled of idiotic powerless labels.Enjoyment: Just because I\'m giving the show a ""6"" doesn\'t mean that it was good, at all. The anime really only amused me by comedy, as every scene in this show needed someone laughing at it. Very little was put into this show... and even though it made me laugh, it made me laugh for the wrong reasons. I give enjoyment ""6"" because the anime made me laugh.Overall: This show was quite mediocre but managed to not completely fail due to it being so mediocre that it was funny.

The story of the series is very light and unique, but like many 13 episode long series, there are some loose ends to the plotline.  The story focuses on Samatarou (god candidate) and Tenko (his guardian angel), and their experiences living in the human world.  However, Samatarou's meddling family creates many amusing problems for him as he wishes to experience everything on his own.As a series, the quality of the artwork in the anime is good and pretty simplistic, and the voices are very good and include many notable seiyuus....However, the characters are the real entertainment of the series; only a few of the main characters show real development through the series while the other characters are groomed for comic relief.  Therefore, I wouldn't so much classify this series as too much of a drama but more as a supernatural romantic comedy series.This series was very enjoyable, and unfortunately, it seems to be a frequently overlooked anime.  There are many elements that make this anime very refreshing for a fan of romantic comedy series, such as a unique, well paced storyline and interesting, unpredictable characters.

It feels a bit like a traditional gag/romance anime, with the caveat being something pretty typical: a focus on angels and gods. What's different about it, and thus attention-capturing, is that the son of god has to come down on earth and learn to appreciate humanity, as a bit of a trial.The love-triangle is a bit hard to get into, as it feels stilted and strained.

We never really stop to look at the bigger picture, seeing just how much is behind our lives and how much we are supported even without realizing it. Kamisama Kazoku (God/Divine Family) is a story about... well, family, as the name suggests. It raises questions like what really makes a family, and how important family actually is. But it's not only about that, it's also explores relationships and maturity, and how they...go hand-in-hand as you come of age. The anime tells this tale of a divine family, living among humans so that their children will learn what humans are like and how they interact and help one another, so that they in turn will become great gods themselves one day. The family's only son, Samatarou, was granted a guardian angel at birth, who would stay by his side until the day that he would finally become independent. This guardian angel, Tenko, becomes much like a twin sister to Samatarou as they grow up, so much that he begins to despise her constant nagging tendencies in his high school days. However, as they encounter strange, unexpected experiences and situations together, their relationship changes, and Samatarou learns to both not only regret taking things for granted, but also see things in a new light like he'd never done before.Story (8/10): Kamisama Kazoku is split up into three story arcs, all of which highlight a different obstacle that our cast finds themselves in. These situations are mysterious and supernatural, and require a degree of maturity and acceptance to overcome. These story arcs are cohesively tied together and frequently reference each other, enhancing the plot as a whole. My gripe about the way they set this up is that some of these story arcs have strange loopholes and unexplained plot conveniences, however these are infrequent and the majority end with a very sensible conclusion despite the situation being fairly mysterious and confusing at first glance. The last story arc becomes a little dark, especially towards the end, but in my opinion it worked great, and definitely gave these characters their final push towards becoming better people. The story overall is charming and is especially enjoyable with such a colorful cast of characters.Art (8/10): I am biased with it comes to this anime's animation and artstyle. To most, it may seem overly simplistic and outdated, but I personally love it. The character design, particularly with our two main characters, is really appealing and charming and I really liked it. Again, this is very opinionated, as the animation is still quite old (a decade old, in fact!) obviously making it inferior to anime these days. However, the gag/comedic moments are all animated well for it's time and just make this anime's atmosphere a lot lighter.Sound (7/10): The sound in this show was good. The sound effects themselves were fairly subpar, but they managed to do their job decently which is really all that matters. The voice acting is excellent, no complaints with that. The opening and ending themes are both great, especially the opening theme! It's super catching and groovy, and wouldn't mind listening to it again at all.Character (9/10): I absolutely loved the characters in this show. Samatarou's family are all hilarious and charming, especially his mom and older sister. They never felt stale or uninspired to me, and they were caring and thoughtful at times when it really mattered. Samatarou at first is selfish, distant, and mean to his family members, including his guardian angel Tenko, but he grows fundamentally as a person throughout the series and learns to see that these people are more than just cardboard cutouts; they have feelings and they genuinely care about him, something which he's taken for granted for many years. Tenko is also a great character in my opinion, she's caring but also a little tsundere (they both are as a matter of fact) but at no point is it over the top. She herself matures and learns to accept that even though they aren't officially related to you, people can be your family as long as they care about you.Enjoyment (9/10): I really liked this anime. It was charming, funny, dramatic, and romantic and times when it needed to be and had a brilliant conclusion that gave everyone a happy ending and resolved the love troubles and doubts between the two main characters. The anime may be confusing at times, since the story arcs that make it up are generally pretty random and strange to begin with, but as they start to make sense, they become very enjoyable and a blast to watch through. The cast of characters was fairly small, but they all played their part well and aided the story in their own way.Overall (9/10): If you have the time and you're a fan of comedy, romance, family chemistry/relationships, character development, drama, supernatural themes, and just plain charm, you should definitely check out Kamisama Kazoku. It was captivating until the very end, where I believe it had it's strongest point, and then concluded wonderfully. At times it may be a little frustrating or confusing, but the payoff is definitely worth it.

The series follows the traveling swordswoman, Ran, and her partner Meow (or more likely, Miao) as they move from town to town, stumbling upon troubles and fortunes at the whims of fate and coincidence.Story & Characters:There isn\'t a semblance of a central plot, it\'s not particularly dramatic and its episodes are a bit formulaic.  Perhaps it is this simple, and gentle approach to story telling which forgoes the dramatic and melodramatic that makes this series so easy to enjoy.  It\'s safe; you know what to expect, and no pretentious philosophy lessons or...painful corny moments pop up to ruin the action-comedy in its simplest form.  Of course the trade off is that the episodes become quite predictable, but the characters are amusing enough to make their light-hearted adventures enjoyable despite that fact.Both Ran and Miao are foolish in their own ways.  Miao is quite simply dense.  She\'s often flattered by Ran\'s thinly veiled, backhanded compliments.  Ran on the other hand, is blunt to the point of tactlessness.  She doesn\'t give due respect to anyone except inn managers, and only because they bring her sake.  Alcohol is her one worldly desire, and it\'s a fervid desire at that.  Her laid back nature and simple wants hide her incredible skill with the sword, but unlike similar characters in Kenshin or Vash, Ran isn\'t much of a hero.  Her laissez faire attitude extends to her morals as well.  She\'ll punish wrongdoings, but only if it takes place in front of her eyes, and the way she passes off desperate pleas demonstrates her ""out of sight, out of mind"" stance regarding justice.  The rather rigid formula of the episodes are all based on these character flaws.  Miao will help anyone with a decent sob story while Ran refuses and looks for alcohol instead.  They separate; Miao eventually realizes she\'s bitten off more than she can chew and Ran will come to the rescue, possibly because she can no longer let whatever evil was taking place slide, but more likely because she ran out of sake money and needs a loan from Miao.The humor is similarly repetitive; playing mostly off Miao\'s idiocy and Ran\'s social impropriety.  With only 13 episodes, it manages to scrape by without getting old.  The ills of society Miao and Ran stumble upon, from drug dealing, extortion, swindling, amongst others, create enough variety in both situational humor and plot to keep the series somewhat fresh.  I wouldn\'t recommend marathoning Tsukikage Ran though.Animation & Music:The 70\'s Asian pop opening and endings along with its 80\'s, Rumiko Takahashi look hides its age well.  I did a double take when I read it was made in 2000.Ran\'s bouts are fast and concise (at times to the point of being anticlimactic), not particularly well animated, but at the very least, fully animated, with no still screens or cut outs.  While most of the characters wield the Katana with two hands, Ran only uses one, hacking with it like a machete.  It\'s a nice fit to her unorthodox nature, and her dislike of Samurai.  Miao fights hand to hand, but her martial looks look awkward at best, ridiculous at worst, though still commendable for being fully animated.The music is a complete throw back.  Not only the OP and ED, but also the regular BGM\'s, many of which even sound like they were recorded in old studios.  They bear that slight fuzziness in the higher notes that typical of older recordings.  To go to that extent for its classic appeal is impressive.--Watching too much Tsukikage Ran at once will exacerbate its repetitive nature.  On a sparing watch schedule, Tsukikage Ran is action comedy distilled to its purest form.  There are no fetish characters, no social-political comments, just some nice good-guy vs. bad-guy action dealt by a classic boke tsukommi comedy duo. painful corny moments pop up to ruin the action-comedy in its simplest form.  Of course the trade off is that the episodes become quite predictable, but the characters are amusing enough to make their light-hearted adventures enjoyable despite that fact.Both Ran and Miao are foolish in their own ways.  Miao is quite simply dense.  She\'s often flattered by Ran\'s thinly veiled, backhanded compliments.  Ran on the other hand, is blunt to the point of tactlessness.  She doesn\'t give due respect to anyone except inn managers, and only because they bring her sake.  Alcohol is her one worldly desire, and it\'s a fervid desire at that.  Her laid back nature and simple wants hide her incredible skill with the sword, but unlike similar characters in Kenshin or Vash, Ran isn\'t much of a hero.  Her laissez faire attitude extends to her morals as well.  She\'ll punish wrongdoings, but only if it takes place in front of her eyes, and the way she passes off desperate pleas demonstrates her ""out of sight, out of mind"" stance regarding justice.

It may be the only anime where I never skipped the opening song.Some of the fight scenes were done quite well, being moderately realistic sword work.  (Save for the lack of blood and, as seen in the opening scenes,  the...common trope of  bad guys lining up to be killed, rather than attacking two or three at a time.)  The characters were likable, though sometimes Ran reminds me of an Eastwood in the Man with No Name films, if he suddenly become like a little boy when offered liquor.  Meow is the goofy sidekick.   I think I had at least one loud guffaw per episode.It was an underrated show and I wish there were more episodes.

As others have said, simple but very enjoyable."", 'Tsukikage Ran is about a female samurai and her fellow female martial artist travelling companion in pre-industrial era Japan (Edo period? I\'m terrible with the exact dates of these period pieces). It\'s a very goofy take on the genre, with everyone acting all cartoony and pulling exaggerated facial expressions and cartoon dust clouds, and the animation plays it suitably free and loose during those areas. However when a fight is going down, suddenly the animation takes this huge jump in quality and every punch and jump and sword swing is meticulously detailed, which makes these scenes far more exhilarating and exciting than the goofy set...ups should really allow them to be. I have a sneaking suspicion that they animated the same moves for each fight, but I like the illusion so I never bothered going back to check that. Also the character artwork avoids the issue that plagues other 2000-era anime where they don\'t do the shading on the face correctly, making it look like they haven\'t got any chins. It\'s like the 2000 equivalent of noses disappearing in current day anime.I had Tsukikage Ran described to me as \'fluff\', and that\'s certainly the case. Each episode is a standalone story in which the two lead characters wander into a town in the search of sake and get themselves involved in some sort of local kerfuffle. The stories are usually brain-meltingly black and white. Some kid has gotten themselves involved with the local yakuza in an attempt to earn money for whatever. The head yakuza characters are almost always hilariously slimy evil caricatures. I\'m convinced they got the same guy to voice the villain in every single episode, with the same low slimy voice in which he wrung his hands and ate babies using a spork and stuff like that. The reason they\'re eating babies and not, say, drinking blood from the caved in skulls of their enemies is because they\'re usually totally incompetent losers who get instantly turned over by the main characters when they stroll in, usually just trying to mind their own business.So it\'s not a particularly deep anime, but it works because of how well realised the two lead characters are and how well written their dialogue is. The writing is seriously sharp in this regard, and often caught me off guard with little turns of phrase, such as ""that\'s not my baby, I\'m so pure I make flowers bloom"" and other lines like that. I particularly love the hypocrisy the lead samurai girl Ran has when faced with a potential drink of alcohol. She could have her pride shoved into the dirt, the clothes taken off her back, the yazuka hiring her to kill a family of eleventy billion, and she would try to justify to herself that it\'s OK and the right thing to do if it was her only method of getting her hands on a bottle of sake. I also love her slightly egotistical side, such as how she refers to herself as \'beautiful\' whenever she introduces herself. I\'ve never been a particularly big fan of the all-serious, all-knowing superhuman characters like Captain Harlock or Black Jack, and Ran felt like a subversion of those types of characters. She acted all-knowing and all-serious and usually ended up saving the day, but that hubris she has made her more flawed and therefore more entertaining as a person.Ultimately though, being as shallow as it is, Tsukikage Ran doesn\'t do a huge amount to ever get me too invested in proceedings. Lets do an obvious comparison to another Edo(?) era anime that plays it pretty fast and loose with historical accuracy: Samurai Champloo. Like Champloo, each episode is fairly standalone as the characters travel from place to place. However there is a much stronger character focus in Champloo that gets you more emotionally attached to them. As we learn about their pasts, we learn more about why they\'re travelling and who they really are. Tsukikage Ran doesn\'t really have that. There were a grand total of 2 episodes where we get to learn about the characters pasts somewhat, and even they tell very little about who they are or why they\'re travelling. Now that may indeed be the point. They\'re travelling for the sake of travelling. It just doesn\'t make them particularly interesting.Still, Tsukikage Ran is plenty enjoyable. I would have liked an English dub, because although it wouldn\'t have gelled with the setting, I would have been able to zone out as I watched it and do other stuff. It\'s not a show designed to demand your undivided attention. You have it on in the background, picking up the witty lines here and there, and the plot for each episode is either so simple or so trivial that not picking up on the details will barely affect your enjoyment. In a way, I\'m criticising Tsukikage Ran for not being something it was never trying to be, as it was only ever meant to be light entertainment, and it achieves that with flying colours.

of a Jidai-geki, whose main objective, besides the depiction of a beautiful historical setting, is entertainment. The comedy is refreshingly simple or better, not exaggerated and therefore convincing. A series that, despite its low popularity, is worth a sneak peek.Story: simple, but on the other hand it doesn\'t try to be more than it actually is (7/10)The simple main story revolves around the two main characters Ran and Meow, their random encounter and how a really good friendship develops through the shared adventures. One could argue that a day by day slice...of life plot is not the most exciting, aside the missing of originality as well an sophisticated storytelling. Even though this isn\'t entirely wrong, the series is still a lot of fun. The idea that strong women, even though they were born in patriarchal times, still assert themselves, is beautifully implemented in this anime. A relaxed samurai lady and a martial artist roam together through the beautiful landscape and experience adventures in the Edo period. Even if this idea is more or less philosophical, it contains a slight reference to parody. And it is also often used in later anime, for example in ""Oda Nobuna no Yabō"", which is also a pretty good anime by the way. But if you are looking for a historically correct anime, with good character depiction and excellent visuals, to be honest, then Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran will not convince and you should skip it.Characters: The two main characters are also the main force of the cast (7/10)Due to the episodic structure of the series, the secondary characters appear in only one episode. The characters are usually described sufficiently so that they fulfill their roles well in the plot. But you shouldn\'t expect great depth and background story.A few of the minor characters are nevertheless interesting and therefore briefly described as well.Tsukikage Ran:Ran is an attractive woman, but she also has some of the attitudes of a ronin. She goes wherever she wants and is almost always broke. Only thanks to her Katana skills and Meow\'s generosity that she can avoid getting into trouble, by skipping out on the bill. She loves drinking Sake. Besides her calm nature, Ran has a sharp tongue and is blessed with wisdom. She cares for people in need, even if she doesn\'t want to interfere, but with the sentence ""that\'s not excusable"" she makes it clear that the current situation makes her angry as well as disturbs her sense of justice. And then her Katana speaks for her. Interesting and somewhat unusual is her handling of the sword, she always uses it with one hand. That\'s interesting, because the sword could be a Tachi because of its length, but it\'s not so strongly curved and moreover Ran carries it, with the edge up, on the belt. In this context a Uchigatana should be considered. This could be supported by the fact that Ran uses the sword with one hand. But the sword in the anime is a bit too long for a Uchigatana. The Uchigatana was used as a second sword because of the shorter edge, especially for fighting in a smaller space. Considering the time, the Edo period 1603 - 1868, it is probably a Katana. This describes Ran\'s individual character very well that she carries a two-handed sword, and use it only with one hand. I\'m sorry for this little digression, I got a little carried away.Meow:She takes over most of the comedy and it makes me laugh, although comedy is not usually my cup of tea. Meow is a Chinese martial artist who can defend herself quite well with her Iron Cat Fist style. She is kindhearted, quite bold and also a bit gullible. So she is always drawn into the affairs of others, intentionally or not. The friendship between the two women is quite interesting. It\'s clear that Ran, takes advantage of Meow again and again but on the other hand, Ran respects Meow also for friendliness and determination to help, so that she also stands by Meow when she\'s in trouble. Normally, I find the impulsive character of the comedy-ninja, who always gets into something by chance, rather annoying. But here I can laugh about it. That\'s because the balance between comedy and characterization has been handled well here. Meow\'s character wasn\'t ridiculed in favor of comedy, as is unfortunately often the case with many of the later anime.Minor characters:Mei:She is a childhood friend of Meow and was put on the wrong track by the death of her parents and, became an opium dealer. The fact that the two former friends meet again under these circumstances can only end tragically and Episode 9 offers exactly that.  Although the episode is a bit theatrical, it is both touching and like a fresh breeze, as episodes 5 through 8 lack a little drive.Stephanie:She is, as the name already suggests, a European foreigner who has a very strong interest in the Japanese culture and especially would like to be trained in the use of the sword. Her portrayal, with the imposing appearance and the slightly unrealistic ideas about Japanese culture, underlines the parody character of the series. Nevertheless, a balance was found in her role as well, because apart from amusement, she is the only one who succeeds with her strength to confront Ran as a very serious opponent.Visuals: Art somewhat simple, but fight choreography well done (7/10)The production qualities of art and animation are somewhat simple for a Madhouse production. The character design of Watanabe Hajime does a good job of making the main characters attractive, but criticism can be addressed to a large part of the supporting characters, which look rather generic and simple. To be honest, I\'m fine with that. A deep and complex colours scheme would only feel a little awkward next to the simple narrative. The simplicity of the colours and shadows goes well with the amusement offered by Meow\'s hyperactive comedy and Ran\'s carefree-coolness. Apart from the fact that the art is simple, it\'s still done right, like the play of light and shadow. On the other hand, in my opinion, a very pleasant aspect with regard to the art department is the complete absence of fan service. Some may miss it, but this way it definitely fits in well with the overall picture.The animation furthermore offers choreographically very nicely animated fight scenes. The fighting style of Ran with its excellent sword maneuvers represents very clearly and precisely the techniques of Kenjutsu from which the modern forms of Iaidō and Kendō developed.Music: funny but generic, yet with some nice musical accents (6/10)The BGM was composed by Sahashi, Toshihiko and consists mainly of historically interpreted pieces of music played on the corresponding traditional instruments. However, there are also some jazz-like pieces that seem a bit out of place in a show that tries to capture the nostalgia of an old samurai drama. But if you consider it as a parody, it fits well into the overall picture.The OP ""Leave it to the wind"" is sung by Akemi Misawa as an Enka. Enka is a musical genre that is almost exclusively produced in Japan and is basically most comperable to traditional folk music. Akemi-san is a well-known and popular Japanese Enka singer and actress. As so often, the lyrics are about loneliness, longing and of course Sake. That\'s why the song in the opening credits sounds so authentic and fits perfectly to an anime in the style of a ""Jidai-geki"".The ED ""Leave it to the wind 2"" sung by Yasuhara, Reiko is more contemporary. The soft voice and the sound of a banjo make the song a catchy tune.The dubbing actors did a good job to give the characters an appropriate voice. Besides the main roles of Yasuhara, Reiko as Tsukikage Ran and Okamura, Akemi as Meow, I also liked the voice of Fuchizaki, Yuriko as Sakura very much. Unfortunately, both the lip synchronization and some of the sound effects are not always convincing.In short, Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran is really entertaining and offers fun. If you\'re looking for a samurai anime that isn\'t exaggerated and yet entertaining, then you\'ve come to the right place.Thanks for reading and have fun watching. of life plot is not the most exciting, aside the missing of originality as well an sophisticated storytelling.

In this context a Uchigatana should be considered. This could be supported by the fact that Ran uses the sword with one hand. But the sword in the anime is a bit too long for a Uchigatana. The Uchigatana was used as a second sword because of the shorter edge, especially for fighting in a smaller space. Considering the time, the Edo period 1603 - 1868, it is probably a Katana. This describes Ran\'s individual character very well that she carries a two-handed sword, and use it only with one hand. I\'m sorry for this little digression, I got a little carried away.Meow:She takes over most of the comedy and it makes me laugh, although comedy is not usually my cup of tea. Meow is a Chinese martial artist who can defend herself quite well with her Iron Cat Fist style. She is kindhearted, quite bold and also a bit gullible. So she is always drawn into the affairs of others, intentionally or not. The friendship between the two women is quite interesting. It\'s clear that Ran, takes advantage of Meow again and again but on the other hand, Ran respects Meow also for friendliness and determination to help, so that she also stands by Meow when she\'s in trouble. Normally, I find the impulsive character of the comedy-ninja, who always gets into something by chance, rather annoying. But here I can laugh about it. That\'s because the balance between comedy and characterization has been handled well here. Meow\'s character wasn\'t ridiculed in favor of comedy, as is unfortunately often the case with many of the later anime.Minor characters:Mei:She is a childhood friend of Meow and was put on the wrong track by the death of her parents and, became an opium dealer. The fact that the two former friends meet again under these circumstances can only end tragically and Episode 9 offers exactly that.  Although the episode is a bit theatrical, it is both touching and like a fresh breeze, as episodes 5 through 8 lack a little drive.Stephanie:She is, as the name already suggests, a European foreigner who has a very strong interest in the Japanese culture and especially would like to be trained in the use of the sword. Her portrayal, with the imposing appearance and the slightly unrealistic ideas about Japanese culture, underlines the parody character of the series. Nevertheless, a balance was found in her role as well, because apart from amusement, she is the only one who succeeds with her strength to confront Ran as a very serious opponent.Visuals: Art somewhat simple, but fight choreography well done (7/10)The production qualities of art and animation are somewhat simple for a Madhouse production. The character design of Watanabe Hajime does a good job of making the main characters attractive, but criticism can be addressed to a large part of the supporting characters, which look rather generic and simple. To be honest, I\'m fine with that. A deep and complex colours scheme would only feel a little awkward next to the simple narrative. The simplicity of the colours and shadows goes well with the amusement offered by Meow\'s hyperactive comedy and Ran\'s carefree-coolness. Apart from the fact that the art is simple, it\'s still done right, like the play of light and shadow. On the other hand, in my opinion, a very pleasant aspect with regard to the art department is the complete absence of fan service. Some may miss it, but this way it definitely fits in well with the overall picture.The animation furthermore offers choreographically very nicely animated fight scenes. The fighting style of Ran with its excellent sword maneuvers represents very clearly and precisely the techniques of Kenjutsu from which the modern forms of Iaidō and Kendō developed.Music: funny but generic, yet with some nice musical accents (6/10)The BGM was composed by Sahashi, Toshihiko and consists mainly of historically interpreted pieces of music played on the corresponding traditional instruments. However, there are also some jazz-like pieces that seem a bit out of place in a show that tries to capture the nostalgia of an old samurai drama. But if you consider it as a parody, it fits well into the overall picture.The OP ""Leave it to the wind"" is sung by Akemi Misawa as an Enka. Enka is a musical genre that is almost exclusively produced in Japan and is basically most comperable to traditional folk music. Akemi-san is a well-known and popular Japanese Enka singer and actress. As so often, the lyrics are about loneliness, longing and of course Sake. That\'s why the song in the opening credits sounds so authentic and fits perfectly to an anime in the style of a ""Jidai-geki"".The ED ""Leave it to the wind 2"" sung by Yasuhara, Reiko is more contemporary. The soft voice and the sound of a banjo make the song a catchy tune.The dubbing actors did a good job to give the characters an appropriate voice. Besides the main roles of Yasuhara, Reiko as Tsukikage Ran and Okamura, Akemi as Meow, I also liked the voice of Fuchizaki, Yuriko as Sakura very much. Unfortunately, both the lip synchronization and some of the sound effects are not always convincing.In short, Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran is really entertaining and offers fun. If you\'re looking for a samurai anime that isn\'t exaggerated and yet entertaining, then you\'ve come to the right place.Thanks for reading and have fun watching.', 'Recommendation: A samurai adventure slice of life series. Enjoyable if you like period pieces set in feudal Japan, but otherwise skippable.Positives:+ The wandering samurai structure lends itself well to the episodic format. There is no overarching story, and each episode is self contained, so it can even be watched out of order after episode 1 with no loss of comprehension.+ Grounded in a way that anime usually isn\'t. There are no pink haired lolis with magical swords or anything of the sort here, it\'s relatively realistic and restrained.+ Artwork, music, costuming and character design are all very evocative of the setting and time period. It...makes it feel like you\'re there. The OP is excellent and fits well thematically too.+ Ran is a really fun character and makes for a great co-protagonist.Negatives:- On the other hand, Meow, the show\'s other co-protagonist, is punishingly annoying and nearly singlehandedly ruins the show. Meow\'s idiocy is so over the top that I actually started getting mad at her at points. The idea behind the odd couple pairing with her and Ran is good enough on paper, but she should have been dialed back 3 or 4 notches.- Episodes tend to have highly formulaic setups, where Ran and Meow enter a city, get attacked by the townspeople who mistake them for villains, and then beg them for their help when they\'re defeated. At least half the episodes follow this pattern and it becomes a bit predictable and boring after you\'ve seen a few.- Action is overly sanitized. There is virtually no blood even though people are regularly getting killed with swords. It makes it difficult to tell when characters are dead or have merely been knocked out or disabled and undermines the drama in those scenes.- Action choreography is hit or miss. Meow\'s martial arts look cool and well animated, but the swordfighting tends to be too ""zoomed in"" and it\'s hard to get a sense of what is happening or where people are in relation to other things.- The drama is much weaker than the comedy, and serious scenes suffer for how closely they\'re juxtaposed with goofiness. In particular, the episode where Meow meets a childhood friend that has broken bad and started selling drugs is a huge swing and a miss for trying to hang a serious storyline on Meow, the goofball comic relief character of the series. makes it feel like you\'re there.

It\'s a very light-hearted, relaxing anime, despite being about martial arts and action. Kazemakase is the kind of thing I\'d put on while I fold some laundry or something. That being said, Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran has no illusions about what it is and it does it very well. It doesn\'t try to be anything more and doesn\'t need to be.One thing that stood out for me was Ran\'s character. If you watch a lot of anime, you might have noticed that a lot of series really seem to struggle with realistic...female characters. Ran, I felt, is believable. She\'s got more than one side to her personality, but isn\'t so convoluted or simple that she\'s unbelievable as a character. She\'s probably my favorite female character in any anime, which is saying a lot, because while Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran is good, it\'s not even in my top 10 anime. female characters.

And the best part is that she\'s very handsome. She doesn\'t have lady qualities, but she isn\'t scandalous either.And then you have Myao, that gives more life to the anime and serves as the...counter-part of her friend.10/10 counter-part of her friend.10/10', ""It was a good show more or less, but it had so much more potential that wasn't realized. No backstory on where Ran came from, no real underlying message or conflict either. It's like an unfinished version of Samurai Champloo when it comes to wandering, penniless ronin and chance encounters while walking across the countryside.Then again, the lack of blood and more adult themes in this show probably indicates it wasn't meant for a mature audience and so the sophistication of the plot likely wasn't a priority.The art, sound, and character development all felt like it came straight of Rurouni Kenshin given the time...it was made, so it's at least pretty decent.

Karin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/469/Karin,"['Karin is my favorite romantic comedy ever. I believe the reason for this is because I like vampire shows so this is a huge plus for me, there is also the fact that it had a real end unlike most romantic comedies. I love the characters in this show especially karin herself she is definitely unique. My biggest disclaimer to people about this show would be if you are looking for a show that is on the serious side this is not for you. so if you like things a little out of the norm then this may be a good fit for you. ', ""To be honest I expected a lot from it and unfortunately the first 5 episodes didn&rsquo;t really grab me. However, after episode 5 things got better and the plot became more definite.Speaking of the plot… So it&rsquo;s about Karin, a freak among vampires. She&rsquo;s probably what you would refer to as an anti-vampire. She doesn&rsquo;t suck blood as often as other vampires do, since she actually makes blood, she bathes in daylight with no problem whatsoever &ndash; The bottom line is that she can do what other vampires can&rsquo;t. Basically, the fact that Karin&rsquo;s not a normal vampire, is what the plot revolves on.She would...get into crazy situations such as preventing schoolmates and teachers from finding out about her true identity, having a vampire hunter as an admirer, keeping her grandma from sucking out her crush&rsquo;s blood and whatnot. These situations would usually end up with her as the victor and everyone (including me) will be laughing at the end. Anyway, situations like this would go on until the last episode, which I actually like. It wasn&rsquo;t expected, nor was it underwhelming, and I would say it ended on a high note.As a comedy, I would say it&rsquo;s so-so. Sure it was funny, but it could have been funnier. It&rsquo;s probably because the comedic scenes are also chockfull of ecchi and fanservice, which I\\'m not really into. As a romantic comedy, I&rsquo;d give it an A. For some reason, the Karin-Kenta love match really works, they go so well together, and I&rsquo;m sticking to that opinion regardless of how creepy Usui Kenta may look compared to Karin. Plus there&rsquo;s always the love-hate relationship of Maki and Winner to back that up.Characters are OK. I love everyone in Karin&rsquo;s family. The Maaka/Marker family is probably the dictionary definition of dysfunctional, and you know how funny dysfunctional families can be. My favorite Marker would probably be Ren, since he&rsquo;s such a bad boy. Usui Kenta is the stereotypical loser, and Maaka is the usual &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; star of the show. Winner Sinclair is also funny, his dialogues are absolutely absurd, and it cracks me up whenever he speaks English. An outraged &ldquo;no&rdquo; from him already merits a laugh from me. Conversely, the villains are also quite interesting. Elda, who was a villain at first, was very convincing for her role. She really did annoy me, and what annoyed me more is the fact that she barely looks like Karin and yet everyone mistakes her for Karin. Doesn&rsquo;t anyone notice how her hair is much longer than Karin&rsquo;s and that it&rsquo;s light pink? Plus that Victor Sinclair guy kinda pissed me off too. He was unforgiving and heartless, like a true villain would be.I love the vibrant colors. I really prefer vibrant colors over subdued tones, but even with that said, I still like the water color backgrounds, plus the occasional water colored scenes such as the ones shown during the ending theme sequence. They were delicate, but it was done nicely and it suited to my slight fondness of water color backgrounds. Character design was OK, except maybe for Karin and Kenta. They looked bland and commonplace, especially for Karin. She&rsquo;s just the usual big headed anime girl with big boobs. There was also the use of CG, which at times made me a bit iffy. They used the CG for the weirdest things, and the last I remember CG was used to depict falling leaves in one of the last episodes.I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the huge amounts of fan service and 2-lady bath scenes. There was even a few seconds worth of Naked Karin that was shown during the opening sequence. I guess that&rsquo;s expected from Yuna Kagezaki, who&rsquo;s actually known for her &ldquo;H&rdquo; works.The voice acting was also so-so for me. It&rsquo;s not entirely bad, but something&rsquo;s off. Props to Karin&rsquo;s seiyu, Sayuri Yahagi. From what I researched this is actually her debut role. And when I shamelessly say &ldquo;props&rdquo;, I meant A for effort. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it, but I got a feeling it can be done better than that. Same thing for Winner&rsquo;s seiyu, Kouki Miyata. Winner&rsquo;s a funny guy, but his voice compared to his looks? Doesn&rsquo;t really go together, does it? I did like Kouki&rsquo;s work on Kyo Kara Maoh! where he played Ken Murata. The one that impressed me the most is Katsuyuki Konishi. I just finished watching Loveless and when I found out he was also Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, I was awestruck since he didn&rsquo;t sound a thing like Soubi. Maki&rsquo;s seiyu, Mikako Takahashi, did an OK job. Even though she&rsquo;s played 2 similar characters, Maki in Karin and Ayu in Honey and Clover, I still would have liked it if she gave more intensity to Maki&rsquo;s character.The BGM and sound effects was actually quite outstanding. I like the &ldquo;tell tale heart&rdquo; sound effect whenever Karin&rsquo;s blood would increase. There was a wide variety of BGM for Karin that can go from cheerful and upbeat to thrilling and intense. I actually prefer the more intense BGM compared to the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a nice day&rdquo; genre of BGM. The opening theme was OK, but I definitely liked the ending song better since it&rsquo;s more cutesy and catchy.I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s one of my favorites, but it was a good watch. I might&rsquo;ve enjoyed it more if I was a guy, since it had a lot of nude scenes and fan service, but I as I&rsquo;ve said, I like it enough. get into crazy situations such as preventing schoolmates and teachers from finding out about her true identity, having a vampire hunter as an admirer, keeping her grandma from sucking out her crush&rsquo;s blood and whatnot.

Oh Winner.................I'm sorry but, I really hated this character, his appearance, his voice (I'll get to that in a bit), his role!His role in the anime is to be the bishonen rival to Kenta Usui, the main male role of the series, for the affection of Karin (The main female role and titular character), but to me (And to hopefully everyone else) he is irritatingly annoying to the point of instant hatred, all this character does is get in the way 24/7, nearly every episode after episode 6.I'm not going to lie, the story is okay, but pretty generic, for the most part and Winner's job is an interesting plot twist which allows an interesting story development, especially the last 4 episodes, but Winner's personality, his presence just ruin's so much of that, he is the annoying kid who hangs around the circle and just never wants to leave.But at the very least winner is the only major headache in the anime, well in the japanese dub.ANIMATION: Okay, not great but good enough.The character designs are true to the source material, but looks like a typical low budget shojo anime, and the opening animation makes the series look like a hentai or something, so it's unclear which audience this anime is made for.Karin's nose bleeds are censored with... flowers... it's unique and a creative way to censor something, but only adds to my argument of who this series is intended for.SOUND: Both theme music are okay, six for both opening and ending songs.Okay I'm going to get this strait, do NOT watch the english dub, stick to the subtitles only (Which gets about a seven)!The english is just terribly bland, typical no emotion script reading with voices that do fit the characters, but are performed so bad.And of all of them, Winner has the most atrocious ear bleeding noise you will ever hear, this is no over exaggeration, no dub hating or trolling (I love english dubbed anime), I really really mean it.OVERALL:+ Different story that has an okay plot- Winner Sinclair- English dub- Unclear of who this anime is intended forAdaptions of manga are notorious for messing with the source material, but some end up just fine, while others are a disaster, and it's quite a feat for just one character to ruin an entire anime. beginning of the manga then goes about with completely different story than what the source material did.Which in truth I usually have no problem with that, many anime went this way, Fullmetal Alchemist ended up great, the second Negima anime was okay.And with like most adaptions  Karin, the anime adds in a new character, Winner Sinclair..................................................................................................................................................................................................................huh?Oh I'm sorry I blacked out for a second there.What was I talking about?

At its heart, there is a clear, powerful romance. Add to it a supernatural backstory, and some hilarious comedy, you\'ve got Karin.Meet Karin Maaka. She\'s a girl caught between two worlds. At first glance, she\'s just an ordinary, easily embarrassed high school girl. She has a couple of friends, and has a hard time juggling schoolwork and her part time job. But of course, there\'s a twist!Karin is a vampire. She lives in your stock creepy old haunted mansion on the hill with her vampire family. But, to this, there is another twist. Karin...is not a true vampire. She is a blood maker, which means instead of needing to drink blood for her survival, she must inject it into someone else. Otherwise, she has a nosebleed. A very big nosebleed. This causes a rift between her and her family, who all function as normal, viewing her as a disgrace to their kind.The main focus of the series is the relationship between Karin and her romantic interest, Kenta Usui. Although the series begins in a rather cliché fashion for a romantic comedy, the show\'s supernatural roots prevent it from being too much of a standard anime. One aspect of the relationship I can criticize is Usui. He is nowhere near as fleshed out as Karin, and although he fits the role of Karin\'s love interest well, we are not given enough to believe the rather convenient romance that seems one-sided. However, by the end of the series, I was forgetting my doubts about Usui, and although he had only changed minimally, the romance is very sweet and believable. Some say it\'s all about the journey, not the destination, but I believe it was in fact the opposite for Karin and Usui\'s love.Okay, I have admitted that the romance isn’t the strongest element of the anime. But you know what is? The characters. All of Karin\'s family and friends has their own distinct personality and role in the main plot. Plus, similar to the general idea of the series, you could view most characters on two levels: in the lighthearted, comedic times, and in the serious. For example, there’s the anime exclusive Winner Sinclair. He both fills the role of the girl crazy foreigner, and enemy of vampires. We witness both his never ending stream of humor and his emotional tackling of his family’s duty. This duality is an excellent example of how a dramedy can work, as I’ve never seen a show where the characters can both expertly fill comedy and dramatic roles.It\'s quite easy to get attached to the characters of Karin. One very positive aspect is that no one gets sidelined during the series as the plot moves on, which makes it easy to get to know all of the characters as the series goes through its various arcs.In terms of art, the anime isn\'t particularly standout. The character designs are simple yet rather memorable. Some interesting aspects of the art style are some occasional stylizations. For example, due to censorship for broadcast, Karin\'s flowing nosebleeds had to be changed into flowers, but this gives the art a quirky feel. Especially considering we at first see a stream of blood-red flowers, which part to reveal a nightmarish bloody mess once it has settled. Yes, positive censorship! And another thing - this anime is quite ecchi. Fans of the manga may be shocked at the transformation, as the original source material had only some ecchi content. The opening of the anime begins with various shots of Karin posing naked.  Karin\'s breasts, already larger than average, have become much larger in the anime, even becoming somewhat of a plot point. Although this ecchi stuff didn\'t affect my enjoyment of the series in any way, it may deter some, considering the amount we are given.Sound as well is also not hugely remarkable, utilizing a range of songs to suit the mood of the scene. The opening and ending themes are quite catchy: I know I\'m not the only one who has been enamored by the simply indescribably fantastic ending theme ""Mou Hitotsu no Birthday"". Character voices suit the characters to their personality well. Special mention, however, should be given to the seiyu Sayuri Yahagi. Karin was her debut anime, and I feel she does a magnificent portrayal of the character.Karin doesn\'t try to overburden you with themes. It is simple in its declaration of true love between two people, which transcends species. Although the series takes a noticeable turn towards action towards the latter quarter of the series, the ending holds true the ideals of romance and comedy which have been sustained throughout the anime. While taking some deviations from the manga in order to make the transition to a half season anime while the manga still printed, these changes never really affected the heart of the series. I would recommend Karin for any fans of romantic comedies, and I promise that it\'s a breath of fresh air in an often unimaginative genre. is not a true vampire.

Although the series begins in a rather cliché fashion for a romantic comedy, the show\'s supernatural roots prevent it from being too much of a standard anime. One aspect of the relationship I can criticize is Usui. He is nowhere near as fleshed out as Karin, and although he fits the role of Karin\'s love interest well, we are not given enough to believe the rather convenient romance that seems one-sided. However, by the end of the series, I was forgetting my doubts about Usui, and although he had only changed minimally, the romance is very sweet and believable. Some say it\'s all about the journey, not the destination, but I believe it was in fact the opposite for Karin and Usui\'s love.Okay, I have admitted that the romance isn’t the strongest element of the anime. But you know what is? The characters. All of Karin\'s family and friends has their own distinct personality and role in the main plot. Plus, similar to the general idea of the series, you could view most characters on two levels: in the lighthearted, comedic times, and in the serious. For example, there’s the anime exclusive Winner Sinclair. He both fills the role of the girl crazy foreigner, and enemy of vampires. We witness both his never ending stream of humor and his emotional tackling of his family’s duty. This duality is an excellent example of how a dramedy can work, as I’ve never seen a show where the characters can both expertly fill comedy and dramatic roles.It\'s quite easy to get attached to the characters of Karin. One very positive aspect is that no one gets sidelined during the series as the plot moves on, which makes it easy to get to know all of the characters as the series goes through its various arcs.In terms of art, the anime isn\'t particularly standout. The character designs are simple yet rather memorable. Some interesting aspects of the art style are some occasional stylizations. For example, due to censorship for broadcast, Karin\'s flowing nosebleeds had to be changed into flowers, but this gives the art a quirky feel. Especially considering we at first see a stream of blood-red flowers, which part to reveal a nightmarish bloody mess once it has settled. Yes, positive censorship! And another thing - this anime is quite ecchi. Fans of the manga may be shocked at the transformation, as the original source material had only some ecchi content. The opening of the anime begins with various shots of Karin posing naked.  Karin\'s breasts, already larger than average, have become much larger in the anime, even becoming somewhat of a plot point. Although this ecchi stuff didn\'t affect my enjoyment of the series in any way, it may deter some, considering the amount we are given.Sound as well is also not hugely remarkable, utilizing a range of songs to suit the mood of the scene. The opening and ending themes are quite catchy: I know I\'m not the only one who has been enamored by the simply indescribably fantastic ending theme ""Mou Hitotsu no Birthday"". Character voices suit the characters to their personality well. Special mention, however, should be given to the seiyu Sayuri Yahagi. Karin was her debut anime, and I feel she does a magnificent portrayal of the character.Karin doesn\'t try to overburden you with themes. It is simple in its declaration of true love between two people, which transcends species. Although the series takes a noticeable turn towards action towards the latter quarter of the series, the ending holds true the ideals of romance and comedy which have been sustained throughout the anime. While taking some deviations from the manga in order to make the transition to a half season anime while the manga still printed, these changes never really affected the heart of the series. I would recommend Karin for any fans of romantic comedies, and I promise that it\'s a breath of fresh air in an often unimaginative genre.', 'A refreshing romantic comedy that brings up a new concept to the table... reverse vampires.I thought it was silly at first but while I watched more and more episodes I realized it\'s not that silly as this concept is the basis for the humor. The story spins around Karin a high school girl with problems every teenager has as well as something more. She is an unvampire and eldest daughter of a family of regular vampires.That triggers several reactions from her family members that lead to funny situations.Whats more about the story and is not a spoiler is that it has a little bit of...everything, comedy tragedy romance and a little bit of action here and there with an ending that is a bit of a letdown.Vampires have always been a subject of interest to people, be it books or cinematographic productions.

One of my favorite characters was Anju because of her devotion to her sister (Karin) and the inclusion of Ren's personal story which completely differs from what the manga told you.Overall, I would recommend this series for anyone who...likes a light hearted comedy with vampires.

I consider it almost like the Twilight of anime Vampires though I did enjoy it. It has an interesting feel to it even though it doesn’t go for a normal vampire storyline.The characters are rather odd and are sometimes annoying. Karin is whinny, her friend Maki is a annoying little bitch that creates some of the trouble for Karin, her brother Ren is a womanizing whore, her father is a dotting father, and her mother is really abusive. It does make a lively bunch but sometimes a little two lively. It just doesn’t have much...structure except for the fact that Karin’s family does care for her even though they don’t act like it.The relationship between Karin and Kenta is pretty generic. Girl is in love with boy but clueless about it and same for boy even though everyone around them can tell that they are together. Even in the beginning, you can tell they were getting together.The artwork is pretty standard for slice of life school life specials. It just doesn’t stand out. I can understand why they call it Chibi Vampire and that’s because it’s really cutesy. I’m surprised that Shinbo, the person that did Dance in the Vampire Bund, didn’t direct this. There is a lot of times that Karin is naked (Although most of the time it’s more in expression of something) and even a lot of other characters. The only thing different then his works is that for a high school student, Karin is pretty stacked. The characters don’t really have a good profile. It just looks off. The water color ending is really cute and pretty.The English voices are alright, but one of the big let downs is how whinny Karin sounds. Everything she says sounds like whinning. Even Anju sounds more adult then Karin. Every word feels like an after school special for little kids. This does not work because of Ren’s little fun he does all the time. structure except for the fact that Karin’s family does care for her even though they don’t act like it.The relationship between Karin and Kenta is pretty generic.

This anime simply is not very good and drags on way too long. If it developed its poor story in the span of 13 episodes it might have received a higher score.Lets start with a quick overview of the story. Karin is about a vampire named Karin. She of course has a secret. She isn't the usual kind of vampire, she creates blood, can go out in daylight, likes garlic, can touch crosses and sleeps at night. She accidentally shows...her secret to a boy named Kenta who pledges to protect this secret and so our typical RomCom scenario begins. Not a bad start to the show.The problem is that for the first 13 episodes nothing much happens that would bring these two characters together. Both Kenta and Karin both have family issues and both in the span of those episodes try to confront them. These issues sound really intense but, the way they are handled makes it feel like the writes didn't really care. You wont know hardly anything about anyone except for Karin's grandmother who actually received several episodes dedicated to her.The last 11 episodes is where the story introduces some of the most aggravating situations, meaningless indecision, and meddling characters that one can imagine. Any time the story progress's a few steps with Karin and Kenta, side characters and conflicts come in to take multiple steps backwards. The last two episodes were plain stupid, forced drama which ended in nothing.There isn't much to say about the characters. The Maaka family looked interesting but there is no depth to them outside of the grandmother. Kenta's mother had a few issues that they teased but never elaborated on. Kenta himself is only interesting because of his eyes, being poor, and his estranged father. which all sounds very interesting but nothing is developed. The father issues are solved with about 2 minutes of dialogue and the rest are not really even problems it seems.The show really only has good points in the sound and art department. The art is well done, dated but really beautiful IMO. Karin is adorable and this is accentuated by her voice actress and the sound affects that coincide with he personality. This is the best part of the show and I love the moments when Karin is embarrassed and flaps her arms around.Overall I would have like this show if it was shorter. It took me a few days longer than it should have to finish this because I was so bored and the ending frustrated me so much it landed itself below the 5 marker.

When I wasnt watching Karin I wished Iwas watching Karin when I was sleeping I was dreaming that I was watching Karin and when I was watching Karin it was like I was in a trance and I had to force myself to occasionaly blink. Part of this was because I love vampires (not the ones that sparkle like off twilight) and this is the only vampire thing I have seen in a long time. And also because the anime and story are realy just that good.Story 10:...The story was very original and deep. I mean come on an unvampire thats almost as epic as the person who thought the leaf blower should blow out instead of in. But on a more serious note this story portrayed how less gory people like mysef believe that vampires drink blood to survive and not to drain you. So if you like the more feely side of a vampire this is definitely one of those type of shows. ( One of my favs when it comes to vampires :-) )Art 9: The art was basic animestuff. I always struggle when it comes to this part of the review with realy good anime because no anime I have ever seen realy struggles when it comes to art.Sound 10: Sound was very good and lacked nothing.Character 9: The characters were very good and all played into the plot well.

Hmm... I liked it, but it as no comparation to the manga! The story is too poor compared to it! If you like the characters, read the manga instead of watching the anime ;) ', 'Karin, not your typical vampire. She isn\'t really a blood-sucking vampire, I like to think of her as a blood-donor. I will tell you this, this anime isn\'t for everyone, and let me say this upfront, I didn\'t expect much from this in the beginning, like most people, I sat through the first 3 or 4 episodes just waiting for her to stop bolting away from Usui whenever he came into the scene, you know, something interesting. Luckily I started to enjoy it more and more after the first few episodes. It was funny, had an interesting story, good show overall.Story-wise, it doesn\'t fully unfold...until after, I\'d say episode 18 or 19. For the first 18 or 19 episodes though it\'s Maaka and Usui hanging out together, eating lunch together, falling in love with eachother, you know, like most romantic animes go. After those episodes though, it starts getting interesting, when vampire hunters come into the picture. Overall fairly interesting. Worth watching in all honesty.Artwork, I wasn\'t especially fond of the way some of the characters looked. Usui\'s eyes freaked me out, I felt like he was staring into my soul, Maaka\'s hair was kind of crazy, would have preferred it a little longer or straighter... but Anju... adorable. Her artwork was the best. Gotta love her!Maaka\'s voice got a little annoying at points, full of drama, even in the littlest things, like ""Oh no! Not another nosebleed!"". That kind of little, although in the show it might be a little bit larger of a problem then what you\'d think. Usui\'s voice was kind of slow, but I liked the actor. Rest of the voices were pretty good. Some were also a little quiet though.Characters, like I said, Anju is the best. She\'s the little sister anyone would want. She\'s cute, and she actually acts like a little sister would, she loves her siblings. Maaka was fine other then her dramatic personality, Usui was pretty cool, although if they make a remake of this show, you gotta fix his eyes. I can\'t go through the show without feeling like he\'s watching me. Other characters were funny, but good lord, how I hated Winter. He was the most annoying character I\'ve seen in a long time, and that\'s saying a lot considering the fact that Renge from Ouran High School Host Club was pretty annoying. He was cool later on in the show, but get a new hobby man, vampire hunting is seriously uncool.Despite the few negative things I told you about before, I liked this show a lot, in fact I enjoyed it a lot. Once Usui and Maaka got closer I started liking the show more and more. Ending could have been better, but hey, at least it was better then some of the other endings to animes. Overall, a good series. Like I said before, not for everyone, but give it a shot. At least get passed the first 3 or 4 episodes, then see if you like it.I hope this review helped. until after, I\'d say episode 18 or 19.

Karin is a really kawaii and loving high school girl. She is really helpful and can do ANYTHING for people  she cares about. She is a well wisher and gets embarrassed easily especially near Usui-kun. Not to mention she is extremely dense(like when Maki told her that she likes W-kun, Karin couldn't guess W-kun was Winner-kun). Keeping these aside Karin is also a vampire-bood sucking one. So, naturally she is the odd one out in her family. Her mother hits her with slipper, her brother...calls her uselss and failure. Anju, her little sister and Karin's father love Karin a lot and they both can reach extreme heights to protect Karin.All 4 people however, love Karin a seen in many episodes when Karin's mama doesn't have energy but she says 'I am fine. If it will be good for Karin, I am alright. If Karin will be a real vampire', Karin's brother, Ren even begs Usui to give Karin back to him, her father, Henry came to get her when she was taken to hospital even when he was burning from sunlight, Anju has shown most love for Karin in the show. She supported her and Usui throughout the series.She even woke up for 3-4 days to look after Karin.Karin was normal until Usui-kun's entry which started the show's romance and drama. At first Karin avoided Usui, she later decided to help him and finally fell in love with him. Kenta also firstly thought Karin to be odd person, he later became her nice friend and in the end of series fell head over heels for her.Winner-kun came as a obstacle in their relationship as he was infatuated with Karin. He called her, his ideal woman. He challenged Usui for duels everyday for Karin's love. Maki(Karin's bestfriend) saw this and fell for him. He however rejected her saying he could only see Karin and cannot fall in love with Maki.Instead of drama, romance, comedy and some creepiness, you will feel emotional in the last episode of the anime. Winner's grandfather, a vampire hunter stabs Karin's mother & father and shoots her brother right before Karin's eyes. Her mother speaks some sad lines such as 'Henry, take their care for me' and her brother tries to save Karin while he got shot(I literally cried for an hour after pausing the episode). I woudn't like an anime to end like this. In the end however, all members stand up and say 'Vampire's bodies are sturdy. Noway something like this would affect us', this left Karin and me in shock.The art is awesome too. I way Karin's jaw drops and the way her nosebleeds are shown like flower petals or pearls, it is really pretty. Karin's blush was kawaii too!!In characters, I think Karin did great job. Her mom who was strict, her dad who was over-protective regarding Karin and Usui's relationship, Anju, who I guess have sister complex and Ren-Karin's oh-so-hot-and-playboy brother(he might be a womanizer),Elda, Karin's grandmother who fell in love with Winner's ancestor but ended up believing humans and vampires cannot co-exist together,she later supported Karin with her and Usui's relationship,Maki-Karin's 24/7 available for help friend who at somepoint was jealous of Karin because Winner loved her. She later does everything she can to make Karin happy, Winner-a happy-go-lucky guy who is always thinking about Karin.The enjoyment started after few episodes. But it really was good. There was a regular suspense in the sory(like when Karin was goin to tell Usui she loves him but he suddenly told her to go back to her family and never see him again). It will continue you interest in th anime. It also told me that love is just love. You cannot help falling in love and when you do, you don't even care if the person is from a different species.

Setting aside the random detail of Usui´s stare, the story doesn´t really play into anything too unconventional. It´s plot and a lot of character interactions are...practically transcribed form the great book of clichés and the show seems to have little self awareness about it, as it takes such story elements far more seriously than an audience which is aware of them ever could. The usage of tropes doesn´t really make something bad, though, as it can be used as a platform to save time and focus on other things, but the way the plot takes itself so seriously in spit of the lack of attachment the characters have to it , makes it feel expendable and mostly just a way of parading the characters.By no means, however, are the characters bad. In fact, I would argue they are the best aspect of the show, which is excellent considering this is a romance, a genre which relies on how much and in which way we want characters to interact. Every character, in both isolation and in their relationship with the other characters feels unique and develops organically, which in turns allow you to not only root for them and their progression as characters (even the psychopathic doll) but also look back and suddenly feels nostalgic about those previous moments that you understand better and better over time. As far as characters go, the show is definitely cohesive and through, contrasting with the plot in that the tropes it does use are meaningful, whereas in the plot the tropes fill like just filler.With felt less cohesive was the mix of drama and humor in this show, which I think wasn´t handled too well. There was an intended progression into darker set ups as the show went along, and well, that much was accomplished, but the insistently repeated jokes that weren´t all that good to begin with (some jokes even being distinctly bad such as a certain Winner Sinclair) and the over the top reactions of pretty much every character to just about everything made the earlier goof feel exhausting and the usage of a plot saturated with cliché turns was enough to dismiss a lot of the drama for me. The first part did allow some contrast with Maaka´s sister, allowing her presence on screen to almost always feel like a breath of fresh air and while the drama wasn´t too effective as drama, it did make me think more deeply about the themes of the show: our nature as people. What makes you be you.This surprisingly deep and even more surprisingly well-explored thematic grants the show a whole layer of new potential. Whether you allow yourself to go with the tide and can enjoy the humor and drama as they go along without concerning yourself with the disparity or you choose to swim deeper into the river and find the golden themes at the bottom, the show has something for you to taste and to help you immerse in what the characters are going through. Even the ending allows the relief for those that follow through with the drama and also resolves the issue in a way that is rather consistent with it´s worldbuilding that far instead of pulling a deus-ex-machina. The only complaint about this I would have is that the answers the show appears to present to it´s conflicts are vague and dreamy at best which could be rather disappointing.Overall, Karin is a very ""middle"" show, good enough to be watched and enjoyed by almost everyone, excelling in the middle but being a little rough on the beginning due to us not caring enough about the characters yet and in the end , due to the repetitive content (unless you have a particular taste for certain themes or the humor of the show). It´s not something I´d go out of my way to recommend to anyone, but it is not a waste of time either , providing and enjoyable twist on the vampire romance trope. practically transcribed form the great book of clichés and the show seems to have little self awareness about it, as it takes such story elements far more seriously than an audience which is aware of them ever could.

I'm not sure what about it I am so drawn to, it could be the awesome artwork, the funny characters, or the overall romance and comedy. This anime has so much going for it, it's hard to choose one reason why I like it so much. Honestly, all I can say is that this anime is a 10 out of 10 and that I would recommend it to almost anyone. It is a bit bloody and a tiny bit perverted, but the story line is sweet despite this being an anime about vampires. The characters are hilarious,...if you really just need a good laugh, pop up an episode of this show and it'll do just the trick. if you really just need a good laugh, pop up an episode of this show and it'll do just the trick."", 'I think this is a really funny anime it has characters that fit and the parents you know the ones that are the awkward types. You have your over protective dad and you got a mom who likes to hit her husband the person i liked the most in the anime was the non vampire (karin) who would of guessed someone would make a anime of this but i think it could of done with a little more awkward moments but i really did like it i recommend this to kids 13+. ', 'I have to say that to some extent, I was disappointed, as I expected far more from this anime. Of course, don\'t get me wrong as I simply love watching anime that has a supernatural theme, with a hint of romance in it as well. But this romance part, is a bit too cliched and typical, like it is with most shows. We see Karin as she falls in love with Usui, and how their relationship develops in an awkward teenage love setting, as Karin tries to deal with managing her nosebleeds. None the less, it\'s just your typical love story, but with an addition...of the fact that Karin is a vampire that injects blood, and does the complete opposite of what you would expect from her character. Of course, the relationship is not in fact the strongest point of the anime. None the less, there are comedic moments, which in fact make up for this.On the other hand though, I have to admit that what truly made the show, what it is, is Karin\'s family. From the quite, reserved yet influential Anju, is always there for Karin. I liked her character in particular, as unlike the rest of her family, she is the one who seems to keep her cool the most. Unlike Ren, who loves flirting, and often gets scolded by his mother. Whilst her parents are found to be very opposite to each other, with her father being the ""softie"" whilst Karin\'s mother is who keeps everyone, and everything in check. Of course, we can\'t forget Elda, Karin\'s grandmother who with her almost girly attitude when it comes to Karin, is truly one of a kind of a character on the show. Which I suppose, is why I really like her character, as she truly stands out, especially when she is around Karin. It\'s almost like she has a split personality. Overall, I feel like the divide on how the characters are, is what truly makes this show what it is.As for the overall appearance of this show, it was interesting. From the colour pallets, to the art style of the characters, it was all fitting with the show. I have to say that, this art style has keep true to the original story, from the manga, even though it has strayed away the greater details, and it could have done so much better, if it kept more true to the manga story. of the fact that Karin is a vampire that injects blood, and does the complete opposite of what you would expect from her character.

First, why she had to be different from other vampires? That sounded so cliché, i would prefer Karin to be a normal vampire from the begginning.She didn´t needed to be different from others, a romance between a vampire and a human is very commun but between a special vampire and a human gets even more commun afterall.Second... I hated the ending. Unconsistent, fanservicing... and why that drama with the characters if in the end they... well... who...saw the anime knows what I am talking about. I was so wtf was that drama if they all were well?Elda romance story had a good concept that ended up not making too much sense.And Karin and Usui are not much of a strong couple.But of course there were some good points on this anime.The fact that the vampires are addicted to traits of a person is very well thinked (example: Ren with stressed people).Loved how the characters were all so different between them.Winner was annoying but I really shipped him with Maka.Karin`s voice was so annoying by the way... but I like the opening.And the art style is good, not the best, but plain good.My favourite characters of the show were Ren an Anju, brothers of Karin.I kinda crushed on Ren, I have to admit, and Anju was just adorable (lacks a little bit of personality but had the potencial).I also loved the bite scenes.Oh, one last thing... that chapter with ""Yaoi fanservice"" was just there because... no reason. Totally unecessary.In conclusion, it`s not a anime that I recommend.But if you don`t mind a little fruity anime with chibi vampires you can try to watch it and possibly you will enjoy it.Story - 5Art - 7Sound - 6Character - 5Enjoyment - 5Total score: 5 saw the anime knows what I am talking about.

I loved the inappropriate jokes that were slipped in periodically. However, sometimes they overdid it. Also, the title sequence is a little creepy. I loved Karin's family. However, it left me wanting more.The characters didn't develop enough, and the last episode had a terrible ending. The ending just ticks me off. I feel like recommending this show but at the same time.. I don't want to. Karin, the main character, I thought her personality was solid. Due to her being the main character; her personality had a chance to develop.However,...I really wish she wasn't an un-vampire. It made her seem pathetic because she acted like the most helpless girl in the world. Normal human girls can take care of themselves so, why couldn't Karin? Next, I'd like to discuss Karin's parents. Her mom Carrera, lacked a complete personality.Most of the time, she was hitting her family. However, when Karin truly needed her help; she was there to offer advice and protect her daughter at all costs. I really wish I could have seen more of Carrera.

I actually quit watching at episode 23 out of revolt at what was happening. The last episode is just a mockery of the whole series in my opinion and for nothing, it ends just as you would expect if the last 4 episodes didn't exist.This to me is raising the stakes for the sense of drama, and the cost of everything else. It's a terrible way of handling a series and wrecks what otherwise was a...great series overall for me.

It was a great series that crashed and burned amongst the hardest I've ever seen.

They live quietly, hidden away from their neighbours by a sort of psychic barrier, surrounded by their familiars. Their eldest daughter, Karin, has a problem. She doesn’t suck blood!She is a “Blood Maker” A sort of reverse vampire, who injects the surplus blood that her body produces into her “victims”. As her blood levels increase every month, Karin wanders the local park seeking suitable humans to bite. At other times, she is a normal 16 year old school girl, who is prone to fainting.When Usui Kenta transfers into the school, her problems increase many fold. She gets an abnormally strong vampiric reaction to his presence, which in her case means her blood increases very quickly. Things get really complicated when Kenta comes to her aid during one of her fainting fits, and discovers her secret! Her brother determines that it is his aura of unhappiness that is affecting her, and so when avoiding him doesn’t work, she launches an assault to make him happy.The two teenagers live out their strange lives, completely unaware that everybody else can see that they are falling in love. Then, another new transfer student declares his love for Karin. Only problem being, he is a student Vampire Hunter!Characters!Karin. (Voiced by Sayuri Yahagi)Karin is a vampire with a difference. She can go out in sunlight. Enjoys eating good food, and has to work to earn money to pay the bills since she is virtually the only member of her family who needs heat and light. Her Mother, Father and Brother are all normal vampires. Her younger sister hasn’t yet “awakened” to her full vampire powers. Karin has non of these powers. She can’t leap over buildings, erase memories, or summon bats as “familiars”. She has to do well in school, as a home visit from the teacher is a no-no! Her friends can never come round for sleepovers, and her “time of the month” is more stressful than most!Usui Kenta. (Voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi)Kenta is an only child in a single parent family. His father deserted him and his mother when he was little, and his mother said that he had died. Kenta knows the truth, as he saw his dad working around the corner from where they used to live. His mother tries hard, but keeps getting fired from any job she takes up. As a result, they have very little money. Kenta works as a waiter after school, and whenever else the Manager needs him, one of perks being free meals. He rarely eats during the day, in order to save money. A fact that Karin and her friend are quick to observe!Winner Sinclair (Voiced by Kouki Miyata)The last in a long line of vampire hunters, Winner takes his responsibilities very seriously, going out after school to protect the neighbourhood. This frequently gets him into trouble. He has been sent to Japan by his Grandfather, who is seeking the Maaka Family. In reality, he is totally hopeless as a hunter. When he arrives in school, he falls completely in love with Karin, saying that she is the exact image of his dream girl. We later find out that Karin is indeed his dream girl, as he was the first person she ever bit! The memory wipe performed by her family left Winner with a dream sequence of the event (with no biting). Winner has some tough choices to make when his Grandfather arrives to eliminate Karin and all her family!Maki (Voiced by Mikako Takahashi)Karin’s best, and possibly only, friend. Attractive and intelligent, she supports Karin in all her efforts, without understanding why since she has absolutely no idea that Karin is a vampire. There is a priceless point when Karin invites her for a sleepover to finish the holiday study work, and Maki wonders why she has never been over before. The family are at full alert to prevent their secret being revealed, but since vampires don’t need to cook, and can see in the dark, things don’t go that well. Maki falls in love with Winner soon after his arrival, but all her efforts to draw his attention go for nothing as he only has eyes for Karin!What did I think?I was quickly drawn in to Karin’s world, and galloped through the series in a matter of a few weeks. The story line was inventive, and the characters developed well throughout the series. Just as the story line started to become a bit predictable, a little twist was thrown in that caused interest to pick up again.The only jarring note was the character of Winner Sinclaire. Over dramatic, it became very apparent that he actually knew very little about vampires. His character seemed poorly developed, with no mention of his parents, or why he was living with his Grandfather. His voice really grated on me, and everything about him was just annoying. It came as no surprise to find out that he isn’t present in the original manga!Other than that, the series was a joy to watch. A gentle romance with plenty of humour. Despite the plethora of compromising situations, there is very little ecchi content. Karin’s nosebleeds are positively explosive, and her family’s reaction to their problem child underline their difference. They just can’t understand that she doesn’t enjoy biting people, and that she does it only as a last resort when her blood increases beyond her ability to control it.A great anime! 8/10 Synopsis!A family of vampires have set up home in a Tokyo suburb.

However.. around episode 6 everything became much more full, and enjoyable. If you want to see a nice romantic comedy, but warm at the same time, this is a very ncie episode!!! ', 'Karin was in my opinion a very good anime, I was hooked after a few episodes. To me, the story itself was unique because of Karin\'s condition. I honestly never would have thought of anything like that, so it gave the anime some origonality. I really enjoyed the develpoment of the relationship between Karin and Kenta throughout the anime. It had a nice pase that never felt like it was going ot fast or dragging on and being to slow, just a moderate pace that really added to the effect. I laughed out loud so many times while watching his anime,and I honestly don\'t do...that very often. It definatly had a big comical element along with the romance that overall made it rather enjoyable.The art was pretty good although I found it rather average. ""Kentas drawn kind of weird..."" was something that crossed my mind when he made his first apperence in the anime, but I learned later on that they way he was drawn was important to his role and certain scenes. One thing that in a way kind of bugged me was that Kain\'s grandmother looked younger then Karins parent\'s and to me that was a little odd, but other then that the art was good.But as for the sound, to me, was not as good as the rest of the show. I watched it dubbed and I personally found some of the characters voices kind of annoying. Aside from that the sound was ok.I thought that the character development in this manga was very good. As I said, I liked the development of Karin and Kenta\'s relationship, but also I really liked the bond between Karin and her little sister. Although it was there from the begining of the anime, it was cute and her little sister ended up being a much bigger part in the anime then I thought she would have been. Also, as the anime progresses, Winner Saint Clair comes into the picture and the fact that he is a vampire hunter and loves Karin was very ironic. He ended up being quite important too, and the relationship development between him and Karin\'s friend, although minimal, was cute.Overal I found this anime quite enjoyable and for anyone who wants to have a good laugh and see a nice romance anime, I would recomend you watch it ^.^ that very often.

This was very nicely done, but did not follow the manga on the later parts of the story (I decline the be the spoiler though).  The Manga storyline was way superior.Art.  Well, from years ago I guess this was the artistic style.  It is not as refined as more contemporary art.  But it is acceptable and does not ruin the story line.Sound.  This was very good and appropriate for all of the action events.  no complaint here.Character.  At first, the Dubbed in English characters seemed cheesy, but they correlated with the intended character development really well....It was totally on point!Enjoyment.  I for sure enjoyed this, but dinged it down 2 points because of the deviation from the original storyline.Overall.  This was worth watching and was a nice romantic story.  I was glad I took the time to watch it.  The only regret was that I did not see the original storyline.  Go read the anime for that--it is a worthwhile read. It was totally on point!Enjoyment.

The supernatural world of Karin gives the story a livelihood that can only be called humor genius. I loved how many vampire myths were dis-proven (or rather solved) in a funny matter, with even funnier explanations. Same goes for the eccentric characters.Plus the light action and Love romance allows for a sense of boundaries, not like a total random anime.I give this 8/10, but the romance could use just a lil' tweaking. =) "", ""I didn't get that interested in the anime.I couldn't get to far into the story when I found out it was different from the manga. I think the manga was so much better. In the manga the romance was sooo good, the comedy was really funny(I guess the show didn't do bad in it's comedy either,it was probably on par with the manga's comedy), and plot.Things like dramatic moments were done so well in the manga. Overall the story in the manga felt like a good romcom and by the end I was completely satisfied,so if you didn't like the anime due to the it...not having enough couple type of romance, definitely DEFINITELY read the manga :) not having enough couple type of romance, definitely DEFINITELY read the manga :)"", ""I watched Karin a while a go so I am a little shaky on the details, but hopefully this is accurate XD.Well I enjoyed the hell out of it. It follows a standard comedy romance progression but with the key differences thrown in from the Vampire/Reverse Vampire nature of Karin and her family. It is hilarious and definitely recommended, even if you happen not to be a huge fan of comedy romances (It was on of my first that I liked a lot). I am primarily a sub watcher, but I saw this in dub and still liked it so watch whichever is your preference.The...overarching story is nothing particularly special for the genre, focusing on the growth of the relationship between Karin and Usui (who shares a name with another of my favourite male protagonists, from Maid-Sama) but of course the problems caused by Karin's reverse vampirism gives a twist that both helps and hinders the two main characters relationships, and towards the end with Karin's family. Part way through the introduction of a new character adds additional interest to make sure the show isn't repetitive before reaching it's satisfying end. overarching story is nothing particularly special for the genre, focusing on the growth of the relationship between Karin and Usui (who shares a name with another of my favourite male protagonists, from Maid-Sama) but of course the problems caused by Karin's reverse vampirism gives a twist that both helps and hinders the two main characters relationships, and towards the end with Karin's family.

And all the situations next to that ;3 Only it sounds like she is comming when her blood flows out xD *ORGY*The animation is really great and looks beautifull! All the characters are original and to be honest, i would have love'd it if there where more episodes.Lucky the manga is still here! ^^ "", 'Summary: This one is a lot better than I thought. I planned on it being a straight forward ecchi/slice of life but it turned out to be a lot more than that. Each of the main characters gets a good amount of development, the concept of the ""unvampire"" is quite interesting and the romance is solid. Even though this feels like an overdone concept it had enough unique elements to make it stand out from the pack.You will like Karin if:You don\'t want excessive ecchi or any nudity.You don\'t care for the love triangle thing; this is Usui and Karin, no harem nonsense in this...one.You enjoy a diverse cast of characters who are a bit stereotypical (loli soft spoken doting younger sister, rough and masculine older brother, weak and caring/effeminate father, overbearing and strict mother, etc).You don\'t mind a slow build up; this anime has 24 episodes and it builds up pretty slowly att he start and keeps building until almost the credits.You want a show that wraps up nicely but doesn\'t necessarily give you a picture perfect level of detail into the characters after stories, a good example would be Mia-Hime.This story gets dark at times, things will not necessarily wrap up into a perfect story.All in all, if you want a nice romance/slice of life with a neat twist and a diverse set of characters you will enjoy this.Story 7 Art 8 Sound 7 Character 9 Enjoyment 8 Overall 8 one.You enjoy a diverse cast of characters who are a bit stereotypical (loli soft spoken doting younger sister, rough and masculine older brother, weak and caring/effeminate father, overbearing and strict mother, etc).You don\'t mind a slow build up; this anime has 24 episodes and it builds up pretty slowly att he start and keeps building until almost the credits.You want a show that wraps up nicely but doesn\'t necessarily give you a picture perfect level of detail into the characters after stories, a good example would be Mia-Hime.This story gets dark at times, things will not necessarily wrap up into a perfect story.All in all, if you want a nice romance/slice of life with a neat twist and a diverse set of characters you will enjoy this.Story 7 Art 8 Sound 7 Character 9 Enjoyment 8 Overall 8', ""This Anime show is my favorite anime ever!

"", ""Ok, well normally I don't tend to write reviews, but as a fan of the manga, and after finally getting around to watching the anime I thought I'd take a moment to write this for two groups of people: Those who didn't read the manga and are curious about this as a general rom-com, and those who did who want to see the anime.I'll keep this short and spoiler free.  This is just going to be a quick insight for what both groups should expect to see, and my reasons as to why I think you should or shouldn't watch this.I'll start with the...NON-manga readers.Given how this is a somewhat old show, you probably clicked on Karin's page based on a recent review, recommendation, or some other link on MAL's page.Let me say that if you enjoy rom-coms and vampires you'll probably enjoy this.  If you don't mind, or even enjoy older art styles then that's a bonus.  There isn't anything that really stands out about the show.  This is something to watch if you enjoy the full spectrum of rom-coms.  If you've only dipped your toes into a few shows, you probably wont care for this.My recommendation to all non-manga watchers is to go read the manga as soon as you're done this.  There are A LOT of differences and I truly believe you will find the manga to be much more interesting.Now, this part is addressed for the manga readers.If you're like me, you most likely read the manga first, and then found out there was an anime adaptation made and decided to check it out.  Well let me warn you, it falls very short of the manga.  It starts out as very faithful, but eventually it starts to head downhill a bit; introducing some anime only characters, anime only scenes, and twisting around a lot of the character's backgrounds and development.  Is it a bad thing in itself? Not exactly, which is why I recommended it to non-manga readers.However, in my opinion, the fact that they decided to stray away from the manga and make this mostly anime original content made the story fall short on a lot of levels.  I believe the story in the manga was a lot more intense and captivating, while the anime story was basically a generic rom-com, with some forced plot and drama towards the end.If you were wanting to watch this because you expected to see a faithful adaptation of the manga, then avoid this at all costs.  You will be severely disappointed.  But, if you wanted to watch it just for the sake of being a fan of the franchise in its fullest, then go ahead and do so.

It\'s ridiculous that he gets away with a lot of questionable things without consequences, it makes the show look so stupid.

It was later released for the PS2 with the adult contents taken out. Finally, the anime version was released in early January of 2008.They Are My Noble Masters (anime version at least) is safe to watch by any age group and both genders. In fact, I recommend anyone to watch it on their spare time. But ecchi-oriented viewers should be warned, the anime itself is pretty &quot;innocent&quot; so one might get disappointed if raising the ecchi...standard too high.

But in actuality this anime has a deeper story to it as first hinted on episode 1.Art:Both the artwork of the anime (characters, settings, etc) should not be disappointing to most viewers ... afterall if the artwork is terrible, I doubt the visual novel will be very good selling.Sound:The only department that's a bit lacking in my opinion. There just wasn't any theme song that is particularly outstanding that I can recall (sadly the OP and ED were so-so as well) ... NOT terrible, they are just okay (they do fit some scene occasionally).Character:Another one of the strong point of the anime. Through each little event in the series, character relationships are developed and over time one will come to understand the characters more and more ...in the end, one will have a good understanding of each uniquely developed character.Just to name an example:Why Shinra is attached to Miyu but not Yume was explained half way through the story. Later on they were able to talk things through and strengthen the bonds between them.Enjoyment etcI definitely enjoyed the anime a lot more than I first expected.

That pretty much sums it up and if any of you out there have watched a lot of harem, you'll know it's a rare thing when it has a story at all. What was great about this anime is that the story doesn't apologize for itself - it is what it is. The eldest sister, Shinra, is a weird cross between a tsundere and a deredere with potent perverted instincs. She's so unique, that she alone is worth watching this series.But the supporting cast minus maybe one or two characters are all well-developed...and you find you know them intimiately by the end of the series, which is another rare thing. The theme of this story is essentially this trio of rich sisters who lost their parents, taking on delinquents or orphans like them to become their butlers and make them a part of their family. And what's great is that this anime never loses that theme, not for a moment. Most anime will introduce a theme and then forget it two episode in in order to dispense with the cliched nuances of harem anime. So, by remembering the theme, this anime accomplishes so much. I wanted 30 more episodes of this anime simply for that reason. It was refreshing and I fell in love with the people.There were some minor problems. The relationship between Shinra and Ren could have been developed more, but the animators chose to put it off most of the time in order to stuff each episode with Shinra basically molesting her chief maid and her lolita-looking younger sister. It wasn't bad (it was very good, if you get me. hehe), but romantics might be a little disppointed until the last episode. Also, as mentioned before, this series was just too short, but it's because it was so good. So it's a win/lose proposition.I would recommend this to any guy. (I just don't see how girls could enjoy this.) It's certainly among the best out there and considering it was released in 2008, I'll have my fingers crossed for a second season. and you find you know them intimiately by the end of the series, which is another rare thing.

This review is from a man who has watched it first, I would probably have given this a higher rating if I had watched this first.Story: Your basic maid/butler story. Ren and Mihato have ran from their home and looking for a job, and all of a sudden, they find themselves working as butler/maid for the ultra-rich Kuonji family. Based on an Eroge, it contains scenes that shows relationships between Ren and all those sisters. I like how they gave enough attention to all of the chars.7/10Art: Not very good, and the...scenes where they &quot;tried&quot; to make comedic moments were sometimes not-so-well drawn. Despite that, I think they've found amusing ways to censor nudity^^ Average drawing+ good ways to censoring = Not the best, but not the worst either.7/10Sound: Definitely not good. The seiyuu cast usually lacks emotions. You all know the scenes where something strange happens and a character changes their voice to mark some entertaining remark. Well, it just doesn't happen right in this anime. This may just be because I'm watching Lucky Star again (which has an awesome seiyuu cast,) but they really aren't the best. Background music was average. OP wasn't that bad, but I certainly didn't wait for it to finish. The ED wasn't so bad too, mainly because I listened to it every episode (due to various reasons &gt;_&gt; guess why ^^)5/10Characters: The Kuonji family were unique in my opinion, and they really provided me a reason to watch this anime (other than ecchi.) What I didn't like was that the others didn't have good backgrounds. Ren's background is the same as Hayate's, Mihato acts too much like Maria-san (calm looking but can be very dangerous,) and also the cooking scenes where she cuts various animals and we see blood is too much like psycho Kaede (Shuffle!)8/10Enjoyment: As a healthy young man, I enjoyed watching the ecchi moments. I didn't realise that I like this anime until it finished (which really left an empty hole in my heart.) I think I liked watching one episode a day, it was about the right amount for my daily ecchi needs.9/10Overall: Please, do not ask me how I got 8 for overall while I have two 7s and a 5. Lets call it being a man. Ecchi gave me enough reason to watch, the Kounji sisters made it interesting enough, and the end made me want for more (and made me want for its eroge - not translated yet unfortunately.) My advice would be to watch this before Hayate no Gotoku or other animes that have very powerful seiyuu cast.8/10 scenes where they &quot;tried&quot; to make comedic moments were sometimes not-so-well drawn.

My advice would be to watch this before Hayate no Gotoku or other animes that have very powerful seiyuu cast.8/10"", ""If you are looking for the usualharem/shonen romance/ecchi anime, this ain't it.But it was a good weird and spontaneous romancestory.One, there are only sporadic content of ecchi in there.Save for Shinra Kuonji's occasional tease and some othergimmicks, not much ecchi content. And that is not necessarily abad thing. It allows the story to expand beyond the scopeof the visual novel....But, the producer could have done better. The storyline was notplanned out, and was very sporadic, with too many filler episodesfor a short series. What drives the story forward? It should be Ren'srelationship with the other girls. But, little progression is made at the emotionalor psychological level. There is a huge social gap between both sides.The character planning could have been better, but since this camefrom a visual novel, you could not have expected anything but one malecharacter along with a huge ensemble cast of girls.Artwork is pretty well done, and there was no action, no pan shots, noheroic shots. But it was well done for this genre. The animation studiodid a nice job touching up this anime. The characters look like repeats fromother series except for Shinra. She seems to be fresh design, and I think thatdesign will be used in the future for other independent female designs.To conclude, good anime to watch on the plane, or something. Don't waste yourprime time or money on this But, the producer could have done better. The storyline was notplanned out, and was very sporadic, with too many filler episodesfor a short series.

From the start of the anime the protagonist even states that everyone in this house is ""so strange, and unique"". Everyone compliments one another and for a bunch of insanely rich girls they are actually very thoughtful and kind.I honestly thought this was going to turn out to be one of those anime where the rich girls enslave the protagonist and make him work hard and over time warm up to him. It...actually turned out that they were all generous, and loving from the start which was a nice change of pace.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in it. actually turned out that they were all generous, and loving from the start which was a nice change of pace.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in it.', 'Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de is hard to descibe. The closest thing this can be described to is Shuffle! It has a solid story, the art is good (with the exception of crowds) Some nice character progression through the story. The voice acting is exceptional. But what makes this anime truely brillant is the references to other shows. Its hard to quote due to spoilers. If you consider yourself a fan of anime then this is a must. A few references include Guren lagann, Shuffle and Fruits basket. And these are only a few, there are several per an episode. And the...good thing is it never feels forced.I feel this is a must watch as it is consistently funny, and ebraces the rest of the industry good thing is it never feels forced.I feel this is a must watch as it is consistently funny, and ebraces the rest of the industry', 'As usual, forgive my english. Being french makes my english sucky sometimes.BTW: SPOILERS this review might contain.Being a butler is no easy job... all the cleaning, the washing, the exigencies of your masters and... the hilariousness that you can get.Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de, also known as They are my Noble Masters (let\'s just call it TAMNM), is truly a good show for the target audience and the genres it wanted to touch. Me, mecha/sci-fi fan walked on this anime with this mind set: I want a mindless show that will entertain me, without being annoying. TAMNM did it perfectly!! Never had...I so much fun watching a mindless ""harem/romance/parody"" anime. Now let\'s get to the review please.Story: huh... none. Read the synopsis and you pretty much get the story. This show never tried to force you a story. You can of course see that the story follows a path of going to point A to point B. It also makes sense, but it\'s not one continuous story. The setup for Ren and Mihato is very well done. Instead of having them just appearing out of nowhere in this crazy mansion, they give almost a complete episode before they actually start working as butler and maid. Having Ren being beaten up by his father and running away from home later was a good sad atmosphere at the beginning of the show. For the most part, this is an episodic show. Nothing that makes it stand out, but it makes sense. 7/10Art: The animation is nothing that stands out, but the character designs are very good. Really too much to say, it\'s just good art in general. 8/10Sound: Meh... generic soundtrack. It has a weird, but funny, mix of music that ranges from Classic music to almost Heavy Rock. Nothing impressive and the OP/ED were just not good. 6/10Characters: This is where TAMNM did his job flawlessly. A lot of ground to cover in this section. Prepare yourself.Ren: He is your anti-lead for a romance/harem/slice of life anime. First of all, he\'s hot-blooded which makes him absurdly epic sometimes. He\'s a man of decision. He\'s willing to become a better butler for the sake of never had to go back to home again. Of course, he gets embarrased over some things, but he eventually gets over that and that makes him stand out of the bunch of pussies in other animes *cough* Aono Tsukune*cough* *cough*Rito Yuuki*cough* *cough*Shinji Ikari*cough*. Thumbs up Ren, you were awesome.Shinra-sama: The first child in the Kuonji family. She\'s incredibly colorful. Charismatic, beautiful and mysteriously attractive. She\'s so awesome. She loves to tease the people that she loves and you can definitely see that in the anime. The things that she does are ridiculously funny and when she gets serious, it is at least credible. Of course, they are two parts in the anime that I think she didn\'t make the right decision, but at least at the end *SPOILER* she kisses Ren with one of the most intense and straight forward kiss ever. *END OF SPOILER* That character did her job with a perfect score.Mihato: Crazy sister, but funny crazy sister. The fact that she admits having a brother complex right from the start makes all her actions believable. She really loves her brother as much as he loves her. That\'s another thing that stands out in this anime. They show you their very deep love for each other, but without having to go in an incest route. She\'s willing to let him go, but she gets depressed when she cannot spare some moments with him and that is understandable. But she never gets in the way for character developments making her a very likeable character.Natose: God, I love her. She is so likeable, always trying to do her best, supporting Ren in his work, giving him advice, etc. She\'s a perfect balance of hilarious moment and also serious moment (and that\'s the moment you don\'t F with her). The fact that she likes Ren, but only as brother, makes that show a ""different"" experience compared to the traditional harem show. That character is up there. Her backstory was also kinda sad, being the only survivor of a tsunami and seeing all her family dying without being able to do anything was touching.Miyu: The second sister of the Kuonji family. At the first, I thought she was going to be the generic girl that looks like a little kid, but in fact is an genius and annoys everybody with her boastfulness. I was completely wrong. She\'s a grown up adult, but has her cute moments. The fact that her own sister calls her loli is hilarious, when she\'s probably the most mature character in the show. She likes Ren, but never to the point of love, which breaks yet again the traditional harem route. She doesn\'t have any shame and the moment when she\'s getting almost molested by Shinra makes her hilarious and like the others, a very likeable character.Yume: The third and last sister of the Kuonji family and probably the most invisible out of the three. She sees herself as an invisible person that doesn\'t have a strong character, which is kinda true. But she is a fluffy person and when she is in the screen, she does have a presence and you like her. She doesn\'t stand out, but she\'s not annoying and you feel good for her at the end.Benisu: That\'s the Tsundere of the show. She\'s looking down upon Ren, but eventually likes him. Her backstory is probably the main reason why she acts the way she does. That character was funny and interesting at times, but she also got in my nerves at some points. I just want to mention that her voice is done by someone who does a lot of hentai and it shows in episode 12... In the end she was just a good character.Ageha: I LOVE HER TO DEATH!! Again, first impression is never the right one. I thought she was going to be the generic evil bitch, but it turns out very differently. She is, along with Shinra, the only character that develops an affection to the point of love over Ren. Instead of being evil, she\'s the hot-blooded female of the show. Very strong, very strict, but she is able to acknowledge the efforts of people around her and giving rewards for that. I was happy that she got an arc devoted only to her and Ren and I was also happy that she takes a backseat for the rest of the series while still being around sometimes. That way, she doesn\'t get in the way for the other characters to develop. She said that she will never give up on Ren, but they didn\'t make this the focus, parting away again from the traditional harem show.Colonel: That guy was so epic. The head butler of the family and you can see why. Handsome, useful, polite, strong and for the most part, hilarious. His voice sounds so good and he\'s such a good butler. Nothing much to say about him other that he was instantly loveable character.Now for the others.Chiharu: That ""guy"" is the biggest trap in anime ever. He sounds like a girl, he looks like a girl and he has the hairs of a girl. He\'s just missing some tits and has a d**k in the way.De Niro: An extra bonus. He\'s not useful to this series, but he\'s funny for the most part.Anastasia: Punish me more.Kojuurou: That guy was ridiculously hilarious and he\'s voice by one the greatest seiyuu ever (Nobuyuki Hiyama)Iwao: A sorry father. He\'s a total douchebag, because he cannot express himself correctly. He, fortunately, redeems himself at the end.In the end, the cast of characters deserves a 10/10. They really did make the show for me.Enjoyment: I loved that show. It was so mindlessly entertaining!! The biggest thing that I loved about this anime was the fact that they never wasted time. The show moves at a fast paced, which gives the chance to see more and more as the show progress. I was also pleased that it was only 13 episodes. Otherwise, fillers this anime would have been full off. This anime beats Sekirei in my terms of a show that was mindlessly entertaining. I also watched this anime with the mind-set that it was going to put mindless. After watching all those serious shows (Legend of the Galactic Heroes for example) it was very refreshing. Good job TAMNM!! 9/10Other: I would like to mention the multiple references to other anime this show has made (G Gundam, Gaogaigar, Initial D, Prince of Tennis, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and others). The hilarious jokes of G Gundam with Gaogaigar are well placed, because of Tomokazu Seki (Domon Kasshu), Yousuke Akimoto (Master Asia) and Nobuyuki Hiyama (Viral / Gai Shishio). This three combinations of hot-blooded seiyuus was a great add to this series. I also enjoyed the fact that if you ay very carefully, there is only two characters that are in LOVE with Ren and that is Shinra and Ageha. The others certainly like him, but not to the degree of love. To wrap things up, I would like to give congratulations to Shizuka Itou (Shinra) and Rie Tanaka (Ageha) for providing great performance.Overall: Everybody who\'s tired to watch shows that needs you to keep your brain open, go watch this show on auto-pilot mode. This is without a doubt a show that I will rematch when I will feel the need to relax. I really recommend it to everybody that has an interest for a stupid-but-yet-great anime.In the end 8/10 (but if I go with what my heart thinks, 9/10) I so much fun watching a mindless ""harem/romance/parody"" anime.

Jojo & Akagi detailed faces to the anime references in general have higher detail). Overall, the animation is nothing to gush about, it\'s just ""decent"".In terms of voice acting, there tends to be some squeak here and there (Yume\'s voice actor Asuka Minamori to Mihato Uesugi voice actor Hitomi), but the voice acting is pretty decent with plenty of shouting attacks to ojouness from Shizuka Ito and Yuko Gotou and LA\'s bias comes in this anime but once again Shizuka Ito was LA\'s favourite voice actor in this series.The ending finally addresses the two characters LA wanted to get developed, Ren and Shinra with their family issues (which was both hinted at multiple times) and like the other more focused character development arcs, this takes centre stage as well bringing in more depth to the two and utilizing both of Ren and Shinra\'s same issues and drama\'s together, however Shinra\'s resolution was handled a bit janky compared to Ren\'s, nonetheless the ending was ""ok"" enough as Ren and Shinra\'s major plotlines gets resolved.Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de is your typical butler parody anime with strong character development outside of the anime references gags and character jabbing. As for LA, LA thought it was actually a slow paced anime (to get things set up obviously) at first but it got better once the character development episodes/arcs entered, the fanservice slightly surprised and unfazed LA throughout. Once the anime really got into the meat of the character development arcs they gave the characters depth outside of their stereotypical archetypes and gave some pretty well drama throughout the cast as well.You thought it was Shinra Uesugi voiced by Shizuka Ito would be LA\'s favourite character, but it was me Miyu Uesugi voiced by Yuko Gotou! (Seriously, LA has no idea why, Shizuka Ito being an ojou with the character design typical of Shizuka Ito...Shinra SHOULD BE LA\'s favourite character in this series, yet Miyu took LA\'s 1st, Shinra warmed up to LA by the final 3 episodes but still Shinra takes an easy 2nd, with Benisu as a 3rd favourite).If STILL the full nudity fanservice gets you squeamish then LA would recommend Hayate the Combat Butler instead, but if your ok with the fanservice LA mentioned before, then Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de is a good choice.Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de maybe a parody at first but dig deep into the wacky main cast and you\'ll get more than a parody, you\'ll get an anime still wanting to tell the main cast\'s story with all the drama and character backstories it gives...comedy and all. or not, but since LA watched many anime to get the references, the anime jabbing fun at the characters with the parody references can be rather funny...at times, as for character jabbing it\'s typical from your ""bleached underpanted adult visual novel adaptation"" with the main protagonist get rag-dolled and punched around.In terms of characters, they are your typical butlers and maids in anime, as in their almost inhuman like due to their strength and capabilities to do whatever they\'re masters wanted, this especially goes to the main protagonist Ren Uesugi voiced by Tomokazu Seki and Mihato Uesugi Ren\'s older sister voiced by Hitomi and Yasushi ""Colonel"" Tajiri voiced by Yousuke Akimoto, but in terms of character development we do get some character arcs/episodes that give the main cast a bit of depth and why their behavior and personality are what they are, such character examples being Benisu voiced by Hyosei (her personality and how she got employed to the Kuonji\'s), Yume Kuonji voiced by Asuka Minamori (her ""identity crisis"" by that her not having an identity from the wacky characters in the cast), Mihato and Ren\'s family issues (With Ren the main protagonist getting his own separate character development of trying to be the best butler and learning from his mistakes) and the odd one enough of Ageha Kuki voiced by Rie Tanaka who had a cameo in Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! but got an entire 3 episode arc about her backstory and relationship with her own butler Kojuuro Takeda voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama in this anime, nonetheless the character development is properly focused on the characters that needed it with some minor characters like the Colonel and De Niro (Miyu\'s sentient robot) just being ""support"" characters.Now this is a parody anime with the focus on characters rather than the plot and LA can get behind this as the plot revolves on the characters so character development and it\'s comedy is key and for a typical butler anime then it succeeded in the basics.The fanservice however is rampant with characters mainly Shinra and Miyu being either full naked or half naked (top only) but as LA said, this is an anime with bleached underpants, thus the fanservice levels doesn\'t getting any higher than full nudity, if your squeamish about that stuff, then best not touch this anime.In terms of animation by A.C.G.T, the animation is decent enough from the character designs to background set pieces, but it doesn\'t get any better than that except for all the parody anime gags that this anime in which the detail NEEDS to go up (eg.

(Seriously, LA has no idea why, Shizuka Ito being an ojou with the character design typical of Shizuka Ito...Shinra SHOULD BE LA\'s favourite character in this series, yet Miyu took LA\'s 1st, Shinra warmed up to LA by the final 3 episodes but still Shinra takes an easy 2nd, with Benisu as a 3rd favourite).If STILL the full nudity fanservice gets you squeamish then LA would recommend Hayate the Combat Butler instead, but if your ok with the fanservice LA mentioned before, then Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de is a good choice.Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de maybe a parody at first but dig deep into the wacky main cast and you\'ll get more than a parody, you\'ll get an anime still wanting to tell the main cast\'s story with all the drama and character backstories it gives...comedy and all.', ""Review #3: Kimiaru/They Are My Noble MastersStory 6/10 -- The story for this anime is very underdeveloped. There isn't much of a plot or long story, and it's more of a daily event anime that relies on comedy rather then actual story. The past is mainly focused on or hinted in this series, but the future seems rather uncertain. The story could of created more intrigue, as there was a few exciting events in this anime, however since this is based off an eroge, it seemed to me like it was struggling in choosing a genre to focus on in the storyline.Art 7/10 --...Not Sure how the art compares to other animes from 2008, but to me it seemed average and i noticed a few mistakes here and there. The mansion has a beautiful exterior, and the city landscape was nice however. The character art is average, but there is some uniqueness with the style.Sound 7/10 -- No Complaints for me about the sound. The acting is normal, OP is decent, and background is fine.Character 8/10 -- The Reason im giving character an 8 is because I liked the style the characters had in this series. Each character has there own funny quirk/personality that make them likable, and the backgrounds and pasts of each character blend in rather well. The macho butler is funny when he has screen time, and i support the little side romances this anime had on the side.Enjoyment 7/10 -- For an anime that came out a decade ago, I was pretty content when I first watched the series. There was some decent comedy, and the relationships between the character were nice to watch. The head butler makes things interesting with his awesome action moves, and the random comedic stints were done alright for an anime of this time. I liked Rin's character, but was annoyed with a few of his decisions.Overall 7/10 -- The anime lacks a solid story, but the characters mixed in with the daily life comedy is a pleasant substitute for that. Art and Sound is average, but this anime is a solid 7, and its based off a visual novel eroge. Time is an important motif in this anime, and the past haunts all these characters, but they overcome it as a rich household family of maids, butlers, and ladies.~Castawayz Not Sure how the art compares to other animes from 2008, but to me it seemed average and i noticed a few mistakes here and there.

Two people run away from home to escape an abusive father. These two people are brother and sister,their names are Ren Useugi and Mihato Useugi, and they have nowhere to go. So guess what! They run to the city to find work! Their young dreams of freedom flowing in their minds, they search all around the city for any source of jobs that provide a place to stay. While searching for work, a middle school looking girl is talking to her miniature egg-shaped robot. She has a large sun hat on top of her head and...she takes it off, suddenly she begins to faint! The brother catches her in mid-fall, and asks where she lives. She gives the directions to her house, and they arrive at a Mansion! Their lives will forever be changed by this event!They find out that the girl is in fact not a middle schooler, but a 20 year old who looks like one. She is also the sister to one of Japans greatest orchestra conductors, Shinra Kuonji, and her name is Miyu Kuonji. Ren's sister, being the observant one, notices all the servants working in the house, and suggests to her brother that they should try to get a living in job at the mansion. After an event (No spoilers for you!) they become servants in training!The anime goes on to how Ren handles the curious events that unfold at the Kuonji household, such as a game of Capture the Flag to, or training to become a better butler (of which some training methods would be thought to be harsh by human standards).Also on a side note, this anime is moderately ecchi, with few episodes being innocent while others not quite so. Comedy is present throughout the anime. Basically this anime is a Romantic-Comedy, so if you enjoy those, you will definitely enjoy this animeThe Kounji Sisters:Shinra Kuonji- Eldest sister, one of Japan's famous orchestra conductors, and has a love for cute things, of which she often teases her younger sister Miyu and Ren the main character.Miyu Kuonji- Middle sister, very intelligent, and is often declaring herself to be the classy one, Miyu does not like how Shinra sometimes almost molests her everyday or so.Yume Kuonji- Youngest sister, still attends high school, she is the shy and easily embarrassed one of the sisters, but she has a love for manga, and hopes to write a successful one of her own.The Servants of the house are as followed:Benisu- head maid of the Kuonji  Mansion, also is often seen with a lesbian like love for Shinra.Natose- personal attendant of the youngest of the Kuonji sisters, Yume, she has a dog-like feel to her.Colonel- Head butler, and former special ops officer, seems to have almost superhuman abilities and powers.De Niro- the egg-shaped robot who serves as Miyu's personal attendant.Chiharu Kiyohara- the cliche female looking male character that is often not included in half the episodes and has little time or importance in the animeOther Characters who serve actual purposes:Ageha Kuki- One of Yume's friends and another rich girl, she has a scar on her face, and falls in love with Ren, often gives food out as a reward for good deedsKojūrō Takeda- Ageha's personal butler, who is basically a masochist for Ageha's punches.The Story is actually good for an ecchi anime, the art is great, sound is almost perfect, the characters are diverse and exceptional, enjoyment was really good.

Hoshi no Koe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe,"[""Another hidden gem gets reviewed.I randomly picked this DVD up at Blockbuster's Anime section and expected nothing much from it and 25 minutes later I was ...... !!!!!! The next day I told 10 people about this movie. That's how much it *got* to me.Hoshi no Koe ~The Voices of a Distant Star~, is essentially a story of a long distance love and mail messages between a boy and girl. The movie is really short, but in that time you discover that the two of them are friends, the girl is sent out with space forces, but they &quot;text&quot; each other. As time passes (on...earth) the boy will age quicker than the girl who is millions of light years away.If you've ever been separated from a loved one by time or distance, this movie will resonate very strongly with you. Prepare the Kleenex. You won't really cry because the movie is sad, you'll cry because of ... sheer longing and wishing and other emotions, please watch the movie and you'll understand what I mean. It's a Masterpiece.The movie's sheer ability to pack that much emotional punch into a 25 minutes ~ now THAT is story-writing talent. It totally disproves the myth that movies have to be long to have good character development.What is even more amazing is this entire anime was done by 1 man with 1 Apple Mac. He and his wife provided the voice acting for both characters. The man is Makoto Shinkai. I made a vow to follow his career. Since Hoshi No Koe his career has taken off, he is the talent behind &quot;The Place Promised in Our Early Days&quot; and &quot;Byousoku 5 centimeter&quot;.

Reviews praised it and I assumed that it must be good. Well you know what they say about assuming.Story:Right off the bat I was unsure about the story. I liked the concept of love separated by distance as it worked quite well in 5cm Per Second, but the idea of lagging text messages is just ludicrous. You'd think that in the year 2046 we'd have invented a more effective form of communication, but I guess Shinkai Makoto didn't think...so. Also look at the phones! No effort was made to even design phones that even had a hint of futuristic technology. Oh yeah, they could invent gigantic, space traveling, mechas, but more advanced forms of mobile communication devices are out of the equation! Moving on, the story gets no better from beginning to end and nothing is resolved. Practically no attempt is made to even strengthen the audience's true understanding of the connection that Nagamine and Noboru share. They just sort of tell you that they like each other and expect that to mean something. The years fly by without any coherent sense of meaning and the progression of time ends up not feeling quite right. Things don't change drastically enough for Noboru or Nagamine for me to even care. The story is just a mess. A pretentious, self-indulgent, mess. 5/10Art:First impression was a mixture of confusion and disgust. The characters are HORRIBLY designed. From scene to scene, depending on the angle, they look so different that I sometimes couldn't realize if they were one of the leads or a new character. Proportions were also SO off at angles that I had to really try to resist the urge to punch the screen out of anger. Emotions don't quite come across as clearly as I would expect which just compounds with all the other flaws making this OVA nearly unwatchable. The space battle scenes actually stand out as the best art in the OVA, but the doesn't mean anything. The mecha designs and animation is average and uninspired. Yawn. 3/10Sound:The sound in this also blows my mind at just how horrible it is. You know how bad the music is? So bad I can't even remember what it sounded like. I can't even remember what if there WAS music in this! And the seiyuu are as lacking in emotion as the Twilight movie actors. The sound effects in the space battle scenes are average, just what you'd expect for that kind of thing, so they leave no impression whatsoever. 3/10Characters:There were characters? Really? I just thought there were talking slabs of painted wood. Not that they had much to say. The characters are just so lacking in any relatable emotion since the OVA didn't spend enough time establishing the nature of Nagamine and Noboru's relationship to make the audience give a car that they are separate. I'd like to see what exactly they love about each other. Noboru is a distant, blank, emotionless guy and Nagamine is a clingy, whiny, child. Neither are developed and both are just without any sort of distinguishing personality. And the whole lack of ANY other characters just blows my mind. Really. 2/10Overall:5 Centimeters Per Second is, to this day, one of my favorite anime movie/OVAs of all time and I think, since it came after this abysmal pile of filth, that Shinkai Makoto is a very talented man. He knows how to establish atmosphere and characters, situations and emotions that you can relate to. He brought none of his skills in these areas to this OVA. Flat characters, a ridiculous premise, emotionless seiyuu and horrible art all make this one of the WORST anime ANYTHINGS I've ever seen. I will never understand how so many people could enjoy this trash, but they can if they want. I do not suggest watching this. Save your time for Shinkai Makoto's other works as they are worth the investment. 4/10 so. Also look at the phones!

The faces especially tend to be distorted and...out of shape though some of the landscape shots were pretty breathtaking. The plot is also pretty normal and if summarised is nothing special. In the short amount of time we spend with the 2 main characters, we don't really find out much about their history or motivations driving them.With all these flaws then, why does this film deserve a 10/10, a PERFECT score??Makoto Shinkai (the director) somehow takes these somewhat mediocre elements, mixes them together and then turns them into an amazing film which is greater than the sum of its parts. Somehow, despite the mediocre and simple art, you really get a sense of the vast emptiness of space, and the loneliness and isolation that Mikako feels as she is separated further and further from Noboru by both distance as well as time. Somehow, despite the limited characterisation, you really come to understand how strongly they feel - their despair, their love, their hope. And to top it all off, Makoto Shinkai somehow did all this on his own using a home computer in 2002, when most people were still discovering how to use a computer to surf for porn and such.Hoshi no Koe is a movie about feelings, and how it conveys these feelings so forcefully in 20 minutes is truly impressive. out of shape though some of the landscape shots were pretty breathtaking.

However, since it was in fact only made by one person, it does have its fair share of flaws (some more prominent than others).Story: (8 / 10)The story is simple. Two childhood friends are separated, but try to stay in contact with each other, even as the distance between them grows. This creates a rather...emotional love story, and it does it all in the short time period of 25 minutes.Because it’s so short, there’s not too much to say about it, but Shinkai did a great job of delivering a story like this.Art: (8 / 10)The art is by far one of the biggest shortcomings of this OVA, and yet it’s so beautiful, all at the same time. Hoshi no Koe uses a mix of 2D and 3D-animation, mostly using the latter for the mecha and spaceships, while characters and backgrounds remain 2D. The backgrounds are fantastic, and looks so good, but this is where the problem comes in. With such beautiful backgrounds, it’s rather weird that the characters look so... bad. It really feels like there wasn’t nearly as much time put in for the character art, and it’s really noticeable.It wasn’t too much of a problem though, as all the other aspects of the art (and OVA in general) will take your mind off the character designs before you know it.Sound: (8 / 10)There are (apparently) two versions of this OVA. One where Shinkai and his wife did all the voices, and one which had proper voice actors. I watched the former, which obviously means the voices weren’t as well done as they could have been. Some lines of dialog just felt stale, but this is also a (very small) problem which quickly fades in comparison to the rest of the OVA.The OVA has a very emotional piano-centered soundtrack, which really helped bring out the emotions in every scene. The music in itself is fantastic, and the credits song, “Through the Years and Far Away”, is an absolutely beautiful song that really captures the tone the OVA set.Characters: (7 / 10)When you only have 25 minutes to tell a story, it’s quite obvious that there won’t be time for a lot of character development at all. Nonetheless, the characters felt real, and somewhat relatable (I’ve never been in a similar situation myself, so it’s hard to tell). What I did like, however, is how there are no supporting characters, really emphasising that this is the story of these two friends, separated in time and space, and introducing new characters which we’d have to develop emotions and care for would’ve probably taken away a lot of the feelings you get when watching this.Enjoyment: (8 / 10)I really enjoyed this OVA, and how it manages to do what it does in such a short time. It was rather emotional and sad at times, but not to the point where you’ll find yourself crying uncontrollably.Conclusion:If you have 25-30 minutes on your hands, and/or you’re simply a fan of these types of movies (5CPS, Promised Place) then I’d highly recommend you watch this.Pros:+ Tells a great love story in a very short amount of time.+ Fantastic soundtrack.+ Nice mix of 2D and 3D-animation.+ Beautiful backgrounds.-----------------------Cons:- Character art really falls short.- Voice acting can feel a bit “off” at times (due to not having real VA’s) emotional love story, and it does it all in the short time period of 25 minutes.Because it’s so short, there’s not too much to say about it, but Shinkai did a great job of delivering a story like this.Art: (8 / 10)The art is by far one of the biggest shortcomings of this OVA, and yet it’s so beautiful, all at the same time. Hoshi no Koe uses a mix of 2D and 3D-animation, mostly using the latter for the mecha and spaceships, while characters and backgrounds remain 2D. The backgrounds are fantastic, and looks so good, but this is where the problem comes in. With such beautiful backgrounds, it’s rather weird that the characters look so... bad. It really feels like there wasn’t nearly as much time put in for the character art, and it’s really noticeable.It wasn’t too much of a problem though, as all the other aspects of the art (and OVA in general) will take your mind off the character designs before you know it.Sound: (8 / 10)There are (apparently) two versions of this OVA. One where Shinkai and his wife did all the voices, and one which had proper voice actors. I watched the former, which obviously means the voices weren’t as well done as they could have been. Some lines of dialog just felt stale, but this is also a (very small) problem which quickly fades in comparison to the rest of the OVA.The OVA has a very emotional piano-centered soundtrack, which really helped bring out the emotions in every scene. The music in itself is fantastic, and the credits song, “Through the Years and Far Away”, is an absolutely beautiful song that really captures the tone the OVA set.Characters: (7 / 10)When you only have 25 minutes to tell a story, it’s quite obvious that there won’t be time for a lot of character development at all. Nonetheless, the characters felt real, and somewhat relatable (I’ve never been in a similar situation myself, so it’s hard to tell). What I did like, however, is how there are no supporting characters, really emphasising that this is the story of these two friends, separated in time and space, and introducing new characters which we’d have to develop emotions and care for would’ve probably taken away a lot of the feelings you get when watching this.Enjoyment: (8 / 10)I really enjoyed this OVA, and how it manages to do what it does in such a short time.

For what reason is beyond me. This anime is just bad. Maybe I\'m not the most cultured person, but seeing two people whining and complaining isn\'t my idea of entertainment.Story: The story has the right idea, it just doesn\'t seem to do anything. The idea that two people who care about each other but are split apart by distance is a noble idea, and one that could have worked, but it doesn\'t because it just shows the two people just complaining, and hardly anything else. Sure there are some action sequences in there, but...they are boring. If your going to do something like this, at least show the characters interacting with characters in the place they are. Just going back and forth between the two is not at all interesting. I honestly think that the director didn\'t even try to expand the story at all. Bottom line, this story could have been good at least, but it just fucks itself over by there being nothing besides the interaction, if you can even call it that.Characters: Now, here\'s where Voices really takes a downfall, the characters. Both Mikako and Noboru are simply too whiny. They\'re so whiny, it\'s hard to sympathize with them. They basically have no emotion besides the fact that they miss each other. It\'s just ""Oh, I miss you"" for 25 minutes in various ways. They don\'t even seem sad about it or anything, just rather depressed. Despite the fact they both whine and complain, I think that Mikako is worse because; 1. She complains more, and 2. She doesn\'t drop out of the army to be with Noboru, even though she can. But still both characters are just awful.Art: The art was overall decent. The Earth setting was really good, but the other settings were absent of anything interesting or eye-catching. Now, when you can\'t make space eye-catching, you defiantly have a few problems in the art department. The character design was OK, but Mikako\'s design looks like it was ripped-off directly from Lain\'s character design. The 3-D art however is where the art starts to drag itself. It just doesn\'t fit. It looks poorly compiled and not at all cleaned up. The only good thing I can say about the 3-D art is that the enemy ships look like a Haunter, who is an awesome Pokemon. But even that doesn\'t save the art, because it\'s just overall decent.Sound: The music is rather forgettable and boring. Sure, some of the stuff they did with the piano was interesting, but it\'s still just boring and forgettable. It\'s almost as they played the same song, just over and over again. The English voices were decent, and the sound effects were sort of interesting, but they were few and far between and you can\'t remember them. The sound part was just rather boring.Overall: I have no idea why so many people like this anime, it\'s just two people complaining for 25 minutes. That\'s not entertainment, that\'s high school drama, and frankly, there are better ways to watch high school drama than this. If you want to see people complaining for that long, then I feel sorry for you. 3/10 they are boring.

It left me feeling satisfied but not quite fulfilled.I can see what 'they' tried to do with this anime, purify and distill it, and in that regard it was pulled off flawlessly. The one problem I have is I feel that the characters drew the short end of the stick and at times, the storyline felt quite rushed.The art style in this anime is just so beautiful it really does justice to the storyline, although the storyline feels like it could have been developed a little more, Voices of a distant star has some absolutely amazingly breathtaking scenes that I never thought I could learn to appreciate within 25 minutes.Voices of a distant star is the perfect example of how even within 25 minutes, something beautiful can occur, but because of this it left me wanting more which is why I give it a 9, although with an added 20 minutes it could have easily been a 10.A truly memorable anime and one that I highly recommend. the same length of time in any other anime, Voices of a distant start would win hands down, but because its so short when it came to the end, I was just wishing it would continue for even just another 20 minutes.

Following the story of two young friends, they are suddenly divided by the reaches of space. Their contact with each other becomes limited to text messaging. Soon the messages take days to reach, then months, and eventually years. The work that put the now-well-known Makoto Shinkai on the map, this bittersweet tale is one not to be missed.Voices of a Distant Star is a story that packs more emotion into its entire 25 minute run than an average...series will in 25 episodes.

A short story in nature, it does it's best not to muddle things up much with lesser details, though the sci-fi setting is a little tough to swallow. Still, Voices keeps things as simple as possible by focusing heavily on main characters Mikako and Noboru throughout the anime's run.The cast, compromised entirely of Mikako and Noboru, tell the story through their own personal feelings and inner conflicts. This not only makes the story a little deeper, but it fleshes out the two much more than just two kids who realize their love for one another too late. Their personal feelings reflect an internal symphony of emotion beyond the care that characters in situations like these are handled with. They never come across as superficial or phony. This is pure human drama anyone can all relate with to some degree.Another thing that's bound to surprise is that this entire anime was animated on Makoto Shinkai's PC, proving that ANYONE can make an anime if he or she really wants to. The result actually looks rather professional as well. It's surrealistic in the robot scenes and alien worlds, but the more dramatic scenes are heavily bound in reality. Shinkai's attention to detail shines as much as it does today and his careful crafting gives the anime a solid look, yet delicate feel.The soundtrack was composed by TENMON, who is now better known for his work with ef ~ a tale of memories. It is heavily piano-laden and that's not a bad thing. The melodies are fragile and beautiful, and the final piece &quot;Through the Years and Far Away&quot; never fails to bring me to tears as the first notes are played.As I said before, Voices of a Distant Star is one of the best anime I have ever seen to this day.

We all probably can think of a story like this one but its how the story was full of passion between the two characters which made this anime\'s story so beautiful.  This anime shows how easily love can determine one\'s future and thoughts.Although the story was good there were some ""not gonna happen, even for an anime"" moments, which was the heroine was still in high school and was going out to the universe. Although, this gave the anime a dramatic effect to it.It was interesting to see how...2-D and 3-D effects were going to be used together. The ships and meccas were nicely done in its 3-D style. Unfortunately the characters design were HORRIBLY done. Even for a 2002 OVA, the character designs could have been greatly improved on taking in account relating to the fact that the scenery was a lot better and it was also in 2-D. For a moment because of the character design, I thought I was watching the wrong anime.Due to the lack of time there is not much to say about the sound and character in my perspective. The sound played nicely in the dramatic scenes and also did a nice effect for other parts such as firing of missiles. Just the BMG alone could make a person cry. The characters were greatly developed in their relationship for the 23 min. The downfall to watching this series after 5cm and The Promise is that the character personalities are very similar.I enjoyed this OVA and is a heart breaking experience. I suggest this to anyone who has 20-30 min on their hand. Also If one would want to fully grasp the beauty of this, watch this before 5 cm and The Place Promised in Our Early Days.

As a one off OVA by acclaimed director Shinkai Makoto it comes with a rather impressive pedigree, but I feel like it never really got moving. The story tells of a young boy and girl who are separated by an intergalactic war. Sounds excellent, but it never really gives you a sense of why they are fighting or even who they are fighting. If the story was more fleshed out and placed in a movie format I feel that this would have been a real winner. It isn't bad as it is, but it could have been...a lot more.The animation and art direction are where Voices of a Distant Star really stand apart. In every scene the smallest details are animated perfectly and realistically. The CG mechs are very well done, especially considering this was produced six years ago. The backdrops and the sky in particular are always top notch and very well drawn. Top marks all round. The character models were a little goofy looking, but it wasn't enough to bother me to any extent.The music and sounds really give a sense of distance. It's an odd way of describing it, but the music really gives scale to the battles and makes you feel like something epic is taking place. If I had a complaint about the sounds it would be the voice acting. It wasn't poorly done, but it could have been better. When the girl was getting emotional and crying, I just wasn't feeling it.The characters, Mikato and Noboru, are the only characters in the story. As it is only a one episode OVA there isn't a chance to see any back story or flesh out the story any way. In the time provided it was mostly focused on their desire to be together and how much they loved each other. They have no personality at all and are very one dimensional. Get over it.I was expecting a lot better out of this OVA, but it is a nice quick watch none the less.

The slow agonizing wait of reply is given a sci-fi spin as the characters age at different rates due to the effects of space travel. As Nagamine travels ever further into the depths of space, her texts take longer and longer to reach her childhood friend and lover, Noboru. The concept is very poignant and one can feel great empathy for the couple as the cold distance of time...and space separates them, slowly tearing them apart. 9/10The Problem:The problem however is the bad execution of characterization in a very short time. The OVA is only 25 minutes long, which is not enough to build the necessary emotions to support the story. You don't understand their pain of time as the characterization scenes zip through haphazardly, undercutting the plot. Their emotions come off as cheap as little effort is made to construct their relationship, and the ensuing loneliness. Instead far too much time is put on glossy space battles and displays of background art that steal time away from character development. Everything is too rushed and the great concept is left unfulfilled.Art:The scenery of planets and mecha were very picturesque and detailed for its time, especially considering it's a one man production. However the characters suffer as their proportions are terrible and even for anime, their faces are misshaped.Sound:There is only three voices: Noboru, Nagamine, and British voice commander. Sadly the main characters have uninspired VAs that are emotionally unconvincing. The score is nothing memorable and doesn't set the mood well. The best sounds are the various beeps and blasts from the action sequences, again undercutting the emotional aspect. 5/10Characters:There is not enough characterization to empathize the characters. While the plot of distance and time separating them is emotional, they remain bland, unestablished, and unconvincing. 3/10Overall:Voices of a Distant Star is a flawed product, it's execution is poor and rushed.

Feel free to help me understand why this is revered. I get that it’s remarkable that Shinkai did everything but the music, but I fail to see how it gives him license to write a hollow story and be called the next Miyazaki for it.Let’s start with the good. Shinkai is a master of animation, arguably the best in the business, and Voices of a Distant Star is no exception. While it may have been made by one man on his laptop, it is...superior to the work of some studios. Even at this early stage in his career, you can see Shinkai’s obsessive attention to detail that brings his worlds to life in a way that few others have accomplished. This stunning world is set to a beautiful soundtrack that features some timeless piano pieces. Tenmon is to music what Shinkai is to animation, and together they make a team few can rival. And if nothing else, Voices of a Distant Star‘s attempt to tell a moving love story in under half an hour is ambitious.Alas, now for the bad. While the animation is gorgeous, the limitations really show. The 3D scenes don’t stand the test of time and stick out like a sore thumb, and the character designs are so bad they’re comical — welcome to the land of the square heads. Tenmon’s also not so great when it comes to the climactic space/action tracks, which are instantly forgettable. And although the original Japanese voice cast (which includes Shinkai) is good, the English voice cast is ruined by Cynthia Martinez, a woman notorious for her role as Hermes in Kino’s Journey. Even if you can stand Martinez’s voice, the dub is essentially worthless because it departs so significantly from the original dialogue.“So?,” you might say, “I’m a real anime fan and I only watch subs anyway. And I can get past the square heads.” Well, good for you — now about that story. Anyone who has seen Shinkai’s works knows his theme is love tested by distance and time, and Voices of a Distant Star is where it all began. In a sense, Negamine and Terao are the perfect characters to illustrate the concept: they’re torn literally light years apart by circumstances beyond their control and try desperately to stay in touch, even if it means waiting years for that next short text message. The problem is the characters and their relationship are remarkably undeveloped. They’re introduced, we’re told that they’re deeply in love (nevermind that they’re junior high school students), and suddenly Negamine is off into space, longing to be reunited with her soul mate.This all felt terribly melodramatic to me, and it’s an issue that frequently arises in Shinkai’s works. The basic idea is beautiful, but if you want the audience to actually feel for the characters and their separation, you need to sell the premise that they’re genuinely in love. Otherwise, it becomes impossible to empathize with them, and what’s left is a dime-a-dozen plot with pretty slow pacing to boot. Granted, the film is only 25 minutes, but Shinkai has fallen into the same trap even when given more time (5 Centimeters Per Second). He does much better when he gives the characters and their relationship the attention they deserve, and fortunately his latest work, Garden of Words, suggests he is improving with practice.Voices of a Distant Star is a unique work, essentially one man’s labor of love, but it’s tough to do it all by yourself. Shinkai deserves credit for his hard work, but he’s received way more than is warranted. There are a lot of good love stories out there, and this one doesn’t come close to making the list. superior to the work of some studios.

It's a love story. Seen plenty of those. Sadly, VoDS does not stand out in this regard. And for god's sake, who the HECK would use a flip phone in 2047? So much for advancements in technology.Art: 0/10This honestly looks like a fan animation than a professionally produced anime. I'm not kidding. The frame rate is so god awful that I can't even...! Argh....Sound: 6/10The ONLY redeeming quality of the show. Even then, only Cynthia Martinez (Mikako) and the Siri-esque voice for the AI system is good. Adam Colon (Nobuo) was FLAT. Could barely even hear him half the time. It's really no wonder why Cynthia is more successful in her career than Adam. IT'S CUZ THE FORMER CAN ACTUALLY ACT, DUH.Character: 3/10Neither of the characters strike off as especially entertaining, so there's not much to say in this regard.Enjoyment: 2/10Well, whaddaya think? It's dreadful, no doubt. If this was a series? OMFG. I would definitely fast forward it like I did with Orange Road.Overall: 2/10The only redeeming quality of VoDS is just SOME of the voice acting, unfortunately. Would I recommend this to anyone? Probably not. I would link it to my friends to LAUGH at how atrocious it is, though. Sound: 6/10The ONLY redeeming quality of the show.

I once tried it for a year and a half and it was really hard. The trust issues men, they’re killer. You don’t know what she’s really doing because you are not always together. Though she tells you want you want to hear, you will not know if it’s really the truth. After the relationship, we became friends (can you believe it?) and she told me she was having an affair during that time. What a bitch! Anyway, my situation was just one of the millions of long distance relationships all...over the world. Being apart from the one you love by just a couple of miles is really, really hard. But can you imagine if the distance is light-years away? Will you still love her even if you have no idea if you’ll ever see her again? Hoshi no Koe: a story of love written in the stars.Story:When I was having a long distance relationship, I’m very strict when it comes to communication. If I send her a message, I want a reply as soon as possible. If a response came 5 minutes after I sent mine, I transform and become The Hulk. But what will someone feel if responses come years apart? Hoshi no Koe is about waiting for text messages that both party is not sure if will ever come. If this is real life, the guy would have probably found a replacement after just a couple of months (Days if he’s good looking like me, and years if he looks like you). But since this is an anime, the guy stays loyal (M). Throughout this short 20 minute one-shot, imagining what these two lovers feel is just really heart-wrenching. Having felt it myself (Well, at least 0.5% of what they experienced), I understand the pain. A bit tragic-like but with an open ending, Makoto Shinkai delivers once again. Oh, yeah! This is a Makoto Shinkai film, if you’ve seen some of his works, then the ending wouldn’t surprise you… or rather, wouldn’t satisfy you. But I personally like it and (byfar) is my favorite Makoto Shinkai movie.Character:Nothing much to say about the 2 characters rather than they gained my respect. They can continue loving each other even if they’re not sure if the other still loves them. If I can point out one bad thing about it, it’s probably the guy. The guy is too masochistic. He can easily pick up some of the girls that like him then he wouldn’t be lonely but he still decided to stay loyal to the girl to continue his hardship. His morale is a bit respectable but more laughable. No man can do that in real life. Temptation will always win. I somehow relate their situation with Chise and Yuuji  from Saikano (Saishu Heiki Kanojo aka. I’m Sorry - The Animation). I don’t know. I just think the situation is somewhat alike. Apart from that, I have nothing else to say about them. They’re still likable characters even if the series just runs for 20 minutes or so.Sound:Makoto Shinkai seems to like his violin and piano. In almost all his movies, piano and violin will never be missing… I think. The music is really emotional. It perfectly matches the premise of this one-shot. In regards to the dub, I really like it. You can surely feel the emotions that the voice actors portrayed. You will hear loneliness, sadness, and agony in it. I really like it specially Adam Colon. His dub is really emotional… it’s as if he can feel the exact same thing that his character is feeling. Well done.Animation:Makoto Shinkai. That alone is enough for one to know that the animation for this one-shot is really good. Though the character design and the animation are a bit dated, it still follows the typical Makoto Shinkai quality. Though it looks a bit old, the quality of animation (in its time) is really beautiful. The one-shot also features some mech and action which looks really cool. Typical Makoto Shinkai fashion.Verdict:I consider Hoshi no Koe as a tragedy because of the heart-wrenching portrayal of long distance relationship. Because it just ended when he was about to follow her, I was a bit disappointed. However, because of the ending being as open as it is, I was fine with it. It is one of the few shows that even after I finished watching it, I was still thinking of possible scenarios that might happen because of how it ended. An ending such as this is one of my favorites because even if it ends, it feels as if it didn’t end. Makoto Shinkai, he teaches us that love isn’t always about sunshine and rainbows since 1997.With all that said, after some random computations, I’d gladly give Voices of a Distant Star an overall rating of 7.9 out of 10. Even if you haven’t experience being apart from the one you love by a couple of miles, watching Hoshi no Koe will show you the hardships and trails that comes along with it. A bit sad upon initially watching it, but once you sit down and think about it, it’s really a good romantic one-shot. Why not check it out? It’s just 20 minutes nothing much to lose, right?Alternate Anime Recommendation:For alternate anime recommendation, why don’t you try Aoi Bungaku? Not all of it (Well, it’s a good series so watch it all if you can) though. Aoi Bungaku episodes 9 and 10: “Run, Melos!” specifically. Both stories revolve around the concept of “waiting” and the hardships that can be tied with it. Both stories present a rather sad question of: “Who experiences the most pain? The one waiting or the one waited?”Also, as mentioned, there is also I’m Sorry – The Animation… I mean Saikano. Both series have masochistic guys, both the girls in their respective series is away from the one they love because of military duties, and also, unrealistic (yet dreamy) romance. Between the two, I’m hope you find something that you would really like.And that’s it for me. Thanks for reading all of that as always. Bye! over the world.

Bye!', 'Melancholic story about love and long journey full of beautiful images. In less than half an hour Shinkai will drag you from the ""boring dead end"" train station somewhere in Japan to remote galaxies. He is executing the whole process very skillfully by mixing poetism with sci-fi.It is remarkable that he did all the work by myself. Deficiencies seen in particular on animation of characters, static backgrounds are however very nice. The film deserves more elaborate scenario. Fights animations are in my opinion, completely unnecessary and in this genre we should feel pretty comfy even without them. On the other hand, it must be...said they are very nicely done. Same goes for sound effects and music which are splendid. Especially in romantic moments sounds of rain, wind, the city in the background and light tones of the piano brings the atmosphere almost to perfection.If you wanna fully enjoy this piece you have to got atleast a bit of empathy for the characters. For those who are of a more rational nature might be 8 years of waiting for SMS absurd in many ways.Yes his style might be over-sweet and naivé for somebody and I absolutely get it, but the bittersweet tones as the end comes so typical for Shinkai\'s ""manuscript"" are frankly said : the most appealing thing on his style. Best with bit of melancholy and tea. said they are very nicely done. Same goes for sound effects and music which are splendid.

Best with bit of melancholy and tea.', 'I\'d heard some really good things about ""Hoshi no Koe"". Considering the amount of praise there\'s been for this seemingly insignificant half hour long OVA, I felt that it was something I simply HAD to check out.Having watched it, I feel a bit... disappointed. The main problem is that it\'s just too short. Due to all the hype, I was expecting a lot more. Though in some places ""Hoshi no Koe"" does succeed in generating a certain special atmosphere, the amount of stuff you can pack into a half an hour show is simply not enough for it to solidify into something more substantial. The...dialogue/monologue heavy format reminds me a little of ""Seikai no Danshou"", as that is also a short OVA that relies more on words than flashiness, But ""Seikai no Danshou"" has an extremely strong background already provided for it by its parent franchise whereas this did not, and as a result this feels a bit more empty.Set in the future, the main story of ""Hoshi no Koe"" revolves around two friends texting each other across increasingly long distances as one of them goes off to fight a long military campaign in a distant part of the galaxy. Even though this may sound like the gimmicky outline for a cheesey mobile phone advert, the idea is used remarkably well. As the distance between the two main characters increase, the text messages takes longer and longer to get to the other person. There\'s a profound sadness as we see the seconds and minutes turning into hours, the hours turning into days, and the days eventually turning into months and years - can you imagine sending a message to a close friend, knowing they won\'t get it for several years, or receiving a message that\'s several years out of date, and this is the only way you are able to communicate? Admittedly, it seems rather strange to me that texting still works when they\'re fighting a war light years away from civilization (again, it\'s the kind of exaggeration of the power of mobile phones you\'d expect from a mobile phone ad :P), but the feelings generated as a result is so heart wrenching that I can almost forgive the contrived scenario.What\'s remarkable about ""Hoshi no Koe"" is that it\'s all made by one man... I kid you not! It\'s a colossal effort considering how well it turned out. Still, the fact that it\'s made by one man means that though the production values are surprisingly good, you\'re not gonna be getting shiny, adrenaline pumping mecha battles scenes the caliber of ""Gundam Seed"", in fact the battle scenes of ""Hoshi no Koe"" are confusing to the extent that I am reminded of those from ""Vandread"", which is not a good thing. Speaking of mechas, they feel like a tack on because I find it a bit seeing them in this kind of anime which really doesn\'t have much to do with flashy battles. I also thought the character designs are pretty bad.But despite its flaws, the emotions it is able to invoke means that it\'s still a good anime. Considering all the stella praise I\'ve been hearing though, I was expecting a lot more from this, and in the end it simply feels too short for me to become totally engrossed in it. dialogue/monologue heavy format reminds me a little of ""Seikai no Danshou"", as that is also a short OVA that relies more on words than flashiness, But ""Seikai no Danshou"" has an extremely strong background already provided for it by its parent franchise whereas this did not, and as a result this feels a bit more empty.Set in the future, the main story of ""Hoshi no Koe"" revolves around two friends texting each other across increasingly long distances as one of them goes off to fight a long military campaign in a distant part of the galaxy.

He looked skinnier than usual, as the white fabric clung to his pale flesh and the shadows plastered to his features. Sliding onto the bench, he slipped out his cellphone, fiddling with it for a bit before the screen came chirping to life. The beep ricocheted through his heart like a jolt of electricity, bringing his attention to the email he received. He had waited...a year to see her name typed, “From: Mikako”.Voices of a Distant Star doesn’t have ambitions to be some theatrical space opera or intergalactic epic of Star Wars-like proportions. It’s a romantic heart dressed in a science-fiction dress, trimmed with mecha and aliens that seek to destroy all of mankind. Exciting isn’t it? But we all know love is about personality, not the looks. Through the smokescreen of whirring missiles and the winding tentacles of Tassarian battleships lies a tale of two star-crossed lovers torn apart by deep-space combat.Makoto Shinkai debut effort sets the motif that threads together his future work, two lovers sundered by the realities of society, its framework and how love’s pale fingers can stretch to the limitless boundaries of remoteness. It’s a microscopic mirror into the mind of Shinkai, who develops these themes in much greater depth in 5 Centimeters per Second and The Place Promised in Our Early Days, but the sense of separation between these particular characters feels the most immense, caulked by vacuum of the heavens. His two actors, Mikako and Nobura, are middle school students that fancy spending high school together, trading dreams of Kendo club and buying ice cream at the local convenience store. These daytime reveries shatter when Mikako reveals she will be a pilot, helming a mech to combat a threat to humanity.The narrative hinges on the emails exchanged by the two friends, as the dividing light-years cause their messages to take longer and longer to deliver. Minutes and hours quickly precipitate into months and years. As the breadth of day grow, Mikako’s gloom and isolation become palpable as she flounders in her heartache. Her outcast from the account of earthly time is distressing to watch, frozen in her fifteen-year-old frame as Noboru ages across an eternity. The exchanges delicately nurture the climax, Nobura receiving a wandering text many years later, as the layers of melancholy and rejection sweep over the viewer. It’s bittersweet, but that’s how I take my chocolate.=====Animation=====The frames of Voices from a Distant Star are torn from the pages of a sketchbook. Frayed lines crisscross one another, actualized into shape by a wash of pastel watercolors. It’s breathtaking, yet curiously unassuming, asking the audience to focus on the interaction of the characters instead of the hushed hallows of ‘Random Japanse Suburb 1’.The placid humdrum of the town is broken up by hyper technological CGI sequences involving giant robots, deviant aliens, and a mobiles of heavenly bodies. The sections seem obtrusive, jarring even, compared to the tranquil hues of earth. Reason being, the 3D sections are of amateur quality, textures are grainy and the rendering is poorly aliased, caked up in overembellished lighting effects. The animation is comparatively clunky, as the steel clad titans stumble through each scene. My homesickness quickly dissipated when the camera traveled back to the dulcet foyers of ‘Random Japanese Suburb 1’.=====Sound=====A companionless piano is kept by a metronome’s heartache, as its solitary steps pave an upsetting chant. The instrument stands on it’s feeble as it’s chord echo Mikako’s alienation and Noburo’s fortitude. It’s the glue that holds together the collages Shinkai assembles with his imagery and dialogue, which at times falls flat. Shinkai and his fiancé in the original did the voices of the leads, and professional seiyuu were employed for the mass distributed version. In either, Mikako’s voice is a monotone murmur, absent of any sort of emotional inflection till the very end. Noburo suffers from a similar affliction, but atleast his voice is audible. Like the Animation, the sound and music stands on uneven footing, faltering from time to time.=====Characters=====Both protagonists don’t have much bulk to them, reflected by their flip-book style of artwork. Most of what we know comes from the events that unfold within the twenty-three minutes, back story ignored. Most of the character development is driven by the communication between the two students and how it fuels their catharsis in the final moments. I couldn’t ask for more from a short film, and was surprised at the magnitude of effect their romance had on me.=====Overall=====I’ve had these feelings before, sitting at the airport as my girlfriend kissed me on the apple of cheek instead of saying goodbye. I thought about how the Rockies, the desert, the Great Plains, and Wisconsin separated us. My heart pelted against my chest as I as the final few seconds wound down from the Quicktime counter.

Voices of a Distant Star is a powerful work of art and a stunning display of storytelling which I highly recommend.', ""With such a short OVA, you can't really expect much out of this... was what I thought first. Watching the first 5 minutes of the OVA, I realized that this was much more than a regular OVA.Story (10/10): Given that it was a short OVA, to be able to fit an entire storyline behind a 30 minute sequence shows the ingenuity of director Shinkai Makoto and his ability amaze. With drama and romance put together, you really cannot go wrong with this. This story really puts you in the driver's seat, and makes you experience what the main character really goes through.Art (8/10): With...such a rating, most people would find that quite a low score for such an anime. But, to warn any potential watchers, Shinkai Makoto made this within a short period of time, and although released in 2002, the animation quality and artwork resembles that of previous years. To be honest, there were many times where I cringed at the sight of the characters, as the square, block-like heads seemed to stick out of the screen. Unless you are not picky with animation quality, then by all means, watch this anime.Sound (10/10): Throughout the entire OVA, every small step, or climbing of a staircase was very smooth and shown very well. Accurate sounds with explosions, rainfall, etc. really created a life-like experience. With this type of drama, an insert song truly brings out the dramatic sequence of an anime, and Shinkai Makoto truly has picked out a fantastic one.Character (9/10): The only problem I had with the characters was their very monotonous voice. Very direct, and very computer like, they weren't regular conversation-like speeches. But, because of the storyline, I actually found that this fit in rather well, although it was somewhat dull at times. But overall, the characters were well articulated, and represented by their actions.Enjoyment (10/10): If you aren't looking for a long anime, go ahead and pick this out from a blockbuster. This 30 minute OVA will give you the reason to reach forthe box of tissues, and sit there for another 30 minutes after the OVA is done. Well, not exactly 30 minutes, but the way the director made this OVA keeps you on the edge of your seat even after the OVA is over.Overall (9/10):  Anyone who hasn't watched this should truly pick up a copy of this and watch it right away. You cannot go wrong with Hoshi no Koe, and at 30 minutes long, it won't take up too much time out of your day. such a rating, most people would find that quite a low score for such an anime.

But overall, the characters were well articulated, and represented by their actions.Enjoyment (10/10): If you aren't looking for a long anime, go ahead and pick this out from a blockbuster. This 30 minute OVA will give you the reason to reach forthe box of tissues, and sit there for another 30 minutes after the OVA is done. Well, not exactly 30 minutes, but the way the director made this OVA keeps you on the edge of your seat even after the OVA is over.Overall (9/10):  Anyone who hasn't watched this should truly pick up a copy of this and watch it right away. You cannot go wrong with Hoshi no Koe, and at 30 minutes long, it won't take up too much time out of your day."", '""There is a word, \'World\'. Until about the time when I was in middle school, I vaguely thought the word meant the area where the signals from my cell would reach. But why is it... My cell never reaches anyone"". The first dialogue of Hoshi no Koe aka Voices of a Distant Star, spoken by the main female character, Mikako Nagamine. That was a EXCELLENT way to get someone like me hooked. This dialogue showed how the girl was lonely and isolated. She needed someone in her life, a friend, who could support her during her bad times. It also showed that how, with time...and experience, our perspective of the world can change.  Makoto Shinkai\'s movies are generally known for their animation, but this one had exceptionally inferior animation compared to the other popular Shinkai movies. So that line really compensated for such an eyesore of an animation and avoided making the anime feel boring. The first scene starts with the girl sitting inside a metro, trying to contact someone through her CELLPHONE. She is shown speaking alone to a person named Noboru Terao. Then she is shown to be in her home and her classroom, when she asks herself the question,"" Where am I?"" Later do we realize that it was not actually happening, but just a reminiscence. She was in a mecha-robot, somewhere in space. We don\'t have a clear idea of what\'s going on yet, but later the scene shifts to the past, where we get to know about both of the main characters, Mikako and Noboru. And from there, a short yet intriguing story begins.This movie is the one of the earliest works of the now-considered G.O.A.T. of romance anime movies, Makoto Shinkai. It was created in 2002 by Shinkai himself and the only two characters in this movie were voiced by him and his wife. Due to the lack of resources at that time, the execution of such a wonderful story was not done at its fullest capacity.Story: 7/10The film is set in the future, in the year 2047, where the technology is shown to be advanced enough to build combat mechas and to create large spaceships that can warp lightyears away through space. Still, the main characters use a cellphone. That too the old 2000s one. That was the reason I highlighted the word CELLPHONE before. This is one plot hole that really concerns me. Because by that time in the future, considering the technology that is shown in the movie itself, there should be better and faster means of communication. But if we do consider that, then they should be advanced enough to, well, cover lightyears of distances in very short periods of time. That possibility leads to the erasure of the actual plot of the anime!That being done, let\'s talk about the actual story of the movie. It is a beautiful example of how true love is eternal. The girl floats away and away in the endless void of the universe, with no one at her side. She mails the boy, and all she can do is hope that the message reaches him and he reads it. The boy on the other side, is on Earth, somehow managing to live his normal life, while handling the emotional stress of his dear one leaving him. All he too, can do is hope that the girl is out there, safe and sound, and has sent a mail. He waits for the mail, not knowing when, or whether a mail will ever actually arrive. This depicts the trust that both of them have in each other, despite being trillions of kilometers away. While fighting the aliens, the girl also has to fight her loneliness. Whilst both of them are separated by distance and space, they are united by thoughts. Both of them simply wish to be together. They wish to experience the simple things like the wind, the summer and the rain together. But due to the girl warping through space and time, the age gap between the two of them, who were originally 15 years old at the beginning, gradually widens. The girl remains 15 and the boy turns 24. There is one thing to note, many of Shinkai\'s movies have SOMETHING that separates the two main characters. The separating factor between the two lovers in this movie was kind of rare and remarkable! Space, which led to the separation of both of them by time as well.Well, sorry for interrupting my own smooth writing, but the girl being 15 gives rise to yet another plot hole here! How does the U.N. hire 15-year-old kids for a space expedition?? And why is she in her school uniform (xD) inside the mecha-robot??And about the name of the extraterrestrial planet, Agartha. Did he just use the exact same name and uncannily similar terrain and landscape of the Agartha shown in this movie in Children Who Chase Lost Voices?!In my honest opinion, the base plot of this movie is fabulous. Two distant lovers (extremely distant ones here) trying to love each other without BEING THERE for each other. But the implementation.. oh my god. Considering that it\'s Makoto Shinkai, it could\'ve been a WHOLE LOT better. The duration of the film is too short to make the viewers understand and relate to the deep and affectionate bond between the two main characters. And again, since the film was so short, there was basically no development of  emotional attachment to the characters by the viewers. The advancements in technology only applied to specific things, for some reason. Then there are the minute mistakes that I mentioned above. Since the story has quite a lot of flaws, I\'d have to rate it a 7/10. Judging its potential, it can easily be a 9 or even a 10/10.Art and Animation: 8/10 and 4.5/10Kind of an odd score, but 6.5 just seems low. The animation was just atrocious. In the entire 25 minutes run time, there were like- maximum 30 distinct hand-drawn frames used. Most of the times it was just the characters moving their mouth, and majority of the movie was CGI. In each scene, it looked like there was a completely new female character. The angles, the proportions, the shapes of the heads, everything was messed up. The animation looked worse than the 90s style. The only scene I remember looking somewhat good was the thunder strike between Jupiter and Io. About the locations, there was atleast some amount of diverseness in the locations where the boy was animated. Whereas the girl, she was always shown to be inside her TRACER(the mech). Like, there should\'ve been atleast one scene where she was shown to be onboard the Lysithea. The CGI was okayish, but a bit overused. I mean, at least it was better than the absolute abomination from KamiKatsu! XD. I checked some other anime from the same season, and almost all of them had at least better animation. About the art, not gonna lie, it kind of blew my expectations. Judging the animation beforehand, I had already set my bar pretty low about the art. But DAMN, was it BEAUTIFUL! One could easily recognize this as a Shinkai creation from the backgrounds and the landscapes alone! Now to be honest, it was nothing out of the ordinary but considering how old this film is and the conditions under which it was developed, I could let this slide. My poor guy animated the entire thing all by HIMSELF! And it was his debut anime film too if we don\'t consider the less-popular version of She and Her Cat. Summing it up, the art was great but the animation could\'ve been way better.Sound: 7/10Sound? OH you mean the pew-pew of the TRACER? Or the beep-beep of the CELLPHONE?! Or rather the voices of Makoto Shinkai and his wife?Jokes aside, considering the fact that Shinkai made this alone, he did a pretty great job in terms of overall audio. The automated English voice in the spacecraft is what I found to be interesting. Atleast it was not a Japanese-wannabe-American voice. The proper English accent was a great decision. Also the ending theme, Through The Years and Far Away by Ai Miyoko was really melodious. It was a treat to the ears after hearing such chaotic sounds produced during the battle. The word ""Ne,"" or ""Say,"" was used many times. Some might find it annoying due to it being overused, but I found it really soothing. The way they asked each other about everything showcased their faith in each other. There weren\'t any other soundtracks as such, but what WAS there was good. 7/10.Character: 6/10Like I said, since there was no emotional attachment to the characters, we couldn\'t feel what they felt. Their sorrow didn\'t make us feel sad. Their fear didn\'t make us afraid. Their select moments of joy didn\'t make us happy. The characters had no apparent backstory. The only thing that was noticeable was their motives. The girl, Mikako was forcibly selected as a soldier aboard the intergalactic Lysithea. But she just wanted to return to the Earth to meet the boy, Noboru. Meanwhile he was firm on making his heart cold and strong, and making it ready to accept the uncertainties that lied ahead. He even lost hope of receiving any mail, but never broke down. He could\'ve never known what had happened out there, but he had to be ready for the inevitable circumstances. THAT was delightful. But still, I\'ll have to give it a mere 6/10.Enjoyment: 5.5/10The same factors apply everywhere, regardless of the categories. I spent more time understanding and analyzing this movie, rather than enjoying it. There wasn\'t anything much enjoyable either. The base plot and the name of the creator carried it hard.Overall: 6/10I would rate it a 7 out of 10, but from a critical and analytical viewpoint, I think it deserves no more than 6. I would like to propose two words for describing this film: Underutilized Plot. Also, Wasted Potential. If this movie\'s duration is increased and it is remade with a larger budget and better animation, I can easily see it being a 9/10. This is such a tragic factor that I have experienced in my Animanga journey. The plot being good but not the execution. I think it is a really important factor when it comes to anime. A mediocre plot with great execution is always better than a great plot with poor execution. That being said, Hoshi no Koe or Voices of a Distant Star gets a 6/10 from me. Definitely worth the watch for the plot and storyline but mainly to see how far Makoto Shinkai has come.With that, I\'d like to end my review. It is long, but I think reading it would be profitable ;). See ya! and experience, our perspective of the world can change.

It is long, but I think reading it would be profitable ;). See ya!', 'This OVA definitely felt like it had potential, but for me, it didn\'t really deliver on what it promised.Anyone who takes a look at my anime list will know that this is definitely the kind of story that I would expect to thoroughly enjoy; from the sci-fi, to the romance, to the unique element that drives the plot.However, it just didn\'t feel like it.. went anywhere. Of course, I don\'t expect much character development from a 20-minute OVA, but the characters felt like they had close to no personality at all. There were no developments that weren\'t already obvious from the start, and little...character development or plot progression - the premise from the MAL description basically _is_ the entire story.Also, while it\'s always deceptively easy to retroactively point out false predictions in science fiction, I can\'t help but find the juxtaposition of mobile phones circa 2002 and a futuristic setting that includes aliens and FTL travel kind of comical.On to the animation; It\'s definitely obvious where the production quality significantly benefited from digital animation, even though the actual keyframe animation is nothing out of the ordinary (if not below average). However, this is counteracted by the overuse of 2002-era 3D animation, which would\'ve looked out of place even at the time, and comes close to ruining the experience altogether in 2015.I don\'t know the circumstances that lead to the choice to invest so much effort into the 3D animation - whether it was for budget reasons or simply a desire to play with the newest possible technologies, but thirteen years later, I think it was the wrong decision to make.I will say that Hoshi no Koe makes good use of what little music it has, and that the director definitely has a feel for how a good soundtrack can be used to bring out the emotions in a given scene.As a side note - While I was initially impressed that the English actually seemed to be well-written, the unnatural use of Japanese grammar definitely becomes more apparent in the later English lines. ""Enemies exist"" rather than ""there are enemies"", et cetera.All in all, perhaps I had massively inflated expectations of a 20-minute OVA from 2002, but Hoshi no Koe was, personally, a let-down. I have yet to see Shinkai\'s other works, but I hope I\'m going to enjoy them more. character development or plot progression - the premise from the MAL description basically _is_ the entire story.Also, while it\'s always deceptively easy to retroactively point out false predictions in science fiction, I can\'t help but find the juxtaposition of mobile phones circa 2002 and a futuristic setting that includes aliens and FTL travel kind of comical.On to the animation; It\'s definitely obvious where the production quality significantly benefited from digital animation, even though the actual keyframe animation is nothing out of the ordinary (if not below average).

It feels like a pilot to something that could have been rather then a real show. Sadly, it’s hard to get a real feel for this. It’s a lot about romance which doesn’t seem to work with mechas. There isn’t much excitement om this because of how slow passed it is. For a show that is only 25 minutes long, the excitement only happens about 10 minutes in.Mikako...doesn’t seem like a good character to be piloting a mecha but then again, I think this is the part where they use Gundam logic. She crys a lot, whines a lot about how she wants to be with her friend, and all together just seems off a bit. Way to emotional for a battle I think and why they decided to have her pilot a mecha like that.The artwork is a bit odd, looking sort of like sketches in some areas that have been filled in. Other areas, its high detailed. The characters are as angled as mecha’s, making them look more robotic. Most of the time, it feels like I’m watching pieces of a game since the characters don’t seem to move much. Most images though actually focus more on the scenery especially during the monolog in the beginning of Mikako and her friend. This show is much like 5 Centimeters per Second in background and amature in characters. Mikako also never changes her clothing. I don’t think a middle school uniform is good for fighting in a mecha. The 3D aspect is alright though I don’t feel it fits with the artwork.The voices don’t even feel like they are trying in the dub, sounding like they are just reading lines. It doesn’t feel like they have any actual feeling what so ever for there lines. Mikako is a little better but still, she sounds like again, only reading. Now, the writing is actually reather poetic and gentle.It was interesting to see this, but didn’t grab me in really. doesn’t seem like a good character to be piloting a mecha but then again, I think this is the part where they use Gundam logic.

It did have an interesting plot to consider in a philosophical type way, about being so far apart, and the same age but getting messages from the past.Despite what could have been a great OVA, perhaps if it was longer, and they eventually re-united.I gave this a 5 simply because I thought about how life would be if I had to share messages with a...love one that way. That aside it would have had a lower score. love one that way. That aside it would have had a lower score.', ""I just finished watching the anime and wanted so much to write a review right away, because I'm still overwhelmed after watching this.(I won't include a summary of the story, since I assume everyone has read the official MAL one)Story: 11Yes.. 11! The story is quite simple to grasp. In a nutshell it shows two people, a young boy and a girl who are seperated by distance. Yup..that's the whole concept. But it's the ideas that enriched this concept and its execusion that made this anime a little gem. Because distance here has taken its most extreme form..that of some light years away. Mikako and...Noboru are able to exhange text messages through their cellphones, but as if distance between them wasn't enough.. the messages sending times depend on how far away each time Mikako is from Earth. At first she sends mails from close planets, like Mars, but then the expedition she is part of draws further away, so the sending time of the mails is delayed.. resulting to mails taking up to a year to reach Noboru and more. As the story unwinds the feeling of a possible happy reunion gives its place to desperation, while every hope seems to dissappear. But what is beautiful is the connection that still exists between the two of them through those messages. And even if they both have to live for each moment, those messages,no matter how rare, have become the core of their existance, around which their lives are revolving. They could try to make their hearts colder and move on, but its like those messages are their real lives and the rest is just a duty they have to bear with. And the mails can transform to something more, a feeling as if one can maybe hear the thoughts of the other, as if they are still close as before.Art: 9I really liked the art! It was quite detailed and thoroughly done. Especially the colors were beautiful. The design of the mecha wasn't my cup of tea, as well as the design of the faces of the two characters. But these were minor things that didn't really matter in the end.Sound: 9The sound was great too, It really supported and enriched the story.Character:10There are only two characters, but you won't even think about that at all. The story is so captivating that you will love both the characters from the very start. Without saying more than its needed, they look deep and mature.Enjoyment: 10I surely enjoyed my almost half an hour of viewing. The story was sad indeed, but still it held something bright and beautiful in it.Overall: 9.5This is a must watch anime! I haven't watched so many anime shows up until now, but this was definitely one of those that I will remember long after I have watched hundreds of others. Because it's one of those anime that don't need to be excessive in order to be liked or seek various tricks to draw the viewer. It's beautiful as it is in it's own purity and that is rare to find. It won't pretend to be something more than it shows and that honesty is captivating. Don't miss this, it's like a small oasis of calmness in our every day craziness.

Don't miss this, it's like a small oasis of calmness in our every day craziness."", 'Originally published on Anime Viking: http://animeviking.wordpress.com/----------The first time I saw Voices of a Distant Star was in the middle of the night back in 2007 when I was merely 14 years old. One of the biggest television channels in Sweden was holding an anime marathon from 12:00A.M. to 06:00A.M. and naturally, since I was an anime fan and this was a rare occurrence, I simply had to stay up and watch it all.Out of every short, OVA and movie that aired, the single piece that stood out was Voices of a Distant Star. This is not surprising, considering how unique Shinkai’s works really are. The...often substantial and realistically portrayed stories (either in the real world or the fictitious one) accompanied by wonderful music and visuals are honestly one-of-a-kind in the anime industry as far as I can tell. There is a clear vision of what Shinkai wants to tell and he does so without compromising his own goal, or at least that is how it comes across.But Shinkai has always had trouble with making me feel connected to any of the characters, which is extremely notable due to all his works focusing on the characters rather than the stories themselves.Voices of a Distant Star tells a story about two lovers literally being separated by space and time, as one of them is stuck on Earth while the other is travelling through space. Their only mean of communication is sending mail messages via cellphones, but as their distance grows, so does their lack of contact. It is a simple and perfect idea for a story, yet Shinkai misses the chance to make a heart-wrenching tale.The problem mainly lies in the aforementioned lack of connection to the characters. We are never really shown how much they mean to each other and have to solely rely on the emails if we want to understand them. But because the emails are rather sparse and nonsensical, this does not work. In theory it should, particularly since we viewers are experiencing the same thing as the characters, but in practice is comes off as slightly hollow. I see that the characters care for each other, I understand the message, but why… why should I care, unless I have been through the same?Another thing hampering Voices of a Distant Star is the overall production, which, especially today, is very simple and on the verge of outdated. While it is possible to ignore ugly heads and static images, it is harder to accept the poorly made CGI-scenes in space and a directing lacking a finishing touch (scenes dragging, odd scene expositions etc.). All of this is understandable since Shinkai essentially did everything by himself, but it does take away a little from the experience.While not perfect in any way, Voices of a Distant Star manages to tell a fascinating tale in only thirty minutes. But sadly it never manages to reach any of the heights it could have had. This, however, does not mean it is bad. It is merely a missed opportunity. often substantial and realistically portrayed stories (either in the real world or the fictitious one) accompanied by wonderful music and visuals are honestly one-of-a-kind in the anime industry as far as I can tell.

The story has no fillers and nothing irrelevant is shown.Even talking between the characters is kept to a total minimum, yet it´s enough.Actually most of the talking are short messages, sent between the mobilphones of the two characters.And it´s these messages, which make this anime really unique.Since Mikako is flying away from earth the messages take longer to reach Noburo, whose still on earth.But the really interesting...part is always, after Mikako send a message, you seen Noburo when this message arrives, which is a long time after.It´s basiclly the future you get to see.After the audience sees Noburos reaction on the message you jump back through time and space to Kikako.This makes the storytelling a bit hard to follow at first, but the result is just epic!Art 9/10The art really hit my taste and the mechas looked really cool.Nothing much to say, it just looks beautyful.Sound 9/10The soundtrack is totally fitting in every scene.That´s all there is to say.Character 9/10In this anime are only two characters.This might seem to less, but since the whole story is centered around thier relationship it´s enough.Mikakos personal developing is not much, because basiclly her story is just a few days long.On the other hand Noburos development is seen through several years, because of the timejumps.Enjoyment 10/10I totally enjoyed this show.Again, nothing to add here.Overall 10/10Voices of a Distant Star is really outstanding.At first i was cautious because it seemed very short, but at the end, i just thought: ""Wow..!""The story might be nothing special, a classic lovestory which is tested by the circumstances, but the way of telling this story makes this anime a totally new and unique experience.I personally recommend this anime to nearly everyone.Additionally: even if it´s not your taste, since it´s only 25 minutes you didn´t lose much, right? part is always, after Mikako send a message, you seen Noburo when this message arrives, which is a long time after.It´s basiclly the future you get to see.After the audience sees Noburos reaction on the message you jump back through time and space to Kikako.This makes the storytelling a bit hard to follow at first, but the result is just epic!Art 9/10The art really hit my taste and the mechas looked really cool.Nothing much to say, it just looks beautyful.Sound 9/10The soundtrack is totally fitting in every scene.That´s all there is to say.Character 9/10In this anime are only two characters.This might seem to less, but since the whole story is centered around thier relationship it´s enough.Mikakos personal developing is not much, because basiclly her story is just a few days long.On the other hand Noburos development is seen through several years, because of the timejumps.Enjoyment 10/10I totally enjoyed this show.Again, nothing to add here.Overall 10/10Voices of a Distant Star is really outstanding.At first i was cautious because it seemed very short, but at the end, i just thought: ""Wow..!""The story might be nothing special, a classic lovestory which is tested by the circumstances, but the way of telling this story makes this anime a totally new and unique experience.I personally recommend this anime to nearly everyone.Additionally: even if it´s not your taste, since it´s only 25 minutes you didn´t lose much, right?', ""After watching hundreds of hours of filler anime this one is a real breath of fresh air.

Especially considering that the entire story had to fit into a 25-minute episode. Two friends who are separated by distances far away, and try to keep in contact with each other. And as the distance grows, it grows more difficult, messages taking longer to go through. There isn't much more to say on the story due to the episode again- being only 25...minutes.Art- 4/10Unfortunately, comparing to other anime's art styles at the time it had come out, it was a poor art style. Though the art style did work well with the space battles, I'm afraid that's all. It was at the point where the characters looked very different depending on the angle, and it was hard to decipher the character's emotions though they looked like it was supposed to be clear on their face. Overall the art style really isn't that great.Sound- 7/10The sound was quite redeeming in the story. The AI's voice was played well, along with the electronic and mechanic noises such as the blasts and beeping.  Along with sounds from the character's surroundings were played quite well. The thing about the sound though is that with the characters, along with the animation, it's hard to tell their emotions.Character- 6/10Considering the 25-minute span, it's obvious we weren't going to go too deep into the characters. It's quite impossible. So within the span of 25 minutes, we don't get much of the character's character. And like said before, it was hard to decipher if there was any, emotion. Though it is mainly shown through the actions they make that show how they are feeling.Enjoyment- 8/10Hoshi no Koe has such an interesting concept. Could it have been portrayed better? Yes. But that doesn't mean that it hasn't already been portrayed well. It's a beautiful and emotional story that I did like.Overall- 6/10Overall, all things considered, I'd give the OVA a 6/10.

After seeing 5 centimeters per second, I launched into his remaining work. I quickly realized that 5 centimeters is by far his best work. Voices of a distant star is probably his least solid piece of animation (besides ""She and her cat"") that he has done. The theme of the story wasn\'t bad but because of Shinkai\'s reoccurring love themes, it was old by the time I saw this animation. The actual plot was kind of weak and was very hollow to say the least. The animation was in my opinion very poorly done (opposite of some...of Shinkai\'s other work). Character development was better than you would have thought for the length of the film. Sorry to say that It wasn\'t very good in any way.

Noboru and Mikako are really badly drawn. And I don't think this is a matter of taste; it's a matter of fact.The reason why I was able overlook characters being badly drawn is because, although they are vital to the story, they are not as present as one might expect.The Tracers...(mechas) and the Tersians  (aliens) were also less than satisfying, but acceptable.However, Hoshi no Koe has amazing artistic moments which almost completely compensate for the mentioned flaws. The scenery, the sky... actually, everything except that what I have mentioned as flawed is superbly beutiful and it's an eye-candy.

""Voices of a Distant Star"" is a masterful short film which displays how suffering can bring forth maturity. Through a skilfully crafted futuristic setting, a beautiful coming-of-age story is told.I will try to explain my take on the film the best I can.During the scene where the alien communicates with Mikako, it says that: ""Growing up can be painful sometimes, but I know you will make it much, much further."" Mikako is pretty far from earth, in fact, light-years away; yet,...the alien states that it is possible for Mikako to venture even further into space. In my opinion, the \'space travel\' idea is a metaphor for growing into adulthood. In other words, what the alien is saying is that pain and suffering is inevitable in order to mature.This suggests that the reason the aliens were attacking the human race was in fact, to help them advance and expand. The fact that the alien embraced Mikako\'s unit instead of destroying it almost makes it seem like they are commiting an act of self-sacrifice for humanity. The aliens inflict pain on humanity, but it is likely that this is to motivate growth and maturity.Ultimately, this motif is summed up in a practical and realistic way, when put into context through Mikako and Noboru\'s relationship. Their distance and seperation has in fact, ironically, brought them closer together. Mikako states that: ""there are a lot of things I miss, because there is nothing here."" Being seperated has made the couple more appreciatve of the smaller things, which most people usually take for granted. This idea is emphasised when Mikako and Noboru reminisce over the finer details about life on earth - the ""summer clouds,"" the ""sound of rain on the soft spring soil."" Things that normal people enjoy but usually overlook, until those things are gone.The pain caused by Mikako and Noburu being seperated from each other has stimulated growth in both of them - Mikako has become more contemplative, whereas Noboru has become more resolute. In both cases, their maturity wouldn\'t have been possible without the sacrifice of their time together.Sadly, the art and sound are factors are relatively disappointing when compared to the great story. Even for 2002 standards, the artwork is rough around the edges, and the voice acting for the two MCs are repulsively monotone, showing little to no emotion despite the emotionally heavy plot. The reason for this being that the film was created almost single-handedly by Shinkai; which excuses the poor quality of the art and sound but still negatively affects the enjoyability level nonetheless.""Voices of a Distant Star"" shares many similar aspects with Shinkai\'s later released ""5 Centimeters per Second,"" and with the latter being one my favourite films of all time, it makes sense that I thoroughly enjoyed the former. I tend to be fond of stories with a bittersweet theme, so I really liked this one!9/10 emjoyment but 8/10 overall due to some let-down factors. the alien states that it is possible for Mikako to venture even further into space.

With everything I’ve watched so far it’s incredibly obvious to me what score I should give it. I loved Voices of a Distant Star when I was watching it, but after I finished I had no idea if I had watched a masterpiece or a waste of time. After some deliberation, I’ve decided to call it… average.Art and Animation:14 years before Shinkai would become the first anime director to outgross Miyazaki’s Spirited Away, he animated this 25-minute short entirely by himself on a Power Mac G4. It’s incredible what he managed to do on his own back in 2002...but the CG and characters look so downright bad most of the time, and the traditional animation and CG clash far more than they mesh. Going into this movie knowing that Shinkai made it on his own makes this short a marvelous technical feat, but any other viewer (even back when it came out) would consider it average to downright bad… because it is. Sometimes though this short still manages to shine, particularly in the traditionally drawn backgrounds and lighting. It’s no surprise that Shinkai is known for these things today considering how good he was at it even back then.Plot:Relativity is such an interesting sci-fi topic that ties so well into relationships it’s no wonder why Shinkai tried to explore it here. Tried. He had a wonderful idea for this short, but conveyed nothing interesting with it. At the same time I understand why I enjoyed this movie, and the reason why people connect with Shinkai’s work at all: how relatable it is. Damn near everyone has experienced the strain of maintaining or ending a long-distance relationship and the way Shinkai increases the emotional tension and cosmic scale as the short goes on only amplifies these feelings. But when you ignore the concept and the emotions that concept wrings out all you’re left with is bad melodrama and action that doesn’t hold up to modern standards or the standards of its time. Quite a shame really, it had a great launching point to be something more than what we got.I had a great time watching this, but the art and animation are bad and the concept is interesting but doesn’t go anywhere. Knowing the context of this short in Shinkai’s career makes it incredibly interesting, but otherwise it’s nothing of note. If you’re a big Shinkai fan like I am I’d recommend this as a must watch. It’s incredibly interesting and humbling to see his beginnings in anime, and it made me respect him and his future movies even more than I already did.

The character designs are not comparable in aesthetics to our today\'s ideals of how animated chins should...be presented or the propriety in the locus of the eyes.

The heroine's alienation from life on her home planet and life in other planets due to her position as a soldier is heartbreaking. This OVA shouldn't be viewed as entertainment but as an experience. The only issues I have with the OVA is the run-time because I believe these characters deserve more development. I would like to see other forces coming into play such as society's expectations of Noboru to become a functional member of society (which means he has to develop meaningful relationships with other people around him to sustain himself) while Mikako...has to deal with focusing on the only meaningful relationship she ever had in the past to keep herself going. I would also like for more emphasis on what little information they shared resulting in the stagnation of their perception of each other due to increasing intervals of the reception of their messages. I hope that one day this OVA will inspire a studio to create a great anime series sharing a similar premise but a more engaging story. has to deal with focusing on the only meaningful relationship she ever had in the past to keep herself going.

"", 'Continuing my odd quest to watch everything Makoto Shinkai’s made, his debut short, Voices of a Distant Star, is… well, it’s not good, but it IS informative. It’s got everything I’ve come to expect from him: underplayed melancholy monologues, sad piano music, landscapes colored in gradients of desaturated light, themes of love fading across an immeasurable divide and the necessary pain of growing up and leaving things behind, the whole works. This is very much the RWBY volume 1 of Shinkai’s work: evidence of considerable talent that will be tapped much more completely later on, but for the moment is let down by amateur construction...that’s the clear result of someone just getting used to the medium he’s employing. The themes are haphazardly exposited instead of intimately felt, the animation is all very janky (the character designs in particular are hideous), the leading lady’s voice acting is distractingly amateurish, and nothing’s allowed the space it needs to breathe. It also makes heavy visual reference to Evangelion; so many shot compositions and visual motifs in Distant Star- the design of the robots’ interior, trains as a metaphor for disconnect, the color red denoting a mind-palace confrontation with a self of a different age, that classic close-up shot on the pilot’s head rising as their eyes open in tandem- could easily be classified as ripping off Eva. None of that’s to its favor, though, as they only highlight how much less effective those cinematic tricks are when not being utilized as part of a carefully constructed audiovisual masterwork. But hey, this was clearly a passion project from one guy first dipping his toe into this stuff, so it makes sense for it to be a wobbly first step. Shinkai’s work has only improved from this starting point, so it’s not worth wasting effort disliking it. that’s the clear result of someone just getting used to the medium he’s employing.

A masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai.When a strange alien force called Tarsians attacks, of which nothing is specified, some specified individuals are chosen to commander battle robots aboard human spaceships to battle the aliens. The girl Nagamine, who wishes to participate in the battle gets selected, and she comes out to be the topper of the batch. The boy Norobu on the other hand gets onto ground duty on Earth. Both get...separated by distance. Since the technology not being so efficient every message that Nagamine sends takes 6 months to reach Norobu for the distance.All during every battle all she wishes is to be with Norobu back again on Earth. Once during a battle when the human UN Forces are heavily outnumbered, they flee some light years away on some course. Then she comes to know that now they will take a course from which it will take nearly 8 years 6 months for every message of her to reach Norobu, and mails him the same. Though Norobu knows that he won\'t, in fact can\'t get mails from her everyday, still checks everyday. All during the travel since she travels at lightspeed, Nagamine still remains 15, the age when she left Earth but Norobu ages. Time comes when Norobu doesn\'t actually check mail for an year. Yet a day he receives a message, it says ""Happy 24th birthday."" The rest of the message is lost. It shows how much she cares about him.She enters another solar system, with many UN forces, but they encounter very large alien force, which takes away all the UN ships except one big one Lysithea. Even though her already loses one arm she goes to defend it. She destroys the remaining one big alien ship and other ships, and her battle robot also loses energy. It is shown that everything blows out and only she in her damaged robot is drifting away. All during the battle both Nagamine and Norobu think, that thought can go beyond distance and time, and if its true even to be with each other for one moment, to experience the memories they had, going to school, walking pasts roads at night, even just for a moment, what would they think, what would the other think. Both think ""I am here"" and she drifts away all alone into to the infinite space with nothing.The ending is very nice, though some people didn\'t like it and wanted more precise ending. I liked it. It was like she is still 15 years old, still thinks of him. Even knowing that all has ended for her, thinks of him with images in her mind, says to herself ""I am here"", something she wanted to say to him, and drifts away into the infinite space.A very nice movie with very strong emotions and a very sad and emotional ending.Greatness, everything fits in 25 minutes of its running time.

One of my favorites.', '[Spoilers... sort of]As someone who considers Gunbuster one of his favorite interdimentional timey-wimey emotional space operas, I was going into Voices of a Distant Star with a handful of recommendations and comparisons to the classic Gainax OVA. What I got was... ehhh. Thankfully, other than the basic concept of time distortion, the mecha setup, and the pacing issues (more on that later), Voices of a Distant Star is it\'s own thing, so I\'m going to do my due diligence and not compare it to the Other Time Dilation Mecha Anime.I should start off by saying that yes, it\'s awfully impressive that this was made on...some dude\'s laptop in it\'s entirety - in 2002! How often do you get genuine passion projects in anime? Not very often. Mad kudos. With that being said, bad animation is bad animation and poor storytelling is poor storytelling, no matter how big or small the production is. This is the first and last time I apologize for any insensitivites about the subject.It\'s a shame, because the concept of the show and how it\'s explained does pull at my heartstrings. It\'s a question that humanity doesn\'t currently have the technology to answer - ""as time distorts, how does relationships?"" - that gives off a unique combination of dread and longing.Funny how time distortion is probably this anime\'s biggest problem, given it\'s short length. Wait I know, it was probably born out of necessity and passion, ect! And I can certainly appreciate time-limited production\'s incredibly tough decisions to Show, Tell, or Infer... but there\'s a little too much assumptions on the viewer\'s part to really get invested in any of the story. My entire issue with the show\'s story is how much it skirts by with so little - and that\'s basically what the Characters and Story section get into.Characters:The protagonists\' relationship is what I would call ""defaulted"" - they\'re a guy and a girl and they\'re in the same class so of course they hit it off - it\'s an anime, don\'t ask why! Outside of a few scant mentions of them hanging out at convenience stores, there\'s not much development of their relationship. ""Defaulting"" assumes the viewer will be perfectly ok with this -  ""love is love"", after all. Unfortunately, without being given a real reason to care about the relationship, all the drama involving time and distance and love come across as nothing more than waxing poetic. ""I miss him"" ""I love him"" ""I want to go to the convenience store with him"" is basically all you\'re really going to get in terms of character motivation.Story:The lover\'s method of communication - their cell phones - is a cool analogue function that is immediately understandable to the viewer. Easily the best case of inferred storytelling in the entire OVA. ""Of course digital data takes a long time to get from point to point in space!""Unfortunately, all this in service to a story that doesn\'t particularly go anywhere special. They eventually long for each other so much that they are able communicate across space-time because love finds a way, or something. They basically miss hanging out with each other, mostly in ways we have to infer.And I\'m sorry if I wax on, but the mecha aspects leave something to be desired. Fine, a 14-year-old is chosen to fight in some space war - that\'s a genre birthmark. The real make-or-break for a show like this is why? Lack of manpower?

I don\'t hesitate to recommend this to people if they want to see what a truly ""indie"" anime looks like, but outside that, it\'s all empty space. some dude\'s laptop in it\'s entirety - in 2002! How often do you get genuine passion projects in anime? Not very often. Mad kudos. With that being said, bad animation is bad animation and poor storytelling is poor storytelling, no matter how big or small the production is. This is the first and last time I apologize for any insensitivites about the subject.It\'s a shame, because the concept of the show and how it\'s explained does pull at my heartstrings. It\'s a question that humanity doesn\'t currently have the technology to answer - ""as time distorts, how does relationships?"" - that gives off a unique combination of dread and longing.Funny how time distortion is probably this anime\'s biggest problem, given it\'s short length. Wait I know, it was probably born out of necessity and passion, ect! And I can certainly appreciate time-limited production\'s incredibly tough decisions to Show, Tell, or Infer... but there\'s a little too much assumptions on the viewer\'s part to really get invested in any of the story. My entire issue with the show\'s story is how much it skirts by with so little - and that\'s basically what the Characters and Story section get into.Characters:The protagonists\' relationship is what I would call ""defaulted"" - they\'re a guy and a girl and they\'re in the same class so of course they hit it off - it\'s an anime, don\'t ask why! Outside of a few scant mentions of them hanging out at convenience stores, there\'s not much development of their relationship. ""Defaulting"" assumes the viewer will be perfectly ok with this -  ""love is love"", after all. Unfortunately, without being given a real reason to care about the relationship, all the drama involving time and distance and love come across as nothing more than waxing poetic. ""I miss him"" ""I love him"" ""I want to go to the convenience store with him"" is basically all you\'re really going to get in terms of character motivation.Story:The lover\'s method of communication - their cell phones - is a cool analogue function that is immediately understandable to the viewer. Easily the best case of inferred storytelling in the entire OVA. ""Of course digital data takes a long time to get from point to point in space!""Unfortunately, all this in service to a story that doesn\'t particularly go anywhere special. They eventually long for each other so much that they are able communicate across space-time because love finds a way, or something. They basically miss hanging out with each other, mostly in ways we have to infer.And I\'m sorry if I wax on, but the mecha aspects leave something to be desired. Fine, a 14-year-old is chosen to fight in some space war - that\'s a genre birthmark. The real make-or-break for a show like this is why? Lack of manpower? Wanting the youngest people available for a campaign that would take decades of real time service?

The storyline is remarkably well thought out and well paced. Each second of the 25 minutes is used well and there is adequate time given to action as well as quiet introspection. His portrayal of Mikako as a young girl thrust into the battle against an alien threat is excellent, and the characterisation of Noboru as the boyfriend she leaves behind is also wonderful. This short manages to perfectly capture the feelings of these two people as...ever-increasing amounts of time and space separate them. It really is a wonderfully put together plot. The only complaint I have is that I wanted more – the alien threat could have been better developed and a more solid ending would have been nice too, but on the whole I was very impressed with Voices of a Distant Star.ANIMATION: Wow. It’s hard to believe that this was the sole work of Makoto Shinkai and his computer. The animation is nothing short of beautiful – the skyscapes and landscapes are just gorgeous with wonderful use of colour. The character designs aren’t the best I’ve ever seen, but they are consistent throughout. The action scenes and use of CGI is also inspired – this short is truly a triumph of independent animation!MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The version I watched was the one were Shinkai and his fiancée provided the voice work and it was pretty well done for amateurs! The music is simple and understated, playing its role well.Overall Voices of a Distant Star is simply one of the best short movies I’ve seen – its truly remarkable how so much plot and emotion these 25 minutes contain! ever-increasing amounts of time and space separate them.

Some saw it\'s fantastic, a hidden gem of sorts. Others say it\'s awful.But for whatever reason I decided to give it a shot. I mean, it was only one half an hour long episode after all.Story: 6/10Now I’ll admit, this wasn’t my cup of tea plot wise. Hoshi no koe is a love story about two teenagers who are separated between time and space-literally. The Earth is in the midst of an alien invasion and the heroine Mikako joins the resistance and goes on a mission to defeat their attackers. There’s just one...problem though; she left her long time friend and love interest, Noboru, behind.The separation does not shy the two away from keeping in contact with each other though. And here arises the other problem, the only way they can communicate is by text messaging each other on their cellphones. It would take months for them to get messages from each other, but as Mikako went further and further into space it began to take longer and longer for a message to send, eventually leading to years without contact. The story shows both sides, Mikako fighting the invasion 39 some odd light years away from Earth; and Noboru, who had vowed to never forget about Mikako and love her forever, even as he grew older.There’s not a lot more going for it than that, it can’t have any more than that since it is so short. But I will admit that by the end of it I felt a little something, something in my heart. They are separated by such a long distance, but all they want to tell each other is that they love them. That was so sad and heart warming at the same time, that I decided to give it a slightly higher score.Art: 4/10Don’t let the cover fool you, the animation quality is pretty terrible. I don’t know if it was because it was only an OVA or if the budget was low, but I know for sure that I did NOT like it at all. I actually almost dropped it just because of the animation, but I thought that would have been pretty pathetic since it was only one episode. I’ll admit that I got used to it towards the end, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t look like an amateur did it.I do have to give credit where credit is due though, the scenery was just absolutely amazing. The color contrasts were pretty darn solid. Too bad the rest of it wasn’t as good.Sound: 6/10There wasn’t a lot of sound to base my judgement on. The opening and ending sequence was just a simple piano melody, and there wasn’t much beyond that besides space guns being shot, which I suppose was alright. It wasn’t horrible, it wasn’t spectacular, it was just kind of….meh.Character: 7/10Again, since the series is so short there isn’t a lot of time to develop character backgrounds and personalities. Hoshi no koe did a good job with the time frame in which they were given though. A lot more character development was given to Mikako however, since she was the one who actually went up into space; which I loved by the way, since it breaks the conventional way of thinking that in times of war the men go off and fight while the women stay home.Both characters are so simplistic that I could actually relate more to them. There was no underlying dark past that a character was plagued with or anything. They just simply wanted to be together.Enjoyment: 7/10So did I hate this anime? No, did I love it? I wouldn’t go that far either. Hoshi no koe is just one of those series that you just sit down and watch. It’s something to take your mind away from your troubles; nothing more. It wasn’t the type of anime I would normally watch, but I didn’t feel that it was  time waster either. It was fine for the amount of effort I had to put into to watch it.Now time for the Happy Panda and Sad Panda award; this is my little quirk where I point out the best and worst part in the anime and give them an ""award"".Happy Panda goes to: The Story!Even though it received a lower score than the characters, there\'s something about \'never could be\' plots that really stabs me in the heart and twists it. The emotional end is what made the anime for sure. I\'m getting chills just thinking about it.Sad Panda goes to : The art!I almost dropped the episode just because of the art, need I say more?Total Score:30/50= .66/10All in all if you’re just looking for something to quickly distract you, then watch Hoshi no koe. If you want to build up a collection of \'shit my friends have never watched’  then watch Hoshi no koe. If you want something more than that then I suggest that you skip out on this one and dabble in something else. problem though; she left her long time friend and love interest, Noboru, behind.The separation does not shy the two away from keeping in contact with each other though.

First of all, I decided to write a review on this anime because I read the manga some time back. The story itself is quite amazing and bittersweet. I had no idea there was even an anime version of this until I searched the mecha genre on crunchyroll. After watching this short film, I felt I needed to write and encourage anyone who reads this to please read the manga. The art is not very impressive at all, but I continued watching anyways because I knew how great the story is. I felt like the anime...just didn't show enough to pull at my heart strings. Overall, I gave it a 7. But that might be because I know how amazing it could be. In short, I just didn't get the same feelings from this animation as I did while reading the story. just didn't show enough to pull at my heart strings. Overall, I gave it a 7.

In short, I just didn't get the same feelings from this animation as I did while reading the story."", ""I watched this right when it was released, and no one knew the director, who had done all of this with two friends. I probably watch it once every year, and it hasn't gotten the least bit old yet. Makoto Shinkai has been on my list of people to watch (in the same way as Hayao Miyazaki is) ever since, because he has that something that made me fall in love with anime as a medium to begin with.Many shows fail to express the characters and the concept in a hundred episodes, while this masterpiece does so in mere minutes. If I had to describe...the experience, this show is like a series of haikus, together painting a vignette that itself could be summed up in a single 5-second section at the end.This is an anime about communication and the human connection between individuals over both time and distance. To consider it sci-fi or romance (or pretty much any other rubber stamp) is to do it a great disservice. The feelings of the characters are palpable in every scene, supported by beautiful and vivid artwork and sound work that invokes Monet in the use of light and color in expressing not simply a scene, but also the feelings embedded in that scene.I can go on, but I would be wasting your time, that you should be spending watching the show. Beyond the Clouds, a feature-length work by Shinkai, is a good follow-on, and explores the same ideas in a different way. the experience, this show is like a series of haikus, together painting a vignette that itself could be summed up in a single 5-second section at the end.This is an anime about communication and the human connection between individuals over both time and distance.

To be honest I cannot go into detail about the story because its so short. Just take my word for it and watch it. Within the first 12 minutes I was already developing tears, 20 minutes in and they fell down my face. Its that sad.The only real fault here is the art style. The characters look awkwardly proportioned with the detail being a bit off. The CGI...for the mechs and whatnot look very cheap but again, this does not matter for the purpose of getting the message that it conveys.The only other kink in this OVA's armor is that the music didn't stand out. But at least it wasn't annoying or anything. The voice acting on the other hand is perfect.I think a 9/10 is perfect for this OVA with only 1 point taken off because of the art. If it was completely 2D like say Gundam then I think this would have been a complete 10/10 for me. for the mechs and whatnot look very cheap but again, this does not matter for the purpose of getting the message that it conveys.The only other kink in this OVA's armor is that the music didn't stand out.

I personally think if it had been longer than 20 minutes, maybe 4 episodes, then it could have worked. But the time they set themselves to tell this story did not work.Story: 3/10I- I don't even understand what the story was? There wasn't a big introduction, this boy and girl were just friends and then she gets sent to space at 15 for no apparent reason. The idea of 90s phones in a futuristic anime is ludicrous to me. No effort was made to change the designs even...slightly, and you would think for an anime set in 2046, there would be a more effective way of communicating, rather than it taking years just to send one email. Nothing really happens throughout the entire movie, there is definitely no conclusion of the story. It just ends. It could have ended at half way through the movie and it would have felt the same. At least 5cm had a conclusive ending, even if it wasn't very good. I like the idea of two lovers being long distance, but Shinkai just can't seem to pull it off. The entire story is just a mess, there is no progression for me to even begin to care about these characters and their story.Art: 1/10The animation... it literally looks like a fan-made project by a teenager. Not a group of professionals. The characters are awfully designed. The proportions and angles were so off putting, no scene looked correct. Every bit of animation looked HORRIBLE. I found it very hard to watch it all the way through in one sitting. The only redeeming factor is the 3D fight scenes and the scenery. They look like they at least had some effort put into them. The mecha designs were very generic and uninspired, clearly no thought was put into the designing of it. I do get that this anime is from 2002, therefore there wasn't the technology there is now, but other anime that came out way before are higher quality. So the issue here is not limited technology.Sound: 3/10The sound may be the only redeeming quality of this anime, but the music and songs were not great either, I cannot even recall how they sounded. I can't even recall if there even was music. That's how bad it was.Character: 1/10You can hardly tell that there ARE characters in this dreadful movie. They were like two bricks trying to communicate. No personality whatsoever. I expected Noboru and Nagamine's relationship to escalate somewhat, but nothing happened. Noboru was an emotionless and distant guy, he may as well have not been in the movie. Nagamine was just a childish and clingy girl. Both awful personalities that were not developed in the slightest. At least 5cm had somewhat likable characters. It is weird as well that they are the only characters shown, what about the people Nagamine went to space with? What about her family? Noboru's friends? Anyone? It felt so lonely, there was nothing good about it.Enjoyment: 1/10There was no enjoyment at all. I was so close to turning it off many times, but I decided to push myself through it.Overall: 2/10Awful story, awful art, awful sound, awful characters, awful awful awful!!

The plot is a fair one and it does try to highlight the theme of distance but the runtime is too short for the proper execution of it. The background score is also just fair. The movie clearly lacks a lot in terms of character development as well.However, one thing that does shine in the movie is the strong emotions which are clearly portrayed. This fact alone makes this short-film a strong piece of work.Ultimately, this movie does make a great impact on the viewer at first but this impact is not long-lasting and...it fades away within some days. it fades away within some days.', 'Spoiler free review"" A distance that takes 8 years at the speed of light is no different than saying \'forever\' "" -NoboruHoshi no Koe is a 25 minute movie/ova by Makoto Shinkai and Comix wave . The scarcity in budget can be traced not only from bad animations or character designs but also from the fact that except for music almost most of the staff work script,character design, animations, direction and production was done by Shinkai himself and the production team, even the VAs were very limited. But that doesn\'t stop it\'s heartfelt and very ""realistic"" story from touching viewer\'s emotions.Story- 9.5/10Hoshi no koe is...set in future where space exploration is booming. People from all over the world are recruited for space expeditions and to fight against other alien like creatures from whom all these technologies are derived which led the human space technology in the state it is now.The story focuses on 2 junior high school students Noboru and Mikako who, as many others, fall in love with each other. But then after graduation Mikako is selected as to join the space expedition to Mars and if situation arises, to fend off aliens inhabiting the place. The story however isn\'t focused on these fights, explorations and aliens. It\'s complete focus is on the relationship of these two. Before Mikako leaves earth they decide to be in touch via mails and continue their long distance relationship. But as you might know, nothing can travel faster than speed of light and sadly, not even human emotions. As the distance between them grows, literally but not emotionally, they\'re faced with cruel reality as the only link connecting them glows dimmer.Earlier I used the word realistic because the concept is derived from something really plausible which makes the emotions even more spontaneous.Characters- 8.5/10There are just 2 characters. I mean not just 2 main characters but 2 characters overall in whole 25 minutes of the movie. But instead of having it exploited as it\'s weakness, Hoshi no koe uses it in it\'s advantage by giving great character development to these two. Both Mikako and Noboro go through a lot of changes through the years, but Noboru\'s character development is especially perceivable, he tries to suppress his emotions and hides his helplessness by pretending to an adult and trying to blend in the society but deep inside he knows himself that nothing can fill that empty void inside of him. Mikako too, as she goes to the places no human has ever went before, sees new places, sceneries so beautiful that can\'t be described in words but none of it seems to put her heart at ease as the simple rain in July after the school on earth with Noboru did.Animations - 4/10Here I wish that it had good animations. This is only part that lets it down. Character designs also are not good. Only good thing in animations are the sceneries( the one on earth specially). It uses Cgi for most of the space scenes in motion and that cgi is bad (still not as bad as berserk 2016).Music - 8/10There isn\'t much music, but where it is, it\'s executed perfectly. The inserted song at the ending melts perfectly with the ending and left me frozen momentarily.Overall- 8/10Even though it\'s quite short, 25 minutes, being the length of a single episode of an anime, it still manages to be better and convey much more emotions than many of the full length animes of this category. I highly recommend it. If you like the likes of Kimi no na wa then you\'ll probably love this too. Give it as try you won\'t regret it. set in future where space exploration is booming.

As it happens, this came before any of those, so maybe that makes my perspective a little wonky, but it certainly seems to me like this was the bedrock that Shinkai would go on to build off of with his future works.This is, in just about every way, what one would expect from an early Shinkai film, and in fact it's the first film, minus the extremely short She...and Her Cat, that he himself wrote. As with his other works there is a profound message about the connection between two humans who are separated by a tremendous distance in one form or another (a theme he'd go on to repeat with physical distance in 5 Centimeters Per Second, age difference in The Garden of Words and time difference in Your Name), the backgrounds and environments look stunning (especially for a twenty year old film) and the writing is deep, pure and authentic. I also thought the ending song, Through The Years and Far Away, was quite lovely.The base premise and setting of this film had all the potential in the world, and had it been expanded upon this film had the potential to be a 9 or a 10 for me easily, but two major shortcomings cap it firmly at an 8 and prevent it from being the masterpiece that it could have been. The first is the length, which at 24 minutes is simply way, way too short to truly build up the attachment to the characters and deliver the emotional whammy it's going for. Had this been an hour and a half or something in that vicinity and he'd maintained the same depth and quality throughout, there's no doubt in my mind this would be among my favorite anime of all time. 24 minutes kills me. It gave me just a small taste of something that could have been incredible but then disallowed me from taking further sips. It's like playing a demo for a video game that absolutely blows you away and gets you beyond excited to play the full version but then being disallowed to ever actually play the full version.The second thing that really holds this film back for me is how ugly the character models look. It's especially egregious given how good everything around them looks, but they're really, really ugly. I can't even give them a pass because it was 2002- there are several anime older than this whose characters look considerably better. I'm not sure what went wrong here, but it sticks out like a sore thumb and detracts from the final score.If you're able to get beyond the length and the ugly characters and simply enjoy the story for what it is, there's a short but sweet treat to enjoy here. I liked it, and I'm a big Shinkai fan as a whole, but I see so much wasted potential here and I cannot help but wonder what could have been if he'd only expanded upon this premise further. As it stands, I'd recommend it to people who, like me, already know they like Shinkai's stuff. Otherwise, while I wouldn't NOT recommend it, as it's only 24 minutes of your time even if you don't end up loving it, I don't see this as essential viewing.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7-8PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8 and Her Cat, that he himself wrote.

Granted, this might just be my bias towards anything that shinkai has ever laid his hands on, but I digress.Story: 7/10Shinkai's films have generally always had some kind of idea or emotion tied to them, and in this case, it's the subject of distance. I think that such a basic concept was used very well, but the simplicity at its core held it back from being something that really stuck with me, though I was invested in it in the moment....The representation of distance through the message time was well used, and really helped to provide a concrete form for such an abstract concept. The story is paced in such a way that I never felt like I was waiting for anything to happen, while also never feeling rushed. Unfortunately, though well paced and executed, I was left wishing for something a little more, especially regarding what was going on with the Tarsians, since they were really just used as objects that were mowed down with no real problem, leading to an unfortunate lack of tension in the final action sequence.Art: 8/10It's a Shinkai film, do I need to tell you that the environments are beautiful? I was also pleasantly surprised by how well done the 3DCG was done, especially considering that this film is now almost 17 years old. But, despite this praise I need to address the elephant in the room: the characters. The models are honestly pretty bad in general, and in some cases just look completely wrong, with eyes almost popping off the sides of heads and everything looking out of line. Thankfully, most of the art is the scenery and CG mech scenes, so my eyes were saved from the creatures of Lovecraftian horror that the character models occasionally became.Sound: 6/10I don't have much to say about the sound. Both VAs are certainly capable, though I don't think either will be winning awards for their performance. There isn't really a soundtrack to speak of, with what little music there is mostly being light ambience. The end theme is rather forgettable, and unlike most of the other end themes in Shinkai's films, I never really felt a desire to search it out for listening in everyday life.Characters: 7/10I already discussed the character's looks, so I'll refrain from mentioning that again and instead just focus on their personalities. Unfortunately, when looking at personalities, there isn't much to talk about. The characters are really just used as a medium for emotion, and lacked any real personalities of their own. Even then, they were used well to convey the feelings that the film was looking to convey, so they get a 7 for being good enough that I didn't feel like complaining about them while watching, even if they aren't that great objectively.Enjoyment: 9/10Now, don't get me wrong here. Despite ripping into every aspect of this film, I really, really enjoyed it. It certainly isn't perfect, but it had an emotional impact on me, and to be perfectly honest, it's a classic Shinkai film, but with mechas fighting in space. As the massive Shinkai fanboy that I am, I would be hard pressed to not enjoy the hell out of something like that.Overall: 7.5/10, Which I round up to an 8/10Hoshi no Koe is nothing crazy or revolutionary, but it isn't trying to be. It tells an emotional story pretty well, and is more than enjoyable enough for me to watch it a few times. I'd certainly recommend it, though I will give a word of warning. I was able to enjoy it because I went in with no expectations. Had I started watching this expecting something of the same quality of Kimi No Na Wa just because they were made by the same person, I would have been incredibly disappointed. If you look at Hoshi no Koe like you would anything else, you'll probably have a good time with it, but if you're expecting something of the quality of modern Shinkai, you're going to be disappointed.

If there's any anime out there deserving of a real good old fashioned Hollywood remake... Look no further, famous producers reading my reviews.I think this is definitely the unpolished blueprint...for almost all Shinkai films afterwards, and not nearly as good, but still has such good ideas that you can't help but appreciate them anyway. for almost all Shinkai films afterwards, and not nearly as good, but still has such good ideas that you can't help but appreciate them anyway."", 'I want to start by saying that I\'m a huge fan of Makoto Shinkai\'s work, in general.  5cm Per Second is one of my favourite films of all time, and obviously the phenomenal Kimi No Na Wa sets a bar that\'s almost impossible to reach.I wasn\'t expecting Hoshi no Koe to live up to that legacy.  It was one of Shinkai\'s earliest works, and it really shows.  The sparks of greatness are there, but there\'s no material for them to set alight.Overall:If you don\'t expect the world from it, it\'s a pleasant watching experience.  As a Shinkai fan I always find...his earlier work fascinating, and with Hoshi no Koe being a short rather than a feature film I honestly don\'t feel like my time was wasted on it even with the low rating I\'m giving it.  If you\'re a fan of Makoto Shinkai and you have half an hour to spare... why not, you know?Story and Characters:Not the greatest.  The concept, two young people who never confessed their feelings to one another separated by lightyears, is a fairly firm one.  The execution just lets it down.  We aren\'t given enough time with the characters to understand their motivations, or even why they like each other in the first place.  A large part of this is probably the fault of the runtime being so short; we simply don\'t have time to spare getting to know these kids.The problem with that is that without us as an audience being able to connect with these characters, when the attempts at tearjerking come in later it just falls flat.  You can\'t get emotional over a character you know nothing about.There are other issues with the story, but you can kind of suspend disbelief long enough to ignore them and others have covered it pretty well in their reviews anyway, so I\'ll not waste my time or yours rehashing it.Art and Animation:The animation is good, but the extremely dated and somewhat haphazard art style lets it down massively.  The backgrounds, scenery, and lighting are all exactly what you\'d expect from Shinkai even with the film being such an early work.  The real problem is the character art, which looks very much like the kind of ""anime"" we all drew in our school notebooks when we were twelve.  Yeah, you\'ve got distorted faces when they move\'; you\'ve got enormous, dead-inside eyes; you\'ve got suspiciously missing foreheads; you\'ve got hair with no volume that just falls flat and lifeless...  It\'s grim.  It\'s really grim.  And I know I\'m not really being fair to it, given its age, but the thing is it\'s not aged well.  Don\'t go into this film expecting it to look like Kotonoha no Niwa, that\'s all I\'m saying.Soundtrack:Good!  I enjoyed the music here, and along with the background/scenery art I\'d say this film\'s soundtrack was probably its strongest element.  A soft piano piece that played at one point put me strongly in mind of 5cm Per Second\'s main theme, which is one of my favourite pieces of film music (so that\'s high praise).Enjoyment:I enjoyed it.  It was crude in parts, and it wasn\'t very sophisticated, but I\'d say it was worth my time even just for the scenery and the concept.  Yes, even though that concept wasn\'t immaculately executed, and even though that scenery often had horrifying mutant-humans in the foreground.Maybe I\'m biased, who knows. his earlier work fascinating, and with Hoshi no Koe being a short rather than a feature film I honestly don\'t feel like my time was wasted on it even with the low rating I\'m giving it.

Yeah, you\'ve got distorted faces when they move\'; you\'ve got enormous, dead-inside eyes; you\'ve got suspiciously missing foreheads; you\'ve got hair with no volume that just falls flat and lifeless...  It\'s grim.  It\'s really grim.  And I know I\'m not really being fair to it, given its age, but the thing is it\'s not aged well.  Don\'t go into this film expecting it to look like Kotonoha no Niwa, that\'s all I\'m saying.Soundtrack:Good!  I enjoyed the music here, and along with the background/scenery art I\'d say this film\'s soundtrack was probably its strongest element.  A soft piano piece that played at one point put me strongly in mind of 5cm Per Second\'s main theme, which is one of my favourite pieces of film music (so that\'s high praise).Enjoyment:I enjoyed it.  It was crude in parts, and it wasn\'t very sophisticated, but I\'d say it was worth my time even just for the scenery and the concept.  Yes, even though that concept wasn\'t immaculately executed, and even though that scenery often had horrifying mutant-humans in the foreground.Maybe I\'m biased, who knows.', 'Hoshi No Koe, or Voices of a Distant Star, is an anime that will make you question whether or not you\'ve accidentally stumbled upon a PowerPoint presentation. The story follows two lovers separated by space and time, and their attempts to stay connected through text messages and giant robot battles. Because, you know, nothing says ""romance"" like fighting off alien invaders.The style of Hoshi No Koe is...well, let\'s just say it\'s not for everyone. The animation is a strange mix of 2D and 3D, with character designs that are reminiscent of a middle schooler\'s doodles. But hey, who needs actual artistic talent when you can...just throw some fancy camera angles and lens flares into the mix, right?As for the main characters, we have the angsty teenage boy who\'s always brooding and trying to act tough, and the girl who\'s...also angsty and always trying to act tough. It\'s like watching a live-action Twilight movie, but with giant robots and a fraction of the budget.The music in Hoshi No Koe is actually quite good, which is a relief considering how lackluster the rest of the anime is. It\'s emotional and haunting, and really helps to elevate some of the more dramatic scenes.As for my enjoyment experience, well...let\'s just say that Hoshi No Koe is an acquired taste. It\'s like eating a dish you\'ve never tried before and not quite knowing whether you like it or not. 7.333/10, because while it\'s not exactly a masterpiece, it\'s still worth watching if you\'re in the mood for some bizarre, quasi-romantic robot battles. just throw some fancy camera angles and lens flares into the mix, right?As for the main characters, we have the angsty teenage boy who\'s always brooding and trying to act tough, and the girl who\'s...also angsty and always trying to act tough.

Much much more important however is that this movie\'s producer and pretty much everything else about this movie, except origin and ED singer is none other than Makoto Shinkai. Yes, The Makoto Shinkai who got everyone and their mother\'s radar through his movie \'Your Name\'. Makoto Shinkai pretty much made everything on this movie alone, except the ED as I just said before. So first of all, mad props for actually doing something like that. Not an easy thing to do. Now,...before I go over to the actual review I like to point out that this movie came out in 2002. So this movie is ""a bit old"". Anyway, now to the review.Plot/Story: The story is set in a near future where humanity as already found ways of galactic travel. During the colonization of Mars aliens attacked the UN base and now humans are in pursuit of those aliens in order tot ske revenge. To do that the UN needed soldiers so they recruit people from different countries. Noboru and Mikako are two students who are in love with each other. They plan to go to the same college, but unfortunately destiny has other plans. Mikako gets scouted by the UN to pilot one of their war mechs. As Mikako leaves earth to fight the aliens he tries to send Noboru mails per Handy. But distance and time for each mail to reach Noboru keeps increasing...While a fairly simple.concept \'Hoshi no Koe\' manages to entertain and to pull of a solid story. And that in only 25 minutes. Not only is this simple plot carried out well, it also achieves exactly what it wanted to and it manages to draw the viewer in. This puts several 12-24 episodes long anime I\'ve seen to shame.Art: The artstyle and animation is...unconventional. This is definitely the first time I\'ve seen such an artstyle. I\'m. Not going to bash it but I want to point out that the lines of each person and object is pretty rough. Unfortunately there is also CGI involved in this anime and in 2002....let\'s say the CGI back then wasn\'t as refined as it is now. And even today it still isn\'t perfect. But the art and animation to what they have to do. Honestly, the artstyle might even enhance the feeling of this show.Sound: Nothing notworthly. It was there, but that\'s basically it. Nothing outrageous or amazing to point out.Characters: we only have Nobume and Mikako as characters. This will. Be fast. The focus on this lies with Mikako since she\'s the one sending the mails. The weight on her sending the mails, knowing how long they will take to reach Nobume is a lot. But also Nobume has problems to face. The distance extends and as such he grow solder. How long can he still hold on to Mikako and waiting for her letters. This anime shows in the small 25 minutes what a toll it takes on them mentally. Well done.Overall enjoyment and verdict: For 25 minutes you get a well constructed romantic drama about distance. While watching, and I won\'t lie, I was more invested into these 2 characters than into some anime altogether. While almost all. It\'s points are around avarage it still manages to produce a good and enjoyable watch. I can recommend this to anyone who is a completionist or likes some romance drama.And that\'s already it for this review. Short and compact.

Messages travel at fastest, the speed of light, so it's not unusual that it would have a huge delay in travel - not to mention the technology is Martian, not human.I found it much better than 5 cm/s because it was more consistent. The ending was left open which was more satisfying than I thought.The art sucked, even for 2007 standards. Expected much more from Shinkai. Sound was fine, nothing too special. The characters had little to no development but this expected of an anime based around them never meeting each other. It is an interesting premise and...I did not deduct points for character development.It was a short but nice anime. 25 minutes, not too long, try it out.

I was expecting to not really get invested into it, but somehow Shinkai made me care about this story. The theme of strained relationships is found in all of his work with this being no exception. The character designs are kind of wack and the 3D is extremely dated, but the landscapes and lighting really stand out just like any of his other work. It's really cool to see the early work of someone who has made it as big as him and see how far they've progressed. It's kind of inspirational in...a way.

And today marks another such occasion as I have once again completed the filmography of a director that I hold in much esteem(not counting any of his short films that were less than 10 minutes long of course).Maybe not as much as Kubrick but the impact that Makoto Shinkai had on me should be obvious for anyone who's known me long enough as not only did he make what I consider to...be my all time favourite movie with 2016's Your Name but he also delivered what would eventually become the very first anime film that I have ever seen with 2007's Five Centimetres Per Second. (I am not counting the The Digimon Movie because I didn't really have a clue what anime even was back in the day)I remember instantly falling in love with Five Centimetres Per Second and further cementing my affections for a medium that I was only starting to really get into. And now I have the pleasure of seeing his very first film, Voices of a Distant Star, which is a 24 minute short that he made almost completely on his own. And once you consider that fact, it is impressive how much he was able to accomplish in such a short time and with so little man power. His fingerprints are clearly evident throughout the film's runtime. I mean Shinkai sure does love a story about star crossed lovers doesn't he?

Because of its length, a lot of the themes and story beats do feel underdeveloped and half baked. It's undoubtedly ambitious and I am afraid that the film's length just doesn't allow it to fully expand on many of the ideas that's seemingly touched upon here. And the film is clunky in terms of how everything is presented as well.

Voices of a Distant Star features a boy named Noboru and a girl named Mikako who try hard to remain connected no matter how far they are from each other. It is a quite a simple movie with no relevant explanation of exploring the enemies' origins nor does it go deep into the space agency that hires kids to fight aliens lol. Well, it is quite a bittersweet story with almost the right amount of runtime.Art: It is a little bland compared to other 90's...animation works. It is not very appealing.Story: The plot seeks to romanticize and explore the relationship of staying connected to one another no matter where they are.

No other way to put it. But the art was pretty sub-par. I think it defiantly could have been executed better as far as artork goes. But the overall plot was really good.

', ""By modern standards, the art of Hoshi no Koe (Voices of a Distant Star) is certainly lacklustre — the character designs are uninspired, with squashed heads and poor movement animation.However, the focus of this short film isn't to amaze you with art ahead of its time or really inspire any form of connection to the characters themselves, but rather tell a story. Centred around the theme of emotional connection between two individuals and the ever-growing distance of space that divide them, it's a somewhat original and certainly interesting watch compared to a lot of anime we get these days.Would I say it's perfect...or even amazing? Far from it. But as a short film around the length of 25 minutes, I definitely recommend watching it. or even amazing? Far from it.

At the beginning I was a bit uncertain about it, due to the clearly unpolished and almost experimental graphic style, but then I found out what was all about and changed my mind. This was one of the very first works of Makoto, but especially, a one man work. Basically he did everything almost alone (if not alone at all) when still younger as a sort of promo work.However, aside from the issue with the graphic aspect, when it comes to the soft and sentimental narration instead, along with certain use of warm...light throughout the scenes, I immediately recognized his typical style which can be found again in its subsequent work 5 Centimeters per Second, something which positively surprised me.The same is for the story, where Makoto didn't offer any complex plot, by focusing instead the attention on the distant and sentimental relationship between the protagonists, in the same way of his next work I mentioned above.This is why, in conclusion, Voices of a Distant Star is an anime I appreciated, but which I feel to recommend only to those like me, who appreciated older Makoto Shinkai works and are now willing to discover more about the origins of this beloved japanese author.

Pretty epic premise if you're into 17th century colonialism, but that's not what this is about.Upon first glance I thought this would be very similar to 5 centimetres a second, and the plot and themes are definitely similar but the latter takes a very different direction. Having watched this, it's pretty clear to me why the same director wanted to make 5 centimetres a second - the premise is executed far more effectively and...is explored in a way that feels far more meaningful and deliberate than what's going on hereThe events on screen are somewhat incoherent, just watch 5cm/s instead. is explored in a way that feels far more meaningful and deliberate than what's going on hereThe events on screen are somewhat incoherent, just watch 5cm/s instead."", '[Spoilers]Knowing Shinkai\'s style as a director, I expected a good amount of romance and drama in Hoshi no Koe. What I didn\'t expect was him trying to fit it all in 25 minutes.The story is pretty straightforward - it tells the tale of two lovers separated by time and space, desperately yearning to see each other again; but the universe seems intent on making their reunion impossible. While this is a familiar concept, it can be executed in a plethora of different ways. This time, Shinkai frames it in the context of an intergalactic war between humans and hostile aliens known as Tarsians.The war...is mainly used as a plot device to forcibly separate the female protagonist through a military draft, but it also leads to the interesting concept of letters “lagging” in time. It’s quite a unique way of conveying a long-distance relationship, if not even enhancing the emotions involved.Portraying the girl’s draft as inevitable, Shinkai builds sentiment by showing the despair and loneliness the two lovers feel as they are separated. Several scenes show both protagonists waiting in solitude for a response, unable to move on in their lives. And to make matters worse, the war causes the girl to drift further into the depths space, affecting the delay between their messages. A month of waiting became a year, and a year became almost a decade. Any hope the girl had of returning from the war was continually snuffed out, as the conflict with the Tarsians had no visible end. Both characters, deprived of their loved one, succumb to despair and loneliness.All of this Shinkai tries to fit into 25 minutes, and this is the main flaw of this anime - the lack of context removes clarity and depth from the powerful relationship the two protagonists supposedly have. You see, fleshing out the characters is important in portraying a meaningful relationship. Otherwise, the only thing the audience knows is  ""Oh, Mikako and Noboru love each other but can\'t be together, so they\'re sad."" I can imagine some will find their relationship hard to comprehend, or maybe just uninspiring or weak. Naturally, the more empathy and experience one has, the easier it would be to “fill in the blanks” and infer the facets and emotions of their relationship; however, excessively relying on empathy is a mistake. Still, people who\'ve experienced being separated from their loved ones will be able to connect the dots quite easily.Another thing that bothered me was that barely any of their messages were actually read out loud. Once again, we know nothing about their relationship, except the assumption that they\'re sad and lonely. The lines near the end about how Mikako wanted to experience life\'s beauty with Nobaru were touching for sure, but nothing demonstrates why they feel that way about each other. This is one of the most important parts about portraying a profound romantic love - the question of why they truly love each other in the first place. Insight into Nobaru\'s and Mikako\'s conversations could have conveyed how close they were, if utilized correctly. Instead, we got a handful of scenes in the past with them riding on a bike together. Moreover, they never even confessed their feelings to each other. This lack of self-disclosure from both sides makes their relationship seem more like an ungrounded attachment rather than meaningful love.Still, I personally found the characterization to be done fairly well, despite only being defined by a few major events. The two characters seemed realistic enough, and their agonizing love for each other was portrayed shallowly yet beautifully. I could really feel Mikako\'s hopelessness as she fought the Tarsians over and over again. Furthermore, after so many years apart, I think their view of each other must have transformed substantially. If only there had been enough runtime to demonstrate this shift in their relationship. After all, being apart for so many years, what do they love about each other, anyway? Perhaps it\'s the fact that only through each other did they ever experience love. Undoubtedly, they would have idealized aspects of each other and their past together. This could have been used to show how idealization is so easy to cling onto when you have nothing else.I also want to emphasize how profound it is, what Shinkai is attempting to convey. For example, what exactly is a significant other? Well, a significant other is anyone who you share meaning with. In sociological terms, you take on their role, imagine their perspective, and use them to constitute a significant part of your entire self. Without these people, life would lose its meaning. A lot of people view this romantically, but this can also extend to family and close friends.But what I found so touching was that these two lovers only had eyes for each other. They were each other’s significant other, and no one else. This explains their devotion to each other after many aimless and painful years, and why neither of them could ever move on. For how could Nobaru move on, if Mikako was the only thing that gave life meaning? What even was life if he gave up on her? The only thing both people can do is tearfully reminisce about their past and hope for a future where they would somehow be together. That sums it up: hope and reminiscence. Sometimes they’re the only things you can do, no matter how illogical or improbable they may seem.Obviously, both characters needed to be fleshed out more. Conveying slices of their past in greater quantity and depth, as well as providing more snapshots of their aimless and trapped lives could have elevated this into a legendary tearjerker. Still, this anime covers the fundamentals very well.I also have no complaints about the sound or art. I admit I don’t pay much attention to these aspects compared to story and characterization, but I found the art gorgeous and the sound fitting.Overall, I really enjoyed this. Despite missing out on its potential as a full-length feature, what Shinkai was able to fit into 25 minutes was something quite special indeed.Well done, Makoto Shinkai. A good first film.

The animation mainly contains the main two characters and Ishida\'s friend along with some shots of nature. In the first song I didn\'t understand the animation and whether it was supposed to tell a story but in the second song the animation has a clear story attached to it. At the very least it\'s something to watch while listening to the music.The songs themselves are alright and you\'ll probably recognise them from the movie. If you...didn\'t like the music in the movie then obviously you won\'t like this.Overall you can watch this if you liked the music in the movie but you\'re not missing out on much if you decide not to watch these. didn\'t like the music in the movie then obviously you won\'t like this.Overall you can watch this if you liked the music in the movie but you\'re not missing out on much if you decide not to watch these.']"
Kyoushoku Soukou Guyver (1989),https://myanimelist.net/anime/6016/Kyoushoku_Soukou_Guyver_1989,"[""******First of all,it was the first anime i've ever seen! I remembered was 6 years old, my father took me from a kinder gurden,we went to a videoaudio technics shop,there on screens was the Guyver...wow,it impressed me,i was so excited...My father noticed my interes,so it wasn't a problem,he bought it******So many years passed but I still love it.+Breathtaking plot,the story won't let you get out of a screen!+great animation (those monsters are so cool,how was I not afraid of them when i was a kid O,o), a lot of blood,meat :D+Characters' temper and their nature are showed well!+It is the first anime movie watched by...me-So,I'm reading the Guyver manga at the moment,and the story is continied...so bad there are only 12series! me-So,I'm reading the Guyver manga at the moment,and the story is continied...so bad there are only 12series!"", ""All I can say is that if you have seen the newer TV series, the plot of this oav pretty much follows the same story line except some changes and being a 12 episode series, the pacing is more condensed and less material is covered. The beginning of the oav this time will be that the man on the run from Cronos is accidentally ran over by a truck as opposed to being stopped by two officers. But these events still lead up to the same result: Tetsuro and Sho go to a lake to hang out, and the man being chased causes an explosion...and in front of them flies a special mechanical device in which Sho becomes the Guyver.I won't go over the changes due to spoiler reasons, so I got really nothing to really say about the story that I already said about in the TV series. But some of the changes should make the viewing experience a little fresher, and I like how certain things were better kept under ambiguity such as the identity of the 3rd Guyver while I felt the TV series rushed and it came across more as a fan service move for fans of the original manga which I could understand. But I have yet to read the manga, so some ambiguity and unpredictable elements will help me at some aspect.Well, the general design for the monsters and the uniforms of the Cronos soldiers are still the same from the TV series. Of course for being an older series, the quality will be more dated, and the coloring and resolution will look grainier, and the frame rate will not be as smooth. But moving on, a significant difference in this one is the design of Sho himself. His hair is much thinner, and he has these long side burns. His design came across as very feminine in comparison to his Heero Yuy design in the TV series and the old 1985 movie. I like how in the other anime installments (not sure what his design is in the manga) he looks more generic just so he won't stand out too much and I like how it kind of represented that the Guyver is an ordinary guy. While in this one, Sho just simply looks like a pussy. But that's just me, and I'll admit that his design doesn't overall negate the experience of the anime.Another design I sort of had a problem with is Agito's and Tetsuro's. He looks way too old and didn't come across convincingly as a teenager. In the TV series, I liked how his wavy hair gave him more of a youthful look, and with the wider eyes and face, he could also still look dignified. The action is still violent and in your face so it should be exciting. But the execution will be stiffer. Another aspect I didn't like was in the later half, they used repetitive frames for emphasis and it was super choppy.One thing I can say about the Guyver OAV that is better than the TV series is the music and the voice acting in Japanese. Before I go on, I want to say the dub flat out sucks. I tried watching it, but I couldn't bear 5 seconds of it. Fuck the dub, and just watch it in Japanese instead.  The opening theme is incredible and feels pretty immersing with the presented imagery. It has pretty catchy beats, the percussion is excellently orchestrated, and the singing gives it a noir kind of feel to the series like the recent Skullman anime though Guyver itself doesn't really come across as Noir in the way Skullman does. I thought it also represented its high-octane action nature at the right moments as well. I could listen to the theme song over and over.  The Japanese track also has a few all star names that are more recognizable from the TV series who I thought were also excellent but not in the leagues of who I am about to mention.Kusao Takashi, the voice of Trunks from Dragon Ball Z plays Sho. I think the portrayal of the future Trunks character, especially in the Trunks special where he's a confused teen with great power and ambition really works well with this role, and I loved it how he screams Guyver to transform. And Wakamoto Norio, the voice of Cell from DBZ plays Risker/Guyver II. And Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Woody from the original Gundam series, and Terryman from Kinnikuman plays Guyver III. I thought he brought a great commanding presence to the character.In the end, I feel Guyver fans who already seen the TV series and have read the manga despite this being older will appreciate this oav more. and in front of them flies a special mechanical device in which Sho becomes the Guyver.I won't go over the changes due to spoiler reasons, so I got really nothing to really say about the story that I already said about in the TV series.

Therefore it leaves you unfinished at the end and you will have to read the manga if you want to see the rest. So depending on the person, the score may be lower if having to continue the story via reading the manga is a critical negative to you.The story of this anime is actually quite believable in that there is this secret corporation, called Chronos, that plans on obtaining world power (similar to the ""Illuminati""). Unlike other anime that rely on magic and supernatural, this one is...scientific and also often makes references to the unknown of beasts and aliens.The art has a retro look to it and would seem to be this anime\'s weakest aspect (because it is old). Although if you really like action anime, I\'d say don\'t let the art stop you from enjoying this epic anime. The action is great and I really enjoyed the idea and concept for Guyver.However, I will say that, despite being old, the art style is really spectacular. Which makes me wish more modern anime could adapt this kind of art.This anime has pain and sacrifice. Suffering and loss. As well as friendship, in both sides of good and evil. Characters have their personalities and qualities; and the bonds between main character-Shou and his precious father and friends are interesting and powerful. Even the enemies have their desires to protect one another. Since enemies also have back-stories, they have reasons to fight for each another.I really enjoyed this anime because it has a well thought out plot and story; and from this, it also makes good use of its characters.

If you like action anime, watch Kyoushoku Soukou Guyver.', 'The Guyver Volume 1 is the first six of a twelve episode series loosely based on Yoshiki Takaya\'s manga. The anime has gained a huge cult following over the years. This was mainly due to its graphic violence which can be brutal at times. To the best of my knowledge the manga spawned this particular series, two live action films, and a 26 episode remake that was released in 2005. Some fans actually hail this version as the best. I on the other hand just can\'t agree with that.The Guyver is a sci-fi action series which in my view succeeds in two areas. This would...be in the action scenes and with some of its characters. The battle scenes can be very brutal on some occasions. The action scenes consist of hand to hand combat plus battles with advanced weaponry. The Guyver armor itself has some interesting abilities. The wearer can slice enemies to pieces or completely annihilate them on the spot with different weapons, which adds variety to the battles.The main character Sho is very believable because his personality seems genuine. Sho doesn\'t possess the typical shonen mindset consisting of the super bad teen that loves to fight and overcomes all near death odds simply by believing in himself. Sho is forced to battle with combat ready soldiers. However, he doesn\'t possess the slightest bit of training. He gains all of his experiance in the heat of the moment. Also, luck plays a factor at times. I think the storytelling is well presented in this area, and it gives the series a realistic feel.There are plenty of characters introduced with only a few that actually serve a purpose. The villains are a mixed bag for the most part. The generic Zoanoids are mainly cannon fodder and lose their appeal very early. The real threat comes in the form of other Guyver units, as well as an advanced group called the Hyper Zoanoid Team 5.The Guyver is an all out action series for the most part, but it takes other measures to try and be a little more than that. The plot is rarely boring, and the events that take place are mainly to display the Chronos Organizations links throughout the country: such as media manipulation and even mass mind wiping. These overwhelming advantages works in Chrono\'s favor heavily against Sho.The series does several things right but has its flaws, and animation and artwork happens to be among them. The animation tends to suffer by the sixth episode. The animation during the opening credits was actually used as a battle scene. I find this approach to be very lazy, and some of the character designs for the Zoanoids are downright atrocious. The artwork only gets worse later in the series. The English dub isn\'t bad, but translations could have used some serious work. Definitely watch this with subs.Not exactly one of my lows, but for those whom remember the original VHS releases will definitely be greatly disappointed, because songs are either changed or completely removed altogether. The original Guyver theme song can only be heard when watching the Japanese version with subs. The English version plays a very generic song that even people new to the series may immediately despise.The series also has a problem with its episode presentation. It isn\'t the least bit subtle when delivering the episode titles. Here\'s an example, episode five is titled ""Death Of The Guyver""; as if the writers couldn\'t come up with a bigger spoiler. This is what adds to the predictability and after episode three there is very little in the way of suspense, simply because the episode title already alerted the viewer on what to expect.I know of several anime fans whom consider this series a classic and even a must see, but this is nostalgia playing a huge role because many cite this series among the first they seen over 20 years ago. I really don\'t feel the same way at all. I will never shower a title with praise simply because it opened new doors for me. I just find that type of attitude to be strange.I mainly recommend this version only to serious anime fans whom must see everything anime related. If you don\'t fall into that category and you\'re more picky. Then your time is better spent with the remake. The 26 episode series remake which also goes by The Guyver surpasses this version in character development, character usage, story depth, plot, animation, artwork, and soundtrack. After watching this version again I have to say it\'s just not on the same level. This is also considering that the remake also has its flaws.Highs: Brutal and very vicious action scenes, believable main characterLows: Predictable, some crude artwork be in the action scenes and with some of its characters.

Great story and concept and even liked the 2nd live action movie staring David Hayter (Voice of Solid Snake)I think both the older and the newer ones have there pros and cons regarding certain elements.The older series felt very rushed and did skip alot of the original material which was a shame. However, the character development was just right even thou they missed out key events. The action and gore was great and even thou the newer series advertised itself as the 'new face of ultra violence'...i prefer this series.Really a shame they did not continue this and make more episodes and would have benefited restructuring and adding to the original 12 to reflect the manga.The newer series does provide more material to the point i had to read the novels. Unfortunately the fight scenes, character development, explanations and pretty much everything dragged on and could have been done in half the time. Example:- when a certain Dr is hit and is slowly dying and speaking to our hero's the enemy who is just standing around and  has time to recharge his weapon, which he states himself. Also character's self explanations into their abilities did ruin the fight scenes in a big way, I can accept that this is required sometimes and if viewers have not seen the original this needs to be done but honestly killed the action and fights for the entire series. i prefer this series.Really a shame they did not continue this and make more episodes and would have benefited restructuring and adding to the original 12 to reflect the manga.The newer series does provide more material to the point i had to read the novels.

These two settings intersect near the end of the first episode,...and we spend the rest of the episodes bouncing back and forth between the two, as they become increasingly intertwined. Both settings are trope-laden, but they’re developed well for a six-episode runtime. Also, since the plot is rather straightforward, and not convoluted as is the case with a lot of the OVAs coming out around this time, it’s easy to watch and follow along with.The four main characters are both simultaneously generic and reasonably developed. They’re generic in that their backgrounds and roles are typical, but the way they interact with each other and change over the course of the series is refreshing and relatable. The antagonists are also relatively well developed, as we are given insight into their feelings about the events taking place, as well as their relationships with each other. On the other hand, side characters do not receive much development, and are barely there. I assume some of these characters play larger roles in the sequel OVA, and are basically present just to give their names and say a few lines here and there.The series largely plays out like a serious action-thriller, but there are a handful of unintentionally humorous scenes. For instance, the main character’s power armor has two laser cannons in its chest, so he literally flashes the enemy as he fires at them. There’s a hilarious scene towards the end with two bug-like monsters sharing an emotional moment before one of them dies. Also, and this may be more annoying than funny, but the main character’s best friend is constantly shouting his name throughout the series, like it’s the only thing he can do.There are a few questionable narrative choices, such as exposition dumps, and some stuff just doesn’t make sense when you think about it. As an example, when the humans transform into monsters, their clothes rip off. What happens when they transform back; are they just naked? Also, their clothing bills must be insane because they keep destroying what they’re wearing all the time.The whole thing feels like an animated tokusatsu. The opening and ending themes sound like they’re straight out of a show like “Kamen Rider,” and the singer for both themes often performs songs for tokusatsu series as well. The Guyver armor and kaiju-like monster designs also look like something that would be at home in a series like that.As far as technical aspects go, the character designs are simple (for the human characters), but they’re nice and reflect the characters’ personalities well. The monsters/Guyver armor designs look good. The animation is limited at times; during some of the fights, stills are often used, and also dramatic scenes are played three times, which is something seen often in anime from around this time period. There are a lot of flashing lights in this series, so that’s something those sensitive to those kinds of things need to be aware of. The background music is forgettable. The opening and ending themes are decent and fit the tone of the series well, but they also are not that memorable. The voice acting is okay, but some of the voices don’t fit the characters well. Especially Agito’s voice, which sounds too old for a high schooler, and I felt that Mizuki’s voice is kind of whiny.There are some issues with the subtitles. For instance, they put a character’s name in the subtitles even though it isn’t said in Japanese, inadvertently spoiling the character’s identity and relation to another character. They also inexplicably translate one character’s name as “Molmot,” but he is actually just being called a “morumotto,” which means “guinea pig” — it’s not a name.As for objectionable content, there’s a lot of graphic violence, gore and death. There are a lot of arms getting cut off, monsters exploding, etc. The violence is not as exaggerated as in, say, “Baoh” or “Riki-oh,” but it comes pretty close.Overall, this is a solid series with a good character dynamic and a well-structured, although typical, plot.

Lupin III: $1 Money Wars,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1422/Lupin_III__1_Money_Wars,"[""Missed by a Dollar, from 2000, starts off another fun decade of Lupin in style.Lupin wants a ring that can lead him to yet another legendary treasure, and so does an evil corporation. Meanwhile, we have a subplot where Lupin tries to help the career of an aspiring jazz singer. And, without giving it away, there's a pretty cool twist later on.That's the basic outline, but like usual it's all the wackiness that ensues that makes this such a great show. Lupin and partner Jigen have some very snappy dialogue in this one. They talk about their guns as metaphors for women, a lot of...great exchanges like that.Fujiko is fantastic as always, she gets to kill a lot more people with machine guns in this than she often does. In general this one is pretty violent, which is a nice change of pace from some of the more lighthearted specials. Crazy people with guns are out to kill the Lupin gang, and this time around it really does feel urgent.Inspector Zenigata is great in this, as always he's awesomely hilarious when he gets emotional about Lupin. Goemon is solid as ever, though he doesn't have a particularly stand out role here.This is the last Lupin feature made with traditional cel animation before they switched to digital I believe, and it has a dark gritty look to it. Very cool soundtrack by Yuji Ohno, a bit more suspenseful sounding than usual here.All in all, this is some very good Lupin action.

If you like Lupin III, you should give this one a watch or two."", '[THIS WAS WRITTEN RIGHT AFTER WATCHING IT AND ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA ACC. KEEPING THIS HERE FOR AN ARCHIVE]I think this must be like. The fucking third or fourth movie in this franchise set in New York/America and like honestly??? I love the NYC parts a lot. Probably more than any of the other attempts at capturing the city this franchise has tried.Aside from that this movie was actually pretty fun on its own!!Story dragged after they left NYC, but the last quarter was definitely where things got fun again. The plot (ignoring the main one abt the Hitler brooch lupin wanted to steal bc...that was just flat out stupid) was really unique and fun as hell. Lupin fighting with a literal business tycoon bank ceo owner girlboss was not one I expected but a welcome surprise.The dub was fucking hilarious too with the zenigata nonsense.

Himouto! Umaru-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28825/Himouto_Umaru-chan,"['I don\'t recommend this anime.  Things included in this show are unlikable characters, terrible comedy, and essentially everything you\'ve already seen before.  I get it, the chibi form of the main character is cute and marketable, it\'s being used on banners and logos and whatnot, but it\'s all just a ruse.Now let me make this clear.  I love slice of life anime.  I loved Nichijou, Barakamon and the list goes on.  However this particular anime has a few breaking flaws.  First off, the main character is a bratty teenager who basically gets whatever she wants and if she doesn\'t,...she throws a tantrum.  Do you even understand how much I wanted to stick my hand into the screen and bitch slap the ever-living shit out of this cheeto lookin\' ass?  You know when you go out, there\'s always that one kid who just screams and throws a tantrum because they\'re spoiled to hell and their parents don\'t do shit so you\'re stuck with this terrible annoyance that you can\'t do anything about?  This anime is basically that.  Twelve whole episodes of that.  The characters are just not likable and the comedy doesn\'t vary.  It\'s the same shit throughout the whole series.  The main character puts on an angelic front when she\'s out in public and everyone loves her, then she comes home and turns into an orange potato and does whatever the hell she wants and whines when she doesn\'t get her way.That\'s the whole anime.  Not even kidding.  I mean sure, let\'s bring in another character in different episodes, but it\'s the same exact thing that happens every time.  This isn\'t even a ""this annoying character starts off as someone you hate but gradually becomes someone you love"" type deal.  She stays an annoying brat throughout the whole series.I can get behind anime with the pure intention of comedy like Gintama, Baka Test etc. but this does it so terribly that it\'s not even funny, literally. she throws a tantrum.

Watching Himouto! Umaru-chan (My Two-Faced Little Sister) makes me feel like a kid all over again. Each week, each episode is like an indoor and outdoor adventure of its own. Titular character Umaru Doma is the class superstar as well as the model that almost everyone looks up to. Her brother, Taihei Doma, is kind of like the sidekick providing her shelter, food, and a sense of comfort for her when she’s living at home. Really though, this series took me by surprise like an unexpected storm. And I’m talking about the type of otaku storm where you have to...see it to believe it.Based on the 4-koma of the same name, the series is adapted by studio Doga Kobo. In recent years, they are better known for their work with slice of life stories. Essentially, that’s how this show is like. The first episode easily establishes Umaru’s ulterior character. She literally lives a double life. At school, she acts mature, friendly, and in general someone that people idolizes. At home, she is almost the complete opposite with a lazy lifestyle, obsessive otaku personality, and acts like a NEET. This makes the show a bit odd at first seeing how each episode reflects on her double life style. What the series does well on this perspective is to demonstrate genuine comedy. The show makes fun of the otaku culture by saturating it with an immense amount of parody. Umaru’s character is someone that people would least expect to be an otaku from the outside. Yet, the show satires that with her lifestyle at home. In retrospect, the show delivers what I would call a cultural comedy.The series also consists of other characters ranging from Umaru’s shy childhood friend Ebina, self-proclaimed rival Sylphynford, and the bizarre and frightening girl, Kirie Motoba. Each of them has a different personality that makes them stand out on their own. Their interactions with Umaru usually brings out the honesty of their characters. Furthermore, each episode provides a better insight about Umaru as well. We learn more about Umaru from both sides of her lifestyle. And through that, the show can make us feel attached to the characters. Umaru’s relationship with her brother can also be quite entertaining to watch. Her brother is the average type of guy with an average job and working an average salary. Umaru often makes him run errands for her although she sometimes gets scolded. Their relationship is the typical brother and sister type with no absurdity involving incest or abuse. As lighthearted as it can be though, the chemistry between some characters can be a bit dull. While most times, the on-screen chemistry has an attachable feel, the concepts are usually recycled tropes. Umaru’s otaku lifestyle can also be a bit odd to get used to considering that it’s so different compared to the outer image she created at school. Selfish and lazy. Those are not good attributes for a young girl like her. But even so, the show satires her personality and connects them with her lifestyle without over exaggeration.Despite the series focuses on a more episodic basis, there are a few reoccurring elements throughout the story. Umaru’s double life is obviously one of them but also some of the competition she faces. This includes her love of video games and she later on creates a third personality specifically used to face her rival Sylphynford. Kirie’s relationship with Umaru also brings an interesting idea to the show. “Will someone at school eventually discover Umaru’s true identity and personality?” The show almost made this slip apart in the early stages and often or not, it keeps the audience at their seat of wondering that question. Finally, while there’s no actual dramatic romance in the show, we do get a bit of the puppy love with Ebina. Like I mentioned before, the main supporting characters consists of different personalities and roles to make this series colorful and diverse.In essence, the artwork is simplistic yet effective. Umaru’s outer image is crafted with an appealing appearance with her perfectly rounded face, smile, colorful hair, and even body structure as shown in pool class. However, the more entertaining aspect comes with her deformed character. When at home, her character design is that of a kid wearing a hamster shaped hoodie. Furthermore, her behavior and reactions are often like a spoiled brat. The visual style and reactive expressions makes us believe who she is as the two-faced little sister. On the contrary, her brother looks average all throughout the series. And while there’s no explicit fan service in the series, Ebina’s character is designed ways that can raise some eyebrows. All that aside, the artwork is well done in terms of overall coverage.The show’s soundtrack is not to be underestimated. Although it lacks any sort of distinctive OST, the way comedic scenes are done is often convincing thanks to the matching soundtrack. Similarly, conversations and dialogues performed by the characters makes you curious about what they will say next often. This is especially true for Umaru as she leads a double life. And from her performance, Umaru’s VA Ami Tanaka deserves a bit of praise for portraying a character with completely different personalities. Other noticeable voices includes Kirie with her intimidating tone or Sylphynford’s pride. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively done. In particular, the OP song fuses the double life imagery of Umaru.Although Himouto! Umaru-chan runs the risk of being a big joke, it ultimately has enough comedy and convincingly gets the audience to laugh. There’s enough jokes in the series that makes it look like satire and in general makes fun of the otaku culture thanks to Umaru. It also has enough time to not forget about the other characters. Furthermore, Umaru’s daily adventures will often get the audience curious to see what she is capable of doing next. As a series that stars a peculiar girl with two-faces, this is more than just a show about a brother and sister. see it to believe it.Based on the 4-koma of the same name, the series is adapted by studio Doga Kobo.

You\'d think ""Wow, this anime must be really funny!"". Well, it is; In the first three episodes at least.Basically, Umaru is a high school student who\'s admired by everyone because of her kind personality, looks, and brains. But once she\'s at home, she\'s a lazy weeb who bosses her brother around 25/8 to do shit for her. The art is decent, I guess, but the main point is suppose to be Umaru\'s personality, or at least I think it is.There\'s some side characters, but they don\'t do much. The anime...has 0 plot. The entire series is just the same repetitive scenes and jokes. Umaru doesn\'t improve as a person, even though there were multiple occurrences where the plot could\'ve developed, but nothing. Although the episode where she gets to be with her mother for Christmas was really touching, it was the only time that there was some kind of emotional factor in the series.Honestly, I watched this anime in hope that I could just relax and laugh, but after episode 5 it got pretty boring, and it was just generic scenes of Umaru being spoiled and playing video games. People hype this anime way too much. It had so much potential, but nothing happens. has 0 plot. The entire series is just the same repetitive scenes and jokes.

People hype this anime way too much. It had so much potential, but nothing happens.', 'Here\'s my thoughts on the show summarized in one sentence:Himouto brings a fun style of comedy to the viewer for the first few episodes, and then recycles those same jokes over and over until you\'re sick of them.As for the more technical side of things:Story- Umaru is a practically perfect girl while with her friends, but a little lazy weeaboo shit when at home with her brother. You\'d think I was oversimplifying it, but I\'m really not. The plot is rather stagnant and doesn\'t change much throughout the show (this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing)...Art-So average that it\'s bad. Let me expound on that sentence: Most shows with an ""average"" artstyle usually have 1 especially notable thing about the art. With Himouto, you could say that this would be her childlike form, but that\'s  really just taken from other shows too.Sound- Decent soundtrack and OP. Nice to listen to.Characters- They all seem interesting at first, but then lose said interest when you realize how linear they are. They do their role okay though, so can\'t say it\'s the worst I\'ve seen.Enjoyment- Show is very entertaining for the first couple episodes, then becomes stagnant. Not sure what to tell you on this one.OVERALL- Himouto does a decent job as a comedy, and if you don\'t mind jokes seeming a bit similar to ones previously used, give it a shot. Can\'t give this show too high of a rating because simply getting rid of your boredom for an hour or two just won\'t suffice. Art-So average that it\'s bad.

First discovered by SankakuHead in 2013, but his findings are in a language known only to few, but thanks to the hard work of cryptologists at Dogakobo they have provided us with SankakuHead's findings in a format we can make sense of and I am writing this report after going through their findings.Though without a botanical name as yet, but persons around it refer to the creature as 'Umaru', so we shall refer to it as such within the course of this...report.At first glance the Umaru seems to be a casual and playful creature, it is largely lethargic in nature and enjoys to indulge itself in as much frivolities as it can. Its preferred natural habitat is a suburban apartment with dimmed lightning at low temperatures, it spends most of its time consuming human entertainment such as Television, Video games and the Internet, its main diet though mostly consists of barbecued foods and chilled drinks, however we have witnessed it consuming fruits and vegetables but it shows a strong adverseness to it and only consumes it when forced or as a last resort when starvation kicks in. The Umaru is capable of becoming dangerous however when not allowed its usual diet, environment or entertainment, throwing tantrums and wailing at most occasions.The most interesting thing about the Umaru though is its ability to camouflage so perfectly whenever it leaves its habitat and ventures into human society, we have no idea how its capable of doing this but when it does it takes on the form of the perfect human being; smart, beautiful and quite flawless in every aspect of its activities. This has led it to be awed and adored by most in society but heads will surely be turned if and whenever its nature in its own habitat is exposed to them.Despite its somewhat selfish and secluded lifestyle it still has a couple of close human companions which it interacts with. It has a blood brother which it lives with by the name of Taihei, but as far as we can tell from investigation he seems to be human, but being a blood relative of the Umaru that section of the investigation is marked as inconclusive at this point. Taihei does most of the housework due to the Umaru's lethargic nature, he is well aware of all its  characteristics but expresses no serious alarm about it, he does constantly try to lecture and reform the Umaru to the right way but at this point to no success. They express a fondness and affection for each other as siblings, but her usual anecdotes are a constant nuisance to him and we on the investigation team found their interactions amusing and a times heart warming to see.Dogakobo's interpretation of the Umaru and its surroundings is very lovely to look at indeed, though simplistic and not in too much detail it still carries a nice mix of color tones that is very lovely to look at. There are no overly excessive motions but constant motion even in small bouts is present to always make sure things never seem dull.In conclusion there is still much we don't know about this creature and its environment, but from the little that we have seen here it is apparent that it is a charming, playful and a times boisterous, and its many antics and characteristics have often left us laughing or at least left us with a smile on our face and we're sure will be pleasing to many. report.At first glance the Umaru seems to be a casual and playful creature, it is largely lethargic in nature and enjoys to indulge itself in as much frivolities as it can.

Instead, I should focus on the humor, it\'s a comedy after all.And the humor the show has... is so, so terrible. It always happens at the expense of the wrong characters, and the most unlikeable characters end up coming out on top - I can\'t find the humor in that.I will admit that there were a few moments that felt kinda genuine, but whenever the show tried to have emotional moments otherwise, it got immediately ruined afterwards for the sake of some bad and predictable joke. [1/10]This is, naturally, directly tied to the cast of the show, which has to be one of the most unlikeable casts I have ever seen in a comedy.Umaru is manipulative and lazy, almost sociopathic in the way she treats her older brother and there is no motivation for her to change her manners completely when she goes outside. She doesn\'t work as a character, because her ""outside"" and true personality don\'t fit together at all. There is no way someone could live like that - only hanging around at home, eating snacks and playing games, but still being perfectly healthy, slim, fantastic at sports and great at school without learning or training or doing anything at all. Also she has some kind of chibi form whenever she\'s in lazy mode and despite only having other clothing, no one aside from her brother ever recognizes her.Her Brother Taihei, while being pushed around constantly, tries to change his sister for the better, but always ends up cleaning after her, buying stuff for her and feeling bad because he gets fed up with her more than one time. He goes to work yet still manages the household all on his own, and he\'s so much into his adorable little sister it gets annoying really fast.Ebina, Umaru\'s friend, has even less personality than that, she likes to hang out with Umaru, is shy, dumb, in love with Taihei and has big boobs.Kirie, another friend, is also shy, but really violent with her older brother.But it\'s absolutely okay, because her brother, who is a friend of Taihei\'s, is perverted and stupid. Nothing is wrong with girls constantly hitting guys for whatever reason, right? Isn\'t it just fun?Then there\'s Sylphyn, who\'s competitive with Umaru, a foreigner who speaks very politely and always a bit hyper.And I\'m supposed to find all of this funny somehow? I can\'t.A character-based comedy is supposed to get the fun out of character interactions, reactions and the situations they find themselves in, but when the whole cast is either bland or horribly unlikeable, the humor doesn\'t work.[1/10]As for art and animation, they are okay, but not great.The anime shines with really nice colors and some good, but mostly bland character designs. [5/10]The sound is also mixed. The show has a rather catchy opening, forgettable ending and boring, bland insert music.The only thing remarkable here is Umaru\'s Seiyuu. In my opinion, she does a great job in trying to give anything likeable to her role and I hope she gets parts in much better Anime in the future. [5/10]As for my overall enjoyment... the show had some nice, relaxing parts in it, which is why I kept watching until the end, but after episode 12, I wondered why I bothered at all. [4/10]Total score (NOT calculated mathematically): 1/10So there you have it. What could have been a nice comedy focused on otaku culture turned into some really unlikeable characters I don\'t care about having fun. And also created one of my most hated anime characters of all time.Hopefully at least Umaru\'s Seiyuu will benefit from having been a part of this. which would be rather necessary to get something out of the main character.""But it\'s just a comedy"", you might say, ""It only has to be fun, what do you expect.""Of course giving a show that bad a score only based on the fact that it has little to no story wouldn\'t be fair.

What started off a harmless comedy with some fun little jokes stays as such throughout the entire show with no...character growth while repeating the same gag over and over again. When this anime was airing last year there was no escaping the orange tic-tac since she was used for every single reaction image and post on every website forum. She was everywhere and unfortunately is still around now. Every Comic-Con I go to, not only am I surrounded by about twenty overweight Narutos, seventy-two Rems and six-hundred Deadpools but also about a million Umarus. As far as the eye can see, all I witness is a shitty waifu. Even in my porn this annoying sister is beginning to show up...and that creeps me out.The plot of this anime is pretty paper thin and the crust of each scenario and joke is centred around the little sister character being an absolute cunt to her big brother. Teaching kids everywhere that it's fine to throw a tantrum and cry if you don't get your own way just to get your pussy of an older brother to go buy you some potato chips and some cola. Rinse and repeat every episode. Umaru, as a character, is both selfish and annoying in her lifestyle. She has two sides to her life; one in which she is a model student at her school and one in which she shrinks down and becomes the useless slob that she is at heart. While this can provide some comedy for the show most of the comedy is derivative of Umaru crying to get her own way or simply watching her play games and eating food.Umaru's main problem is that she doesn't grow as a character in the slightest. She stays exactly the same throughout the show and the fact that the show hints at her realising that she is a little too selfish is a kick in the balls to the audience as they never do anything with it and she devolves back into the cunt that she is. Many little sisters of this nature have the same problems in anime. Take for example Kirino from the anime 'my little sister can't possibly be this much of a cunt'. She too is a selfish prick and never changes in her narrative but to be fair, Umaru is not as much of a bitch as she is...she is just annoying. Umaru, in a way, glorifies the lazy and self-entitled lifestyle that some kids are living today. You can call me cynical, and perhaps I am for thinking about this show in this nature but the entire show comes across that being a worthless member of society is okay as long as you can get someone to buy you stuff while you remain a selfish asshole.The older brother is a character whom I want to reach through the computer screen and slap. As someone who has three little sisters myself, one of which is about the same age as Umaru herself I feel embarrassed by how much of a pussy he is. He never actually stands up for himself or tries to make Umaru see the error of her ways. He is just there and that's it. In terms of the supporting cast, they're a bit more lively and interesting and have more in the way of comedy. I liked Ebina the most...especially her boobs. Yes, it's shallow but if the show is this shallow, I might as well be too. The comedy is kind of hit or miss for me. While there were some moments that I felt were generally well executed there were plenty in which I couldn't care for and most of the time the writers constantly repeat jokes throughout the show. The narrative is pretty bare-bones and I'm not expecting anything remarkable out of a slice-of-life show's story but when the cast is this boring and the comedy is this stale I lose interest fast. The music was okay at best but the wooden train flute got annoying really quickly. The animation and art design was decent and get the job done but is nothing remarkable as a whole.Overall Umaru is a show with weak comedy and one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. Umaru was just too much of a dick for me to properly enjoy myself with this show and every time she was on screen I wanted to punch her through the monitor. One may argue that I am taking the show too seriously and that I should enjoy it for what it is. That's fine, but the show's comedy is so awful that I find that impossible. If you want to learn how to be the ultimate useless member of society, then watch this show. Awaken the Umaru in you... character growth while repeating the same gag over and over again.

Umaru-chan comes from the protagonist being strikingly similar to its target audience; a lazy, entitled otaku teenager who always gets what they want. You're meant to identify with this cola-obsessed girl to the point of empathizing with her every move, and that obviously worked. Within days of the first episode airing, the show became a meme. It was (and at the time of writing, still is) hard to enter an anime discussion without catching a stray gif or picture showing Umaru in her chibi form, because people loved that they saw themselves or their behaviour in this...cute little character. A month later, the show's viewer base had unexpectedly doubled.This isn't the first time this model has succeeded. In 2013, both Oregairu and WataMote garnished immense popularity by using a character the audience could relate to, through teen angst and depression respectively. And as much as I'd like to lump Himouto! Umaru-chan in with those two, it feels different. It's not some one-off attempt at being relatable, but a series that wants to tell a story through the eyes of its audience. And I completely hated it until I came to that strange realization.While beautiful and endearingly polite on the  outside, the titular Umaru turns to a horrible blob of laziness as soon as she arrives home. She lives with her older brother, Taihei, who thankfully brings no themes of incest to the table. As Taihei's a strict and punctual businessman, the two don't exactly get along. All that happens between the two from there on does nothing but highlight Umaru's much-needed flaws (bad behaviour ahoy), but also makes you feel pretty sorry for her older brother. His patiently putting up with her and loving her regardless is what ends up turning the theme on its head—it's a critique of the consumer as much as it is a critique of Umaru, even though the characters are too one-note to allow it to work. With all of this trickery going on, the entire premise is much more suited to a drama than the mangaka may realize. Since a better option is available, it becomes pretty disappointing to see the conventional slice of life comedy route being taken every step of the way.Aside from the aforementioned two, the entire cast is fairly unremarkable. You've got your shy oppai twintail girl, the energetic rival, and the mysterious tsundere who has a crush on Umaru. Taihei also has two coworkers, who unknowingly happen to be related to two of Umaru's friends (sigh). Moreover, we don't get to know very much about these characters beyond their basic stereotypes. Everyone's certainly able to provide a few laughs along the way, though it always seems like a distraction from the real matter of familial tension. The team behind the anime seems to have a quota to fill for uninteresting or typical scenes, so you never get more than a five-minute glimpse at the better material. It's a sadistic game, and the way it's dragged out is extremely frustrating. In the last episode, about four of five prior misunderstandings or lies are perpetuated. Not only does this keep the plot from progressing, but the frustration is furthered when the final scene alludes to the lack of development in Umaru. As I've said before, joking about such a serious problem instead of combatting it is a dire mistake.Complaints about the literary portion aside, it's probably the best-looking show of the Summer 2015 season. Dogakobo is clearly proud to prove that you don't need detailed cuts or any exotic art direction to make something look great, only nice colours and consistently smooth animation. If one thing were to set the mismatched anime aside from its competition, this would be it. Have you not already seen it, I'd advise you to look up the OP for the show. Aside from the catchy nature of the song itself, it's a fantastic showcase of what I'm talking about.So even though I wouldn't recommend the anime, you can't exactly go wrong with it. It's inconsistent in a lot of places and somewhat hard to actually wrap your head around, but you'll be sure to get a few giggles and a grand treat for the eye. Lest I forget, Sylphynford is a total cutie. If you end up having a little more fun with it than I did, you have my envy. cute little character.

Umaru-chan after searching what anime I should watch after finishing spring season. Honestly, I consider this as my main priority to watch for Summer 2015, but after watching Gakkou Gurashi! (Considered as my highest priority for SM 2015) I still make Himouto! Umaru chan as my second highest priority to watch in 2015, so no hard feelings for Himouto lovers. :DAnd I’m really glad I watch Himouto Umaru-chan, one of the best combination of comedy and slice of life anime in my life, I don’t know for others but it...may depends on their perspectives but for me I totally enjoy it. Down below is my full review about this series. Other than that, I’ve learn so much from this anime that I completely forgotten to do my homeworks. And yet, most of the scenes in this series I can almost relate to my everyday life where my sister is struggling to control me when it comes to anime related staffs. Anyway, back to the review.I really like how they scripted the story from the manga, well except some of the scenes may be cut-out but overall it was well adapted and I like how they make the story simple and not too complex, (my perspective). Other than that, the pacing of the story is not too rushed or too slow, just right, (I haven’t read the manga so excuse if I’m wrong). Most of the story focuses on Umaru who has a two-faced side being one a perfect sister with strong intelligence on the outside and seconds after stepping into the house, turning into annoying yet cute otaku Umaru-chan and Taihei whom he has to deal all kinds of problems that his sister cause or make a big tantrum and this is where comedy played a big role in this series. Not much of bikini scenes except for the ED song video and the final episode if you don’t drop the series. Nonetheless, this is a good 2015 summer anime for those who loves comedy and slice of life show. Not much of romance content, but still have those ship moments. Don’t forget, this show has a lot of references from other anime.The work is done by Doga Kobo, a studio which make good anime for example Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Yuru Yuri and recent anime Plastic Memories. Their animations are really decent, not bad for 2015 animations. The background is not too saturated as it follows the mood of the character and character designs are not too bland, in fact Umaru is quite cheerful when she is in cola mode. I love how the original character, Sankakuhead design all the characters of the series, it’s pretty cute especially Ebina. Overall, not much of weird animations made by Doga Kobo.Most of the seiyuu which I haven’t heard before are pretty new to the anime industries, yet they did an amazing job voice acting on all the characters in this series, especially the seiyuus of Umaru, Ebina, Kirie and Sylphynford. Not bad for first starters. The OP song is very catchy and perfectly match the personality of Umaru since she loves to play video games so much and the ED song well quite enjoyable to listen. OST or background music are lovely too. And the sound effects when Umaru transforms is almost related to Yuru Yuri’s “Akari disappearance effect” because the director is from Yuru Yuri!I love all the characters of this series, they all have unique appearances and personality. I love how Umaru being an otaku at home and loves to talk all about games and anime to his brother because that’s what I did in real life, but I do prefer her on the outside personality though and well the good thing about her is she cares for her onii-chan since he work really hard to financially support her. Sylphynford is Umaru’s not really kinda rival and she loves to challenge umaru just because she is below her but nonetheless they do spent together as TSF and UMR. Kirie, is more like Tomoko from Watamote except that she is cute and shy, well Tomoko is cute too so yeah. She’s having a hard time to talk with other people because of her shy personality but hopefully she would make more friends in the future, well at least Umaru help her. Ebina, ahh my favorite character of the series even though she is just a supporting character. What is so special about Ebina? Boobs? Nope, her air-headness and her kawainess throughout the series, I just wanna pet her head so much. Since she came from Akita, she is trying to improve her standard Japanese language so she can speak without making any Akita dialect, well except if she is in a good mood after tasting Tokyo’s food. Other than that i completely enjoy seeing her in each episodes, makes me happy.With most of the episodes has completely finished airing, I feel sad that the show had ended but at the same time, I’m happy that they adapted this from the manga, I would say this is the best 2015 anime summer from my perspective and I enjoyed much watching on this, it helps me to cool down my stress after heavy load of school hours and help to cheer me up when I’m feeling moody. The good thing is that, this has no incest relationship because if it does, well that’s up to your imagination. Overall, this has easily made to be one of the recommendations for anyone who wanted to watch slice of life and comedy for 2015.So to sum it all up, it has been an amazing ride with the Umaru and her friends and of course onii-chan throughout the whole series. Also thank you Oota Masahiko for directing Himouto Umaru Chan, he did well on directing this and making it a fun series to watch, he is the director who directs Yuru Yuri S1 and S2, hopefully there would be a season 2 for this, because it was freaking funny and cute to watch. Eventhough it is long and may be completely nonsense but I hope this review is helpful as I went a lot of process of thinking and rewriting the review again for the past few days. Thanks! And have a nice Umaru day!~ may depends on their perspectives but for me I totally enjoy it. Down below is my full review about this series.

And have a nice Umaru day!~', ""Do you want to watch something that will smile on your face regardless of what mood you are in? Specifically, an anime that has one particular character that has the charisma and charm to make an entire series into a glorious package of fun and cuteness all by herself? Oh boy, do I have an anime for you if you do.Himouto Umaru-chan is one experience that still perplexes me as I am writing this. Not just because of how much I loved it, but also how something like this could exist. It is essentially a gag comedy anime with the most generic formula you could...ever witness if you read this idea on paper. She is an otaku girl who tries to keep her otaku secret from the people around her, even her close friends. Only her brother is aware of this and takes care of her despite her wacky and almost nerve-racking antics driving him to insanity. When you read these two sentences, more often than not, you would most likely shrug off and browse off to the next anime on the anime list. But hear me out for a spare moment of your time.I’ll start with the most substantial positive to Himouto Umaru-chan: Umaru-chan. There is no denying her cuteness exists. There is not. But since I know cuteness is not a character structure that is very clear to many people, I will explain her merits with less vague terms than just being cute. What character merits she has, one, in particular, she manages to show off with high tenacity and spark is charisma. Thanks to how she transitions from your stereotypical perfect girl to a wild chibi character who loves to play games, drink copious amounts of cola, and read the latest manga issue. After all, who could not relate to a character that exhibits these quirks?Two aspects make it enjoyable: how seamlessly the art style shifts from average to chibi character design and how the voice actress shifts her voice pitch from this transition. It gives Umaru-chan a great sense of character, not really from a development standard, but an engaging one. Her presence demands your attention to her in many ways that could become annoying when poorly done. But to the writer’s credit, they know how to pace off the comedic chibi bits and add in new and exciting subtle ways to make the jokes involving her seem fresh and new with each episode. Even when she is outright selfish and acts like a crybaby, she still comes off as incredibly lovable thanks to the considerable charm that he inhibited from her over-the-top design and personality.Another aspect of her that I enjoy immensely is her relationship with her brother, Taihei. You could say it is a relationship, albeit a bit exaggerated, that is hilarious and somewhat realistic if you’ve ever had an annoying little sister or brother who annoyed you. Despite her constant barraging of wants and needs to her big brother, they still form a close relationship of sibling love that is honestly touching in a few episodes. Taihei does good things for her out of his heart's kindness and vice versa with Umaru-chan. Her over-the-top personality doesn't overshadow him. He carries himself as another funny character in what can be described as the best sibling duo in anime in recent memory.Himouto Umaru-chan’s brand of comedy is one other big positive that sets itself higher than most comedies that center around otaku life. For one, it does not overly state that the otaku lifestyle is inherently tremendous or destructive at the same time. It mostly keeps the message subtle so that it does not distract us from the comedy bits too much. It has no well-defined message written into the narrative or characters since it knows what type of show it is and runs with it as a silly comedy. This is where the subject matter of being an otaku is seen better than most that try to because it can be enjoyed by everyone who has a particular view on this specific issue that can be against or for it.As for the comedy jokes themselves, most of them hit the mark quite well. Much of it centers around satire of real-life issues that we all go through, whether we go through the internet, social situations, or our need for material goods more than anything else. What’s great about it is that you do not have to be a self-described otaku, or know the culture for the matter, to get the jokes. Such as not getting any internet connection for today, realizing how life seems meaningless without it, etc. The banter between Umaru-chan and her brother is always the biggest highlight of the show’s comedy, as I’ve mentioned before about the great relationship. And there are even some funny moments with the supporting cast; unfortunately, they are not on the same comedic level as our two siblings.The supporting cast, which little there is, garners a significant role in a specific arc and has their moments here and there. Umaru-chan’s best friend, Ebina, is undoubtedly one note in how she is continuously shy whenever she is near people. Not to say that they are not funny by any stretch. It does not raise the bar for one of the best shy girls in anime. Sylphinford is pretty hilarious as Umaru-chan’s gaming rival. Kirie Motoba, however, is my least favorite of the cast. It mostly comes down to the fact that whenever she is with any other character, like Umaru-chan, her personality gets overshadowed by how bland it is.I want to give an honorable mention to the OP/ED, which I rarely ever do in reviews, only if it is something special. Umaru-chan’s is quite the special one continually sets the stage for what you are in for. Just the first ten seconds of the OP always makes me bob my body up and down to the rhythm of the cute repetition of Umaru-chan shouting “Umr hai” repeatedly makes me giddy with excitement every time. Aimi Tanaka’s performance proves she can be exciting with her voice-over and her singing, even if it isn’t the best voice in the business.Finding an excellent otaku comedy is hard to come by. Some are good or decent enough to think of it as a good time waster, and some are wholly average or below that do not have any punch to their jokes. Himouto Umaru-chan has officially raised my optimism for more comedies like this one to come out more often. It succeeded in proving to me that this type of comedy is far from dead. I know some may groan at that notion, but if more studios take notes from Himouto Umaru-chan, I’m all for it.Grade: A- ever witness if you read this idea on paper. She is an otaku girl who tries to keep her otaku secret from the people around her, even her close friends. Only her brother is aware of this and takes care of her despite her wacky and almost nerve-racking antics driving him to insanity. When you read these two sentences, more often than not, you would most likely shrug off and browse off to the next anime on the anime list.

But since I know cuteness is not a character structure that is very clear to many people, I will explain her merits with less vague terms than just being cute. What character merits she has, one, in particular, she manages to show off with high tenacity and spark is charisma. Thanks to how she transitions from your stereotypical perfect girl to a wild chibi character who loves to play games, drink copious amounts of cola, and read the latest manga issue. After all, who could not relate to a character that exhibits these quirks?Two aspects make it enjoyable: how seamlessly the art style shifts from average to chibi character design and how the voice actress shifts her voice pitch from this transition. It gives Umaru-chan a great sense of character, not really from a development standard, but an engaging one. Her presence demands your attention to her in many ways that could become annoying when poorly done. But to the writer’s credit, they know how to pace off the comedic chibi bits and add in new and exciting subtle ways to make the jokes involving her seem fresh and new with each episode. Even when she is outright selfish and acts like a crybaby, she still comes off as incredibly lovable thanks to the considerable charm that he inhibited from her over-the-top design and personality.Another aspect of her that I enjoy immensely is her relationship with her brother, Taihei. You could say it is a relationship, albeit a bit exaggerated, that is hilarious and somewhat realistic if you’ve ever had an annoying little sister or brother who annoyed you. Despite her constant barraging of wants and needs to her big brother, they still form a close relationship of sibling love that is honestly touching in a few episodes. Taihei does good things for her out of his heart's kindness and vice versa with Umaru-chan. Her over-the-top personality doesn't overshadow him. He carries himself as another funny character in what can be described as the best sibling duo in anime in recent memory.Himouto Umaru-chan’s brand of comedy is one other big positive that sets itself higher than most comedies that center around otaku life. For one, it does not overly state that the otaku lifestyle is inherently tremendous or destructive at the same time. It mostly keeps the message subtle so that it does not distract us from the comedy bits too much. It has no well-defined message written into the narrative or characters since it knows what type of show it is and runs with it as a silly comedy. This is where the subject matter of being an otaku is seen better than most that try to because it can be enjoyed by everyone who has a particular view on this specific issue that can be against or for it.As for the comedy jokes themselves, most of them hit the mark quite well. Much of it centers around satire of real-life issues that we all go through, whether we go through the internet, social situations, or our need for material goods more than anything else. What’s great about it is that you do not have to be a self-described otaku, or know the culture for the matter, to get the jokes. Such as not getting any internet connection for today, realizing how life seems meaningless without it, etc. The banter between Umaru-chan and her brother is always the biggest highlight of the show’s comedy, as I’ve mentioned before about the great relationship. And there are even some funny moments with the supporting cast; unfortunately, they are not on the same comedic level as our two siblings.The supporting cast, which little there is, garners a significant role in a specific arc and has their moments here and there. Umaru-chan’s best friend, Ebina, is undoubtedly one note in how she is continuously shy whenever she is near people. Not to say that they are not funny by any stretch. It does not raise the bar for one of the best shy girls in anime. Sylphinford is pretty hilarious as Umaru-chan’s gaming rival. Kirie Motoba, however, is my least favorite of the cast. It mostly comes down to the fact that whenever she is with any other character, like Umaru-chan, her personality gets overshadowed by how bland it is.I want to give an honorable mention to the OP/ED, which I rarely ever do in reviews, only if it is something special. Umaru-chan’s is quite the special one continually sets the stage for what you are in for. Just the first ten seconds of the OP always makes me bob my body up and down to the rhythm of the cute repetition of Umaru-chan shouting “Umr hai” repeatedly makes me giddy with excitement every time. Aimi Tanaka’s performance proves she can be exciting with her voice-over and her singing, even if it isn’t the best voice in the business.Finding an excellent otaku comedy is hard to come by. Some are good or decent enough to think of it as a good time waster, and some are wholly average or below that do not have any punch to their jokes. Himouto Umaru-chan has officially raised my optimism for more comedies like this one to come out more often. It succeeded in proving to me that this type of comedy is far from dead. I know some may groan at that notion, but if more studios take notes from Himouto Umaru-chan, I’m all for it.Grade: A-"", ""By day she is known as the famous perfect girl with princess like qualities: Umaru-sama, but by night she transforms into the fridge raiding, cola drinking, snack munching, and brother mongering girl known as: Umaru-chan. She is the epitome of cute and fun characters; she gives off the kind of aura that makes you want to forgive her for even her biggest grievances. She is adorable, she is malicious, she is conniving, and all the while still manages to be sweet. She is the kind of character who will make you froth at the mouth with anger, and then seconds later offer you her favorite...thing begging for forgiveness. She is heartwarming and reminded me instantly of my time watching Oreimo (How can my little sister be this cute), minus the incest obviously. We are introduced to a girl who when outside is: kind, loving, mature, serious, and someone that others look up to. However as soon as she gets home and puts on her orange hamster cloak she transforms into the annoying yet lovable pest that she truly is, a quality she is only willing to show around her brother. This show is hilarious and a blast, as it should be expected seeing as how it is a comedy.----Spoiler Free----Characters: 9Character Development: 7This show has a wonderful main character, however she is unfortunately the only character who seems to shine out of all the cast, this show reminds me a lot of Nyarko-san, in that the whole entire show is supported by a single really well fleshed out and lovable character. While the cast as a whole may have great chemistry, and complement each other perfectly (ie. Umaru and her brother) leading to tons of funny and enjoyable moments. It still must be noted that none of the other characters really get developed any further, and at the end of the show they are the exact same person as they were at the start. The same can be said for even the main character Umaru-chan, while she does face her mistakes head on, and seemingly learns from them. The episode will end and i the next episode she'll do something which basically mirrors what she was scolded for. This lack of growth is a given though, seeing as how all of the comedic elements stem from the duality in her character, and how she only reveals certain characteristics to certain people. That topped with the perversion of her originally perfect image lead to a rather jarring, and because of that funny story.Plot: 7Pacing: 8When you start up a slice of life/ comedy show, you don’t go into it expecting much in terms of plot development, the reasoning behind that is similar to why there isn’t any character development. The comedy aspect of these types of shows often relies on the state that the characters are currently in, in order to create a parody of reality, one that we as humans find to be funny. Going into more detail about that, this show has little to no real advancement in plot and stays in its comfort zone throughout the entire story. The show is divided up into a bunch of little skits, most of which take place in the comforts of their home, wherein Umaru, the main character, is made to reveal what we as an audience are seeking to see, a funny and abnormal character whom we seem to become fond of and attached to.Art: 8Music: 8Once again there isn’t much that can be said about the art. It didn’t serve us up any new kind of controversial art style, nor did it really push its own boundaries. It, like this show, stayed in its comfort zone utilizing a more warm and bubbly feeling animation style. The art was all in all well directed and fitted the tone and mood of the show. As for the music, like the art style, it fit the show well with some nice and quirky music to accompany Umaru’s escapades, and an above average intro song. The background music while not standing out did a nice job creating and maintain the atmosphere of the show.Enjoyment: 9In the end I find that the most important part of a show is whether it is enjoyable or not, and let me tell you, oh is this show enjoyable. I found myself smiling throughout a majority of the show and sympathizing with the characters who I had grown to adore.

Back in my previous reviews, I did have an a-ok tone over Hyundai (or was I just trying to be nice), but as time went by, I was beginning to think the cringe it would be to own one. I would like to really sit and talk to someone who owns such and repeatedly ask them if they know what a car is, and if they know any other automakers from Japan, Germany, America, even Italy.Is it because Hyundai looks “fluidic” and “beautiful to look at”? I wanna know because this kind of...imprudent query is the very kind of impulse I feel over asking an anime-fan or otaku on why they like Himouto! Umaru-chan.Because why does Himouto! got a SEVEN+ score here in MAL? Is it because of her ‘kawaiiness’?Don’t get me wrong, I’m somehow okay with it, the same okay-ish I feel on Hyundai, which is a car brand I honestly never bother. The thing is, ‘why bother’? Just why are we bothering with Hyundai if there are Subarus, BMWs, Alfas and Fords around, and the price-ranged Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas; is the same way as why bother with Himouto! if there are KinMoza, Non Non Biyori, Yuru Yuri, and a lot more KyoAni’s to add to the moeblob list?Maybe perhaps it’s because of the very eponymous character, Umaru-chan herself. Otakus dig this.STORY = 4It’s a slice-of-life, CGDCT thing this. However, the antics and comedies that Umaru herself does, with the characters such as her brother and friends Nana and Kirie are a bit of a daft, like an automatic transmission (presumably from Hyundai) that does make the engine roar, but couldn’t give the power needed, or due to the fact that it lags most of the time the gear is shifted. As projected of CGDCT, plot and storyline are easy and relaxing. Himouto did seem to deliver these along with Hayate-ish parodies, but the charm of the story really doesn’t pick up, unlike KinMoza for example.Let me put it this way for comparison: KinMoza and Himouto does have one particular thing shared: they both are otaku-societal tropes about what anime fans are and can be. The former focuses on ‘genkis’ and ‘engrish’ and ‘japanophiles’ and ‘british-philes’; while the latter focuses on ‘otaku-ness’ and ‘gamers’. Putting a seeming ‘genki kawaii shoujo’ in the guise of Umaru giving the otaku-slash-gamer-slash-lazy-kawaii persona should have worked, as WataMote’s Mokocchi surely did. But somehow, it didn’t.Though to give it a benefit-of-doubt, Himouto might work on the surface, when you’re too consumed about Umaru’s ‘kawaiiness’ that you can’t think more for yourself, or you’re simply not discerning about plot and characterization, you ended up rating this beyond 7 really.CHARACTER = 1So Himouto should have worked its charm but didn’t. What I can devise though, is the characterization of Umaru-chan herself. Let me quote from the show itself:“My younger sister, Umaru, is pretty and popular. She's kind, smart, and gifted with many talents. She's the perfect high school student, without any flaws.”See what I mean? Umaru is a goddamned MARY-SUE. This is the very type of character that I’d like to put an Excalibur-face on, every literature-oriented person loathes and grimaces, the epitome of a traditional mary-sue where every author (who does learn literature and proper creative writing, and not just a housewife) is taught to avoid making. Mary-sues, especially the traditionally pretty, popular, gifted, perfect, no flaws, this is not just a Mary-sue, it’s Bella Swan in kawaii and kirei desu, just without the uber-romance. (KEYWORD: traditional Mary-sue)Of course, it’s in everyone’s entitled opinion. But if you have decency of not wasting your own time watching a one-dimensional, flat, unmoving, static character in the eponymous role who assumes a ‘perfect’ image, does throw fits and tantrums while maintaining ‘perfection’, then let me tell you that Japan releases about twenty anime titles per quarter of the year. Go to www.livechart.me and count ‘em all: that’s about eighty and I mean 80/EIGHTY anime titles on average per year. Why can’t you go with the other titles instead?SOUND = 5Sound is moe-good. I know I’ve noted the seiyuus but right now, I really don’t want to bother. Oh, in Umaru’s UMR-mode, her seiyuu really does sound like Kanae Itou. Maybe I’d give this a 6. While in her little-shit mode, she does have a little bit of Aki Toyosaki sounding, so that’s a 7.ENJOYMENT = 3I “might” have enjoyed it like enjoying driving a Hyundai, you know, when it is the only car you’ve got and you don’t want a bicycle, or if zombies are on your tail. The thing is though, Himouto isn’t the only anime on my list: there was Kekkai-Sensen that needed to be finished, Sore ga Seiyuu that was faithfully made for a seiyuu-fan like me, Fate Illya season 3 which I know will still be lolitastic, Etotama, Shirobako, Charlotte (which is effing horrible but that’s on a different review), IdolMaster Cinderella, and most especially Non Non Biyori Repeat. Bothering with Himouto is like bothering to spend time checking a Hyundai when you’ve got enough cash to get a Toyota or even a Subaru.Hence, the score of 3 you’re seeing here is mostly directed to Kirie, who rather resembles Mokocchi.OVERALL = 5I personally don’t like Himouto. Parodies can't save this one for me because there's Hayate, Danna ga Nani, Lucky Star, even Gintama. If you’re asking why still I watched it from episode 1 to end is only because of MAL-listing, so that I can put this title on my anime list and move on. Another reason is because I do hate it when some otakus ask me in cases when I haven’t fully watched it, then why am I criticizing the show. Thus, I’ve watched it, not because I like it, but only to fill the 560+ list of anime I already have and to prevent Himouto-fans from shitdorsing their Mary-sue.Again, this is a review written by someone who has 560-something anime on his list, a seasoned-fan of moeblobs, and I would like to stress that I’ve seen a lot of CGDCTs from K-On to Yuyushiki, YuruYuri, AcchiKocchi, and I do love seiyuus, but Himouto never compels the iconic cute things of these aforementioned titles. My take is that when it comes to CGDCTs and/or slice-of-life, it’s always about the characterization over the plot. CGDCT lovers probably wouldn’t give a damn about where the plot goes and comes around, but more of how the shoujo and her seiyuu would do cute things and moe antics, easy on the mind, relaxing on the heart.Putting a mary-sue on this formula and this turn of one-dimensional thoughtlessness is just a complete waste of time.Though it doesn’t seem so to Himouto-fans, or those who don’t bother watching Boku wa Tomodachi and Accel World and won’t do character-analysis, and thus are just so happy watching Umaru’s superficial kawaiiness. For these “Himouto fans”, that’s all fine and prudent in your point-of-view—stick to your Mary-sue, as hand in heart I respect that, just as the same gauge of respect towards Hyundai-lovers. Or wait—I think I do have the answer to my Hyundai-question: maybe these Hyundai-lover people really don’t mind on what a car is, or as long as Hyundai does look good on the exterior design. Guess that principle applies for Himouto fans also.Again, why I scored this 5 overall has a lot to do with Mokocchi-look-alike Kirie, and Umaru’s seiyuu. Screw the plot, chaps—I’m all for Kirie and Umaru’s seiyuu, parody-less or not.VERDICT: For me there’s none really; but MAL rated this as SEVEN+, and MAL users can’t perhaps ever be wrong (no BellaSwan fan was wrong, too, right?). imprudent query is the very kind of impulse I feel over asking an anime-fan or otaku on why they like Himouto!

It's pretty much how the main characters spend their days. What i do like is however that they try to hint alot of relation and expose...the main things about the anime. They will try to make you hyped about when her secret will be revealed or trying to create some shipping. There's even hint of backstory. However this anime will not bother doing any of that since they have to keep the manga running forever, you know.  The loose and unconnected storyline might get you confused however remember that every episode is a singular episode with some connections here and there.This is what seperates this anime from others. It's an extremely calming slice of life without any tension or drama. This is a perfect show to watch if you just wanna laugh and enjoy since it really doesn't want to create any tensional problem or any development in anything all. This is however great since every comedy anime has some type of conflict.Art:I can't comment much on this except that the character design is good however nothing special. However sadly it is below average in terms of animation compared to today (not overall) which does minus point it, however there's nothing large to notice so do not get put down by thinking it has bad art.The biggest problem people has with the art is that they dislike chibi and moe type of character designs which is what this anime excels at. Honestly there's not really much of loliness here and you shouldn't be annoyed unless you have a grudge against moe. I personally like moe designs and also like cute female characters which is literally the definition of Umaru so it's a big plus for me.Sound:The BGM is very relaxing and sets the mood most of the time. This is a very good point of the anime, but as said there's absolutely nothing memorable whatsoever in terms of OST. I've never said '' yes, the OST finally came up ''. I even forgot it even existed.The voice acting is very good in this anime. I really think most of the characters fit their voice actors and they're also very skilled. I don't have any complaints here.The opening is probably very hated and very loved. I can't explain it so just try listening to it and you'll see what i mean. I personally like the opening, although there's nothing more to it. It's memorable due to the parodic tone the opening has. The ending song is not bad but i really couldn't care less about it. The OP/ED however sets me in a somewhat correct mood which is a plus.Characters:Honestly you have this set of typical characters which are likeable. I even did some shippings because they were likeable and the main girl (Umaru) really takes on an interesting social point. Although it might see very common but trying to hide your indoor life from your life with other people is something we're all mostly doing and can even cost you your real life relationships if you're too deep. I really like how Umaru is trying to hide her otaku life. This is actually i myself am doing at school with like 99% of the people there. I am not open with ANY non anime watcher at all. My school personality and real life are too different.What's the problem you ask? I did say that the characters are likeable. This by no means mean that they got depth. This also means they hardly got any character development. They remain the exact same as the start. Umaru is probably the one i expected to get developed the most however i was left disappointed. She is still this character who drags around her Onii-chan to do everything. You can somewhat see her opening up to the people around her however she is still kind of the exact same thing.Obviously i know the point of this anime but it's still sad, you know :(.Enjoyment:This does what it's meant to. It's really enjoyable and keeps you to watch it. I do not recommend you binge-watch it after the mid-point (the early point worked well when i binged watched it). It will eventually tire you out and you will give it a lower score than you intented to. The comedy is good but it somewhat repetitive with these overused scenes however i don't think this will stop you from enjoying it.Overall:This anime really isn't anything special and is pretty much a very good relaxing anime with some annoying cliches. This doesn't have any conflict at all nor does it have much character development at all. It's really just a fun anime without any cliffhangers which you might enjoy unless you really dislike moe art.

Doing absolutely nothing is something of a rarity these days as we all run around like headless chickens doing god knows what in order to properly execute whatever we have to do in our lives.  So, what if we followed the life of one someone who is blessed with such a simple life?  Here\'s Himouto!  Umaru-chan!Story: Umaru Doma is the pinnacle of high school perfection.  She\'s friendly, she is the best in both academics and sports, and she very beautiful and all around the most popular girl in school.  But underneath that...facade, when she arrives home, she transforms, donning her signature hamster hood and turning herself into her true form, the himouto, (A Hikkiomori Imouto, basically) where her perfect appearance is melted away to reveal the selfish and cola loving beast that\'s inside...  And, that\'s pretty much the whole story.Adapted from a manga whose average chapter page length is only 11 pages, Himuto plays as a slice of life show that reflects off of a bunch of minisodes grouped together to form one complete episode.  By mostly taking chapters that relate to one another with a common theme and stringing them together, Himouto\'s storyline is mostly linear story with some progression to move the story along, mostly in the form of the way characters interact to each other and in some cases, how they act.As for any central themes, Himouto occasionally goes into a slightly more serious note by relating to the sibling relationships within the series.  It\'s a nice touch because it doesn\'t actually bring much away from the story and actually, kind of adds a nice bit of depth to the characters.But for the most part, the show focuses primarily on Umaru and her selfish Himouto lifestyle.  The comedy of the show is drawn from the various antics that she gets into or executes in order to get whatever she wants, as well her tripolar behavior that makes her a bit of a more complicated character than you would think, sort of.  Umaru herself shows a lot of selfishness and laziness as a character, so, if you don\'t like people like that, then I would not suggest watching this show.  (Also, don\'t question the whole chibi shrinking thing she does when she devolves into Himouto form.  Apparently, it\'s a physical change, and I have no idea how she does it.)Overview:+ Unique base story+ Little bit of character depth+/- Comedy comes from the title character and her antics  (good or bad depending how you perceive that kind of personality)-  Show is mostly unchanging and static with the way it presents its contentCharacters: Since this show mostly reflects off of the older brother/little sister relationship, every character but one in this series belongs in one of these camps.First, we have the title character of the series, Doma Umaru.  As the mascot and main plot point of the series, Umaru as a character is a very odd creature.  As I mentioned before, she is ""tripolar"", as she has more than one ""form"" that she lives her life in.  As a result, Umaru is quite the piece of work.  Her first form is her ""outside"" form where she is the calm, collected, beautifully perfect self that she is.  This is the form that Umaru wants to be seen as outside of her house, hence the reason why she adopts this as the way she wants to reveal herself to the world.  And then we have her true form, ""Himouto"", where she dons a hamster hood and devolves into the size of a chibi for maximum laziness.  As the main form showcased in the series in general, Himouto is Umaru\'s true nature, which is a selfish, spoiled little hamster with a pension for whining for whatever she wants, lazing around at home by playing games or watching anime, and drinking cola; LOTS and LOTS of cola.  And finally, we have ""UMR"", her gaming persona.  UMR is the least used form in Umaru\'s arsenal.  Mostly used for gaming or arcade related purposes, UMR really only serves to help Umaru deal with one of the other imoutos in the series, a point I will get back to on later.  As a character, she doesn\'t particularly develop as a person.  She occasionally has lapses of realization and pops out a sweet little moment for a second, but the show eventually just returns back to its status quo with Umaru being selfish again, recreating the never ending cycle of pain for her brother and for the anime.Speaking about her brother, let\'s talk about him.  Doma Taihei, the Onii-chan of Umaru.  As a hardworking sales rep, Taihei is a man who is very devoted in his time and energy in trying to support both he and his sister since the two of them live in the same apartment.  Very frustrated by the way his sister acts with her constant whining and complete disregard for his own feelings, Taihei serves as the straight man for the series, while also being a bit weak because he succumbs to Umaru\'s cries rather easily.  While the series mostly focuses on Umaru, Himouto also puts a good bit of focus into Taihei and the relationship between the two siblings which is nice, but unfortunately doesn\'t last long because of the status quo of the series.For side characters, we have three other pairs that correspond to the ""older brother/little sister"" relationship which are Kirie, Sylphin, and Ebina who each have an older brother that also appears in the series.  (Though, Ebina\'s isn\'t revealed in the anime.) As characters, each of the other characters in the series serve as characters to fill in the blanks.  They\'re not neccesarily deep, they don\'t have many actual character traits to them, there\'s almost no character development for them, and they are all fairly trope-like.  But, all three of the other girls in the series progressively get to know Umaru through one of her three forms.  (Ebina with ""Outside"" Umaru, Kirie with ""Himouto"" Umaru, and Sylphin with ""UMR"" Umaru.  So, this is where the tripolarness sort of comes in handy.  Sort of.)Overview:+/- Interesting main character (Umaru is known to be liked and hated as a character)-  Characters are mostly one trick ponies-  Little to no character developmentArt: The art for Umaru is a moe-like style with bright colors that reflect off of the lighthearted feeling that the show gives off.  There really isn\'t much to say about it since the art is pretty standard.As for comedy, Himouto takes a lot of the common comedic tropes for anime, utilizing dramatized backgrounds, different facial expressions for characters, and lots and lots of Umaru.  They also have quite a bit of references in this series, so if you like references, this show has quite a few.Overview:+ References in the artwork+ Decent but standard quality artSound: Now for the sound.  Himouto\'s tracks are quite few in number, as the show has it\'s OP and it ED, as well as the two other songs in the series that serve as the background songs.The opening is a very addictive song, as it encapsulates the complete madness that is Umaru\'s Himouto form and as such is, while not a masterpiece, a very catchy song, which makes it memorable, I guess.  The ED on the other hand is a little song that is sung by the seiyuus of the four girls.  Even with that though, it\'s not a song I find to be particularly memorable as it\'s pretty generic and doesn\'t have anything to it that\'ll latch its tune into your mind.For the two or so background tracks that are in the series, there\'s not really much to say about them.  Using a calm and airy tone for the songs, they bring about the kind of emotion that\'s supposed to be conveyed during the scene.  There\'s nothing really memorable about them aside from adding a bit more to what Umaru is doing in that point in time.Overview:+ Catchy OP-  Rest of the soundtrack was average at bestPersonal Enjoyment:  So, all in all, did I enjoy this adaptation?  Well, I can safely say that I did.  Himouto as a series is one that really just focuses on the fun that it wants to convey, not really taking itself seriously and really just lets Umaru do whatever she wants.  They actually did rather well with translating the tiny 11 page chapters into a full-length episode, which I at first was unsure how they were going to do it.Did I enjoy this anime?Yes.  Umaru as a series is one of my more favorable casual reads, and seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life is always a grand little treat.  It was just as wacky as the original series, they didn\'t cut any corners, and it was overall, still very enjoyable.  Plus, it\'s a series that actually has some progression, so it\'s also pretty quaint in that aspect.What didn\'t I like about this anime?I was a bit sad that they didn\'t actually show Ebina\'s brother, since that would\'ve completed the entire set of ""Onii-chan/Imouto"" characters in this show.  Of course, that would\'ve caused more complications because there\'s some buildup to that, but still.Would I recommend watching this anime?Yes, actually.  Honestly, I\'d say just give this series a shot.  It\'s a fun little series that doesn\'t take itself too seriously, and while everyone is one-sided, makes for quite a charming little cast.  Of course, if you\'re not a big fan of moe-style art, people who are completely selfish, or watching a girl down a gallon of cola in a matter of seconds, then you may reconsider the decision. facade, when she arrives home, she transforms, donning her signature hamster hood and turning herself into her true form, the himouto, (A Hikkiomori Imouto, basically) where her perfect appearance is melted away to reveal the selfish and cola loving beast that\'s inside...

Spoilers ahead!)Unlike Himouto! Umaru-chan, I do not have a younger sister. However, I do have a younger brother. Admittedly he is not-so-little anymore, but he is still my baby bro nonetheless. I always tried to be a “good older brother” – playing sports, earning high marks in education, and looking out for him when needed. Still, I do not think he ever looked up to me as an older brother; for much of his life he has made his own decisions, regardless of me or anyone else around him. Not that I hate him or vice versa...(we love each other despite never saying the words), it is just we have been more like the best of friends rather than him viewing me as a role model of sorts. Whether that speaks more about him or myself, I cannot say.This past week I met up with him, to discuss life, how he was doing, and what stories we had to share. We insulted each other, we poked fun at each other, and we belittled each other, but we were always laughing. The jokes, the melodramatic tales, and the unique scenarios we find ourselves in are separate, but we get each other. His laughter, mixed with my own, makes this known.No matter what happens, he will always be my baby brother. I know that, and I know that he knows that, too. Despite the things we might do or the words we might say, my brotherly relationship to my goofball of a brother is something I will always cherish. As for Umaru of Himouto! Umaru-chan, that same mentality can be found somewhere within.STORYHimouto is a simple anime. As a comedy with intermittent, heartfelt moments, the show truthfully does not do much except stick to its regular self. This is not necessarily a negative but it does leave much to be desired.“Desire” is an important concept since much of the comedy revolves around this notion. Umaru desires laziness, leaning on her brother’s generosity and indulging in her own fantasies. Ebina desires food and romance. Kirie desires friendship. Sylphinford desires winning. With these desires in mind, the anime often constructs its comedic events around them. One scene might have Umaru chatting with her inner-selves while making popular anime references while another scene might showcase Kirie’s daydreaming involving her, her “Master”, and the beach. Doing so allows the show to essentially “do what they want”, escaping the confines of reality in order to give the show a wider breadth of material to work with. That is to say, gratification stems from their (often unfulfilled) desires.Of course, the show bends its own reality when it so chooses, most notably when Umaru goes from prim and proper to squat and squalor. The show makes a distinction between the two halves, meaning the audience (and the characters) can (or cannot) tell that the refined Umaru is different from the reduced Umaru. This, once again, opens up another branch of comedy. The show constantly uses this disparity between the regular and the hermit Umaru in order to create contrasting comedic courses. For example, one scene has her out to eat with her brother and Ebina so she has to act “correctly”, but since she wants to purchase a new video game, her “true” self starts to emerge. This mixture of both halves – this ultra-perfect girl whining, crying, and acting silly – creates a dichotomy that naturally invokes hilarity. This kind of contrast applies to each of the other girls as well: Kirie being excited and cute yet somewhat creepy, Ebina accidentally using her normal dialect when happy, and Sylphinford acting (playfully) high and mighty but getting embarrassed when her brother appears. This contrasting motif permeates the anime, both in its narrative and in its characters.As for other, concrete themes, the narrative does not invest in anything too deep. Ideas such as “home sweet home” – when Umaru hangs out at a manga café that has everything she has ever wanted yet she heads home early – and the importance of family – when Umaru feels alone after separating the apartment into two halves – are sweet for the soul but remain unexplored. That is, they exist solely to add a bit of sentimentality to balance out the stream of comedy the show provides. In this way, the comedy avoids to an extent becoming stale since the show often relies on the same gags and adorableness. Therefore shifting the tone slightly time and again does not outright take away from the laughs. Instead the show makes those laughs, when they do come around again, stronger since they are jumping from a relatively mellow level of emotion to a level of pure happiness.Himouto avoiding the exploration of difficult themes is not automatically a problem; the anime has no interest in going super-critical. The show simply wants to make comedy its first and foremost outlet. However there is a theme that Himouto, to some degree, expounds on: the sibling relationship. At most points throughout the anime, Umaru and Taihei’s bond is tested. There are the obvious instances, where Umaru feels bad for acting difficult around Taihei and Taihei thinking about his sister’s lunch so she grows up healthy. But it is not these kinder moments that portray their sibling status. Rather, Umaru’s teasing, Taihei’s lividness, and their ultimate reconciliations are what display the bond they share. Having a sibling – be it a brother or a sister – brings with it certain connotations. Understanding, respect, tolerance; “family comes first” is not said lightly. This cliché literally means that that guy or girl who shares the same blood is always at the forefront of the mind. While Himouto might not necessarily have Umaru and Taihei in dramatized situations, Umaru fretting over Taihei when he gets sick or Taihei working overtime to support Umaru’s future are moments that highlight the special relationship that not everyone gets to experience.This theme of sibling relationships does not only apply to Umaru and Taihei. Sylphinford and her brother Alex as well as Kirie and her brother Bomber are relationships about the same idea. The former contains a bit of unnecessary distance whereas the latter is filled with miscommunication. In truth, these examples are likewise lacking intensive exploration, but these relationships at least expound on what a sibling relationship entails once again. Meaning Himouto, despite focusing so much on comedy, has at the minimum a noticeable thematic presence.ANIMATIONOne of Himouto’s biggest strengths is the level of animation it employs. Mostly due to the simplistic art, the characters and their various actions – from Umaru’s transitions between normal and hermit to Ebina’s frantic disposition – are fluid. This also stems from the show’s laidback nature. The characters never do anything extremely extraneous, meaning resources can be relegated to hair, faces, and limb movements. As such, the show manages to remain dynamic, fitting the show’s equally dynamic comedy.The designs for the characters are not as dynamic, however some of the characters are impressive. Umaru may have an argument in her favor for the fact that she is given two separate designs to coincide with her two separate personalities. Her cute side, having long hair, glinting eyes, and a model-esque smile, makes her blanket-wearing, height-missing, and doofy-grinning side a jarring spectacle. Most striking of all is Sylphinford. Her cat-like smile, light-blue, flowing hair, and fancy dresses make her stick out from everyone else in the series. Yet it is her eyes, with their cross-symbol pupils, that immediately draw the attention of the audience. There is no denying how different she looks from the other decidedly plain (read: normal) people, signifying her own need to rise above the rest. This “rest” being Kirie, Ebina, and Taihei, each of who are visually lackluster. Kirie’s purple ponytail, Ebina’s huge boobs and twin-tails, and Taihei’s glasses make them their own persons but nowhere near as creative as Umaru and Sylphinford.As for the art, as was stated Himouto rarely ventures outside of its comfort zone. The art is simplistic, taking place primarily at or around Umaru’s abode. Parts of the school, the arcade, or a restaurant may be visited now and again but the majority of the action takes place in the regular apartment. The result is a tame offering of the same, tired area despite how detailed the recluse location is. Lighting also contributes to the sameness since the anime rarely deals in extravagant use of fixtures or bulbs. Still, the camera and its direction deserves some praise for its occasional execution. One scene in particular takes an aerial view of Umaru and the apartment’s entrance, then shifts into a first-person perspective of Umaru as she crawls along the floor and under a table to her favorite resting spot. A unique scenario – one of a select few instances where the camera does a lot of work – but worthy of attention regardless of its frequency.Other nuances exist – such as the inclusion of text for certain conversations or actions, the visibility of a heat wave, and the literal tilting of the frame on-screen – that, however slightly, demonstrate the show’s attention to detail on an artistic level.CHARACTERSArguably the characters are the backbone for comedies (characters being the backbone for all anime is another conversation entirely), meaning whether or not Himouto can stand upright relies mostly on the strength of its cast.Focusing solely on the main troupe – Taihei, Ebina, Sylphinford, Kirie, and Umaru (ignoring Bomber, the “Christmas Cake” boss, and the other very minor characters) – Taihei actually rests at the bottom of the totem pole. Much of his persona derives from the other girls. He shows kindness towards Ebina, understanding towards Kirie, and happiness towards Umaru. This, combined with his adult status, does not give him much room to change throughout the season, and that is sort of the point. As a caregiver, as a guy who has to look out for his family and his family’s friends, he is more or less the rock that supports them. While he does have nostalgic asides, the anime uses Taihei as the man he is and the man he is supposed to be: one always willing to help those around him.Ebina is not so much a helper as she is a girl seemingly out of her element. She hails from the country, her accent (which she hides) giving her away easily enough. Her strangest feature, though, is her adoration of Taihei. Her loving him is fine, it is her reasoning that is weird. On her travels, Taihei was (supposedly) the first person to look not at her ginormous bosom but instead at her, the girl hoisting said bust. Therefore, whenever Taihei is around she noticeably blushes. As for her relationship to Umaru, they are best friends, the big-boob lady floored that the perfect girl of the school would even think of hanging out with her country bumpkin self. Ebina does not do a whole lot throughout the season despite hang out with Umaru, fail to get her feelings across to Taihei, and try to make friends with Kirie, but as the genuinely sincere part of the group, she plays her role well.Sylphinford also has a role in the group: the hyper-competitive and hyperactive girl. Loving games, anime, and manga (which she hides from her brother), she comes from a place of wealth. Aptly put, Sylphinford is a character among the characters. She has a self-imposed rivalry with Umaru – in sports, in grades, and in general life. Sylphinford always loses but she never lets this deter her. She is almost happy that she loses, or at the minimum has someone who she can call her equal. Umaru’s masquerading gamer side is someone Sylphinford also competes with for nearly the same reasons. But no matter who she is with, she gives everything her all not because she wants attention but because she simply wants to have fun. She loves playing games but even more so than that she loves making other people smile.Kirie is similar in the sense that she wants to have fun but has a hard time getting across this notion. She has an extremely awkward personality (which she hides…unsuccessfully) that most people interpret as a threatening demeanor. She was lonely because nobody wanted to interact with her and because she could not muster the courage to interact with anyone else. It is not until Umaru’s hermit half that she finally opens up completely, revealing to the audience a girl who is still awkward at times but actually filled with heart and love. Kirie is the only one to see growth of a sizeable magnitude: having overcome her inherent anxiety, not just with Umaru but with Taihei and Ebina later on, she comes to have the type of camaraderie she had always sought, breaking her shell slightly. And it is slightly. Kirie still has a lot of difficulty talking with everyone, even regular Umaru. But progressing to the point of having a beach vacation with five people at once is a hugely relative leap for the hugely shy lady.Unquestionably, Umaru is the most interesting character. Questionably, Umaru is the most complex of all the characters. Technically Umaru is a single person. However Umaru is somebody with multiple personas (which she hides). Like Spider Man and Peter Parker, she adapts herself for the people around her. For Ebina, she acts like her refined self. For Sylphinford, she acts like her gamer self. For Kirie, she acts like her lazy self. In other words, Umaru “becomes” somebody else depending on who she happens to talk with. Her brother is the only one to see all these sides simultaneously because, as was aforementioned, their sibling relationship demands trust between the brother and sister. Interestingly, she does not “open up” to anyone despite them opening up to her. Ebina recollects her outside origins, Sylphinford laments her embarrassment, and Kirie confides her troubles. On the one hand, this is selfish of Umaru. Her friends willingly unveil themselves while she continues to dodge their glares. On the other hand, Umaru is the least selfish. Looking at the situation more closely, Umaru uses the persona that best suits each of her friends, less a ruse and more a comfort. Ebina cannot handle crazy stuff so she acts normal, Sylphinford loves to compete so she dons her UMR mask, and Kirie is better at dealing with children so she goes full-childish. In a strange way, she is a complex character, someone who contorts to fit the occasion while simultaneously being herself. She is Doma. She is UMR. She is Komaru. And yet she is not. Because, in the end, she is nobody else besides Umaru.Umaru easily personifies one of the definitive themes of the anime. This theme being two-sidedness (granted, Umaru has three sides). Each of the girls has the same peculiar quality – they hide some part of themselves. Indeed, the previous discussion on each character makes this connection clear. Everyone has something to hide, or more poignantly everyone has something to reveal. Men and women often view other individuals through a single lens rather than through a multidimensional scope. Meaning they are incapable of seeing all sides to another person. Ebina is quite reserved, but she has a voracious appetite, an accent, and a pure love. Sylphinford is bombastic, but she adores candy, loves “all things Japanese”, and hates to embarrass herself in front of her brother. Kirie is overly shy, but she can play sports, she can cook cookies, and she is devoutly loyal. Ebina, Sylphinford, and Kirie reveal these traits to Umaru as time passes, and to an extent it is a relief for them. Having the opportunity to be themselves around another person, revealing who they actually are, is a wonderful feeling, one that Himouto manages to explore in a comedic yet meaningful manner.SOUNDThe opening theme is absolutely delightful, perfectly capturing the mood of the show. The beat is quick, the tone is ecstatic, and the instruments are fun. However it is the song’s interlude, where the track shifts its tune from cacophony to calm then back to calamity – what Umaru does on a daily basis – that elevates the piece’s awareness of the anime’s focus, thereby improving the piece’s overall execution. The ending theme cleverly tones everything down, keeping its mood mellow. The four main girls take turns singing in the first half, followed by an audible “aragato”, and then the second half a choir of their voices. Alongside the cheerful and serene tone, the track gets better the more it is listened to. If nothing else, the piece has the audience exit each episode feeling warm in the soul.A minor note: the anime likes to use silly sound effects, especially with the characters. This most prominently happens with Umaru and Sylphinford, their “Umaruun!” and “Shupaan!”, respectively, adding comedy to their actions. Also, the distinct sounds of hermit Umaru walking make her tiny form that much funnier. As such, the anime improves on its comedic delivery, albeit in a roundabout way.Voice acting for Himouto is above average for most of the performances. Aimi Tanaka as Umaru provides two separate voices to match the young lady’s current demeanor, giving Umaru a stronger distinction between her two halves. Plus, as Ms. Tanaka’s first major role, she goes above and beyond. Yurina Furukawa as Sylphinford uses quite the upbeat voice, resulting in a girl who always sounds determined. Similar to Ms. Tanaka, this is Ms. Furukawa’s very first role, meaning her debut performance could not have gone any better. The best performance comes from Haruka Shiraishi as Kirie, whose grunts, gasps, and guttural noises made her into the lovable weirdo that she is. And as might be expected, this is one of her first bigger roles in the industry, her well-executed performance demonstrating a potentially bright future for her as a voice actress. Akari Kageyama as Ebina also has this as her first big role, so if anything the voice acting should be remembered for enlisting new and strong talent for the majority of the main cast.The remainder of the soundtrack outside of the OP and the ED is intriguing. As a slice-of-life anime, Himouto is not grandiose in its background music, but some do manage to perk the ears. One track involves a low-note piano with constant snapping, used for the slightly ominous moments. Another almost strictly sticks to xylophones for the questionable times. Techno beats, fast-paced tunes, and lots of flutes fill the air of various pieces, creating a wide range of offerings. The music can also become specific, like during the time Umaru, Kirie, and Taihei play a video game that incorporates 8-bit recordings. Again, nothing is memorable but Himouto does a nice job of having the right piece for the right moments throughout the season.ENJOYMENTAdmittedly, there is not a lot to say about this one. Except for specific categories, the anime is quite average at everything it does. Yet this does not outright deter the amount of entertainment derived from the show. The characters, regardless of their meager development, are nothing short of fun. Especially Kirie, whose awkwardness and accidental creepiness, combined with her stuttering and devotion to Umaru, made her an undeniable ball of awesomeness throughout the season. Literally anything Kirie did made me laugh out loud, making her easily my favorite of the show.Sylphinford is not too far behind. Her boundless determination, sincere praise of Umaru, and her ridiculous poses were nothing short of hilarious. Umaru, too, with her dramatized adorableness and lackadaisical attitude. Ebina, as well as Kanau, brought a dash of romance which, given my adoration for the genre, was a welcome addition. Bomber is a cool dude, too. He plays the off-kilter man to Taihei’s straight man while also playing well off of lazy Umaru and his sister Kirei. The characters are a nice bout of fun, individually and collectively providing laughter throughout the experience.In fact, there was probably more room for different pairings. Sylphinford barely interacts with anyone besides Umaru and there is very little of Kanau despite her having a funny (and heartfelt) scene. Furthermore, besides the moments themselves being cutesy or sweet, none were moving; the events were neither sad nor frustrating to me. While I could certainly empathize with the sibling relationship ideas, I simply understood those themes and where they were heading rather than them being a set of scenes that I found myself resonating with. Regardless, the faces the characters made, the imaginations they thought up, and the simple moments they shared with one another put smiles not only on their faces but on mine, too.Himouto! Umaru-chan is a comedy before anything else. Its meager themes on siblings and the idea of multisided people exist but are not explored extensively. Other areas are a mixed bag: the animation is solid but the art is often par for the course. Still, this does not take away from the musical choices, the impressive debuts of the voice actresses, and the large amount of entertainment the whole package delivers. And as this one shows, regardless if it is a made-up anime family or my brother and I, having a sibling relationship is a truly unique experience.SUMMARYStory: Fine, comedy entails desire and bending reality, with sentimental and sibling themes that are explored only adequatelyAnimation: Fine, above average actual animation, Sylphinford and Umaru are the only impressive character designs, about average artistic direction with hints of ingenuityCharacters: Fine, while the majority of the cast are relegated to singular roles, Umaru’s adaptability and the theme on multiple sides holds a higher sense of meaningSound: Good, great OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA workEnjoyment: Good, Kirie, Sylphinford, and Umaru were hilarious, the rest of the cast was fun, with missed pairing opportunities and emotional events.Final Score: 6/10 (we love each other despite never saying the words), it is just we have been more like the best of friends rather than him viewing me as a role model of sorts. Whether that speaks more about him or myself, I cannot say.This past week I met up with him, to discuss life, how he was doing, and what stories we had to share. We insulted each other, we poked fun at each other, and we belittled each other, but we were always laughing. The jokes, the melodramatic tales, and the unique scenarios we find ourselves in are separate, but we get each other. His laughter, mixed with my own, makes this known.No matter what happens, he will always be my baby brother. I know that, and I know that he knows that, too. Despite the things we might do or the words we might say, my brotherly relationship to my goofball of a brother is something I will always cherish. As for Umaru of Himouto! Umaru-chan, that same mentality can be found somewhere within.STORYHimouto is a simple anime. As a comedy with intermittent, heartfelt moments, the show truthfully does not do much except stick to its regular self. This is not necessarily a negative but it does leave much to be desired.“Desire” is an important concept since much of the comedy revolves around this notion. Umaru desires laziness, leaning on her brother’s generosity and indulging in her own fantasies. Ebina desires food and romance. Kirie desires friendship. Sylphinford desires winning. With these desires in mind, the anime often constructs its comedic events around them. One scene might have Umaru chatting with her inner-selves while making popular anime references while another scene might showcase Kirie’s daydreaming involving her, her “Master”, and the beach. Doing so allows the show to essentially “do what they want”, escaping the confines of reality in order to give the show a wider breadth of material to work with. That is to say, gratification stems from their (often unfulfilled) desires.Of course, the show bends its own reality when it so chooses, most notably when Umaru goes from prim and proper to squat and squalor. The show makes a distinction between the two halves, meaning the audience (and the characters) can (or cannot) tell that the refined Umaru is different from the reduced Umaru. This, once again, opens up another branch of comedy. The show constantly uses this disparity between the regular and the hermit Umaru in order to create contrasting comedic courses. For example, one scene has her out to eat with her brother and Ebina so she has to act “correctly”, but since she wants to purchase a new video game, her “true” self starts to emerge. This mixture of both halves – this ultra-perfect girl whining, crying, and acting silly – creates a dichotomy that naturally invokes hilarity. This kind of contrast applies to each of the other girls as well: Kirie being excited and cute yet somewhat creepy, Ebina accidentally using her normal dialect when happy, and Sylphinford acting (playfully) high and mighty but getting embarrassed when her brother appears. This contrasting motif permeates the anime, both in its narrative and in its characters.As for other, concrete themes, the narrative does not invest in anything too deep. Ideas such as “home sweet home” – when Umaru hangs out at a manga café that has everything she has ever wanted yet she heads home early – and the importance of family – when Umaru feels alone after separating the apartment into two halves – are sweet for the soul but remain unexplored. That is, they exist solely to add a bit of sentimentality to balance out the stream of comedy the show provides. In this way, the comedy avoids to an extent becoming stale since the show often relies on the same gags and adorableness. Therefore shifting the tone slightly time and again does not outright take away from the laughs. Instead the show makes those laughs, when they do come around again, stronger since they are jumping from a relatively mellow level of emotion to a level of pure happiness.Himouto avoiding the exploration of difficult themes is not automatically a problem; the anime has no interest in going super-critical. The show simply wants to make comedy its first and foremost outlet. However there is a theme that Himouto, to some degree, expounds on: the sibling relationship. At most points throughout the anime, Umaru and Taihei’s bond is tested. There are the obvious instances, where Umaru feels bad for acting difficult around Taihei and Taihei thinking about his sister’s lunch so she grows up healthy. But it is not these kinder moments that portray their sibling status. Rather, Umaru’s teasing, Taihei’s lividness, and their ultimate reconciliations are what display the bond they share. Having a sibling – be it a brother or a sister – brings with it certain connotations. Understanding, respect, tolerance; “family comes first” is not said lightly. This cliché literally means that that guy or girl who shares the same blood is always at the forefront of the mind. While Himouto might not necessarily have Umaru and Taihei in dramatized situations, Umaru fretting over Taihei when he gets sick or Taihei working overtime to support Umaru’s future are moments that highlight the special relationship that not everyone gets to experience.This theme of sibling relationships does not only apply to Umaru and Taihei. Sylphinford and her brother Alex as well as Kirie and her brother Bomber are relationships about the same idea. The former contains a bit of unnecessary distance whereas the latter is filled with miscommunication. In truth, these examples are likewise lacking intensive exploration, but these relationships at least expound on what a sibling relationship entails once again. Meaning Himouto, despite focusing so much on comedy, has at the minimum a noticeable thematic presence.ANIMATIONOne of Himouto’s biggest strengths is the level of animation it employs. Mostly due to the simplistic art, the characters and their various actions – from Umaru’s transitions between normal and hermit to Ebina’s frantic disposition – are fluid. This also stems from the show’s laidback nature. The characters never do anything extremely extraneous, meaning resources can be relegated to hair, faces, and limb movements. As such, the show manages to remain dynamic, fitting the show’s equally dynamic comedy.The designs for the characters are not as dynamic, however some of the characters are impressive. Umaru may have an argument in her favor for the fact that she is given two separate designs to coincide with her two separate personalities. Her cute side, having long hair, glinting eyes, and a model-esque smile, makes her blanket-wearing, height-missing, and doofy-grinning side a jarring spectacle. Most striking of all is Sylphinford. Her cat-like smile, light-blue, flowing hair, and fancy dresses make her stick out from everyone else in the series. Yet it is her eyes, with their cross-symbol pupils, that immediately draw the attention of the audience. There is no denying how different she looks from the other decidedly plain (read: normal) people, signifying her own need to rise above the rest. This “rest” being Kirie, Ebina, and Taihei, each of who are visually lackluster. Kirie’s purple ponytail, Ebina’s huge boobs and twin-tails, and Taihei’s glasses make them their own persons but nowhere near as creative as Umaru and Sylphinford.As for the art, as was stated Himouto rarely ventures outside of its comfort zone.

Umaru-chan is a very simple anime: it has mostly no story. We just watch Umaru and her lazybutt adventures. However, it is surprisingly enjoyable: although watching shows can easily be a bore for me, I watched all episodes in something that was almost a rush.Story (6):The story is simply a cute girl who excels at school, sports, beauty, literally everything, but is a slacker when home: she spends her entire day playing games, reading manga and drinking cola. Annnnd, for most part, that's all. Yes. Really, that's all.Art(9):The art was pretty good, and kind of helped in...the comical effect. Alongside with pretty much everything in this show, it was simple as well, but smooth.  I liked it a lot.Sound(7):Far from outstanding, but good and well used.Character(6):Other than Umaru, there was almost zero character development for all characters. They felt like some stereotypes in anime and manga, however, they managed to be almost likeable.Enjoyment(10):I laughed a lot with this anime! I really can't deny it's flaws, but I cant as well deny how fun it was for me. It, somehow, made me remember of myself when I was younger: and this sort of time travel was relaxing and very, very enjoyable.Overall(8):Like I said, Himouto!

In fact, thinking hard on it now, I think I picked it up because I heard /a/ was torn between loving and hating Umaru for being The Perfect Girl Who Is Secretly An Otaku, and that was all the reason I needed in the end.So I tried episode one. And I am immediately hit with the surprisingly catchy and fun theme song; I am a particular fan of the Hamsters + Umaru stampede scenes, which warm my black heart considerably, and the elegant bridge in the middle is a very...nice touch for what is to come.From that moment forward, I watched Umaru transform to the radiant, unattainable, and awe-inspiring high schooler to hideous moeblob of spite, manipulation, selfishness, and laziness, and then back again. And I should have hated her, for all intents and purposes. Umaru is a garbage princess borne from a trash dumpster. Umaru is unquestionably a horrible little girl who has no qualms with using others for her own material gains -- especially poor Taihei onii-chan -- but instead, I found myself (horrifyingly) loving her for how much I identified with her. While I am arguably not nearly as evil as she is and I do not steal my loved one's credit cards, I was startled by how overjoyed I was to get a heroine who maintained a flawless outer persona in personality and character, but tossed on her comfy clothes and immersed herself in snack food and weeb garbage when she got home without a care in the world.Importantly, though, is that despite Umaru's myriad of shortcomings, there is the very real existence of her guilt when she overdoes it or something goes terribly wrong, and while the hoops she made her brother jump through frequently bordered on cruel, it was always apparent by the end that they honestly loved each other.It is that last point is what actually makes this series work for me. Personally, I cannot stand the trash characters who are heinous to everyone without any redeeming morals or scenes. Umaru avoids this narrowly with moments of empathy and mutually heartfelt love. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Taihei gets a little revenge every now and then. The lapses in comedy are punctuated by these more real and honest moments, highlighting her more wordly thoughts and feelings, as well as focusing on the family aspect of the show. When Umaru isn't raising hell, we find her worrying about her brother and him worrying about her. We see Taihei go out of the way to buy her favourite food even after a long and tiresome day at work, and him becoming completely lost when she's not bothering him. We see Umaru, in her bedtime walk through town, basking in the quiet solace of the night, reveling in her private moment. Even the side characters are afforded this luxury, as the series has a running theme of brother and sister relationships -- the scene of Tachibana's brother grabbing her after her freak out in the middle of a tournament is strange and out of nowhere, it seems, but when it sinks in you can't help be left with warmth.Now, on the other hand, my greatest qualm with the series is that I am always disappointed and pretty disgusted to see young girls tossed into sexualizing scenes that are meant to make it more marketable. Umaru is not exempt from this highly unfortunate trope. While I am relieved that these scenes are kept to a minimum, especially compared to other shows, they are not non-existent, they make me uncomfortable, and they truly add nothing of any real and meaningful substance to the narrative or characters involved. Additionally, the other reasons for giving this an 8/10 are just that while Himouto! Umaru-chan is really funny, it's not above and beyond funny; and while it does have its underlying moments of depth that step away from the pure comedy, they're not quite profound enough to really hit home.In the end, Himouto!

Umaru-chan is a series about Umaru, a Mary Sue, the high school girl you dream of having as your gf, or waifu for that matters (not happening brah, srsly?), or so that’s what everyone thinks of her. When she gets home, the perfect schoolgirl façade is dropped, revealing her lazy, irresponsible side, which I find cute, relatable and annoying at the same time.The series doesn’t have an overarching plot, instead it follows these episodic formulas:- Umaru gets back from school, enters lazy mode, brother goes back from work, gives her a scolding but ends...up being her slave as always.- Umaru hangs out or have friends over, and either she keeps up her usual outer shell OR she pretends to be her own sister while retaining her lazy attitude. Meanwhile, the brother ends up being a slave, again as always.- Umaru hangs out at the arcade using the alias UMR, beat the crap out of every games and fools around with that annoying girl. The brother doesn’t even get screentime in this situation which is worse than being a slave. Poor dude.Thus, the series can be hard to follow as a whole, characters end up not getting any development and it gets very stagnant after a while. It relies on comedy which is repetitive and isn’t that good tbh, but occasionally it did give me a good laugh.Characters: relatively one-dimensional, little to no development and background information.Umaru: She’s actually 95 but she used that secret anti-aging technique which angered doctors worldwide, she’s so smart she’s beaten the US and Soviet Union in the space race, she’s so loved and admired by everyone that she has yet to receive a love-letter or a confession (what the fuck?), she’s so sparkly that not even Edward Cullen from Twilight can out-sparkle her, she’s so godly at gaming she made South Korean Challenger players look like North America and Europe West Bronze players, … Blah blah blah. She’s perfection incarnate, except that she’s annoying as fuck.She whines about unreasonable shits a lot, and everytime she does I have the urge to bitch-slap her so hard that her nationality changes from Japan to Yugoslavia. Now she does show her gratitude and humility once in a while but it’s so trivial, no one cares. She doesn’t received any real development or background despite being the main character, and derps around for the entirety of the series. Talk about the life everyone wants.Taihei (slave brother): I simply admire this guy’s tolerance. He’s there to be the normal guy in the midst of all these weirdos, but in the end he’s just gonna end up being a slave to the corporate world and his sister. If I were him I would’ve thrown her bitch ass out before episode 1 even airs.Ebina: Personally, I think she’s the most interesting character in the show as her origin and personalities are very fascinating, but instead she’s shoved aside to be a recurring gag character. I would’ve loved to see how she’s coping with city life, how she met and became Umaru’s bestie or how her crush on the slave would turn out, etc. But instead I get a frying pan (her blushing face seems hot enough to burn the sun to crisps), two huge milky coconuts (I love coconuts don’t get me wrong), and some Morse Code gibberish coming out of her head. She’s desperately in need of more screen time.The rest: Just there for more gags, they’re of no importance whatsoever and often came off as annoying to me. Any potential characterization to these characters are thrown out the window.Art: Fairly colorful and beautiful for today's standards, but nothing groundbreaking. Sometimes it gets sloppy but that's tolerable.Sound: Again, pleasant enough for the ears but nothing really standing out either, I skipped both OP and ED every ep.VERDICT: 6/10Honestly, I feel like Umaru’s going through the stage of trying to keep up with society’s expectations and being herself at the same time. I went through this stage for a relatively short time then learned to not give a flying fuck about what people want me to do/be/do/be/do (I’m sorry that was a bad Scooby-doo pun). I do empathize with her in this sense, but it doesn't change the fact that she's more annoying than poorly synchronized subtitles.There should be a s2 about Umaru coming out of her shell and people accept her for who she is, or her becoming more responsible. AND A SCENE WHERE THE BROTHER BITCH-SLAPS HER SO HARD HER NATIONALITY CHANGES FROM JAPAN TO YUGOSLAVIA.Ebina definitely needs moar characterization and development. I practically dragged my ass through the series for this (but now I’m sad). How come the smoke detector never ever goes off? Japanese technology get your shit togetherI kinda enjoyed the series despite the repetition and apparent flaws it has, it helped me ease up on stress because of college laifu. If you like to just sit back and relax, watching cute girls to cute things, or lazy things, pardon me, this will suit you, otherwise you won’t find complexity or inspirations in this series. up being her slave as always.- Umaru hangs out or have friends over, and either she keeps up her usual outer shell OR she pretends to be her own sister while retaining her lazy attitude.

Umaru-chan is genuinely a really funny show, something that isn't as bad as what many people say out there. Now that I've made my effort to clear out the random crap, let me properly make my review on this anime.Umaru-chan focuses the most on 2 people, Umaru and her brother, Taihei. This brilliant show presents the 2 sided sister paired up with basically one of the best brothers you can ever find in this universe. Umaru, a top over-exceeding student, is a totally different person when she is in her home. She transforms into...the 'ultimate life form', becoming easily the most annoying brat there is in this whole entire world. A total meanie to her brother, is what someone else will say. It looks more like every child when they are with their parents in the toys' store when they were young. When your parent won't buy the toy that you want so much, and there you go, making a tantrum and start rolling around everywhere. That's the best thing of this anime, it perfectly shows what it tells you, a perfect 2-sided sister. You can definitely see the contrast of Umaru when she is with her friends and compared to when she is with her brother or is at home.The art for this anime is displayed really well. I love how Umaru turns little when she changes 'faces'. My theory of this change is that , this is to show how Umaru's mentality becomes equivalent to a little child. Like what I said earlier, Umaru's other face feels like a little child with her parents in the toys' store. This makes my passion for this anime grow even further once I theorized that fact. I still wonder why do the hamsters look so oddly strange, that still leaves me thinking for a while. Still haven't found an answer.As for the sound goes, I cannot say anything in terms of voice actors since this is the only anime where I've seen most of them voice act a character. Something I can say is that, they've done a pretty good job, to annoy so many people like this. Shows that they have really done the job well and right. It's also pretty awesome how the voice actors are the ones who are singing the opening theme and the ending theme, instead of hiring actual professional singers. I really appreciate that, it might not even as well thought out or perfect as the ones professionals compose and sing. However, the effort they've placed into practicing and playing the song is also quite a lot. I truly admire that effort that they have put into making it.Umaru herself is a pretty hard character for some people to accept, since according to people, she is considered to be an annoying character. To speak the facts, she was designed this way, to be an annoying, selfish brat that only basically thinks of herself and not others. I respect that Doga Kobo was able to perform that task out pretty well. The tantrum animations were just right on point, I had a pretty good laugh watching this show thanks to this one character. I should also speak more about the other characters while we are at it. Taihei is your generic, nice brother character that is created to get abused by Umaru, but he's really tolerant, patient and kind. I love his little friendship with Ebina, it's quite adorable. Ebina should get some more love though, I feel that she is quite an underrated character in the series. Kirie is amazingly played out, I'd place her 2nd to Umaru or actually maybe on par with Umaru. She plays out the shy personality amazingly good, also the rumbling scenes when she gets pissed off is awesome. Sylphin feels like she needs to be expressed more in the series. She is like a rival, but feels off at the same time. It's either horribly played out or because this is a Slice of Life. Either reason, Sylphin would have become a way better character if she was expressed more as a rival than as a person that looks like some crazy attention seeker you will find in every class you have ever attended.I truly enjoyed this anime, however, I do get slightly pissed off when Umaru is a meanie to her brother, but it depends on the situation. After all, this is a show to presenting to you what people think of you when you do these kind of things. The comedy is really well drawn out, I had a few good laughs with this show, can't tell you which ones though. (watch yourself to find out >.<)Will I recommend this anime? Well, to keep this straight, I'll say yes & no. Yes because it honestly give you a sense of all the guilty you have done in the past (devil face). No because some of you will get angry at Umaru for being an annoying brat, but isn't this what this show is about?!

This show just tries so hard to make a cute anime but kind of backfires and gets an unlikable spoiled mary sue. The main character, Umaru, gets almost everything she wants, I mean EVERYTHING from her brother but I've never even spotted her to be thankful.  Compared to her brother and other side characters, the main character, is just too pretty? I guess? And between her brother and her, they're not even similar as if they aren't even related. Such a bad design.All I can see is that she tries to act cute and gets what she...wants, she gets good grades, has good friends, and at home, she does whatever she wants. Life doesn't work like that even though it's just an anime, in my opinion, it was annoying to watch.  I question if she even contains character flaws.

It's one of those shows like Sakamoto Desu Ga and Renkin San-kyuu that has a separate story for each episode, like American cartoons, rather than a continuous season, like typical anime. I personally don't see anything wrong with it.People are also complaining about both the art style and shallow characters, but they're forgetting that it's COMEDY.StoryLike I said, it has no true plot, but I think it does a good job of having a small subplot each episode. I also find it hilarious.ArtEh, it's not the...best, but it's not minimal and is beautiful compared to some.SoundThe BGM is fitting and doesn't get annoying fast, and the opening is nice and catchy.

Literally nothing else.It\'s not funny. Umaru is the most annoying, whiny, unlikable character. The jokes are mostly the ""oh look at me i\'m so lazy and quirky and *relatable*""-type and that just gets redundant. The episodes are very repetitive, and not much happens other than Umaru bossing her brother around and being an absolute pig. At least the art is tight, but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter you throw on it.I hate this show so much. I cant stop talking about how much i...hate this show and dumb stinky Umaru.

I would. First off, let me explain that I have no problems with you liking this show, I guess I can see why someone would like it, and I also urge you to form your own opinions on it by going and watching it yourself. That being said, let me tell you why I hate this show with a passion....One person, Umaru. God, I hate her with all my heart, I was hoping that she would get some sort of comeuppance, but no. Umaru is a mary sue and everything goes her way, she never changes or develops really, and she always gets what she wants. I am not saying that she has to lose it all and become extremely depressed in order to make me enjoy it, but at least SOMETHING. I only continued watching this series  out of respect for a friend, since I promised him I would watch it all. After the frst episode, I should of stopped. Other than Umaru's dreadful character, I guess I would give it a 4/10, the story isn't amazing and not to mention when not infuriating, it was boring. However, I know that many do like, so I can probably assume that I am the outlier here, so I would personally recommend that you don't spend precious time watching this, however, you should always give the first episode a try, just in case you do like it.

Apparently I first knew about Himouto! Umaru-chan before it came out when I was browsing the pre-order listings in a certain anime shop, and I found this anime through a cute Umaru nendo. The owner said that it would surely be famous when it airs, so I decided to check out the series. The synopsis seemed interesting (although at the time, it was vague) so I decided to put it on my watchlist for this season.The story revolves around Umaru, a girl all-so-perfect-in-every-way in school, but she has a deep secret which totally tells a different...side of her - slacking like what a hikikomori would do, reading manga and watching anime, eating junk food, etc. She has to hide this secret towards her friends for her own good and keeps her perfection still. She lives with his working brother, Taihei, who just does not like her attitude at home since he finds it annoying and irritating. Being a slice of life anime, well, one would expect your typical slice-of-life-ness. But this anime shows more of what one person with two sides would do. You see how Umaru manages to hang around with her friends, while still being a total hikki at night-time. Of course, his brother will find her quite annoying and usually argues over her hikki-state, and some many find it annoying too when she whines like a little sister who demands everything. Nevertheless, the story is captivating if you like to see how one handles two sides.I really like the comedy that plays out well in the anime. There are great hilarious moments as well as many references that one can spot within a few episodes. There are also segments that focuses on other characters that are pretty good. Honestly, who would just want to see Umaru being the only focused character of the anime? Some of these segments may have show more of the characters’ personality and they are pretty chilling or heart-warming to see. Overall, the whole story is very nice and maybe if you can stand the bitterness of Umaru’s little sister devil, I think it is worth a shot.The anime portrayed Umaru’s two sides well. Her character of being too perfect may be a bit boring or uninteresting for people, and perhaps her character of being an annoying little sister can piss people watching the anime off, but I find them quite interesting and it might take a while to get used to this thing. She seemed to develop quite a while, being more open to her friends and trying to do things on her own, but in the end, she is still almost the same.The cast has not only the Doma siblings (Umaru and Taihei), but also Umaru’s friends and their siblings, and a few minor characters. Ebina is Umaru’s neighbour and classmate who come from a different province. She is shy and self-concious, that actually makes most of the viewers happy, proclaiming the best girl indeed. Kirie is another classmate of Umaru’s who although may look menacing to the people around her, she is actually shy. She admires Umaru greatly and treats Ebina as her affection rival. Sylphynford is also another classmate of Umaru who likes to compete with her, but in the end hangs out with her. All of these three actually have a nice development as they changed while being around Umaru for a while. It is really nice of how the story manages to give them some focus.For a slice of life, it is normal for the anime to look nice and pleasing. I mean, let’s be honest - looking at chibi Umaru is cute, despite how annoying she can get. Her character designs, both as normal and chibi, is nicely shown and cute as well. The other character designs are good-looking as well, and I really love the facial expressions the anime brings. The sceneries are good and I like to see how the references being placed as well.The opening song is so catchy and great to listen. I think it is a great way to bring the excitement of what the anime will show. A great cheerful song sung by Umaru’s voice actress Aimi Tanaka. The ending song, sung by the four voice actresses of the four girls in thr anime, has a different mood compared to the opening song - a much more light-hearted relaxing song to listen. The soundtrack is great to listen, a normal thing to say. The voice acting is done pretty well for the many voice actors/actresses who are relatively new to the voice acting scene. How they express their emotions to the characters is a job well done.All in all, Himouto! Umaru-chan is an enjoyable anime, one that struck out this season and one that can quite memorable for a long while. It is one great slice of life anime that not only shows the life of a two-sided person, but also around her peers with different thoughts too. It is one that also shows how we can be as similar as her when it comes to being alone watching anime, so some can pretty much relate to her. I personally would like a second season, but seeing that Dogakobo would never want to do a second season, the manga (and the OVA coming soon) is suffice for now.So, give it a try.

I found myself sometimes screaming at the screen because of some weird and stupid thing Umaru did, and you can bet, she does a lot of stupid things.The comedy is on point with all the characters and the anime and gaming references make up for some interesting details that, if you understand, will have you raising the corners of your mouth.Overall,...this anime is a comedy that will not leave you hanging.Also, my personal opinion, Kirie is best girl. this anime is a comedy that will not leave you hanging.Also, my personal opinion, Kirie is best girl.', 'Himouto Umaru-chan or My Two Faced Little Sister at first LA was irritated by this, but later on, like the title...LA began to see another ""face"" to this anime.By all means Himouto Umaru-chan is a slice of life comedy of a closeted otaku girl Umaru Doma voiced by \'\'Aimi Tanaka\'\' who orders her big brother Taihei Doma voiced by \'\'Kenji Nojima\'\' while doubling her life by having a perfect school life and really at first LA saw Umaru as an irritating obnoxious character due to her nature of being a lazy otaku and along with her treatment of her older brother got LA to label...her as an irritation, HOWEVER LA kinda warmed up to her and by extension this anime.The comedy really revolves around Umaru and what she can get away with her with laziness and it can be predictable at times, but sometimes the comedy shines out (along with the gaming and anime references makes it that much better) as well as bringing development to the main cast mainly through the character interactions and relationships but more importantly Taihei and Umaru\'s rocky yet ""Aww they really do like each other"" sibiling relationship (NOT incest, LA didn\'t mean it THAT way).In terms of characters, Taihei and Umaru gets the most focused in terms of their own individual and relationship development (and was because of this that LA warmed up to Umaru from being a ""irritating perfect brat to a fleshed out character who happens to laze around"" and LA will say that LA has done what Umaru done to so brings in some level of nostalgia and hypocrisy on LA\'s part), other characters such as Nana Ebina voiced by \'\'Akari Kageyama\'\' who is a friend of Umaru and downstairs neighbor of Taihei and Umaru and just happened to be LA\'s favourite character of the anime (odd since LA usually doesn\'t like Ebina\'s character archetype), Kirie Motoba voiced by \'\'Haruka Shirashi\'\' who is another friend of Umaru and Sylphinford Tachibana voiced by \'\'Yurina Furukawa\'\' the eccentric genki rival of Umaru all get their times in the limelight and interacting with Taihei and Umaru. Luckily LA thought that the cast outside of Taihei and Umaru would be stereotypical however they don\'t by the end of the anime, they too becomes fleshed out outside of their personality all through their interactions from Taihei and Umaru, best character example is Kirie as she was the extremely shy tsundere type but later on LA warmed up to her through Taihei and Umaru\'s interactions with her.If there was anything about this anime\'s concept LA would talk about is that it feels like a parody vers. of Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai just replace romance genre with comedy (Seriously, closeted otaku main female heroine who is nearly perfect at everything, a ""rival"" friend and the anime more or less showing that the siblings ""really are in good terms of each other by the end of it"").In terms of voice acting, Aimi Tanaka does a good job in voicing Umaru (both vers.) and although squeaky it\'s hardly annoying (though her tantrums kinda do), Akari Kageyama does a good job voicing Ebina only because she\'s voicing a shy silent type, though LA\'s favourite voice actor would actually have to go to eccentric genki Yurina Furukawa.In terms of animation done by Doga Kobo, the animation is detailed enough for a comedy anime as the backgrounding besides the references are decent enough but the nice touches on the gaming and anime references just that much better in a generalized way, where LA praises the animation is on the character designs on the cast, they are all distinct and noticeable (even the minor characters).Himouto Umaru-chan is a look at the extremely comedic vers. of both of ""perfect kid in a school"" and ""lazy otaku"" and trying to juggle them in the form of Umaru the abnormal one with Taihei being the resistant and the ""normal one"" but with comedy and slice of life elements placed in quite well.LA at first saw this anime as annoying at first all due to Umaru personality but with LA\'s hypocrisy through Umaru (""in some form"", LA isn\'t saying LA fully embodies her, but is some form as there are always people who want to be lazy just because) along with what made this anime get out of the ""anime with an annoying lead"" and show a bit more substance in the form of sibling bonds (and by extension giving Umaru a bit more of a personality other than being just lazy), character interactions from both the main and minor characters and the referential humor.LA does have one question about this anime though, the anime never addresses how Umaru\'s chibi vers. ""works"", LA only brings this up as the characters acknowledges Umaru\'s chibi vers. and some of the characters see her chibi vers. as a ""different character"" from Umaru\'s human form and the anime never addresses it.Himouto Umaru-chan is definitely a unique spin at looking at a girl with opposing double lives with lots of comedy, slice of life and gaming nostalgia and very much like this anime\'s title, it has two faces (Umaru\'s chibi and human form), if you look at only one side of face, it\'s either annoying and irritating or just funny and nostalgic but if you can look at both faces with some open arms then this anime can still be comedically enjoyable even with it\'s ""annoyances"" that will disappear before the halfway point and that\'s LA\'s opinion on Himouto Umaru-chan as a whole. her as an irritation, HOWEVER LA kinda warmed up to her and by extension this anime.The comedy really revolves around Umaru and what she can get away with her with laziness and it can be predictable at times, but sometimes the comedy shines out (along with the gaming and anime references makes it that much better) as well as bringing development to the main cast mainly through the character interactions and relationships but more importantly Taihei and Umaru\'s rocky yet ""Aww they really do like each other"" sibiling relationship (NOT incest, LA didn\'t mean it THAT way).In terms of characters, Taihei and Umaru gets the most focused in terms of their own individual and relationship development (and was because of this that LA warmed up to Umaru from being a ""irritating perfect brat to a fleshed out character who happens to laze around"" and LA will say that LA has done what Umaru done to so brings in some level of nostalgia and hypocrisy on LA\'s part), other characters such as Nana Ebina voiced by \'\'Akari Kageyama\'\' who is a friend of Umaru and downstairs neighbor of Taihei and Umaru and just happened to be LA\'s favourite character of the anime (odd since LA usually doesn\'t like Ebina\'s character archetype), Kirie Motoba voiced by \'\'Haruka Shirashi\'\' who is another friend of Umaru and Sylphinford Tachibana voiced by \'\'Yurina Furukawa\'\' the eccentric genki rival of Umaru all get their times in the limelight and interacting with Taihei and Umaru.

That\'s right. ""Mars of Destruction,"" ""Eiken,"" and ""Pupa,"" can safely be considered masterpieces compared to this cancerous monstrosity of an anime. Allow me to elaborate upon my position...I love slice of life anime, and have always been a big fan of series\' that deal with everyday people doing everyday things. The simplicity of a slice of life concept allows for us as viewers to relate to any given character, and really get to know them, since the entirety of a series hinges on them and...their life, without any specific overarching plot. Essentially, I love the character studies that are done in slice of life anime. We have the opportunity as viewers to participate in, and get to know a given character, or characters, who live lives much like ours, and can relate to us on various levels.""Himouto! Umaru-chan,"" falls into this descriptor I have laid out, and we do get to know our characters pretty well in their mundane, everyday lives. Umaru, the main character in this series, is a model student, gorgeous, and well loved by her classmates. By all conventional metrics, she is the epitome of a successful adolescent. She is responsible, diligent, respectful and sophisticated. Or so we think... Umaru has a well kept secret. When classes are over, and she returns home for the evening, she is a complete WEEB. She is an avid gamer, anime watcher, and junk food eater. As anime fans ourselves, this may seem like the dream sometimes, right? Umaru can definitely be relatable to us in terms of the interests she holds, and the enjoyment she derives from said interests.This is where my beef begins, and pretty much ends too. This is the entirety of the show. Umaru faking her school life, going home, and doing weeb stuff. That\'s it. As I mentioned previously in slice of life anime, I look to partake in a character study. I look to see the growth in a character as a series progresses. I look to the characters, because they define the story. If there is no character development, there is no story. This is where ""Himouto Umaru-chan,"" falls apart. As a character, Umaru is not only one dimensional, she is also incredibly annoying! Immature, bratty, spoiled and entitled, she embodies everything that is wrong with anime culture. There are frustrating and annoying characters in many series\' that I enjoy; however, these characters are often clearly defined, undergo changes, and move in a certain direction, for better or worse. They may be stagnant in their annoyance, but we can see many sides of them as a series progresses. This is not the case with Umaru. We are treated to the exact same character in every single episode. And being a show defined by the actions of its characters, we are by extension treated to the exact same episode, over and over and over again.I held on to hope in this series for so long. I waited earnestly for some type of character development or turning point. But alas, I waited in vain. There are moments where Umaru seems genuinely sympathetic, caring and vulnerable, especially when interacting with her older brother and guardian. These moments are her most interesting, as they show a side of her that seems more real, and deep. I don\'t mind that she does her weeb stuff, but I\'ve wanted to further get to know Umaru the person. We get to know Umaru\'s interests, Umaru\'s tantrums, Umaru\'s favorite snacks, but we never really know for sure just who Umaru is.This being said, I hate this anime. I can\'t stand Umaru, I can\'t stand her older brother that spoils her. I feel bad for Umaru\'s friend Ebina, and I can\'t stand Umaru\'s creepy video gamer friend. There is absolutely nothing to like here. Even the theme song is super annoying. Yep, this series just gets on my nerves. I don\'t recommend it to anyone.Final score-1 their life, without any specific overarching plot. Essentially, I love the character studies that are done in slice of life anime. We have the opportunity as viewers to participate in, and get to know a given character, or characters, who live lives much like ours, and can relate to us on various levels.""Himouto! Umaru-chan,"" falls into this descriptor I have laid out, and we do get to know our characters pretty well in their mundane, everyday lives. Umaru, the main character in this series, is a model student, gorgeous, and well loved by her classmates. By all conventional metrics, she is the epitome of a successful adolescent. She is responsible, diligent, respectful and sophisticated. Or so we think... Umaru has a well kept secret. When classes are over, and she returns home for the evening, she is a complete WEEB. She is an avid gamer, anime watcher, and junk food eater. As anime fans ourselves, this may seem like the dream sometimes, right? Umaru can definitely be relatable to us in terms of the interests she holds, and the enjoyment she derives from said interests.This is where my beef begins, and pretty much ends too.

I initially thought this premise was very limited in what can be done with it, but it worked out for 12 episodes. There were enough characters to provide many different situations for Umaru. What I found weird though, is how she seems to be able to actually transform. At least I have no...other explanation why nobody seems to be able to see those two are the same person.7/10Art:Well, there's nothing groundbreaking here. Basic solid comedy animation. I think the characters could have used a little more edge, but there's nothing missing in the animation department. Something I found really odd were the hamsters. Why do the look like.....that?7/10Sound:It's no breaking news the opening song is catchy as hell. As far as I understood the lyrics, it also serves as a great introduction into the show and the main character. The ending is okay. The voice acting was solid all throughout, though I have to say Kirie stood out. Aimi Tanaka also did pretty well with Umarus different voices.9/10Characters:After the first episode I was convinced I would hate the Doma siblings. But Umaru showed some more depth throughout the run of this anime and I came to actually like her. Her brother...well, he developed not so much, but I didn't turn out to hate him either. The side characters are a lot of fun, there is nobody I really disliked. Ebina however could have become annoying if the anime was longer, as she didn't seem to develop in any way.8/10Enjoyment:As I already implied, I enjoyed Himouto Umaru-chan more than I thought I would at first. Not all the short stories ignite, but it never really gets boring. However, if they plan to make a sequel to this anime, I sure hope there will be more development in the characters or the dynamics. For this first(?) season, I am satisfied with what I got.8/10Overall:7.8/10 other explanation why nobody seems to be able to see those two are the same person.7/10Art:Well, there's nothing groundbreaking here.

Truly, it may be one of my top 5 contenders for the Anime of the year for me. All that aside know one thing, even if you DESPISE ""Slice of Life"" esc Anime, you need to give this one a shot. Outwardly, Umaru Chan looks like another slice of life Anime, with a younger sister and an older brother going through their everyday life (running through the brothers point of view). Though in many ways this can be true, it is buffered by the fact that Umaru herself, is a Otaku/Gamer/Food Junkie and...childish in personality, in stark contrast to her school life, where she is know as one of the most beautiful girls around her high school, always gets great grades, and is just a genuinely nice person. Kind of like a lot of us, and the show (in a lot of ways other than what was just mentioned) is highly relate able, as a Gamer/Anime fan, though this leads me to my one gripe with the show as a whole...To put it out there, Umaru LOVES her home lifestyle. So much so, that she would rather lounge around play video games, and drink a lot, (and I mean a lot) of Cola, and not even bother to look outside or to go to the Beach, or really anything. And yet, she puts on a facade, this veil of ""Hey I am totally perfect and flawless, but that\'s all I am"". For example, one episode, Umaru decides to go to the arcade, but to do so, she disguises herself in a entirely new outfit, and takes on a much more quiet and quaint personality. WHY? Why does she feel that this NEEDS to be her persona? Is it because she wants to feel better about herself? It couldn\'t be, she doesn\'t need to. Maybe to hold a social image? But even that seems pointless, because she enjoys her lifestyle so much, that it really shouldn\'t bother her. As someone who used to have this problem, I used to think that I would be frowned upon for my interests, and looked at weird by my friends. But, even then, I just brought it up, and sure enough my friends were pleased to hear that I was enjoying myself, and many later started to enjoy the same things I did. To me, that doesn\'t seem too far fetched for Umaru and her friends, as her friends, really aren\'t exactly ""popular"" or perhaps better worded, Overfilling on the friends beverage. I can\'t imagine a even remote possibility were her friends would up and abandon her, especially for loving and appreciating her and her brother as much as they do. And on top of that, as an even bigger plot hole, why does she literally change the way her body looks? As of current, (and no, I haven\'t read the manga) there is no logical explanation as to why or how she morphs to her chibi form. And it is not just a viewer exclusive thing, the actual characters in the show can clearly tell that she is a small, and hyper girl, but cant ever tell that it is anything more than Umaru\'s little sister (A Cover Plan). Though I understand that the Manga may contain more detail as to why this occurs and who can see her like this, it is still no excuse to not include it in is\'s Anime adaption.All of that said, all of the problems with the shows story, are quite frankly, irrelevant. Shocking as it is, Umaru Chan is by far one of the best slice of life Anime to come out in a long, long time. Episode to episode, the show remains hilariously relate able and entertaining, while also taking us through the big times of the year, and various experiences, as slice of life Anime should. And for that, I can push aside MASSIVE gaping plot holes until the next season of Umaru comes (if or ever, which I REALLY hope it does). If you are looking for an Anime that can give you a intriguing and amazing story, you won\'t find it here for sure. However, if it is entertainment and overall charm in a easily digestible episodic style you seek, Umaru Chan is by far the best place to go. And my favorite part of the show, aside from the hilarity and shocking moments of reliability, is that AMAZING opening. For once, the studio knew they had a good opening, they stuck with it, and REALLY nailed it. The tones and lyrics express the Anime very well, and the hyper overall song, with a subtle drop in the middle really reflects Umarus personality. To be totally honest, Umaru Chan\'s opening has to be one of my absolute favorites, of all the Anime I have seen.Final thoughts/TLDR: Umaru Chan is a great Anime and succeeds at what a ""Slice of Life"" Anime should, and more. Though it has massive plot holes, it is still worth the watch, and will be a delight for any Gamer/Anime fan. childish in personality, in stark contrast to her school life, where she is know as one of the most beautiful girls around her high school, always gets great grades, and is just a genuinely nice person.

I will explain my statement in next paragraphs.The show is about an excellent and popular schoolgirl who behaves completely different when she returns home. She turns into a spoiled brat who does nothing but playing games, reading manga or watching anime. Her brother lives with her, despite being older and more responsible, he lets her do whatever she wants and fulfills her demands.I don\'t feel there is any story in the show, all...episodes follow this pattern: Umaru wants something (a game, magazine, etc) and annoys her brother to buy it for her, her brother refuses and she starts a mess, brother gives up after a while and says ""it cannot be helped"", so he buys her what she desires and that\'s the end. The show is centered on Umaru, all the characters and events develop around her and go in her favour, there is no feel of progress or story moving on, just Umaru using others to get what she wants and things go where they were at start of the episode.Art and sound are the only elements which weren\'t horrible, but they aren\'t much good either. Art is basic and nothing special, also sounds and music aren\'t memorable but not bad.The show lacks in character customization terribly. The protagonist is displayed as cute, while having nothing but bad traits: arrogance, manipulation, disrespect, childish behaviour, sloth, etc. Other characters are far more likable than her, some of them have quirky characteristics or seem nice people, but in the end no matter what they stand for, they just adapt to protagonist\'s desires like it doesn\'t contradict their morals. No matter how many times it seems there may be some progress when characters socialize, in the end Umaru jumps in and ruins the atmosphere, she is the main reason why this show is terrible. Question is why would anyone make a character like that and set it as a protagonist, also put in a show with no story at all...The only enjoyment I had was when some characters faced each other and there were few funny moments, until Umaru came and turned everything about herself. What is the purpose of the show? The protagonist was nothing but a nuisance which removed every element of comedy. The show would have a point if Umaru changed in the end, to realize her behaviour, but no, her brother and other characters let her use them to get what she wants. It is annoying to see someone making a fuss over a toy, especially when the other person is trying to get some sleep or returned after stressful day at work. It wasn\'t funny at all, I felt bad for her brother having to deal with her... I hoped he would teach her lessons how to become a responsible person, but no, he is a weak character who talks about responsibilities but lets her get away with anything she does to him. episodes follow this pattern: Umaru wants something (a game, magazine, etc) and annoys her brother to buy it for her, her brother refuses and she starts a mess, brother gives up after a while and says ""it cannot be helped"", so he buys her what she desires and that\'s the end.

This anime is a pretty standard comedy, not unlike Lucky Star, but all the same, I found it to be an enjoyable watch. This series, however, feels as if it needs to shove in ""character development"" and ""drama"", which feels out of place in this kind of show and is executed terribely. In these kinds of episodes, it feels like they are trying to be Welcome To The NHK, but it ends up feeling more like the ""dramatic"" episodes in Hetalia, which are also out of place. The only reason to watch...this show is to see the himouto version of Umaru be lazy, push her brother around, and make Kirie her servant. It just feels annoying when they try to push the whole ""she\'s living a double life, what will she do"" thing because it just never feels compelling and perfect Umaru\'s character is bland and unexciting. Nonetheless, I really liked the side characters in the show and there was ony one that I wasn\'t too fond of.  I thought Kirie\'s relationship with Umaru was interesting and funny, bringing an interesting dynamic to Umaru\'s ""himouto"" situation. Sylphyn, too, was enjoyable and felt like the only character to get any real development. Ebina, though, was a classic moe blob; she was forgetable, bothersome, and didn\'t add much to the show. The only thing I liked about her was her backstory about how she moved to Tokyo from Akita and she had to learn to talk like the people in Tokyo do and how she felt embarrassed about where she was from. Her accent sometimes came through when she was excited or eating familiar food, which was pretty cute. I would say that if you liked Lucky Star and are curious about the idea of a girl who acts perfect and public, but is a lazy, selfish shut-in when she comes home, then you might enjoy this anime. this show is to see the himouto version of Umaru be lazy, push her brother around, and make Kirie her servant.

Umaru-chan was different from what I expected and was strangely compelling.I don't think it's all my fault that I thought it was a purely comedy anime though, the first few episodes presented itself as such. Even though it's not purely comedy, it's still largely comedy so I guess the initial impression isn't too far off...However, occasionally, there were strangely realistic parts in between comedic segments. These mostly involve Umaru's brother, Taihei, and show what comes after graduating from school, juxtaposing that lifestyle against that of a student, albeit a lazy one. Maybe it hit closer to home for me but...at one particular part, I started thinking about my parents and what they might be feeling, coming home from a hard day at work to see their children playing games or lazing around in general. It was probably moments like these that compelled me to continue watching, I think.Other than that, I found that there weren't very many jokes and that a few of them take a long time to set up before getting to the punchline. For the first half of the season, anyway. Perhaps they weren't even meant to be funny and I missed the point. Maybe they were mostly character introduction and I hardly noticed. Good thing is, the anime got more interesting in the later half in terms of story (what little there is), character development and jokes.Here's a token mention of music and animation. They're both pretty okay, nothing stellar. I happened to notice, at one point, that one of the character's fingers were wrongly drawn but it wasn't obvious so it's fine. Music blends into the background as people talk and things happen.Overall, it wasn't much as a slice-of-life or comedy anime at first but a few glints of reality keeps it compelling. Some character development later also makes it interesting.7/10 at one particular part, I started thinking about my parents and what they might be feeling, coming home from a hard day at work to see their children playing games or lazing around in general.

I did my math homework in the background of this show, and when I finished that, I\'d do the math homework for the next night.

Umaru is literally Satan that's hiding in that damn hamster hood all day, parasitising on her older brother who does everything for her but never receives any praise or a single thanks from her.She's everything a normal person shouldn't be.I'm talking about the stuff she does aside from being a lazy good for nothing person,otaku or whatever it's called.I liked the anime,I...liked all of the cast except Umaru.Story: 5/10I haven't read the manga past the events that happened in the anime so I'll just review what the anime offered.The story is mediocre,a typical slice of life anime that shows us the shenanigans of Umaru and her brother/friends,while hiding her true Satan form in school and other public places.Art:6/10It has some charm,I liked it but I think it could've been better animated.Sound:8/10I think the sound was probably the best done thing in the anime,the voice acting was superb.Ebina's accent was well done and Umaru's tantrums did a good job since it made me want to punch her in the face with no remorse.Character: 6/10Not so much character development,in the last few episodes they did forshadow some things that are probably already answered in the manga.I'm sad that we hadn't the opportunity to see them in anime,so that's why my score isn't so great for it.Favorite female characters are Ebina and Sylphyn(Shupaaan!),Taihei was great,if i was in his shoes I would already commit murder.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed it a lot,all the gaming,anime and real life references made me chuckle.Street fighter,one piece,jojo,evangelion,hatsune mike,lots of japanese insider jokes etc. Himouto Umaru chan isnt a great anime,but is as hell enjoyable and I recommend it if you're into comical slice of life anime.Also if you're into the cute girls do cute stuff genre.Overall :7/10 liked all of the cast except Umaru.Story: 5/10I haven't read the manga past the events that happened in the anime so I'll just review what the anime offered.The story is mediocre,a typical slice of life anime that shows us the shenanigans of Umaru and her brother/friends,while hiding her true Satan form in school and other public places.Art:6/10It has some charm,I liked it but I think it could've been better animated.Sound:8/10I think the sound was probably the best done thing in the anime,the voice acting was superb.Ebina's accent was well done and Umaru's tantrums did a good job since it made me want to punch her in the face with no remorse.Character: 6/10Not so much character development,in the last few episodes they did forshadow some things that are probably already answered in the manga.I'm sad that we hadn't the opportunity to see them in anime,so that's why my score isn't so great for it.Favorite female characters are Ebina and Sylphyn(Shupaaan!),Taihei was great,if i was in his shoes I would already commit murder.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed it a lot,all the gaming,anime and real life references made me chuckle.Street fighter,one piece,jojo,evangelion,hatsune mike,lots of japanese insider jokes etc. Himouto Umaru chan isnt a great anime,but is as hell enjoyable and I recommend it if you're into comical slice of life anime.Also if you're into the cute girls do cute stuff genre.Overall :7/10"", 'I like to think i\'m open minded when I watch shows. And Slice of life for me is a hit or miss. So when I see shows such as this advertised I thought: ""neat""! Like Gudetama or Domo little mascots will always catch my attention. So I thought id give this a chance. Me and my sis watched all of this in one day and then turned to each other and started listing the different better ways we could have spent six hours. And it was definitely not watching this.The story is about Umaru-chan whose public life is her being a mary-sue. She literally is...the embodiment of perfection. Good grades, she\'s pretty, everyone loves her. But when she goes home she literally transforms into a gluttonous lazy brat. Who plays video games, eats junk food, and mooches off her guardian. And the rest is just her doing her thing.The music, let\'s just say I don\'t care for the opening theme. It\'s really annoying, like the first ten seconds made me want to turn the show off and listen to a choir of tone deff smokers. Its so annoying its so shrill, I was begging crunchy roll to suddenly add a skip intro feature but to no avail. Each time it came on just listening to the first five seconds while trying to grab the remote and fast forward put me in a bad mood. And the credit theme I had no words I just skipped to the next episode so I didn\'t have to listen to it.Then we have the animation which is typical. And doesn\'t really add anything. It looks and feels like any other slice of life. Even when Umaru is in her chibi form it looks bland. Her movements aren\'t fun, not stylized. Its basically a giant blob rolling around screaming. So it\'s less then average.Then we get to what\'s really terrible about this show. None of the characters offer anything. Her ""friends"" are basically moe teenage girl versions of the three stooges. Which actually sounds funny but they aren\'t. They just seem like one note body pillow cases and I\'m sure that\'s what they were made for. Umaru\'s brothers no better he\'s just your basic pushover that really needs a backbone but never gets one. Your suppose to feel bad for him...I guess. But he just sits there letting her get her way. I kept hoping he\'s going to crack and straight up tell her no and enforce it.....but he doesn\'t.And finally the worst part is our protagonist Umaru herself. God I wanted to smack her every second she was on screen. The embodiment of selfishness with no negative repercussions. She sits around all day playing video games and stuffing her face. And forcing her brother to basically bow to her every will. While keeping an amazing social status of no one finding out about her true self. She forces her brother to spend his hard earned money on crap for her that she ignores after a week. He even buys a car! A @#%$#%& CAR! And he just treats her like oh sister if your happy so am I. Her voice is basically that of a smug toddler. She plays games constantly yet doesn\'t know what a router is? There\'s literraly no negative repercussions for her actions. At least none that affect her directly. She\'s an all around unpleasant character.Now the thing is, you can write a charecter like this, but you need to do at least one of two things. 1. They need to be likable. Give them a fun personallity. Make them appeal to the audience, not ignore them. 2. Make them suffer. If they dont suffer for their mistakes they dont appear human, and thus arent likable. If she\'d too much of a mary sue, yet has no humanity...,she\'d boring and in return unlikable.So its really not my cup of tea. So if you ask me give this one a pass. the embodiment of perfection.

What can be said about her besides the fact she\'s a horrid creature? Honestly not much. She\'s a self centered child who tortures her brother with her constant screeching because she doesn\'t get her way like a child throwing a...fit over being told the word ""no"".I had hoped her brother would be somewhat better and not enable the little demon by rewarding her for throwing a screeching tantrum like a child throwing themselves on the floor at a Walmart for not getting a toy they want, but alas my wish was not to be. He has no backbone and just gives in to the little monster like the bitch enabler he is and continues to reward the entitled little hellspawn.There\'s nothing to say about the rest of the cast because frankly I don\'t care they\'re all bland.If you have absolutely nothing else to watch...look again I can promise you\'ll find something much more deserving of your time. I just have nothing good i can say about this show. Respect yourself more and find something that is worthy of your time. fit over being told the word ""no"".I had hoped her brother would be somewhat better and not enable the little demon by rewarding her for throwing a screeching tantrum like a child throwing themselves on the floor at a Walmart for not getting a toy they want, but alas my wish was not to be.

If I believed in god before watching this steaming shit pile, this would convince me that God died long ago. I'd rather watch Berserk 2016 and 17 on loop. I literally could not stomach watching the entire anime, it's not even entertaining with how bad it is, it's just grating on the soul.If this anime was never produced I know that we'd be closer to world peace, but the cosmic fucking disturbance that was created by Umaru crawling out of the deepest pits of hell...is really hampering that.Please spare your sanity and never watch this damned show lest you actually go hollow. I legitimately despise this anime with all my being. is really hampering that.Please spare your sanity and never watch this damned show lest you actually go hollow. I legitimately despise this anime with all my being."", ""Review originally written in 2017.Himouto! Umaru-chan is an anime that explores the amusing yet relatable concept of leading two contrasting lives. Initially, I found it easy to connect with Umaru, the main character. But, my enthusiasm shrunk exponentially as I realized her character development would remain stagnant throughout the entire anime.The anime tries, and fails, to explore the idea that all people have different sides to our personalities. Unfortunately, this theme takes a backseat to “comedy.” If you find watching a girl repeatedly teasing her kind-hearted brother entertaining, you might enjoy Umaru's antics. If this premise doesn't sound very funny to you, chances are you'll...get very bored of it very quickly. Just like I did.My main issue with this show is repetitiveness. Seeing Umaru bother her brother without consequences becomes tiresome after a while. The lack of growth and learning from mistakes hampers character development and prevents the show from reaching its full potential. The comedy mostly revolves around Umaru's quirky transformation into a mischievous gremlin whenever she's away from others. However, without Umaru's presence, the show fails to deliver laughs. Despite receiving more screen time than anyone else, she falls flat, along with the rest of the cast.While the characters are pretty badly-written, the anime’s art brings them to life a little bit. The art style is simple, portraying typical suburban environments found in slice-of-life anime. Although the characters lack originality, their expressive behavior compensates for it. In her gremlin form, Umaru's playful antics remind you of a cat, making you want to sit on the couch with a refreshing soda while relaxing. Sometimes, Umaru’s brother’s character design flips to something out of Ace Attorney or Kaiji. It is creative, but does not always match his personality and comes off as pandering.The music in Himouto! Umaru-chan is forgettable, adding nothing to the overall experience. While some catchy tracks accompany humorous scenes, none stand out as exceptional. Personally, I found the opening theme loud, brash, and obnoxious, which aligns well with Umaru's character. Which is why I always skipped it.The anime relies heavily on forgettable jokes that persist throughout, and I highly doubt the sequel will offer anything different. Umaru's humor is like the Minions from Despicable Me—contextually thin but filled with obnoxious noises and mannerisms. Although the writing and comedy in Himouto! Umaru-chan left much to be desired, I don't consider my time watching it a complete waste. Everyone's experience may vary depending on how much they identify with Umaru, which can significantly impact their enjoyment of the series. get very bored of it very quickly.

If you like that kind of show I would also recommend non non biyori (which is leagues above this one in my opinion). I had a great time watching this show, but it is really just something to watch To fill up time. Also, I'm disappointed in the ending. I can't really say why because it would spoil it, but don't take me saying that as a reason you shouldn't watch the show (because you should). I also watched the second season and liked it, basically if you liked the first season you...will like the second, and if you didn't you wont. will like the second, and if you didn't you wont."", 'This is a very valuable anime for me, made me smile every episode, and it was also more than just a comedy.The Intro is awesome. I am holding myself to not get up and dance while watching the intro.First, I don\'t only like it because it\'s a ""slice of life"" anime. I usually don\'t watch an anime because of the topic or type. I watch them because of the characters and their personalities. (if I like them or match with the people I know).And Umaru is a wonderful character. Her cute angry moments, her smug grin and her little moments that she changes her...mind or does something by thinking her friends, basically her whole personality is 10/10. And all of her personality fits with her childhood. That\'s awesome. She is the only character that makes that anime valuable.BUT, she is not a character that everybody would like. I know exactly the people who would hate it. And I know exactly the people who would love it. She is a type of character that you would like or hate. So this is a type of anime you would like or hate.The other characters are fine. I can match them with the people I know from real life. And they are just acting their personalities. So, didn\'t see anything wrong with them. Especially Ebina, all of her lines and acts are matching with her history and personality.Overall, characters are very realistic I can match their lines and acts with real-life situations. And they are very lovely.For me, art and drawings in anime are about feelings. Anime is about feelings for me. Others just a normal film or series that is drawing in an anime like style. Anime different because you can see the feelings in that art. You can match a feeling of a character with a memory of a feeling that you had before.A very simple example is when a character lays down to bed after a very long day, you can match that character with yourself. In real-life maybe you didn\'t look like that but it was the exact feeling you felt before.There was nothing wrong with that in the anime. The art perfect in its ""own style"".Talking about the story is tricky because there is no an obvious story.It\'s a slice of life and daily life anime. The thing makes it loveable is the characters. But the story part was very rich too in its own style. Umaru\'s childhood, Ebina\'s history, Taihei and Umaru\'s childhood memories. There are many little lovely moments in their life. Just like real-life. It was good for how it suppose to be. I really wanted to see Alex Sylphinford and Umaru together but It didn\'t happen ^^Of course, there are many Master-Piece anime better than this little Daily life anime. But It was a Master-Piece in its own type.It\'s my 2nd favorite slice of life anime. Simple(?), lovely and funny.So overall it was perfect for me. Every little moment, every little reference, every little part that I found in my life.  It was perfect to watch it. Also, she reminds me someone that I know. mind or does something by thinking her friends, basically her whole personality is 10/10. And all of her personality fits with her childhood.

I tried to avoid this series, since nothing about it looked like it'd be appealing to me, but caved in and made stomached the entire series in a night. In a nutshell, I'd advise to just stay away from it altogether! I didn't hate the show as much as I thought, and at times I actually had fun with it, but I expected to give this a 0, so being slightly better than garbage doesn't warrant a positive recommendation. This is my first...review and I don't really have a solid paragraph structure, but I felt I had a responsibility to warn people of this abomination and avoid this trap of an anime!Positives:The OP is probably the sole reason I kept coming back for more punishment; it's just so damn catchyEvery once in a while I'd have a laugh.It was cute for a moment.Clever metaphor, I think, of the ugly appearance representing her inner beauty.Will make you laugh from time to timeNegatives:The soundtrack, outside of the OP, is one of the worst I've ever heard.The plot was non-existent, so don't expect any kind of compelling story here.After recycling the same joke over and over again, the series fails spectacularly in recapturing any kind of fun that may have been present in the beginning, making the series sort of drag on.The supporting cast is a collection of your typical, generic moe tropes with the added bonuses of being boring, one dimension, and generally unlikeable.Umaru-chan herself, the short version, is just a complete piece of shit!For one thing, it's literally impossible to live the lifestyle she live; eating all junk food without getting fat, straight As without ever having to study, being awesome at sports without exercise, etc.If being unrealistic wasn't enough, she's also a total degenerate, showcasing arguably the shittiest personality in a human being. She's a manipulative, lazy, self-entitled, selfish, spoiled bitch.Unrelatable and unlikeable, she's just every weeb's ultimate fantasy of being awesome at literally everything and having the world dote on them.The final episode made me wish I never started watching this nonsense. After hinting some sort of growth from the protagonist in a few eps prior, the show ends with her reverting to the same personality as the beginning. I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up thinking there would be some sort of payoff for sitting through this, but the finale was pretty much a huge slap in the face to its audience and I'm sure I've lost some IQ points by episode 12.Overall:There are some things to like here, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it to some extent.If you want to shut your brain off, like all the way off, then sure why not go ahead and watch it, you might like it too.However, objectively speaking, this is one of the worst shows to ever come out.Personally I found some enjoyment in this, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to overlook the sea of flaws that this series is very obviously suffering from.Ultimately, this series is just a huge waste of time.Avoid this trap!You've been warned review and I don't really have a solid paragraph structure, but I felt I had a responsibility to warn people of this abomination and avoid this trap of an anime!Positives:The OP is probably the sole reason I kept coming back for more punishment; it's just so damn catchyEvery once in a while I'd have a laugh.It was cute for a moment.Clever metaphor, I think, of the ugly appearance representing her inner beauty.Will make you laugh from time to timeNegatives:The soundtrack, outside of the OP, is one of the worst I've ever heard.The plot was non-existent, so don't expect any kind of compelling story here.After recycling the same joke over and over again, the series fails spectacularly in recapturing any kind of fun that may have been present in the beginning, making the series sort of drag on.The supporting cast is a collection of your typical, generic moe tropes with the added bonuses of being boring, one dimension, and generally unlikeable.Umaru-chan herself, the short version, is just a complete piece of shit!For one thing, it's literally impossible to live the lifestyle she live; eating all junk food without getting fat, straight As without ever having to study, being awesome at sports without exercise, etc.If being unrealistic wasn't enough, she's also a total degenerate, showcasing arguably the shittiest personality in a human being.

Himouto! Umaru-chan engages viewers in a cutesy, feel-good, sometimes repetitive series that brings some new ideas to the field of Slice of Life anime.Story (read the synopsis first!)The show is episodic in nature, focusing on isolated events occurring between Umaru and either her brother, her friends, or herself. Some portions follow Taihei instead, as he could be considered the deuteragonist. Examples of events include Umaru\'s competition at a fighting game tournament, deciding the best snack food complements, and eating out at a ramen...shop. Most are cute and fun in their own way, though some events such as her wanting her brother to buy something or begging for ""hamburg steak"" at dinner repeat themselves often. The best scenes are the ones where she individually hangs out with her brother or friends, making us privy to the two (or three) individuals\' growing bond. Some of the supporting characters also have their own scenes, such as Kirie\'s conflicts with her brother, Bomber.Himouto! succeeds at getting the viewer initially invested through the concept of a ""inwardly flawed yet outwardly perfect"" character. Umaru-chan is cute as hell, no denying that, easily being the selling point of the series. If you like watching cute things, Himouto! is great for that. Male audiences are attracted through Umaru\'s tomboyish like interests in action manga and video games, while females are attracted through normal Umaru\'s feminine presentation out in public. Unfortunately, for myself and any other males invested in the series, the feminine portion seems to overtake the tone. While that\'s great for the other demographic, as this is a series that was intended to be a seinen, a lot of the value dropped off because of the cultural disconnect. I\'m sure everyone, however, can relate with the idea of having two separate selves, one you show in public and the other,  more legitimate one you let loose at home.Genre and CharacteristicsSlice of Life animes follow the life of a specific character and his or her friends or family. Himouto! is no different from this regard, though main character Umaru\'s life stands out as being one focused on lazing around or being irresponsible. How you feel about Slice of Life anime in general will likely be analogous to your enjoyment of this series.The biggest issue of the story comes in its redundant patterns. A lot of the charm of the original concept wears off around the midway point of the series as you find the same actions and themes repeating themselves with little to no change in presentation. This, unfortunately, is a flaw that is what holds most Slice of Life animes from reaching that ""great"" or ""fantastic"" tier, often greatly hindering any potential re-watch value as well.Modern references dominate much of Himouto!, as Umaru is meant to mimic a particular entertainment consuming demographic in it being a seinen. She reads manga (inspired by Shounen Jump\'s One Piece), watches anime, plays games (modeled after JRPGs or MMOs), and eats junk food (notably potato chips and ""cola!""). I found these references to be pretty endearing and enjoyed their presence, as it inspires the show with a bit of real world familiarity.AnimationHimouto! was fairly aesthetically pleasing, presenting itself with warm, bright colors and decent facial animation. If you like orange, you\'re in luck. Also, the visual effects used, often to accompany whichever Umaru we were currently experiencing, did much to convey the differences between the two. The fantasy like situations including a particular Game of Life scenario (ep. 6) and the assault upon the RNA viruses (ep. 10) were well designed and creative in their execution.Atmospherically, I felt the animation did shine at certain points. Taihei\'s wandering (ep. 7) through a residential area was particularly beautiful, showcasing a beautiful orange hue and blazing sunset up above. The rain scene (ep. 11) also displayed a gorgeous use of water, both visually and aurally, creating for the peaceful, pre- and post-rain atmosphere that Taihei was supporting. Unfortunately, these moments were fleeting, but still worth noting. Strangely enough, they both involved Taihei as well, hmm...With that said, however, compared to other Slice of Life series such as Nichijou, the animation wasn\'t particularly unique or outstanding in its stylistic design. Great but nothing special would likely be the best explanation for what to expect visually.SoundI was quite content with the voice acting. Each voice fit the personality of their respective characters well, particularly Sylphinford Tachibana\'s confident gait and Ebina Nana\'s dialectal murmur. There\'s also a surprising variety of ways I learned you can say ""onii-chan"", thanks to Aimi Tanaka\'s (Umaru-chan) considerable use of the word.The music found in the series is fairly average. Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding. At times, the main track can get a bit repetitive, much like the show does itself. Slice of Life animes are rarely ever known for their soundtracks, so I do not consider this as much of a detriment as I would for a series of greater depth.I\'m a fan of the OP for the series, especially knowing that it was voiced by the main character\'s voice actress. Visually, it\'s well done, and represents the energetic, back-and-forth spirit of the show. The ED is alright, much more muted and feminine in nature, likely to mimic Umaru\'s outside form more than her couch potato evolution.CharactersUmaru is the main focus of the series in almost all respects. She\'s fairly likable, relatable to some people, but at times you find yourself getting bored with her. She never really evolves as a character, always swapping between the kind Umaru and devilish Umaru-chan, though it would be unfair to say she\'s particularly flat. Taihei, at times, allows her to realize that her overall lazy demeanor creates an unnecessary stress on her caring brother, which does indicate some sort of personal growth. Largely, though, the same Umaru-chan we have in episode one is the same at the end of episode twelve, and it\'s debatable whether or not that\'s okay, even in a Slice of Life series.Taihei Doma is almost as featured as little sister Umaru is. A salaryman with an responsible spirit, Taihei takes care of Umaru in the absence of her parents. What struck me as as odd was, despite the show being heavily centered around Umaru herself, I found Taihei to be the most likeable and realistic character of the bunch. He has his flaws, as shown in his inability to scold Umaru or social inadequacies and anxiety, but overall he comes off as strong enough to be that stable deuteragonist that the series needed.Umaru\'s friends in big-breasted, shy Ebina Nana, reserved, loyal Kirie Motoba, and energetic, competitive Sylphinford Tachibana are okay. I liked them without a doubt, but despite their individual quirks and ""backstories"", all of them serve to exist seemingly only for Umaru\'s sake. Rather than be developed into interesting and unique characters, which could have been achieved when considering what history of them we\'ve witnessed, they\'re more caricatures of certain personality traits (shyness - Ebina, anxiety - Kirie, competitiveness - Sylphinford) set to revolve around Umaru rather than enrich her.Taihei\'s friends in Bomber (Kirie\'s brother), Alex (Sylphinford\'s brother), and Kanau are given even less screentime despite having strong potential for development as well.If Himouto! Umaru-chan zoomed out a little from Umaru and focused on the rest of the characters a little more, it\'d have been a much more enjoyable series without losing much emphasis on Umaru herself.ConclusionIn my opinion, Himouto! does exist in the better half of the Slice of Life animes, though in a genre where ""average"" dominates the majority, it\'s hard judge the impact of such a placement. It\'s a dreadfully cute series with some high moments, but sadly one that doesn\'t have much sticking power. If you do decide to give it a try, be sure to get your snacks and cola ready.

Something happens, it doesn\'t really matter in the grand scheme of things, reset. Some people like this kind of thing. I usually don\'t like them. This one grabbed my attention enough that i thought it would be good, but the story had little depth to it. Well, its a slice of life, so story isn\'t a big factor. I only gave it a 4 because the setup was good and a bit original.Art: 8Probably the...best, and maybe only good thing, about the show. The scenes are pretty, and look nice.  The Its detailed, very well done. I have to at least give credit to the animators for a job well done.Sound: 6I personally didn\'t like the OP. It wasn\'t my style, so i often skipped it. Overall, though, the music did set the tone well, and always matched the mood.  It was pretty average, not much to say.Character: 3Now here is the thing that really makes me dislike this show. The characters don\'t develop at all. From beginning to end, they stay the same. No One character, Kirie, has very slight development, but its hard to notice as the whole change starts and finishes in one episode, like the first or second episode she is in. None of them have any motivations ether. Even the main character, Umaru, has no motivations whatsoever. Yes, she likes to watch anime and that is her thing. But why does she try to be so perfect at school? She has no reason. She is fine with being a slob in front of her brother, but at school? No. She doesn\'t even have that many friends, just one. Two by the end of the show (unless you count Sylphy, but she acts like more of a rival and only shows up in like, 1/3 of the episodes after she is introduced, which is the second episode). The show ends returning to the status quo. Umaru doesn\'t become nicer to her brother (even though several episodes make it seem like she wants to be). No one finds out about her secret (they basically use it as a joke that everyone is an idiot and doesn\'t notice), and she never ever gives us a reason to pretend she is a perfect girl at school.Enjoyment: 4It was somewhat enjoyable. Except for all the moments Umaru acts like and asshole and never has to answer for her actions, which happens about a million times an episode. Nothing more to say here.Overall: 4This show, really, is not a good show. If you are a shut in, and have no friends, you might like it because it lets you fantasize about what it would be like if you had friends who weren\'t also shut-ins like you. Maybe the reason i don\'t like it is because i\'m not in that situation. But being unbiased, this show has nothing to go on. Compared to other slice of lifes i have watched, it is worse than some but not the worst, and nowhere near good. I would suggest staying away from this if you like story, closer, and characters that have to deal with the consequences of their actions. If you like shows for having tons of overly endowed women, a bunch of ""plot"", and all the fanservice you can imagine, possibly wrapped up with an unintelligent MC who gets into bad misunderstandings and gets slapped, i would also recommend staying away because it doesn\'t even have that.

Umaru-chan ReviewOut of all the new things that came out of this summer anime season (2015) I must say; Himouto! Umaru-chan was probably my favorite. It earned that title certainly not out of awe inspiring animation, gut-busting comedic value or deep and concise storytelling, but from relate-able characters with relate-able anxieties, the light-hearted misadventures of which they bond over and the steady stream of otaku culture references that make me smile and think “I get that”. But before I get into any of that, just let me say this: Kirie is best girl.I mean, it’s pretty obvious. She...gets anxious around others and becomes even more nervous when approaching them, unconsciously making glares which then turn away most of the people she so desperately wants to connect with. With all her quirks and mannerisms, she’s easily the most endearing character in my mind. That being said, the other girls aren’t too far behind her. Sylphyn has a funny name and an even funnier personality. She’s very over the top and just wants to the very best at everything, like no one ever was. Ebina’s very shy and self-conscious, and has really big boobs. It’s pretty funny how they use this character trait of hers. Instead of making her just some underage sex object, they use her endowment as a reason for her crush on Umaru’s brother, the only guy who doesn’t seem to notice her huge bazongas. Some might argue this as just stupid while others may considered it brilliant. I myself would side with the latter. Anyway, Umaru’s brother is the nice guy who just wants what’s best for his himouto. Then there’s Umaru: The conniving, garbage food loving, two-faced otaku/perfect girl that this showed is named after. She’s fun and gets everything she wants, even if it takes childish, underhanded tactics to achieve those things. You know, pretending to cry to make her brother feel bad and stuff like that. She uses a perfect façade to cover up the coked up, garbage eating monster that dwells beneath the hamster hood (and when I say “coked up”, I am referring to the cola). But beneath that is a person who legitimately cares about her friends and is capable of selfless acts of kindness every once and a while.So yeah, the characters are well conceived. How do I move on from here? There’s, like, no transition here. Which kinda reminds me of how Himouto! Umaru-chan handles transitions. It doesn’t. Just like other typical comedy shows, Himouto! Umaru-chan moves from one misadventure to the next. Which is okay, but the show does miss one thing when doing this. Resolutions. And I’m not talking about one thousand and eighty pixels. I’m talking about a punch line or a lesson to be learned, something to leave me with before we move on to the next thing. Sometimes the show does, but most often it just presents itself as “So that happened. Moving on”. In that respect, I felt the writing could have been done a better job in making every moment count and leaving me laughing. But other than that, I felt the show did a fine job at slowly, but surely, developing Umaru into a decent human being.I’m a self-proclaimed “decent human being” and I know that we “decent human beings” like pop culture references. They make us feel all nice and smart when we understand them, and we can just shrug them off or google it if we don’t. Basically what I’m trying to say is: Himouto! Umaru-chan has pop culture references. Pop culture references are good. At least, I think so. Actually, what this show has is an abundant amount of otaku culture references (which some might argue is the popular culture, at least in Japan). The opening alone has parodies of Pokémon, Mario Kart and Monster Hunter. Those are things I understand, and I like that.One thing I didn’t like about the show was the animation. Well, it’s not that I “didn’t like it”, per say, it’s just that it was pretty basic. It had some creative choices here and there, like when Umaru went first person mode for a brief period in one scene, but other than that it was just alright. Which is okay, because they’ll probably double down on the second season that I hope will come. gets anxious around others and becomes even more nervous when approaching them, unconsciously making glares which then turn away most of the people she so desperately wants to connect with. With all her quirks and mannerisms, she’s easily the most endearing character in my mind. That being said, the other girls aren’t too far behind her. Sylphyn has a funny name and an even funnier personality. She’s very over the top and just wants to the very best at everything, like no one ever was. Ebina’s very shy and self-conscious, and has really big boobs. It’s pretty funny how they use this character trait of hers. Instead of making her just some underage sex object, they use her endowment as a reason for her crush on Umaru’s brother, the only guy who doesn’t seem to notice her huge bazongas. Some might argue this as just stupid while others may considered it brilliant. I myself would side with the latter. Anyway, Umaru’s brother is the nice guy who just wants what’s best for his himouto. Then there’s Umaru: The conniving, garbage food loving, two-faced otaku/perfect girl that this showed is named after. She’s fun and gets everything she wants, even if it takes childish, underhanded tactics to achieve those things. You know, pretending to cry to make her brother feel bad and stuff like that. She uses a perfect façade to cover up the coked up, garbage eating monster that dwells beneath the hamster hood (and when I say “coked up”, I am referring to the cola). But beneath that is a person who legitimately cares about her friends and is capable of selfless acts of kindness every once and a while.So yeah, the characters are well conceived. How do I move on from here? There’s, like, no transition here. Which kinda reminds me of how Himouto! Umaru-chan handles transitions. It doesn’t. Just like other typical comedy shows, Himouto! Umaru-chan moves from one misadventure to the next. Which is okay, but the show does miss one thing when doing this. Resolutions. And I’m not talking about one thousand and eighty pixels. I’m talking about a punch line or a lesson to be learned, something to leave me with before we move on to the next thing. Sometimes the show does, but most often it just presents itself as “So that happened. Moving on”. In that respect, I felt the writing could have been done a better job in making every moment count and leaving me laughing. But other than that, I felt the show did a fine job at slowly, but surely, developing Umaru into a decent human being.I’m a self-proclaimed “decent human being” and I know that we “decent human beings” like pop culture references. They make us feel all nice and smart when we understand them, and we can just shrug them off or google it if we don’t. Basically what I’m trying to say is: Himouto!

So was it?STORYThe story is rather simple. Umaru moves in with her brother, and she is a secret otaku. Although that...is the overall story, each episode is split into several different mini-stories that usually contain many laughs and parodies of Japanese culture. Speaking of parodies, there are a lot and you may come across many parodies throughout your time watching this anime. One parody that many people might not catch is that the famous Japanese department store Aeon is named Nyaon. Nya is the sound a cat makes in the Japanese language. Besides these things, don't expect to have a full blown story with plot elements. The parodies are what makes this show so great and I think many people will like The Grudge parody.ANIMATIONThe animation is typical of any shoujo anime, so don't expect any awesome cgi. I will say that I love how the characters are dressed and drawn and it really fits there personality. Whether Umaru is wearing her hamster hooded coat or her cute attire, it is fun to see how cute she really is. That brings up another good point. In my humble opinion, the Japanese have some bad fashion taste that I have seen so to see these anime characters dressed so nicely, it was another one of those special treats.SOUNDLet me start off by saying that the opening and ending theme songs are really great and whenever I think of Himouto! Umaru-chan anime, those are the first sounds to pop in my head. The OST is not that bad either, but don't expect a Clannad OST here. It's just your typical shoujo anime OST, except slightly better.CharactersThere are five main characters: Umaru (indoor and outdoor mode), Ebina-chan, Umaru's brother, Kirie-chan, and Tachibana. Each character has his or her own personality that I think people will rather adore. Some anime fans I know or at an impasse when it comes to Umaru. Some think she is selfish and stuck-up while others don't care and say it's part of the show. I, for one, like both personalities that Umaru presents to the anime. I, like everyone else, wish that her brother would put his foot down sometimes, though.VERDICT/ENJOYMENTI thoroughly enjoyed Himouto! Umaru-chan and think that fans of comedy or the shoujo genre will like this anime too. My only real complaint is that I wish we would have seen more of Umaru's outside mode more because she is so freaking cute. Also, I think that we didn't get to see enough of Ebina-chan and Kirie-chan.

This anime has one thing pinned down right, and that's the killer opening. Himouto! Umaru-chan is sort of, kind of, like Watamote... The watered-down version at least. To be fair it's original in it's own way: Umaru is a hardcore otaku who also happens to be the hottest girl in your close parameter... And of course she tries her best to hide her geekiness behind a facade of cuteness and kindness. For me this was the first time watching something the like so, yeah, it was pretty enjoyable to an extent.Now, that was the good stuff. The bad stuff is that...the animation is mediocre, character development is more or less zero, the fan service got on my nerves from time to time, and I hardly felt any attachment to Umaru, her brother, or their friends. Her pet hamsters were pretty rad tho. Rock on pet hamsters.If you're looking for something light and non-committing give it a try, although the banality of it all might make you feel discouraged and drop it mid-way, especially with all the 'higher quality' anime circulating around.Too much Moe is what I say. the animation is mediocre, character development is more or less zero, the fan service got on my nerves from time to time, and I hardly felt any attachment to Umaru, her brother, or their friends.

Absolutely anything, you name it. In this case we\'re not talking about the intense ""this is messed up"" kind of stuff. No, no, we\'re talking about a split personality or two-faced. Welcome to Himotou! Umaru-chan (My two-faced little sister). Now, heres what I know. You usually get the \'geek/nerd\' (otaku) and the popular ""perfect"" people. However, in this case we see a popular, beautiful, perfect girl who is also an otaku. Welcome to Umaru-chan\'s life, a perfect girl who eats chips and does nothing but watch anime, play games and read manga all day, while having her handy older brother...to do everything for her. The thing is, outside, nobody knows that she\'s a hardcore otaku, in fact, she keeps it a secret from everyone apart from her brother of courseCharacters:Doma, Umaru (Umaru-chan) - The most perfect girl in every single way. In looks and personality. Whilst Umaru is outside of her home, we see her as the perfect girl she pretends to be. Everyone will stop and admire her stunning appearance as she walks by keeping her otaku self inside. On the outside, we only see Umaru hang out one friend. Well, for the first 4 episodes or so. Her friend is called Ebina, nana, and not even she knows what her friend really is. You might ask yourself, why? why does she want to hide the fact that she\'s an otaku?. Well, that\'s because being an otaku is not a good thing to be, I know a few people who thought it was but it really isn\'t, especially in Japan. You see it a lot of times in an anime where some of the characters deny being an otaku. When we see Umaru in her home, she changes into a chibi looking character with an extremely cute character type. She has huge tantrums at her older brother for simple things like, not buying her potato chips, cola, and in one episode, over manga.Ebina, Nana - Ah yes, another beloved character which you just can not hate one single bit. Ebina is of course Umaru-chans best friend. She\'s friendly, shy, cute as hell and self-conscious but just a delight to be around. She came from a different part of Japan therefore has a different dialect, she gets very scared of letting it out, and that\'s another thing that makes her adorable. Surprisingly enough, even though she lives in the same apartment block as Umaru and her brother she has no idea about her secret.Doma, Taihei - Now, I don\'t know about you but...I was just begging for Taihei to notice how much Ebina-chan likes him. Even though she didn\'t say anything. Taihei is Umaru-chans older brother. He had already graduated school and is now working and taking care of his little sister. We get to see a little bit of his school life and friends in some parts of the episodes which I think was an amazing touch. He\'s a pretty simple guy and laid-back, but I wish he could find some kind of hobby just to make his character a little more interesting..:May contain spoilers:.Kirie, Motoba - Last, but not least, we have Kirei. The first person to see Umaru-chan in her otaku chibi form. This character, in most scenes looks like a scary stalker, which she is a little. She is always caught staring at the outside Umaru-chan. But one day she happens to see her inner self when she goes over to her house. Of course Umaru falls into a panic and decides to call herself Umaru-chans little sister. So then, without knowing that this is the real Umaru-chan, Kirie falls in love with this small adorable otaku person. She happens to disliked Ebina-chan a lot as she sees her as a rival because Kirie admires the perfect side of Umaru-chan. She will never know that she has such a strong relationship with her, its a pity.Overall:Enjoyment - I think that this is a very enjoyable slice of life anime. They had taken a what could have been relatable character and turned it into something else which was more fun. The comedy is pretty good too, it throws in a few laughs.

Himouto is that part of us was invited to a party ,prefers to stay in home but goes to the party anyway. the week, so yes it is more than worth to watch this anime.

Hai!That was the intro of the opening Kakushin Teki Metamaruphose. Oh I have just shrunk in size. Wait a second let me transform back into the original me.Okay here we go. Let's not beat around the bush. Summer 2015 has been a rough season lately. Normally, Winter seasons and Summer seasons are always rough seasons for anime.STORY (6):The story follows Umaru with her brother Taihei who attend high school. Normally when Umaru goes home, she transformers to become a tiny person. Umaru is basically like Ant-man who transforms into a tiny...person. However, this is not an action anime. This is a romantic comedy anime.I would say that I did enjoy some parts while others not so much. I did like the way how Taihei tried to be a good brother to Umaru and take good care of her. I also find the final episode when they get a car, it made me chuckle.There were parts I thought that they could explore more on like why Umaru whenever she is indoors, she becomes tiny.ART (7):The animation was good. Some subtle lip movements between the characters.SOUND (7):I did love the opening and ending song. The ending song is relaxing and I hope that I can listen to it day by day.CHARACTER (6):Every seiyuu did their best in their roles given. Especially Kirie Motoba who has frightening eyes just like Okapa from Plastic Nee-san. She is by far one of the most entertaining person in this anime.Umaru when she is tiny, she is adorable and her voice had some charm in her. She also did her role well. Although at times, I find her quite annoying.The brother Taihei was the most bland character, he was not charming or funny in anyway. He is just stoic. Although I did appreciate how Taihei was understanding towards Umaru.Nana & Tachibana both didn't stood out to me in my opinion. But I did appreciate their character development with Umaru. However, to me they are bland as individuals.I also did like Sylphyn the character who opens up with Umaru in the future episodes even though they were rivals. However, her character was close to being an interesting character desu wa.CONCLUSION (6):If you want a light-hearted comedy and just an anime to relax and have fun with, I would say give this anime a watch.Although this anime didn't surprise me on how good this anime is and that there are more boring moments, I did appreciate a few moments and friendship moments.  And for that I give this anime a 6 out of 10. person. However, this is not an action anime. This is a romantic comedy anime.I would say that I did enjoy some parts while others not so much.

Being a perfect girl while also being an otaku is something people like to see. The same way people like Kirito being an invincible badass in Sword Art Online and scoring Asuna as a waifu, it\'s very ideal and something most people dream for. Even if he is kind of bland in personality. Not to say Umaru is bland, she does semble some unique characteristics and more relatability than Kirito. In terms of other characters I liked, Tachibana is probably my favorite character in the anime....I enjoy her competitiveness and positivity.My only complaint about the anime is that Kirie and Nana feel somewhat too similar in personality, it seems like both of their main character traits involve shyness. I know Kirie is different with her often getting mad at Takashi and also calls ""Komaru"" her master. But there\'s just not differentiation for me to like either of them as of now.There are some pretty good backstories surrounding the characters in Umaru, it\'s not just Umaru playing video games and watching anime. It\'s worth pulling through if you\'re willing to learn more about the characters.I hope that in Season 2 that they\'re given more backstory and character development. It\'s a good watch definitely, give it a shot at watching it. It may or may not be for you depending on how well you can tolerate Umaru\'s stubbornness. Good anime overall!

Probably everyone said, ""hey this is just 4-koma anime stuff, there`s not much you can expect anyway."".Characters are not much memoriable except Umaru, the lazy smart-ass girl who plays too much games and spend rest of her times in home....Opening is great but whats with the music, as it sounds out of places. Voice acting was fine.Um... anymore?Enjoyment? Kinda downhill.At least everyone remember this Anime.5/10. Opening is great but whats with the music, as it sounds out of places.

Out of many reasons I liked about it I will pick out two that stuck with me. This review is also for people who already watched Himouto, but if you are unsure about whether you should watch it, I hope I can convince you...to do so.Have your ever read an old Shakespeare comedy? If you haven't, you should. I you have, you will know that disguising as some other person plays a major role throughout these stories. A lord's daughter dresses up as a guy, a lord dresses up as a commoner...In Himouto we also have that element: the main character assumes different roles and acts differently in front of various people. Granted, they fail to realise who she really is. Many people may denounce this as a cheap, lazy and above all nonsensical plot device. But hey, Shakespeare got away with it over 400 years ago - the people loved it, it was great fun. So why should an anime that's primarily about providing nonsensical fun not be allowed to do it? I can admit that I really liked it and thought it was pretty cool when I noticed that Shakespeare connection - you can’t beat sounding all educated and smart :DSecondly, the feels. No, not the ones that make you cry in romance animes if you have a weak spot for that sort of thing. More like the relationship between the characters being shown in a subtle way through small gestures. Most negative reviews go on about how Umaru is this unlikable brat who acts awful towards her brother. I would argue that her extreme spoiledness is just for the sake of comedy (who’d have thought :D). But - you will see her actual personality shining through quite a lot: she really cares about her brother! Notice how she cherishes presents he got for her or how upset she gets when something seems to be wrong with him. This is also the case for the relationships between the other characters. I'm not going to go into detail here but it’s all very well made and will leave a smile on your face while also making you really care about them and their stories.At the end of the day it's not a perfect series but one well worth watching if you like comedy and slice of life animes.Music:catchy, perfect openingboring endingmusic throughout the episodes fits the story well, sometimes a little bland, some nice themesAnimation:great & cute animation of Chibi Umaruuu~ :DNothing surprising, outstanding or special but still goodStory:Nothing new or exciting but very well executed with some nice ideasComedy is not “rolling-on-the-floor-choking-from-laughter-level” (for that, go watch prison school) but it will constantly put a smile on your face and really make you laugh from time to timeCharacters:I like! (except for that annoying, blue-haired, noble chick) to do so.Have your ever read an old Shakespeare comedy? If you haven't, you should. I you have, you will know that disguising as some other person plays a major role throughout these stories. A lord's daughter dresses up as a guy, a lord dresses up as a commoner...In Himouto we also have that element: the main character assumes different roles and acts differently in front of various people. Granted, they fail to realise who she really is. Many people may denounce this as a cheap, lazy and above all nonsensical plot device.

Umaru-chan is an alright anime, but it certainly isn't anything special. The only defining feature of the anime would probably be the somewhat iconic hoodie that umaru wears.

Umaru-chan? You're late like me, but it's okay.... lolIt's my first time being here and this is my first review, so it might be a little silly. Don't worry, it will not have spoilers. And don't mind my bad English ^^''Himouto! Umaru-chan is about a girl named Umaru (really?). In school, she's a very pretty, popular, and dedicated student. But appearances can be deceiving, because when she arrives at her house, she literally transforms into a chibi with a hamster hood, being a completely lazy and egoist person. Are you interested? So let me tell you my opinion about...this anime...--Story (3/10)--Scared by this score? Well, it's for a good reason. This anime doesn't have a story, it's just a slice of life thing about a girl being a completely angel in school, but when in home, she's lazy, addicted to cola and video games while torturing her older brother by using her manipulative skills. If you don't like this kind of anime, thank me for warning you. I don't really like this kind of genre, so when I finished watching it, I got disappointed. I really thought it was going to have a little conflict, but in the end, it was just a way to fool you into watching it completely... Like Umaru-chan does.--Art (9/10)--Now things got better, right? It's for a good reason too. The characters and the scenarios are great to look at. The main characters are cutely drawn and the scenes are very dynamic, with sparkling lights and Japanese Onomatopoeia. The character that I found cute in design, was Sylphin. Don't judge me if you think the opposite, I just liked her long blue hair, sparkling blue eyes, cat-like mouth, and most importantly: her ojou-sama way of talking.--Sound (7/10)--It wasn't epic or unforgettable, but this anime had music and sound effects. And they were good. It wasn't strange nor bad quality.--Character (8/10)--I really loved the characters. I found really cool the idea of Umaru being a two-faced sister, and hiding the lazy personality from her friends and others. I liked the idea of she having a rival: Sylphin. Of course she would have one, she only scored 10 in her exams! Umaru's older brother: Taihei, is a completely cool person! He cooks, cleans, and takes care of his little sister although she's a brat! And the character I really liked in the series was Kirie. I'll try not to say spoilers, but Kirie is Umaru's Number 1 Fan and she can't talk to her properly, acting really creepy. Some other things happen after this, but I will spoil the entire anime if I say and it will be really boring to watch after knowing this things... Remember when I said that it didn't had a story? So.--Enjoyment (6/10)--Well... I watched the entire anime, but only because I thought it would have something intriguing. But it hadn’t, so it got a bit boring. And on the Anime List’s page synopsis, it said that it was a comedy anime. But I didn’t found it very funny. Sometimes I laughed, but not like a comedy thing, that you cry a lot. It was just a bit funny. Not comedy.I only scored 6 because I could watch it completely (if it was really bad to watch I would drop it for sure), and the episodes were full of games and anime references. It was fun to find some of them.--Overall (7/10)—In my opinion, Himouto! Umaru-chan is a watchable anime, but just to spend time. You have nothing to do? Watch this anime, it will probably be something. If you want a more thrilling or intriguing anime, that makes you excited to see what happens, watch another. Simple as that.

Now, what do I think of Himouto!? I think it's pretty good! It's very entertaining and funny with amazing voices for these types of characters. Now, why do I think it's entertaining? First off, it's about a Mary Sue out in public while at home she is a complete brat. It's not only interesting but very entertaining. The only thing I...don't really like about this concept is the big brother, [Taihei Doma] all he does is what Umaru wants, which gets kind of boring after a couple episodes and that brings the story down. Why doesn't Taihei do anything about it?  Sometimes you just want to yell at him for being so dull.Besides Taihei being dull, the other characters work off of Umaru well, both Ebina, (the red head) Kirie, (the black haired girl) and Sylphinford (the blue hair girl) all act differently to who Umaru is, Ebina being Umaru's best friend,  Kirie being the shy girl in the back of the class, who socializes with young kids well [which is Umaru's chibi form,] and Sylphinford, Umaru's rival.Sure Umaru is a brat but if it's entertaining, funny, with wonderful characters, why does it have to be bad? don't really like about this concept is the big brother, [Taihei Doma] all he does is what Umaru wants, which gets kind of boring after a couple episodes and that brings the story down.

Here we go with one of my very first slice of life anime( This review will contain spoilers)-Himouto! Umaru-chan is a show that resolves around a highschool girl named Umaru,her brother and her friends. It\'s a slice of life comedy anime that tries it\'s best to be fun and pretty much succeeds in that matter.If you’re here,it means you already know about the characters and a little bit about the show itself. But I\'m still gonna go over those things. Because,why not?Let\'s start with our female protagonist Umaru. Around her friends and other people,our MC is perfect in every sense. She\'s the class topper,great...at sports,interacts with people a lot,nice towards everyone and she\'s also good looking. In other words,she\'s a very likable person in the outside world.However,when she\'s inside her house with her brother,things get a little different. Outside,She looks like any normal highschooler. But inside the house,she turns into this little girl with a hamster hoodie that looks like a kindergartner. Why? Well,I guess,BECAUSE ANIME!Upon entering her house,Umaru becomes a Slackster gamer and an otaku who spends the entire day watching anime, reading manga,playing games and eating snacks. Her hard working nerd brother,Taihei looks after her and does all the chores after coming back from work. He also listens to all her demands and tries his best to keep her happy.  Even when Umaru is throwing a tantrum over the weekly jump or anime merch,Taihei just can\'t seem to say \'NO\' to his sister.One of the reasons why I enjoyed this anime so much is beacuse it\'s like an escape route from reality and it reminds me of how much of a cheeky little brat I was as a kid. The show is fun it\'s own way. After watching a certain episode(I don\'t remeber which one it was), I just realised,""Hey,I just watched a kid eat snacks for 10 minutes and I still enjoyed it."" Well, I guess that\'s just how it is with slice of life anime.Now,let\'s talk about some of the throwbacks in these types of stories. The show kind of loses It\'s pace when it steps out of It\'s primary concept. Plus,it can also get a bit repetive when it runs out of freash ideas. But the industries pretty much don’t care about these things. As they\'ll just brand the fan-favourite character and make money out of the merch.So,in conclusion,I\'d say Himouto!Umaru-chan was a fun and entertaining show. Was it something groundbreaking? No. Does it need to be groundbreaking? No. It\'s fun and enjoyable in it\'s own way and that\'s good enough. at sports,interacts with people a lot,nice towards everyone and she\'s also good looking. In other words,she\'s a very likable person in the outside world.However,when she\'s inside her house with her brother,things get a little different. Outside,She looks like any normal highschooler.

Well, I guess that\'s just how it is with slice of life anime.Now,let\'s talk about some of the throwbacks in these types of stories. The show kind of loses It\'s pace when it steps out of It\'s primary concept. Plus,it can also get a bit repetive when it runs out of freash ideas. But the industries pretty much don’t care about these things. As they\'ll just brand the fan-favourite character and make money out of the merch.So,in conclusion,I\'d say Himouto!Umaru-chan was a fun and entertaining show. Was it something groundbreaking? No. Does it need to be groundbreaking? No. It\'s fun and enjoyable in it\'s own way and that\'s good enough.', 'One word review: Relaxing.Watch a group of lovable characters have fun and enjoy their everyday life. No plot, no stress, just fun. Every character is a great person, and they all care enormously for each other.This pretty much sums it up. If these are the things you like, then this anime is for you.Himouto falls into a really unique subgenre of the slice of life anime, and judging by the scores, it is not for everyone, so beware.If you like any of these, there is a great chance that you will enjoy Himouto too:Gakuen Babysitters, Flying witch, My Roommate...is a Cat, Interviews With Monster Girls. is a Cat, Interviews With Monster Girls.', 'I didn\'t get this anime. I didn\'t get into it. I didn\'t hate it either, it was just kind of there and something you could leave on in the background.  I suppose if you enjoy watching a Chibi character make lots of cute noises endlessly, it might be your cup of tea.Why is this such a big chunk of nothing ?  Well the big three elements just don\'t do anything. The characters are flat. The story is flat. The comedy is flat.I am not even sure if I can tell what was supposed to be funny. The best I can tell here...is you are supposed to be overwhelmed by Umaru\'s cuteness and overwhelmed Taihei\'s selflessness (in this case read selfless, as chump). Just to give an example of a gag in the series. There\'s a bit where Umaru makes a promise to clean up after herself, and she wiggles out of it with ""I didn\'t say when"".The characters are uninteresting and just don\'t pull you in.  Umaru is unbelievable, and really uninteresting, her biggest emotional impact is being mildly annoying. Her outside personality is fine but really uninteresting.  Taihei, is a generic father (yes father) character, who is working himself to death, while being easily manipulated by Umaru. I actually thought the Bomber, Kirie relationship was more interesting than the main characters but there was so little of it over the series it was hard to get pulled in.  That\'s not the only missed opportunity  Taihei could of been more , but he was just there to be Umaru\'s perpetual victim.The story was just as uninvolving as the rest of this mess. Every episode is more or less Umaru doing something in her useless mode that, she then guilt trips her brother into ignoring or fixing for her. You can toss in a round of one of the following, Taihei missing out on romantic opportunity, her friends failing at something. The only major plot point of note is the when will her friends recognize any of Umaru\'s alternate selves. This is incredibly  badly done. The author may even be aware of this, as there are bits where you get lines of the sort ""what you have two sisters with the same name ?"", mind you they have seen both modes.Have to say the voice acting was probably the best part of this anime. It was spot on and did a good job of setting an emotional tone.The music was good if a little more interesting than the actual anime. It actually had a video game type feel to it, where it was constantly shifting on character actions.The art was about the lowest level you could expect to be aired these days. The characters were distinctive but not particularly original. There are some interesting drawings and backgrounds but overall it has a feel of being squeezed by a low budget.Overall, if you want something on in the background that you aren\'t actually going to pay attention to, this is good for the task. If you want to use it to teach your kids how not to be, it\'s questionable. There\'s too many bad messages in it. Especially the way Umaru gets rewarded or achieves things without making any effort. is you are supposed to be overwhelmed by Umaru\'s cuteness and overwhelmed Taihei\'s selflessness (in this case read selfless, as chump).

Umaru-chan that struck me most. It might be a bit unconventional but that\'s just what may make it interesting.Let\'s start this off by jumping in at the DEEP end.Umaru-chan is actually a show that contains some poignant messages. The main one being that it is okay to have niche hobbies and be passionate about them as long as the rest of your life isn\'t negatively affected by them. It\'s a modern illustration of the time-honored advice ""everything in moderation"". This may seem strange when talking about a show like Umaru-chan but just as the great...Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca taught us, Umaru-chan also shows us that moderation is key to living the good life.Umaru\'s level of obsession with her games, anime and lazing around when she\'s at home would seem excessive or even problematic to any random observer. People would think that such a person would have trouble functioning as a member of society. They would be concerned for Umaru\'s wellbeing and even think that the presence of such a person would be bad for society.However, in Umaru-chan\'s case she has her life under control. Her school-grades are top-tier and socially she\'s well adjusted and popular. When in public, she\'s the perfect member of society. For her, what she does is in perfect moderation and as a result we can see in the show that her life is smooth-sailing and happy.Umaru\'s brilliance is that she shows otaku/NEETs/hikki\'s who\'s life has somewhat gotten derailed that there is another way. You don\'t need to reject society to enjoy what you like or to live an unconventional lifestyle. The reality of life is also that you need society to survive and thrive. It\'s therefore preferable to be a respectable and upstanding citizen, both for your own wellbeing as that of the people around you and society as a whole. You can do whatever you want but don\'t let it consume you, this is the trap that many who reject society fall into.Rejecting society, isolating yourself and indulging in what you enjoy most will not make you better off as you might think at first and Umaru knows this. Over time your greatest pleasures and joys can consume you if there\'s nothing to balance them out. Umaru\'s outside persona acts as that counterweight that prevents her himouto way of being from going off the deep end.Umaru has achieved perfect happiness and balance through the duality of extreme self-improvement and being the best she can possibly be on the one hand and on the other hand unapologetic indulgence in what she truly enjoys. Umaru herself is an allegory for how to lead a good happy life. She\'s therefore an inspiration and role-model to the viewer. With this I of course don\'t mean that people should try and emulate her literally. It\'s the concept she embodies that can be applied in your own life.There\'s a scene in the anime that illustrates this balance of Umaru very well. In this segment Umaru fakes having a fever by playing a trick on the thermometer so she can skip school to stay at home and laze around. Although her plan succeeds and her onii-chan urges her to stay home for the day, the things that would normally amuse her seem different and she can\'t really enjoy herself. She feels like there\'s something off and feels guilty. Her himouto-side had gone too far, what she did was a dangerous precedent and could cause harm to herself and the people she cares about. In other words, the balance was disturbed. Umaru quickly realized her mistake and decided to go to school for the rest of the day, symbolizing the restoration of the balance.The way the anime visually portrays her two ways of being almost as two different characters can be seen as a way to emphasize the balance, stability and strength that come forth from the duality of her existence. We might ask, why does she keep her two ways of being so separate? Why not show an Umaru that\'s both type of person at once? One reason is probably to drive down the above mentioned point about balance by showing such a stark contrast in character. Another is to show that keeping some things hidden from society is not necessarily a bad thing. It can even be a trait that points to being well adjusted in society. Umaru knows that her behavior at home could be negatively perceived by outsiders. Even though it doesn\'t cause negative consequences for her or anybody else. This is the way society can be, generalizations often lead to unjust judgments. Although the general judgment that excessive indulgement in pleasure is harmful is correct, the perception of what is ""excessive"" is highly subjective. It\'s therefore wise (for Umaru) to hide certain things from public or certain individuals to avoid misunderstandings that could come back to haunt you.Another striking impression I got while watching Umaru-chan was the message that improving yourself to become the best possible person you can be is also the best way to (perhaps not even intentionally) be good to others.Throughout the show we see Umaru meet and befriend a small number of girls that end up very dear friends to her. Ebina-chan for example is a classmate of Umaru that has come alone from the countryside to go to school in the city. When Ebina-chan moves into her apartment she meets Umaru and her onii-chan who also live in the same apartment-block. They quickly get along and Umaru\'s presence becomes support for Ebina who knows nobody so far from home.Next we have Kirie-chan, a social outcast from Umaru\'s class. Kirie wants to be friends with umaru but can\'t because of her social anxiety. When Kirie-chan ends up on Umaru\'s doorstep through circumstances she meets Umaru in himouto-form. She however doesn\'t recognize Umaru and is led to believe that she met Umaru\'s sister. Through this meeting they end up becoming friends and from then on Kirie comes by often to hang out with Umaru in her apartment. This helps Kirie-chan to slowly gain some confidence and being friends with Umaru also makes a social outcast like her very happy.Last but not least we have Tachibana Sylphinford (aka TSF). She\'s an ojou-sama type girl that initially always bothers Umaru at school by competing with her in literally everything. Umaru doesn\'t mind this though. When Umaru goes outside to compete in a gaming contest in disguise she is surprised to find TSF among the competitors. From then on they run into each other at other times (while umaru maintains her disguise) and Umaru discovers she has much in common with TSF. She also finds out that TSF seems kind of lonely in her hobbies. So Umaru and TSF meeting makes them both enjoy each others company and share their passions together. Slowly Umaru starts to see TSF as her friend and goes out of her way to have fun together.From these examples we see that Umaru is a force for good in these girls\' lives without actively trying to be. If Umaru wouldn\'t have balanced her life (symbolized by her outside form) she would have never met these people and impacted their lives in such a positive way. It\'s because Umaru also works hard for and on herself outside of her himouto form that she can be good to others. And this also brings good back to Umaru herself. Because while Umaru-chan might be popular because of her seemingly perfect outside-persona, she didn\'t have any real friends. People that accept both sides of her and not only the seemingly flawless Umaru, are rare in her life.When different aspects of Umaru\'s secret self get out to her new friends she learns that she isn\'t rejected by them. Things about herself that she initially hid she can now show to her friends. Although most don\'t realize (yet) she\'s the same Umaru as the perfect outside Umaru, she learns that it is okay to open up to her friends about her hobbies and the things she likes. And this is what true friends are: people that care for you and accept you for who you are. Umaru\'s pursuit of a good and happy life for herself through a balanced life has brought not only life-joy to herself but also to others and even more, it has brought Umaru true friends.As this is actually a full review and not merely an analysis, I want to touch upon some other aspects of the show too. As for the experience of watching an episode of Umaru-chan; it feels like a mix of slice of life with comedy. While there are certainly better examples of both genres, Umaru-chan\'s premise maintains a certain uniqueness that certainly entertains. Also contrary to some people\'s first impressions, this show is not about pandering to the audience. There\'s virtually no fanservice here. It\'s actually quite a wholesome show, both in what\'s visually shown on screen and the portrayed characters and their relations.The walls of text written above may perhaps give the impression that Umaru-chan is a dramatic, deep and plot-heavy show but this is not the case at all. While there is a plot in Umaru-chan it won\'t be enough for people who are specifically looking for a plot driven show. Himouto! Umaru-chan is best described as lighthearted, fun, charming and occasionally moving.Also worth remarking is that there are a few scenes in Umaru-chan that evoke a particularly strong awareness of the world and of being alive in the current moment. I was honestly surprised and taken aback because these scenes seem to come from seemingly nowhere and suddenly hit you. An example of this is when Umaru goes out at night to buy some cola in a convenience store. On her way back when walking along the dark deserted roads she remarks ""It\'s so silent, like the world is holding its breath."". Experiencing such moments is rare and evoking them in people is not an easy feat. That Umaru-chan can evoke ""Mono no aware"" emotions is testament to the care and thought that the staff put into this anime.The music of this show deserves praise in my opinion. First of all, the ending song ""Hidamari Days"" is just beautiful and emotionally moving. The ending\'s lyrics in particular. Take these lines for example: ""Soon enough we\'ll bid childhood farewell, but even when that day comes, we\'ll always, always be the best of friends."". I found these lyrics quite touching, especially combined with the music and in the final episode.Umaru-chan\'s soundtrack also didn\'t disappoint and has some great tracks. The OST is composed by Yasuhiro Misawa who has also composed the Yuru Yuri soundtracks. I like Yasuhiro\'s style of composing a lot. He uses relatively simple compositions that use a limited amount of instruments and have a strong rithm. This gives them a very ""clean"" or pure feel. Most importantly, the tracks evoke the right kind of mood well which is really what counts most in any show. Some tracks are also quite memorable and will get stuck in your head. TSF\'s character song ""TSF in Nippon"" is also very catchy, I recommend to check it out.My final conclusion is that Himouto! Umaru-chan, while nothing groundbreaking, is an enjoyable anime that can teach you some important things if you pay attention and look beneath the surface. Personally, I\'m very glad I watched this. Desu wa~ Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca taught us, Umaru-chan also shows us that moderation is key to living the good life.Umaru\'s level of obsession with her games, anime and lazing around when she\'s at home would seem excessive or even problematic to any random observer. People would think that such a person would have trouble functioning as a member of society. They would be concerned for Umaru\'s wellbeing and even think that the presence of such a person would be bad for society.However, in Umaru-chan\'s case she has her life under control. Her school-grades are top-tier and socially she\'s well adjusted and popular. When in public, she\'s the perfect member of society. For her, what she does is in perfect moderation and as a result we can see in the show that her life is smooth-sailing and happy.Umaru\'s brilliance is that she shows otaku/NEETs/hikki\'s who\'s life has somewhat gotten derailed that there is another way. You don\'t need to reject society to enjoy what you like or to live an unconventional lifestyle. The reality of life is also that you need society to survive and thrive. It\'s therefore preferable to be a respectable and upstanding citizen, both for your own wellbeing as that of the people around you and society as a whole. You can do whatever you want but don\'t let it consume you, this is the trap that many who reject society fall into.Rejecting society, isolating yourself and indulging in what you enjoy most will not make you better off as you might think at first and Umaru knows this. Over time your greatest pleasures and joys can consume you if there\'s nothing to balance them out. Umaru\'s outside persona acts as that counterweight that prevents her himouto way of being from going off the deep end.Umaru has achieved perfect happiness and balance through the duality of extreme self-improvement and being the best she can possibly be on the one hand and on the other hand unapologetic indulgence in what she truly enjoys. Umaru herself is an allegory for how to lead a good happy life. She\'s therefore an inspiration and role-model to the viewer. With this I of course don\'t mean that people should try and emulate her literally. It\'s the concept she embodies that can be applied in your own life.There\'s a scene in the anime that illustrates this balance of Umaru very well. In this segment Umaru fakes having a fever by playing a trick on the thermometer so she can skip school to stay at home and laze around. Although her plan succeeds and her onii-chan urges her to stay home for the day, the things that would normally amuse her seem different and she can\'t really enjoy herself. She feels like there\'s something off and feels guilty. Her himouto-side had gone too far, what she did was a dangerous precedent and could cause harm to herself and the people she cares about. In other words, the balance was disturbed. Umaru quickly realized her mistake and decided to go to school for the rest of the day, symbolizing the restoration of the balance.The way the anime visually portrays her two ways of being almost as two different characters can be seen as a way to emphasize the balance, stability and strength that come forth from the duality of her existence. We might ask, why does she keep her two ways of being so separate? Why not show an Umaru that\'s both type of person at once? One reason is probably to drive down the above mentioned point about balance by showing such a stark contrast in character. Another is to show that keeping some things hidden from society is not necessarily a bad thing. It can even be a trait that points to being well adjusted in society. Umaru knows that her behavior at home could be negatively perceived by outsiders. Even though it doesn\'t cause negative consequences for her or anybody else. This is the way society can be, generalizations often lead to unjust judgments. Although the general judgment that excessive indulgement in pleasure is harmful is correct, the perception of what is ""excessive"" is highly subjective. It\'s therefore wise (for Umaru) to hide certain things from public or certain individuals to avoid misunderstandings that could come back to haunt you.Another striking impression I got while watching Umaru-chan was the message that improving yourself to become the best possible person you can be is also the best way to (perhaps not even intentionally) be good to others.Throughout the show we see Umaru meet and befriend a small number of girls that end up very dear friends to her. Ebina-chan for example is a classmate of Umaru that has come alone from the countryside to go to school in the city. When Ebina-chan moves into her apartment she meets Umaru and her onii-chan who also live in the same apartment-block. They quickly get along and Umaru\'s presence becomes support for Ebina who knows nobody so far from home.Next we have Kirie-chan, a social outcast from Umaru\'s class. Kirie wants to be friends with umaru but can\'t because of her social anxiety. When Kirie-chan ends up on Umaru\'s doorstep through circumstances she meets Umaru in himouto-form. She however doesn\'t recognize Umaru and is led to believe that she met Umaru\'s sister. Through this meeting they end up becoming friends and from then on Kirie comes by often to hang out with Umaru in her apartment. This helps Kirie-chan to slowly gain some confidence and being friends with Umaru also makes a social outcast like her very happy.Last but not least we have Tachibana Sylphinford (aka TSF). She\'s an ojou-sama type girl that initially always bothers Umaru at school by competing with her in literally everything. Umaru doesn\'t mind this though. When Umaru goes outside to compete in a gaming contest in disguise she is surprised to find TSF among the competitors. From then on they run into each other at other times (while umaru maintains her disguise) and Umaru discovers she has much in common with TSF. She also finds out that TSF seems kind of lonely in her hobbies. So Umaru and TSF meeting makes them both enjoy each others company and share their passions together. Slowly Umaru starts to see TSF as her friend and goes out of her way to have fun together.From these examples we see that Umaru is a force for good in these girls\' lives without actively trying to be. If Umaru wouldn\'t have balanced her life (symbolized by her outside form) she would have never met these people and impacted their lives in such a positive way. It\'s because Umaru also works hard for and on herself outside of her himouto form that she can be good to others. And this also brings good back to Umaru herself. Because while Umaru-chan might be popular because of her seemingly perfect outside-persona, she didn\'t have any real friends. People that accept both sides of her and not only the seemingly flawless Umaru, are rare in her life.When different aspects of Umaru\'s secret self get out to her new friends she learns that she isn\'t rejected by them. Things about herself that she initially hid she can now show to her friends. Although most don\'t realize (yet) she\'s the same Umaru as the perfect outside Umaru, she learns that it is okay to open up to her friends about her hobbies and the things she likes. And this is what true friends are: people that care for you and accept you for who you are. Umaru\'s pursuit of a good and happy life for herself through a balanced life has brought not only life-joy to herself but also to others and even more, it has brought Umaru true friends.As this is actually a full review and not merely an analysis, I want to touch upon some other aspects of the show too. As for the experience of watching an episode of Umaru-chan; it feels like a mix of slice of life with comedy. While there are certainly better examples of both genres, Umaru-chan\'s premise maintains a certain uniqueness that certainly entertains.

The really odd thing is there really could have been one but it seems that it was sacrificed in favor of repeatedly representing the otaku-ish antics of the main character, Umaru. Sure, you could give it the benefit of the doubt and say ""well it\'s a slice of life"" BUT at least other SOLs are more diverse. Each episode is almost literally the same thing with very little variation as time progresses (the only real variation being an increase of...a few characters in the show). But you\'d think there\'d be at least some explanation as to why Umaru had to be the one to develop a persona in public vs private.Art:Can\'t complain much about this besides the fact that every character except Taihei, Umaru\'s brother, seems to have one specific expression on their face most of the time.

I mean, I want to appreciate its practical nature that the main character does not turn out how I wanted it to be.

Very cute characters, but almost as if they all have the same face, but different hair, outfits and voices.

A few seconds of silence pass and then the episode sort of moves on.Yes, it is meant to have us reflect on her brother but there...is also a lingering, understated question: where are their parents?

She’s beautiful and cute, and academically successful. While also having a nice personality towards everyone she knows. But when she gets home, she drops the act and shows her true colours.   (The Video Review is Up Here is the Written)Story - 6/10Himouto: Umaru-chan is slice of life comedy anime about a girl who  would be perfect on the surface. She has a nice personality, has good grades and is beautiful at the same time. But when she comes home, she is a complete trash monster. Meaning, she just likes to laze around all...day, playing video games, looking at anime and manga and eating junk food, especially chips and cola. All doing this while wearing her iconic hamster hoody.Now although Umaru, is nice to everyone else, there is one person who knows her true personality and that is her brother Taihei. Usually how the story goes is that Umaru is doing something that really annoys Taihei, which forces him to do what Umaru does and so goes many enjoyable moments from the brother-sister duo. There is not really an overarching story throughout the whole show, its more broken down into segments. I’m kind of disappointed in this, because there are moments in the anime, where they try to go through with a more story orientated plot, but by the end of the series, those story plots never really play another part. Like example, why is it only Taihei and Umaru, living together. Why does Umaru, act the way she does at school, compared to how she acts at home, and many more. It annoys me, because at times it would look like they’re trying to progress the story, but they don’t capitalize on it.Characters - 6/10Umaru Doma, is our main character of the show. All gentle and nice on the surface, complete trash underneath. Wait a minute, she’s an anime equivalent of me, well maybe not that extreme. Basically she has two personas. In her outdoor mode, she’s a perfect role model student. In her indoor mode, she’s going to be the most annoying little sister to you. Throughout the show, she’ll consistently annoy her brother, and actually be nice whenever her friends are around. There is very little development with her character, as only at times, it’ll look like she’s questioning herself on why she puts on a façade, but then comes back wanting to keep her identity a secret.The other main character of the show is Umaru’s older brother Taihei, who constantly puts up with her shenanigans. She is pretty much a nice guy, he can do pretty much do everything well. But he is a bit of a pushover, due to Umaru’s bratty-ness always getting the best of him. For his development, same goes, he doesn’t really have much development, as he just plays constant victim to Umaru and he’s a bit oblivious too.As for the rest of the cast, same goes, there is rare development in any of them. But the main reason for that is, this is mostly a sketch show, and it’s a slice of life, so don’t expect too much. But all these characters are very likeable, because they remind us of us sometimes. Even though there isn’t much development at least there is some signs of development, and the fact you can see when the characters start showing some care to the other characters once in a while. Some characters will be annoying to some people, due to the fact, they could remind you of someone you kind of hate.Animation and Sound - 6/10, 6/10The animation and art style is rather light. Nothing is really detailed, and you can clearly see that when you look at some of food Umaru’s eating or some of the games she’s playing. Also there are some scenes that the animation doesn’t match the action. Such as when Umaru’s playing an FPS and she’s just mashing buttons on the controller, but that’s just me nit picking. Obviously one thing very noticeable is when Umaru’s in her chibi mode. Now this not the change in art style, but this is more an actual disguise as no one, but her brother of course seems to recognize her. Of course when she’s in her outdoor mode, she’s all sparkly, representing the perfect girl. The art style and animation is really simple, nothing really stands out, besides Umaru’s chibi mode and one scene, showing us the glory of how to watch a movie.For the soundtrack, I’m going to lie, it sounds like ‘The Sims’ when you’re in build or buy mode. It’s very upbeat and bouncy. Even though, I like the soundtrack, I feel like nothing really stands out. They re-use the same tracks quite often for a lot the scenes, so nothing really stands out for me. The opening is catchy, but not to the point it’s really great. Same with the ending, it’s mellow and slow, but nothing great. However I do like it that they go the voice actors the sing the opening and ending songs.Enjoyment - 9/10Despite not having a progressive story, character development and a soundtrack that seems too oddly familiar, I found myself enjoying this show a lot because I can relate to the characters. They are all really likeable, and there are some very nice moments in the anime that’ll leave you laughing or leave you heart warmth. Not once did I feel bored, while watching this show. Every character interaction brings a lot of fun unique dynamics the show and I had blast seeing how they react and interact with each other. It’s also a show that makes you feel good, because it’s really light-hearted and filled with great comedic timings.Verdict - 6.5/10For the story, I give it a 6. There is not really an overarching story and unfortunately, it felt like some stories were cut off early, which never went full circle. But I do love the concept, and how they build the world around the characters.For the animation and sound, I give them both a 6. The animation and art style is nothing special, it’s really simplified with some pretty cool moments here and there. However I do like the changes in Umaru, because it really sticks out to show her both her sides. The soundtrack, sounds too familiar to be called original and also it doesn’t really stick out, but’s ok. The OP and ED are a little catchy.For the characters, I give them a 6. All the characters don’t really get that much development, if any at all. But I love their interactions with each other, because every moment with these characters are really entertaining. And they are very likeable as well.For the my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. I love the light hearted nature of this anime and the comedy is good to as well. I like how it makes me feel at home, due to the fact I have characters I can really relate to. Not once was I bored watching this.For the overall score, after rounding it up, I give Himouto: Umaru-Chan a 6.5/10. As for the quality of the anime, it’s not really that great, it’s just slightly above average. But by good, is it really entertaining and hits close to home. I recommend this anime for comedy lovers and for those, who think they live the life style of an otaku, you may feel at home as well. day, playing video games, looking at anime and manga and eating junk food, especially chips and cola.

I like how it makes me feel at home, due to the fact I have characters I can really relate to. Not once was I bored watching this.For the overall score, after rounding it up, I give Himouto: Umaru-Chan a 6.5/10. As for the quality of the anime, it’s not really that great, it’s just slightly above average. But by good, is it really entertaining and hits close to home. I recommend this anime for comedy lovers and for those, who think they live the life style of an otaku, you may feel at home as well.', ""Started watching this after my friends couldn't stop talking about this after episode 2.Well, Himouto is a very fun and bright anime. The art is outstanding in my opinion, so as the characters which are very rich. The storyline is pretty average however - After episode 4-5 the story line starts to feel a bit recycled and even a bit boring at some point. It's still a lot of fun to watch, though. Except for the story there aren't much more negative things to say about himouto. The art is bright and colorful, the music fits and the characters are rich. If you like...kawaii characters, typical comedy/slice of life/school jokes and embarrassing situations, Himouto will probably won't disappoint you. kawaii characters, typical comedy/slice of life/school jokes and embarrassing situations, Himouto will probably won't disappoint you."", ""Long time ago i was just a simple bored otaku who is searching in the internet  a fun anime to watch but one day a video of this anime suddenly pop out of nowhere in my facebook my first thought was this is gonna be another moe anime which is 80% true no no no no make that 90% but unlike other moe anime that i have watch this anime is ultra mega super awesome fantastic ultimate Cute!!!!!!!

Umaru-chan sounds more like a quick 3 minute anime series rather than a full blown show. It\'s just so...simple and plain.There\'s not a lot of variety when it comes to content of the show, and this comes a variety of reasons, but the main one is just that it tries to showcase the difference between Umaru\'s interactions in the outside and interactions at home. It\'s an alright premise, but not much gets done with it. The idea that she\'s a lazy slob at home vs being perfect outside at school is not expanded upon at all. You\'d think that there\'d be more characters that...perhaps get to know her better, but not really.

You can enjoy a whole story in 10 minutes or less.The main character, Umaru is the perfect student and athlete, excelling in everything at life without even trying. At home she’s an otaku, fast food junkie and an annoyance to her brother, Taihei. Most of the show is made of jokes on her double identity, sort of. To be honest I didn’t find it funny, more like amusing. It’s an easy, relaxing watch. The important thing is to take it for what it is, light hearted stories about characters that really care for each other.What I liked the...most about it though is the actual hero in all of this, Umaru’s brother, Taihei. I liked his wholesome personality, always trying to do the right thing, clearly trying to become a good adult. He’s a decent cook and manages to keep order in his house, despite Umaru’s being a toy hoarder and never cleaning after herself.

It is okay to make characters who are hated, in a way. Where would we be if Femto from Berserk did not elicit strong feelings during the sacrifice? Or a certain dad from Fullmetal Alchemist was actually as nice as he appears? Surely not everyone in a story can be equally liked, and some are downright detestable, which may serves the story well. It makes us root for a particular outcome, that of the Protagonist...to achieve victory over the villain, versus apathy to the events going on. In fact,a strong feeling of hate may be more preferable to outright annoyance, from insignificant mascot tagalongs like Kon of Bleach, or for us Westerners, MINIONS.What am I am trying to say is, title character Umaru Doma is one of the most unjustifiably annoying characters I have seen in anime.But let us start with things one should know. Umaru is actually a 16 year old girl who switches between the chibi form you see on the cover and her teenage self, the general premise being that she is the perfect straight A+ student, rumored to be wealthy beyond imagination and engage in all sorts of things people like you and I can only begin to imagine, the draw being that in actuality, she just goes home and lazes about, her chibi form being a physical transformation signifying a sudden personality change.This could be executed well, but....Umaru is insufferable, especially given the context of her actual age. I would be lenient on Umaru if she was actually 6, but she displays full capacity for thought regardless of form. Her most annoying acts and habits includes....-Lazing about and contributing nothing.-Begging her brother Taihei, who is a hardworking salary man, to buy her several items upon getting home, such as her trademark cola, and throwing a temper tantrum when he expresses some reluctance.-Her brother enables her to the point that he even does her homework at one point, despite holding a job himself to support them both.-Not being useful when her brother was sick, but instead turning into a sobbing wreck over a minor cold that he had reminiscent of a child than a 16 year old High School student.In essence, Umaru is just a bratty, self absorbed teenager who gets what she wants most of the time from her weak willed brother who doesn\'t know how to say ""No"". Taihei is the ultimate enabler, and Umaru takes advantage of that.The final nail is the clueless nature of every other main character to discern that the Chibi Umaru is actually the grown Umaru, and apathy when they discover what a jerk she is to her brother. Normally, I wouldn\'t expect friends to weigh in on family dynamics, but having no one say anything in condemnation is aggravating, especially considering people like Ebina are infatuated enough with Taihei that it feels odd that no one has anger, or anything indicating discomfort.The most aggravating is that Umaru had many opportunities to grow, and there were hints that she is having second thoughts, but for these 12 episodes, it goes back to status quo.So to recapitulate, a main character who throws temper tantrums like a 6 year old while being 16 erstwhile contributing nothing, and it seems to provide a glorification of being a laze about Otaku without any social condemnation, except this time it is an accurate moniker to assign to Umaru, and utterly unrealistic for her to succeed at school given what we are shown, among other things. She did not appear to be a genius, and the whole concept of accomplishing without effort is the stuff of dreams.In fact, the anime seems to be a fantasy asking one to relate to its character. Except I am an adult, and a productive member of society. I left this juvenile mindset a long time ago, and it is because of this juvenile mindset that the main character possesses and acts on with impunity, that I greatly dislike this show.It is one think to have a jerk for a main character; it is another for no one, not even the writers, to acknowledge it, or even portray it in a good light. Especially at the behest of someone like Taihei who should have Umaru\'s interest at heart, but comes off as being whipped under Umaru\'s heel.That is why I do not like Himouto! Umaru-Chan for the most part. Any good attributes of the show like Kirie or Tachibana are greatly overshadowed by Umaru\'s presence. to achieve victory over the villain, versus apathy to the events going on.

I feel like she's only loved because of her obsession of being lazy which is something people can relate too. At first I was in love with the series, but then I kept watching in hopes that Umaru would get some character growth but she becomes excessive to deal with. How she treats her brother and doesn't get any consequences for her actions or behaviors is irritating to watch. I will admit there are moments where she's doable to watch her on screen. I think if she had gotten character growth to be a better person instead of a...leech, my review for this series would be alot better. leech, my review for this series would be alot better."", ""This show is surprisingly good. I initially dropped the show after the first episode due to the little cunt that is Umaru but after coming back and finishing it years later, I felt that ultimately the show was very fun and it developed with likable characters and a wholesome story.As the show developed, Umaru became less of a cunt although not totally cunt free even at the end. Her friends are all very likable tho a bit 1 dimensional. As a slice of life comedy, it is not boring or over the top and has a certain charm about it. Even the little hamster...bitch becomes likable enough as she grows with the show's progression.Although the show isn't amazing in any particular way, it does a good job of being interesting while not being too focused on anything serious. If you like light and fun slice of life, this show will be enjoyable. Just don't focus too hard on how much of a little shit Umaru is. bitch becomes likable enough as she grows with the show's progression.Although the show isn't amazing in any particular way, it does a good job of being interesting while not being too focused on anything serious.

If you\'ve talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Himoto! Umaru-chan. What\'s the difference between Umaru and the rest? Umaru only has 12 episodes so far yet it\'s on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that\'s simply because it\'s stunningly amazing. Those people that call Himoto! Umaru-chan ""overrated"" may not have the same taste as me, and that\'s perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Himoto! Umaru-chan is one of if not...the greatest anime to be made. It\'s not popular for no reason.The story is one of the most captivating stories I\'ve ever seen. The viewer is thrown directly into the universe of Umaru-chan as they follow the exploits of Umaru through the watchful gaze of her older brother, Taihei. Easily misconstrued as a light-hearted woman in the public eye, Umaru seems like an ordinary schoolgirl. But we soon find out, that Umaru is much more special than she seems, as a surprising physical revelation is revealed beyond closed doors. It is possible that Umaru could be the key to humanity\'s survival, but could also be humanity\'s destruction.My 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there\'s lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters).Characters was another area (alongside every area) that was Umaru\'s strongpoint.There\'s trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There\'s comedy relief among many characters, especially Nana Ebina. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Kirie Motoba, who wants to do the right thing, but can\'t seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Sylphinford Tachibana, who is Umaru\'s sworn rival, yet one of her closest friends. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, ""scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real"" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Taihei is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Himoto Umaru is strong-hearted, and ""special"", but she\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How she develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime.The art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. ""U-M-R! U-M-R! UMA janai yo umaru! U-M-R! U-M-R! UMA janai yo umaru!"" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certainly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action.Of course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\'s so different from us, and Umaru-chan? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\'t already watched this anime and you\'re reading this review, then you\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\'t your style of anime. the greatest anime to be made.

Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Sylphinford Tachibana, who is Umaru\'s sworn rival, yet one of her closest friends. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, ""scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real"" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Taihei is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he\'s cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Himoto Umaru is strong-hearted, and ""special"", but she\'s still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How she develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime.The art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people\'s eyes as well. A new form of action that\'s never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. ""U-M-R! U-M-R! UMA janai yo umaru! U-M-R! U-M-R! UMA janai yo umaru!"" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certainly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action.Of course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What\'s so different from us, and Umaru-chan? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven\'t already watched this anime and you\'re reading this review, then you\'ve clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn\'t your style of anime.', ""Rating: 4the plot seems interesting and has much potencial, It's entertaining at the first episodes but they repeat and recycle the same jokes and gets you boredThe title is generic,but the theme of Himouto is very attractive to the Japanese audiences.yeah, the main character is cute and interesting at first but I hate her now after few episodes because it gets so bad along the way (pardon my english, I'm not Native speaker)>The art is average to high.

I hope the author of the original manga never comes up with such a character idea ever again, especially not as a main character.Her ""personas"" are severely exaggerated, and while exaggeration of some traits is a common comedy trope, there\'s some point which if you get past it stops being funny and starts being annoying, and Umaru is far beyond it.

Boring and generic brother, tsundere, fangirl, etc. the tsundere especially for me is pathetic. I feel like Umaru chan as a character and anime is targeted at the massive weebs who live of chibi anime characters.

I wanted to reach into my screen and beat the shit out of...the bitches in this anime.2) the humour is obnoxious and executed terribly. The humour just goes off of video games and pathetic characters. Many video game references that im guessing are supposed to make you laugh (just want to say references ≠ funny).

Each episode was split direct into two mini episodes, it was sad. The only connection among all the episodes was the progression throughout the year. Like you have one storyline, commercial, then it changes gear to a whole new story line. Only in the end did they begin to explore some of the potential, but even then it wasn't much.

Umaru-chan is the epitome of living a chill life. I\'m going to go into detail about why I like this anime. I feel like by watching this show, I\'ve got a better understanding of what Japan\'s culture has to offer, and it all looks good to me, especially the food and ramen is one of my favorites.Story:The plot is basically about a girl living in Japan who loves lazing around at home, and enjoying all the twenty-first century luxuries most of us in the developed world have. The show shows her home life and all the things you can do, from playing video games,...to playing with your hamsters, to watching anime with a cola at your side. Seriously, that one episode with the different versions of herself in her head arguing what snack to eat was hilarious! Each episode can be watched stand-alone and the story will still make sense. Every episode is a mini-adventure through the fun activities Umaru does, which a lot of times is at home, and sometimes outdoors with her friends or shopping with her Onii-san. If you like slice-of-life anime, and still have a kid living inside you, you will probably like this show.Art:The art of Umaru when she acts like a himouto is really funny because she\'s so little and that\'s fitting cause she acts just like a kid would. When she goes out she has that perfect, studious girl look that I like and she looks pretty when she acts refined like that.Can I just say that the food in this anime sometimes looks extremely appetizing? Seriously, looking at the close-up of ramen in episode seven with Umaru\'s descriptive narration over it sounded like a professional foodie and made my mouth water.Characters:Every character felt very unique, and I appreciated them all.I like Umaru a lot. Umaru is excellent at describing the food she eats. She know the perfect combinations of snacks and it\'s fun to hear what she thinks is best with what. I think she opens a window into what you can do for fun just by staying at home. Even though she puts on a facade when she goes outside, she can still do things she likes, but just in disguise like as UMR when she goes to the arcade. I think it\'s cool how she has so many different personalities. She\'s really interesting and creative, because most of the time she wants to have fun and it\'s fun for me to see that and take notes from her book of how to have fun.I liked Ebina-chan. Umaru and Ebina are great because they\'re both really nice people, but Ebina is just so shy, it\'s funny. She is hesitant to ask for more food, state how much she likes the food she\'s eating, has a secret crush on Onii-chan. I liked when Ebina broke into her dialect sometimes, like when she was eating that tasty meal in episode two with Umaru and Onii-san. She felt even more personable when we saw the flashbacks of her home life, which was interesting to see because she used to live in such a rural setting. I could relate to her politeness and nice demeanor a lot, I think.Kirie-chan was a little uncomfortable to watch, but that\'s what was entertaining. I can relate to the awkward character because I can imagine having those uncomfortable situations with strangers and even friends sometimes. I thought it was super funny when she made Komaru her master, even though it was really Umaru. She has an... interesting... relationship with her brother, but even so, I kind of wished it resolved more in the last episode. The comic relief with her hitting him was funny, but I still feel bad for Takeshi. There are some unanswered questions about her home life, but that\'s what you get with short animes like this. Definitely /not/ a bad character; she was a cute follower and admirer of Umaru, and it\'s a good quality to want to be attracted to someone who seems perfect.Sylphyn felt overly competitive, but it was understandable because she needs someone to compete against since her family is prestigious and seemingly rich and expect a lot out of her. Syphyn became easier to like because she spontaneously wanted to go to an old-fashioned candy store in episode seven, and did I mention she likes video games? It\'s fun to see her compete with Umaru in everything because she always plays to win, and that\'s a good thing, to want victory. Definitely not my favorite character, but still she added more fun to the show, with her emphatic movements, and how expressive she was. Literally, the pupils of her eyes are shaped like stars, she sparkles with all her movements, and she talks a little differently from the rest of the cast, like for example she says ""indeed"" when she agrees with Umaru, which makes her unique.Onii-chan, or Taihei, was a good character too. I saw some reviewers call him a generic, regular guy, but he\'s really more than that. Yes, he is a Yes-man, and says yes to Umaru for most things she wants to buy and do, but he\'s genuinely caring for her too. He thinks critically about Umaru\'s well-being, like in the last episode taking advantage of her longing to go to the beach, and seeing it as an opportunity because she usually prefers to stay indoors. That\'s healthy and we as the audience should appreciate that. He\'s also a skillful cook. I remember one episode he made something healthy for Umaru, and she doesn\'t usually like greens, but he made it for dinner and she didn\'t eat much. That night Umaru asked for steak for lunch, and then he mixed in the greens with the steak and it was funny when Umaru noticed what he did when she was at school. How would you feel if your big brother mixed your favorite food, with something you don\'t like, but it\'s healthy? It\'s great that he wants Umaru to eat something better than potato chips in episode seven too, because it\'s healthier to eat a meal, not snacks. But I digress, Onii-chan is the epitome of a big brother who loves his younger sister unconditionally, and it\'s cool he has other skills, and also he works so hard! Like when he stayed overtime at work to help his friend Takeshi out, because Takeshi was slow at doing his work. Taihei has so many good qualities and lives out many virtues, and that\'s what makes him a great older brother to Umaru.I like that Umaru, Kirie-chan, and Sylphyn all have brothers, and it\'s touching to see when Syphyn has flashbacks to warm times with her brother. I think sometimes I feel bad for Ebina-chan, that she has no one else she\'s living with, and she\'s away from her family to attend school with Umaru, but I\'m glad at least that she has her own hobbies like learning to cook, going shopping, and entering contests.Sound:I love when they play that silly flute-like instrumentation over when Umaru\'s about to chow down on some yummy food, or when they\'re doing something silly. I like the music that plays when Umaru is with Sylphyn because it fits her personality so well. I like the nostalgic music that plays when they\'re UMR and Sylphyn are in the candy store. I like the piano music that plays when Taihei is telling Umaru to get ready for school. I think the music throughout the show sets the mood accurately, and just as important it sounds good. Whenever I go back and watch an episode, I can always remember the soundtrack, no outstanding melodies inside the episodes though.I liked the opening song because it always immerses you into Umaru\'s universe, which is fun and always a good time. She\'s a himouto, but still a likable character, especially if you can relate to her, and that\'s basically what the opening is about.The ending song is always a refreshing end to each episode, and especially fitting when you think about how it foreshadows the last episode when Umaru and all her friends are at the beach together. We get to see almost the whole cast and it\'s great to see them enjoying themselves on the beach. I\'m glad the anime didn\'t end celebrating at home because that\'d be not as good. Even Kirie has fun, which is nice because she\'s usually reserved.Enjoyment:I really like watching this when I want to take a breather from schoolwork, or I\'m just stressed out. This show has a lot of rewatch value because Umaru does all the things I would totally do in my free time, and a lot of times how Umaru feels and acts is relatable for me. It\'s because of this relatability, fun playing games at home, and enjoyment in eating food that /I/ can find pleasure in taking a break watching this show. It\'s really refreshing to see a character I can see myself in, and I wouldn\'t mind being friends with a real life Umaru. I wouldn\'t mind taking Taihei\'s role in buying her food and stuff like that. Yeah, she\'s lazy, but don\'t we all have those moments sometimes? She really is justified being that way at home because she performs well academically. I guess if you try to put yourself in Taihei\'s shoes, you wouldn\'t like to be nice to your bratty, lazy little sister, but that\'s all you certain people that are like that. I don\'t think I\'d be like that, but I also don\'t have any younger siblings, so I can\'t say for sure.Overall:Overall, this anime plays with the nostalgia of being able to come home from high school and play games right away when I come home. Now that I\'m older and attending secondary schooling it feels like I don\'t have as much time availability, but watching this reminds me of my golden age of lazing around, watching tv, playing video games, watching anime... And she got to do even more than I did, like reading manga—she has her own manga collection and follows the shonen magazines!—going out for ramen, going to arcades, and going to internet cafés. Yes, she is privileged, but they\'re all duly deserved. She takes advantage of those privileges, and she\'s successful in school, so really there\'s no blaming her. This anime wasn\'t anything groundbreaking, but it was solid in storytelling and you can watch any one of the episodes as a standalone story which is something really great about it. The relatability really strikes a chord with me, and that\'s why it really isn\'t a bad anime either. I\'ve got to say an anime that takes me back to my childhood deserves a good score, so that\'s what it gets. to playing with your hamsters, to watching anime with a cola at your side. Seriously, that one episode with the different versions of herself in her head arguing what snack to eat was hilarious! Each episode can be watched stand-alone and the story will still make sense. Every episode is a mini-adventure through the fun activities Umaru does, which a lot of times is at home, and sometimes outdoors with her friends or shopping with her Onii-san.

When she goes out she has that perfect, studious girl look that I like and she looks pretty when she acts refined like that.Can I just say that the food in this anime sometimes looks extremely appetizing? Seriously, looking at the close-up of ramen in episode seven with Umaru\'s descriptive narration over it sounded like a professional foodie and made my mouth water.Characters:Every character felt very unique, and I appreciated them all.I like Umaru a lot. Umaru is excellent at describing the food she eats. She know the perfect combinations of snacks and it\'s fun to hear what she thinks is best with what. I think she opens a window into what you can do for fun just by staying at home. Even though she puts on a facade when she goes outside, she can still do things she likes, but just in disguise like as UMR when she goes to the arcade. I think it\'s cool how she has so many different personalities. She\'s really interesting and creative, because most of the time she wants to have fun and it\'s fun for me to see that and take notes from her book of how to have fun.I liked Ebina-chan. Umaru and Ebina are great because they\'re both really nice people, but Ebina is just so shy, it\'s funny. She is hesitant to ask for more food, state how much she likes the food she\'s eating, has a secret crush on Onii-chan. I liked when Ebina broke into her dialect sometimes, like when she was eating that tasty meal in episode two with Umaru and Onii-san. She felt even more personable when we saw the flashbacks of her home life, which was interesting to see because she used to live in such a rural setting. I could relate to her politeness and nice demeanor a lot, I think.Kirie-chan was a little uncomfortable to watch, but that\'s what was entertaining. I can relate to the awkward character because I can imagine having those uncomfortable situations with strangers and even friends sometimes. I thought it was super funny when she made Komaru her master, even though it was really Umaru. She has an... interesting... relationship with her brother, but even so, I kind of wished it resolved more in the last episode. The comic relief with her hitting him was funny, but I still feel bad for Takeshi. There are some unanswered questions about her home life, but that\'s what you get with short animes like this. Definitely /not/ a bad character; she was a cute follower and admirer of Umaru, and it\'s a good quality to want to be attracted to someone who seems perfect.Sylphyn felt overly competitive, but it was understandable because she needs someone to compete against since her family is prestigious and seemingly rich and expect a lot out of her. Syphyn became easier to like because she spontaneously wanted to go to an old-fashioned candy store in episode seven, and did I mention she likes video games? It\'s fun to see her compete with Umaru in everything because she always plays to win, and that\'s a good thing, to want victory. Definitely not my favorite character, but still she added more fun to the show, with her emphatic movements, and how expressive she was. Literally, the pupils of her eyes are shaped like stars, she sparkles with all her movements, and she talks a little differently from the rest of the cast, like for example she says ""indeed"" when she agrees with Umaru, which makes her unique.Onii-chan, or Taihei, was a good character too. I saw some reviewers call him a generic, regular guy, but he\'s really more than that. Yes, he is a Yes-man, and says yes to Umaru for most things she wants to buy and do, but he\'s genuinely caring for her too. He thinks critically about Umaru\'s well-being, like in the last episode taking advantage of her longing to go to the beach, and seeing it as an opportunity because she usually prefers to stay indoors. That\'s healthy and we as the audience should appreciate that. He\'s also a skillful cook. I remember one episode he made something healthy for Umaru, and she doesn\'t usually like greens, but he made it for dinner and she didn\'t eat much. That night Umaru asked for steak for lunch, and then he mixed in the greens with the steak and it was funny when Umaru noticed what he did when she was at school. How would you feel if your big brother mixed your favorite food, with something you don\'t like, but it\'s healthy? It\'s great that he wants Umaru to eat something better than potato chips in episode seven too, because it\'s healthier to eat a meal, not snacks. But I digress, Onii-chan is the epitome of a big brother who loves his younger sister unconditionally, and it\'s cool he has other skills, and also he works so hard! Like when he stayed overtime at work to help his friend Takeshi out, because Takeshi was slow at doing his work. Taihei has so many good qualities and lives out many virtues, and that\'s what makes him a great older brother to Umaru.I like that Umaru, Kirie-chan, and Sylphyn all have brothers, and it\'s touching to see when Syphyn has flashbacks to warm times with her brother. I think sometimes I feel bad for Ebina-chan, that she has no one else she\'s living with, and she\'s away from her family to attend school with Umaru, but I\'m glad at least that she has her own hobbies like learning to cook, going shopping, and entering contests.Sound:I love when they play that silly flute-like instrumentation over when Umaru\'s about to chow down on some yummy food, or when they\'re doing something silly. I like the music that plays when Umaru is with Sylphyn because it fits her personality so well. I like the nostalgic music that plays when they\'re UMR and Sylphyn are in the candy store. I like the piano music that plays when Taihei is telling Umaru to get ready for school. I think the music throughout the show sets the mood accurately, and just as important it sounds good. Whenever I go back and watch an episode, I can always remember the soundtrack, no outstanding melodies inside the episodes though.I liked the opening song because it always immerses you into Umaru\'s universe, which is fun and always a good time. She\'s a himouto, but still a likable character, especially if you can relate to her, and that\'s basically what the opening is about.The ending song is always a refreshing end to each episode, and especially fitting when you think about how it foreshadows the last episode when Umaru and all her friends are at the beach together. We get to see almost the whole cast and it\'s great to see them enjoying themselves on the beach. I\'m glad the anime didn\'t end celebrating at home because that\'d be not as good. Even Kirie has fun, which is nice because she\'s usually reserved.Enjoyment:I really like watching this when I want to take a breather from schoolwork, or I\'m just stressed out. This show has a lot of rewatch value because Umaru does all the things I would totally do in my free time, and a lot of times how Umaru feels and acts is relatable for me. It\'s because of this relatability, fun playing games at home, and enjoyment in eating food that /I/ can find pleasure in taking a break watching this show. It\'s really refreshing to see a character I can see myself in, and I wouldn\'t mind being friends with a real life Umaru. I wouldn\'t mind taking Taihei\'s role in buying her food and stuff like that. Yeah, she\'s lazy, but don\'t we all have those moments sometimes? She really is justified being that way at home because she performs well academically. I guess if you try to put yourself in Taihei\'s shoes, you wouldn\'t like to be nice to your bratty, lazy little sister, but that\'s all you certain people that are like that. I don\'t think I\'d be like that, but I also don\'t have any younger siblings, so I can\'t say for sure.Overall:Overall, this anime plays with the nostalgia of being able to come home from high school and play games right away when I come home. Now that I\'m older and attending secondary schooling it feels like I don\'t have as much time availability, but watching this reminds me of my golden age of lazing around, watching tv, playing video games, watching anime... And she got to do even more than I did, like reading manga—she has her own manga collection and follows the shonen magazines!—going out for ramen, going to arcades, and going to internet cafés. Yes, she is privileged, but they\'re all duly deserved. She takes advantage of those privileges, and she\'s successful in school, so really there\'s no blaming her. This anime wasn\'t anything groundbreaking, but it was solid in storytelling and you can watch any one of the episodes as a standalone story which is something really great about it. The relatability really strikes a chord with me, and that\'s why it really isn\'t a bad anime either. I\'ve got to say an anime that takes me back to my childhood deserves a good score, so that\'s what it gets.', ""this show has one thing that i tries to do and dose it horribly. it tries to appeal to the people that watch anime and play video games and i has this weird idea that if it fills itself with these references then it is going to appeal to people.It's comedy reminds me of rick and morty in the fact that it has an ego that is derived from telling a bunch of pop culture references that the viewer can notice and relate to. and this works as well in this show as it does in rick and morty. absolutely dismally.add to that the...fact that if a show is trying to relate to an audience then they should not create a character that portrays the audience as whiny, crybaby, autistic baby's with no redeeming quality's other then the fact that they are cute and there best friend has a nice pair of tits. this causes the audience to hate there own kind.this show is a head ache. but there is some alright hentai that was made using the characters and at least i could put that to use. fact that if a show is trying to relate to an audience then they should not create a character that portrays the audience as whiny, crybaby, autistic baby's with no redeeming quality's other then the fact that they are cute and there best friend has a nice pair of tits. this causes the audience to hate there own kind.this show is a head ache. but there is some alright hentai that was made using the characters and at least i could put that to use."", ""I fucking love Umaru.

It's also a more lowkey affair, with various unrelated little chapter adaptations in each episode. You can watch it in very short chunks, if you're so inclined.The show is nothing more than a slice of life series with a cute main character, and it doesn't need to be more. Not everything needs to be MHA's diabolical sludge of poorly put together moral grandstanding.

I came with high expectations due to its score but from my experience, it's pretty mediocre.

Umaru-chan prior to watching it was that it was simply dumb and for some reason caused a lot of butthurt among a lot of people. One day I put on the first episode out of impulse/curiosity. To my surprise, it was actually decent. I ended up watching both seasons and the OVAs.Sibling relationships are a dominating theme. This is personally very depressing. Be warned. I had to stop watching sometimes because I'd start to think about my own family and would become very sad. This isn't a negative aspect of the anime, in fact it's a potent mechanism of emotional engagement....That said, one's reaction to the sibling relationship theme will be highly individual.Another prevalent theme is the glorification of one's hobbies and leisure, which is obviously very relatable. Actually a lot of the themes explored in Umaru are relatable, I think. Various elements of Japanese culture are commonly included in the show, ranging from traditions to more otaku-ish stuff.The series has broad appeal and is easily digestible. The quality is consistent. This would be good material for someone relatively new to the anime medium, I think.Good direction. The show smoothly jumps from happy uplifting scenes, to light conflict, to comedy etc...Episodes typically consist of scenes which are entertaining in isolation, but are woven together by a light episodic plot of some kind. Sweet moments are skillfully implemented within the light-hearted writing.Very 'watchable' show overall.The characters are simple but they do have good chemistry. There are funny scenes sometimes. The characters are cute and there are a lot of cute outfits!In terms of likability, the cast is kind of a mixed bag. A lot could be said about this, but I'll summarize by saying that some aspects of the character personalities could be considered unlikable, and that one's own viewpoint on this will be highly individual. Regardless of the specifics though, I think the most common criticism of this anime is that character(s) are in some way unlikable or unethical. I'm sympathetic to this argument, but my own view is that it's just a fun light comedy SOL show and if you're sitting there doing a complex analysis of ethics then you are watching the wrong show for your mood. Go do a tiring day of work and come back, or put on a more intellectually demanding anime. Stop watching things that don't fit your mood. That said, I think the anime would be improved with better-written characters, but I also think people are overreacting when they say that it's literally unwatchable because of the cast. This is yet another aspect of the show that will invoke a reaction that is strongly dependent on the viewer. Perhaps these highly variable audience reactions are why this anime stirred up so much butthurt.The animation and art style are unremarkable. The OST is unremarkable, though I liked the S1 ED song. Also, the S2 ED animation is CUTE CUTE CUTE!A lot of SOL shows tend to fizzle out as they progress. For this reason I had guarded expectations of the second season of Umaru. Actually though, season 2 was pretty good.I'd liken watching Umaru to eating plain potato chips. It's not complex or unique, but it's still consistently good and you can consume a lot in one sitting and not even realize it.Overall rating: 7/10-kind of spoiler below-a lot of light-hearted episodic anime tend to be ruined when the author attempts to introduce some kind of plot. In this case during the second season I found that the theme of private lives/secrets among the characters was handled well. It didn't intrude too much on the episodic SOL, but still provided a compelling and relatable theme for the viewer while simultaneously adding a little more character development. It also provided some relief from the repetition of season 1. I think this is a good example of mild plot injection for an SOL series being handled well.

No major critiques here but it\'s anime like these that we identify as having a lot of money spent on the animation and audio but literally none on the source material, story and characters. The...animation is impressive, high quality but it doesn\'t exactly have that distinctive value or appeal that differs from other anime; good, but generic. The same can be said for sound, not that unique either.If you\'re looking for a story dense anime with a thrilling plot set out to shred you to tears or to scare the living shit out of you... just fuck off. There\'s essentially no story apart from this: perfect study who is a demon at home. Literally.Characters are pretty straightforward, not much else to say. Our protagonist, Umaru is a student who is perfect in every way, and quite frankly the opposite at home.Did I enjoy this? I enjoyed this show because it was shit, and solely for that reason.

This time the premise is straight-A student Umaru who acts perfect in public and then turns into a lazy child when she's home alone. It's totally made for hardworking high school or college kids to relate to, with the exception being that most of us don't come across as perfect by day, but as tired, caffeine-addicted drones who lose all work ethic the moment we get home.The style gimmick of Umaru's physical transformation into this hamster-looking thing fits the show very well,...and makes for a super-recognizable, simple character who looks great on merchandise. Umaru is transparently trying to be the Garfield of anime girls here, an infinitely marketable icon of sloth for the zoomer otaku to relate to.It's enjoyable for an episode or two, but unfortunately, the show goes nowhere with this idea, unless you count vague incestual undertones with her creepy older brother. Had this been a series of three-minute shorts I might be praising it, but stretched out to about four hours of content you'll find your appreciation of Umaru-chan fading fast. and makes for a super-recognizable, simple character who looks great on merchandise.

You'll either like it or not. "", 'I don\'t tend to write reviews but I feel like I need to ""rage"" somewhere.Umaru-chan is the biggest disappointment I experienced while watching anime in years! Umaru-chan is quite famous online, lots of clips and memes are out there, quite few people online praised it as well, so I thought ok this might be a cute anime with an otaku / gamer girl - I should be able to relate to this.I lasted 2 episodes. Barely.I will not question the quality of jokes, the actual representation of otaku culture etc., but 1 thing I absolutely cannot stand is... Umaru-chan herself.I cannot think on top...of my head the more annoying character in anime that is a main one!Her relationship with her brother is so toxic and abusive. I am a 25 years old woman, so when I see a brat waking up her hard-working brother at 5am on Sunday while he is clearly stressed out and exhausted because... she\'s bored... I am fuming. Teenager throwing a fit because she wants a brand new game - how is this entertaining in any way? Sorry, but the only way I can see others enjoying this show is when they\'re acting like Umaru-chan themselves, to which I\'d highly suggest therapy.Jokes aside, everyone is entitled to their opinion and preferences but honestly, don\'t. Thousands shows out there, don\'t waste your time on this. of my head the more annoying character in anime that is a main one!Her relationship with her brother is so toxic and abusive.

Umaru-chan is an anime series that captivated me with its portrayal of a cute little girl who offers a humorous reflection of today's gamer culture. Umaru's dual persona, as both the perfect high school student and a lazy, junk food-loving gamer at home, adds a delightful twist to the story.The show brilliantly captures the essence of many gamers' lives, showing us the escapism and indulgence in unhealthy habits that can sometimes come with the territory. Umaru's love for video games, junk food, and her often manipulative behavior towards her brother, all while maintaining her adorable exterior, makes for a hilarious and relatable experience.The characters...are endearing and easy to root for, and the humor is on point. Whether it's her obsession with cola, her wild late-night gaming sessions, or her interactions with her friends, Himouto! Umaru-chan never fails to entertain.While the show doesn't delve too deep into complex themes, it excels at what it sets out to do – providing light-hearted comedy and an enjoyable glimpse into the life of a modern-day gamer. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a good laugh and a charming story that doesn't take itself too seriously. are endearing and easy to root for, and the humor is on point.

For Himouto! Umaru-chan, it\'s Doma Umaru who lives a perfect 16-year-old life whenever outside the apartment she and her big brother Taihei live in, a polar opposite to the situation within the building\'s confines as she mushes into a rotten freeloading bloodsucker of finances and tranquility. She echoes the NEET lifestyle bar her surreal exterior ""UMARU~N"" transformation when the situation arises and...her close relationship with Taihei. This stark contrast between Umaru\'s parasitic recluse persona taking advantage of the comfort and security her hardworking salaryman for a big brother provides her, lazing around like a bum while constantly inconveniencing Taihei, and her image as the most loved, most talented, effortless in both academics and athletics high school student cycles in every episode.And I\'ve got to say, I actually find it decently average. That\'s a praise.More praises to come! So while everyone and their grandmothers describe Umaru in the same vein, I have little vexations reserved for her. She\'s a pest, but the author\'s approach on how she\'s written and the usual mindset I\'ve equipped whenever I click an episode make her an adorable pest--at least, more tolerable than some other melancholic girl. Having to see her in the lens of fiction truly abated much of the annoyance I\'d naturally have for someone as childish as her; it\'s the cherry on top. But what makes her rather endearing to me?It\'s that formulaic gimmick itself that replays multiple times per episode when she\'s in her Hamster form. Her slothful escapades involving Taihei comes off as entertaining more frequently than irksome (since the comedy is usually at his expense). It\'s so predictably cliched in anime fashion, and that\'s what makes it amusing to me. At times wholesomeness chimes in which puts Umaru back to upright senses. This kindles warm awkwardness in the atmosphere as both siblings exchange direct acts of care. In this way, Himouto! Umaru-chan tries to manipulate the viewer to gradually trivialize Umaru\'s irresponsible demeanor, but then you remember, it\'s junk food anime! Entertaining the audience despite twisted conditions is the name of the game.And talking about wholesomeness, I do have my limits in disregarding their character progressions. The anime always balances and/or overpowers it with more mischief and disrespect from Umaru. I can\'t say I like that, but it\'s your typical SoL comedy anime so I just learned to shrug intricacies like that off without much indignation, as with other incompetencies. This shift in judgment to accommodate the story\'s intent allowed me to enjoy this more than I thought.Insert: Hamster Umaru\'s infantile image over childish and teenage behavior, her voice acting, her manipulations and ulterior motives driven by hedonistic desires, and other elements combined to make her work as a character.I can\'t say much about anything else really. Production-wise, I don\'t think anything really stood out. The characters are basically cardboards with chemistry. I like Sylphyn, though, bless her.Junk Food: The Anime / Himouto!
