Kuruneko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6604/Kuruneko,"[""I challenge anyone to watch the first few episodes and not binge the rest. It's that addicting, and why not? It's very cute, the characters are terribly enjoyable, the minimal art style is a joy and every episode tells a very relatable and adorable tale as to why cats are vexing.We're introduced to every cat and how the family came to be, and with every episode, we also get a glimpse to the owner's personality. Every cat is a one-note character sure, but they're cats. It suits them well.I think it's also important to note that  I'm a dog person. ""]"
Love Hina Haru Special: Kimi Sakura Chiru Nakare!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/192/Love_Hina_Haru_Special__Kimi_Sakura_Chiru_Nakare,"['This is a typical special episode.. There really isnt much here for someone looking for a bit of a ""conclusion"" on the Keitaro x Naru arc.. But the one thing that this special does do.. is give you more of a prespective into the Shinobu x Keitaro arc.  You learn more about her feelings and thoughts.. I wished they would have went ahead and made it into a special completely from her prespective.. but.. they did enough for me to develop her character and feelings a bit more..But.. This IS a special so.. its basically for the fans.. It doesnt really have anything to...do with the storyline.. and its more like a mini-movie for fans of the series.The art is the same as the series.. the music is still good.. and it has the same comedic hi-jinks. If you like the series.. youll like this too! I hope you enjoy! do with the storyline.. and its more like a mini-movie for fans of the series.The art is the same as the series.. the music is still good.. and it has the same comedic hi-jinks. If you like the series.. youll like this too! I hope you enjoy!', ""Let's get down with the review.-Keitaro got a tan.-Keitaro finally got into Tokyo U, but the rest of the episode is spent on the girls locating him just to tell him that.-There's an alternate dark side Shinobu.-At the waterfall scene both Naru and Nyamo had to change into leaf clothes after their shirts had been soaked with water but few scenes later Nyamo changes back into her normal clothes while Naru is still in leaf clothing. Okay.-The scene at the end is an important event, as it is an important progress for both Naru and Keitaro's relationship. Might as well be saying that this whole...episode is worth it just for that scene. Even Love Hina Again will reference to this scene.The audience would not miss anything by skipping this out but the confession scene at the end still looks pretty important in preparation for Love Hina Again. episode is worth it just for that scene.

However, in the final stretch, he fails miserably and daydreams through the test. Assuming that he has failed, he runs away, so the rest of the cast hunts him down on a remote desert island to bring him back.I might as well call this special, “The FUCK IT ALL” special because we’re just going through the same shit again with Keitaro trying to pass his entrance exam to be in Tokyo U for the umpteenth time but manages to fuck that up and ended up being at a desert island.Sorry if I don’t have...much to say on this because they’re really isn’t much to say about this. Keitaro is going through some shit we’ve seen before. Shinobu’s storyline isn’t that much vital anyway considering that whole “this guy likes me but I’m obviously in love with Keitaro” plotline isn’t referenced that much in the OVA and of course, there is another character, this island girl named Nyamo, who is basically a darker skinned version of Shinobu and her plot of finding her father or grandfather or something…….yeah, the OVA didn’t have much care about it so why should I?And yes, those Keitaro/Naru moments are back and still annoying as ever, especially with one scene where she’s chasing him throughout the desert and even when she’s almost exhausted, she still tries to hit him. Stop with that shit!!! It wasn’t cute nor funny the first time and it’s not going to be this time either, it’s just an annoying gag that got overused way too much in this franchise and it only justifies as why should we care if these two idiots get together in the end. Even if there was a conclusion to that story, I still wouldn’t care that much about it. Yeah, as I said in the Again review….their problem isn’t the fan service, it’s their comedy and their schmaltzy attempts of getting sentiment from the audience. You want to make something with enough laughs and heart? Then don’t follow Love Hina’s example!!!As for the animation and sound, they are about as equal to the series and the last OVA, The Christmas Special, and they isn’t really nothing new to add on the animation front. It was daring and new at the time it come around but it’s just mostly the standard as of……well, a few years ago. Music is just the same cutesy yet annoying tone but it gets worse during the Spring Special and worse of all, The English dub is just so horrible…….my god, this is a bad one. All the voices sound too high-pitched and girly even when it’s the voice actresses giving it their all and while I may like some of these actresses, I think their talents were abused during this OVA.FINAL VERDICT: I’m so glad I’m done with this franchise. Just so fucking done. I hate Love Hina within all my heart and this is never going to change. You don’t give a shit about the story, the characters, and you wonder why you even thought of going along with this in the first place. much to say on this because they’re really isn’t much to say about this.

Lady Georgie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2542/Lady_Georgie,"['Lady Georgie is like a rosy fire on a snowy day. This treasure will enchant you....The richness of animation, the vastness of location and the fairylands of the heart. These things permeate and encompass the long lost tale of Lady Georgie. There are so many beautiful things to discover in the older world of anime. Lady Georgie is one of these presents. It is a tale of romance, the entanglement of fate, mans desire and the perplexities of maternal nature. At first glance, one may think the anime is superficial in its intent to portray a triangular love story, but this would be an...incorrect assumption.There are many deeper themes that are garlanded within the flowery meadow of Lady Georgie. but only after and during watching should the viewer be enabled to see them. In this review I deliberately wished to avoid mentioning what is so moving about this anime. Because only by watching it will you understand.This is a romantic anime in many ways. The painting style, the sensitive, delicate, yet realistic portrayal of human emotion, and the almost Shakespearean portrayal of love makes ""Lady Georgie"" a pure treasure when compared  to other shoujo anime of its type. The maturity of this anime in terms of sophistication and elegance cannot be overstated. The is no rushed moments. Each character has depth. Each moment has been engraved beautifully with every scene filled with sweetness. The time has been taken to deliver an enlivened masterpiece. The story is very rich and really feels like a true voyage.  It is sophisticated because it does not concede to cliché. There is a sense of realism in every scene, even though it is still a fairytale of sorts. It is old fashioned in nature, and feels very heartwarming and rare because of this.  It is quaint yet magical. It is dearer than anything that attempts to be like it. incorrect assumption.There are many deeper themes that are garlanded within the flowery meadow of Lady Georgie. but only after and during watching should the viewer be enabled to see them.

So I wrote this review before I realized I actually couldn't complete the series and had to finish it with the manga. Sorry in advance to those who had the hope to still watch it. I have checked and still haven't found it online.------- Edited the 10st...September 2021--------My curious character couldn´t avoid watching it all from start to end and more than once I wanted to slap or punish some bad character. It was the time when bullies were the perfect antagonist to make the perfect cocktail in children/teenager anime story and that wouldn´t be less. Difference is, the antagonists weren´t some childish same-age neighbour/classmates. They were real adults, with their darkness and secret intentions.The love-triangle wouldn´t dissapoint me one bit, as that was the main issue here. The cringiness and cheesiness wouldn´t keep me away yet as there were many special details that concerned real life Aussie History.It was a little long, like many other similar stories, but at least it got to the very end and had its own conclussion. I wasn´t dissapointed at all, it was what it was for this kind of story. What let me wide-eyed was the very last chapter. It's up to you if you want to find out or not.

Discotek Media has started making an effort to put out more shoujo and magical girl stuff as of late, something many fans are very happy about, especially since a lot of those titles either never came to the US officially or were neglected in previous years. One such title that Discotek put on Blu-Ray recently is Lady Georgie, based on the manga by Mann Izawa and Yumiko Igarashi that ran from 1982 to...1984. The anime was made concurrently with the manga in 1983, but it wouldn't get brought to the US until 2023, a whole forty years after its first premiere in Japan. It never even received good fansubs. Since it's so rare for eighties shoujo anime to get brought to the US in any capacity, I figured I'd buy Lady Georgie to give Discotek incentive to license more in the future. Hell, for all I know, they probably will in the future thanks to all the money Berserk is netting them right now. But now that I've actually watched the series...yeah, there are reasons why Lady Georgie never came to the US. I think its an okay show, and the changes the anime made to it might have actually helped it in a lot of ways, but Lady Georgie is not only very much a product of its time, it has a lot of elements that really would not fly today.But what's the story, you might ask? Georgie Buttman (Yes, that is how her name is officially spelled. The people at Discotek confirmed it with the mangakas themselves) is a cheerful, energetic young girl living with her family on a farm in late 19th century Australia. However, even though her father and two brothers Abel and Arthur adore her very much, her mother Mary seems to resent her. What she doesn't know is that her family actually found her in the middle of a storm, with the only clue to her true lineage being a golden bracelet. But early in her life, Georgie grows up happily alongside her brothers, and at one point meeting and falling in love with the dashing Lowell J. Gray, the grandson of the then governor of Sydney. When Georgie finally learns the truth about her true heritage, she decides to journey to London to learn more about her birth parents and find Lowell again, with her brothers following in hot pursuit for reasons of their own.Alright, there's no point in hiding it, so let's get the elephant out of the room: The bulk of Lady Georgie consists of a love triangle between Georgie and her two adopted brothers, so basically non-blood-related incest. For what little it's worth, compared to the manga, which has one of the brothers actually consummate their relationship with Georgie (Ugh!), the anime changes things drastically in that while Abel and Arthur do fight over her quite a bit and try to pursue her, it's completely one-sided on their parts and it never manages to go beyond simply confessing how they feel and eventually accepting the fact that Georgie rejected them. Thank God, because if Lady Georgie's anime had been a faithful adaptation of the manga, I wouldn't have touched it with a ten foot pole as I abhor sibling incest romance in anything. That's pretty much the only reason I even bothered to watch the anime, because it either removed or toned down a lot of the manga's grosser aspects, though that's not to say the anime is perfect. I have no interest in reading the manga for the fact that it actually makes the incest subtext actual text, so for anybody who's turned off by that, Lady Georgie's anime provides a better alternative.Speaking of the anime, it's a serviceable production all things considered, even if it's held back by the limitations of the technology of the period and due to Japan's bubble economy not having happened yet, so it wouldn't have had the higher budget of later eighties anime. I do think Yumiko Igarashi's trademark shoujo character designs made transition to the screen pretty well, and what the anime lacks in fluidity and kinetic motion, it manages to make up for with well-drawn backgrounds and setpieces and really capturing the look of 19th century Australia. I will admit, as an American, my knowledge of Australia and its history is pretty limited, so I don't know how the anime producers went about researching Australia and whether their depiction of it is accurate or not. But even with my limited knowledge of Australia, I can say that no koala I've seen behaves the way Rapp does, and it's very easy to tell he's an original creation of the anime made solely to be a cute comic relief animal character, even though he flat-out disappears when the setting moves from Australia to London in the latter half. The music is pretty nice for its time period, and both the opening and ending, sung by Georgie's seiyuu Yuriko Yamamoto, are pleasant to listen to.Remember in my review of Dear Brother, I mentioned that the anime for that added a lot of new scenes and expanded on some characters' backstories, which actually benefitted them quite a lot? Lady Georgie does the same thing. Since the manga is only 5 volumes long and the anime has 45 episodes, the anime opted to really expand on Georgie's early life in Australia, detailing her childhood starting from age 6-7 and ending when she turns 15. The manga actually starts just before the boomerang contest, but in the anime, the boomerang contest doesn't take place until episode 24, more than halfway into the anime's run, so most everything before then is anime original. I actually like that the anime took its time to flesh out Georgie, Abel, Arthur, and the rest of the characters early on, because it allows the audience to get invested in them before getting to the harder drama so you'll actually care what happens to them. If the anime had started at the same point as the manga, it probably wouldn't have made the same impact and would have resulted in a lot of pacing issues. Lady Georgie's slow and steady approach not only helps the characters, but the pacing and story progression, and it never feels like the anime is rushing to get through all its major plot points.Interestingly enough, the anime also makes changes to some characters' personalities that actually humanize them more and make them feel less like one-note cartoonish villains. For example, in the manga, Georgie's adoptive mother Mary is abusive and cruel through and through, whereas the anime, while still keeping her resentment of Georgie and worries about Abel and Arthur falling in love with her, goes out of its way to show her at least trying to connect with Georgie and showing her genuine affection on occasion, making her feel more human and sympathetic, and her crueler moments hit harder, especially when Georgie learns the truth behind her lineage. Another character, Jessica, is made much less cartoonishly villainous. In the manga, she has a crush on Abel but when she finds out that he loves Georgie, she tries to hire a hitman to kill her while she's heading to London and even wishing she'd die. In the anime, she still crushes on Abel and gets jealous of Georgie, but her murderous plotting is excised in favor of having her just try to get Georgie out of the way via suggesting she get on a boat manned by a sailor she knows. It also tones down other villains' more crueler actions, such as removing Irwin drugging and raping Arthur in favor of just simply holding him prisoner and foiling Abel's attempts at saving him. I think the anime's changes really helped Lady Georgie, both from expanding on some characters' personalities and backstories, humanizing some and making them more sympathetic, or just getting rid of the grosser aspects of the whole incesty love triangle plot.However, Lady Georgie isn't a perfect anime, and its pseudo-incest plot, while the biggest problem the series has, is just one of its problems. I found Lowell as a character to be rather bland and annoying, mainly because his reasons for falling in love with Georgie don't really have anything to do with Georgie herself, and a lot of the time he came across as objectifying her and seeing her as an ideal and a solution to all his problems rather than as a person. Furthermore, I know Japan has more lax views on child nudity, but there were several points in the anime where Georgie's bare chest is shown completely uncensored, most of which happen when Georgie is still in her early teens. Hell, one scene in the anime shows Arthur stripping naked and cuddling with an also naked Georgie in an attempt to share his body heat with her and save her life, and the way the scene is animated makes it look like they're about to have sex. Do I even need to go into how creepy and gross this is? Yeah, I think I'm starting to understand why the anime never got brought to the US until now. And keep in mind, Lady Georgie is considered a children's series. This is as far as anything goes between Georgie and Arthur, and like I mentioned before, Georgie never gets romantically involved with either adopted brother as opposed to the manga, but...this is still skin-crawlingly unsettling. Finally, the narrator. Decades ago, I reviewed another historical anime called Ie Naki Ko, or Nobody's Boy Remi, and while I love that show to death, one of my biggest complaints is how the narrator is really overused. Not only does the narrator talk in literally every episode, he had this bad tendency to spoil really important plot twists when the show would have been better off revealing them on its own. I think the narrator for Lady Georgie is even more obnoxious in that she does this as well, but also has the bad habit of not only spelling out the characters' thoughts and feelings like she's talking to toddlers, but restating past events that were already established previously. The narrator as a whole feels unneeded because the show does a good enough job of showing the characters growing and revealing the narrative organically. You could cut the narrator out entirely and nothing would be lost.Other than the whole pseudo-incest love triangle going on, Lady Georgie is still your typical eighties shoujo melodrama, complete with family issues, theatrical acting, cheesy eighties sound effects, and over-the-top plot twists straight out of a soap opera. I do think the anime improved on the manga's problems quite a bit with what it did do, so I'm willing to give it kudos for the things it did right both on that front and on its own merits. I actually think the anime's best episodes are near the finale, where certain characters have to make hard decisions and face genuinely compelling moral dilemmas for the sake of others' happiness, tackling them with a surprising amount of maturity and realism. But overall, Lady Georgie is very much a product of its time, and a lot of what it does absolutely would not fly in the modern era. But if you like this series, I'm not going to judge you for it. I should be happy that Discotek Media put Lady Georgie out on blu-ray in the US, because if enough people buy the series, it'll give them incentive to license more old school shoujo series like Lady Lady, the 70s Haikara-san ga Tooru series, and Hello Sandybelle. We already got stuff like Rose of Versailles, Aim For The Ace, Dear Brother, and a few others like them, so who knows what the future might hold? 1984. The anime was made concurrently with the manga in 1983, but it wouldn't get brought to the US until 2023, a whole forty years after its first premiere in Japan. It never even received good fansubs.

We already got stuff like Rose of Versailles, Aim For The Ace, Dear Brother, and a few others like them, so who knows what the future might hold?""]"
Little Nemo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2286/Little_Nemo,"[""Flowy artwork and enjoyable storyline along with amazing characters make this movie worth watching. I watched it when I was a toddler and grew up loving it. Nemo is a boy plagued by nightmares and when the circus comes to town, he's taken off to Slumberland. There he meets the princess, King Morpheus, and many more friends that bring this adventure to a wonderful climax.  If you liked Spirited away, you'll love Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland. It's based off of a 50's comic strip by the same name. Very underappreciated and underexposed, but well worth watching. "", 'Overview:Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children\'s movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn\'t re-watch this film until recently.Background:Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s,...right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid\'s movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like  The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki\'s Nausicca, and America\'s Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy""  led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca.Plot: 5/10The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche\' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn\'t much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children\'s films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn\'t really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn\'t have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.Characters: 3/10The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan\'s favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn\'t dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that\'s...better?Sound: 5/10It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not.Overall: 5/10Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don\'t blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn\'t really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious. right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid\'s movies.

I still watch it 10 years later! It's just so full of adventure, comedy, and sad moments. The plot, characters, scenery, && music are illustrated && played out very well. It's probably the most unique && original work of art you will ever come across next to Miyuzaki's 'Spirited Away' and 'Howl's Moving Castle'. I would recommened this to just about anyone who shares a love for imagination. This is deffinately worthy of the title 'classic'. "", 'I actually seen this baby nearly 20 years ago when I was a kid. But due to how little I could recall of Little Nemo, I never got around to writing a proper review for it until I got a copy of the film just recently to cover.A little known fact about this film to many folks is that Little Nemo was made as an attempted collaboration between American and Japanese animation studios planned during the early 1980s. However, differences in the creative direction of the film led to enough disputes between both sides that it took years before the film finally got a theatrical...release, which shows rather prominently in how the animation and plot to this are laid out. The look and feel for both are very Western-influenced as Little Nemo looks almost like a Disney film with its character designs and scenery, while sporting fluid movements and animated sequences. For an 80s anime, Little Nemo is easily among one of the better-looking animated films I\'ve seen from the decade, being on par with Studio Ghibli films made during the time.In terms of its plot and characters though, Little Nemo is rather underwhelming in both departments if you\'re not this baby\'s intended target audience of younger children. The cast mostly fill simple character types related to Western animated films and the plot\'s rather haphazard pace limit any world-building or character exploration that could have been utilized. The plot for it also milks a number of storytelling cliches that never get explored as Nemo is the ""chosen one"" to be Slumberland\'s prince, a typical good vs evil conflict involving the Nightmare King in the movie\'s later half, a number of the Slumberland residents looking like those part of the circus troupe he encountered at the start of the film and an attempt at incorporating some sort of moral related to Nemo\'s adventure. Pretty much, the film\'s intent is to keep its plot and characters as simple as possible for its target audience while anyone older may keep wondering why certain stuff to it is never explored.Little Nemo also has its sloppy points in its writing. The later third of the movie features a couple points where Nemo is in some sort of hostile situation, yet he ""wakes up"" away from it only to discover he is still dreaming. The ""wake up"" bits function as a sort of deus ex machina to get Nemo out of trouble and seemed rather lazy in execution. The film\'s attempt at a moral is also rather questionable as it tries connecting a rather mundane incident that Nemo is involved with at the start of the film to later events in it when Nemo unintentionally triggers the threat of the Nightmare King for the film\'s second half. However, the events leading up to the moral being utilized are rather idiotic as a certain character was dumb enough to entrust the safety of his entire kingdom to Nemo (and not warning him of the danger in question) and our lead gets rather easily duped into triggering said events.Overall, Little Nemo is mostly fare for younger children as its plot and characters are way too simple to appeal to older audiences in the same vain that many Studio Ghibli films are. I might have been in awe of the movie as a kid.

I read there that the Little Nemo comic strips in the beginning of the twentieth century went to be highly influential with most comic authors that came afterwards, Disney being one of those.Little Nemo does have something American and occidental in it, but it is an entirely Japanese production, but it certainly doesn’t seems like that, it sure looks more like a Disney or other occidental production. The character designs, as well as everything else in the animation, backgrounds, story, screams Disney.Some trivia...regarding the pre-production of this movie is that Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were to pick this in the beginning, unfortunately they never got to work on it, I wonder how it would have turned if they remained in charge here.Here's a brief description on the story.The story starts with a boy named Nemo and his weasel friend. Somehow Nemo is chosen to be the sole heir of Slumberland, so Little Nemo goes from his home back in NY to Slumberland without thinking twice. He is to learn on how to be a prince and everything that involves being a prince. But the king only asks Nemo to promise him one thing, the King gives Nemo the master key that opens every door in the castle to little Nemo and only makes him promise not to open the door which has the same symbol as the key, the forbidden door. While roaming through the castle, Nemo gets to know a little weird and malicious character, which incites him to run away from his lessons on how being a prince and later while escaping the guards in their fun, incites Nemo to open the forbidden door they that they had found… The rest, you can easily guess asthe story develops in a rather simplistic way.The story was done thinking on an younger audience and it does have a simple story very easy to get without major plot turns for a easy understanding. But the good animation makes it for the simplicity of the story, even I get the feeling that I would like to watch this at a tender age.While being a Japanese movie and being often referenced to Ghibli lovers, Little Nemo is by far a innocent view without any conscious and adult meaning in it. Ghibli recommendations, would probably be Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro for their both innocence.Unfortunately, the file that I got was a dubbed old file, so my enjoyment could have been greater. The English voices sounded too much higher than the other background sounds and the usual music. But still I could notice that they were good voices and did fit each character well. It's a pity that I didn't get to hear the background music in all it's glory, I'll wait for a proper DVD release in the future.Rate: 6/10 - A nice movie, but not really necessary to most folks.

With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it\'s not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be.To start with the animation itself, it\'s actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It\'s smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways...with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best.This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie. Cheers! with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special.

Cheers!', 'Can we all just agree that dreams are fucking weird?  They’re one of the least understood aspects of human life, and everybody but Mike Pence has them.  Their are tons of theories about what their purpose is, what they mean, and why we’re always naked in them, but to this day, nobody can pinpoint what these bizarre movies we get to watch while we’re recharging even are.  Sometimes they have purpose...  Back when I was in a bad relationship where I felt trapped and with no control over my life, I’d constantly dream that I was stuck on a labyrinthian waterslide...that I couldn’t escape from.  But they can be completely nonsensical, too.  Maybe you’re fighting in a war with flamethrowers, but they suddenly turn into waterguns.  Maybe you’re running from a spider that can fit through any crack.  Maybe you’re beating up pedophiles, taunting serial killers, throwing horses at witches, fighting demons in the wild west, meeting people you don’t see anymore, running from a golden car like it’s a metaphor for Satan, or hell, maybe you get into a car crash but wind up in your living room, with your family ominously telling you “It’s waiting.”For little Nemo, dreams aren’t quite like that.  Every single one of his dreams is a lucid one, and he can use them to escape to big fantastical worlds, all by riding on his bed like it’s a magic carpet.  One day, after seeing a parade and wanting desperately to go to the circus, Nemo drifts off and is invited to the world of Slumberland, a country governed by a kind, jovial king and his prickly little daughter, and inhabited by a whole host of wild and zany characters.  Nemo is declared the King’s heir, and entrusted with protecting it from harm, but it isn’t long at all before one of these inhabitants, a chain-smoking green minstrel named Flip, tempts him into letting Slumberland get taken over by a terrifying sea of darkness, which leaves it in shambles and takes the King away to a faraway land.  With the order of a whole world now at stake, there is only one chance at saving it...  Joined by Flip, the princess, a wacky professor and his talking squirrel sidekick, Nemo must brave the horrors of Nightmareland to make everything right again!If I were to show you Little Nemo directly, there are two reactions I expect from you almost immediately.  The first would be disbelief at the fact that Nemo’s not a clownfish(although his world is populated by Clowns), and incredulity at the fact that it really doesn’t look like an anime.  It is, I assure you...  It was produced by Japan and released in Japan three years before it was released in the States, although I’d say roughly a quarter of the people credited to making it are american, including both of the screenwriters.  The production was a mess of almost legendary proportions, with huge names from both sides of the ocean coming into the project and then leaving it just as quickly, leaving influence behind but rarely ever any guidance on how to implement it.  Even Hayao Miyazaki himself was attached at one point, which is probably why the movie opens with a sequence of Nemo flying through the city on his bed.  It was ultimately produced by TMS, a company that made Akira and animated several american cartoons.And speaking of american cartoons, that’s exactly what this movie was based on.  Little Nemo was originally a newspaper comic that ran in the early 1900’s, which doesn’t sound like something an anime would ever be based on, and yet lo and behold, that’s what we have here.  Visually, this is exactly what I’d think of if I was told that an anime was being designed to look like an American product.  First of all, being that this WAS a product of TMS, the animation budget was high, so there’s a lot of fluid animation and graceful character movement, sometimes almost to a fault.  It is very lively, and it makes the movie feel really energetic, but there’s also a certain feeling of over-indulgence to it, like what the Nostalgia Critic might call movement porn.  It never stops moving, which can almost feel exhausting at points.  It’s one of those cases where something was new at the time, and had never really been attempted to such a degree, so of course it was impressive at the time for what it achieved, but looking back, it could have been done better.For example, there’s a scene where the cast engages in a dance at the palace, and Professor Genius starts doing a weird dance(I’d be surprised if The Duke of Wesselton wasn’t at least partially inspired by this), and then the king joins in, and for this strangely surreal moment, it looks like the two are moving in synch, probably through some sort of rotoscoping, despite being at least a foot apart in height.  It’s a really creepy bit of Uncanny valley.  Oh, and speaking of uncanny valley, there’s also the facial animations, which I actually kind of had trouble watching.  Characters were so far removed from your typical anime style that it honestly looks like something Chuck Jones would have animated while shit-face drunk, and this is reflected in the character designs.  Most of the characters look all right, if a bit generic, but the animation doesn’t always work in their favor.  Princess Camille, for example?  Whenever she lets her shoulders slump, she looks more arrow than human.  She looks like the love child of Bob Belcher and Marzipan from the Homestarrunner cartoons.  At least the demons look cool, I guess.When it comes to the music, I was actually kind of expecting the American and Japanese releases to have different soundtracks, but surprisingly, they don’t.  Even though this movie was originally released in Japan, the OST was comprised of English language songs.  On Wikipedia, the music is credited to a few American sounding names, including the Sherman Brothers, who are absolute legends in the field of family film musical scores.  The film’s main theme, which is simply named Little Nemo after the Japanese title of the movie, is beautiful.  I love it.  It works great in the film, carrying the kind of epic whimsy that can only be found in nineties children’s movies, and it’s just as strong when listened to on it’s own.  Melissa Manchester has an amazing voice, which I really shouldn’t have to tell anyone who’s familiar with her work, and it’s a testament to her strength as an artist that she can carry the Sherman Brothers occasionally awkward and flowery lyrics without ever sounding hokey or condescending.Unfortunately, this mark of inspiration doesn’t really carry over to the rest of the soundtrack, which sounds about as standard for a generic children’s movie soundtrack that you can get, with some of the songs being directly attached to scenes that were clearly added to the film just to pad out the run time.  This is no more clear than with the song Etiquette, which I think was supposed to be funny, but just winds up coming off as annoying.  Melissa Manchester is nowhere to be found on this track, but she might not have been able to save it anyway, because she wasn’t able to carry her majesty from Little Nemo over to the song Slumberland, which is just kind of boring over-all.  Songs like Fun and Laughter, The Boomps Song and Princess of Slumberland are safe, saccharine and forgettable, which is sadly par for the course with this soundtrack.  The instrumental tracks are okay, but they’re not the kind of thing that could ever set the world on fire, and there’s nothing about them that really justifies going out of your way to find them.The English dub is...  Well, it’s also okay.  There are a ton of really popular names credited to this film, including a pre-Simpsons Nancy Cartwright and a post-Vampire Hunter D Michael McConnohie.  Actually, there area ton of voice actors attached to this project whose resumes would surprise you, as even beyond famous names like Tress Macneille, Jennifer Darling, Sherry Lynn and the late June Foray, there are names that may have flown under your radar like René Auberjonois and Gabriel Damon, and I’m sad to say this, almost none of them brought their A-game to this project.  There are a few exceptions, like Laura Mooney in the role of the Princess, who was the only cast member who CLEARLY wasn’t trying; Bernard Erhard, who put his heart and soul into making King Morpheus the most likeable guy in the world, and strangely enough Mickey Rooney, who was obviously having a blast playing the mischievous and duplicitous Flip.  It’s not a great dub, but it’s passable enough, which is good, because western releases don’t include a Japanese language sub track.So, here’s an interesting little bit of trivia for you guys:  this was the first anime I ever watched.  It predates my experiences with Pokemon and Dragonball by nearly a decade, even.  When I was little, like really little, my Dad would often rent movies on VHS and bring them home for my brother and me to watch.  He’d go to the grocery store...  Wegmans, in my area...  Rent somne random movie with a G rating and bring it home for us.  For those of you who are confused by those last two sentences, ask your parents.  He’d bring home Disney movies, Don Bluth movies, straight-to-video shitfests(I saw Once Upon a Forest at least three times), and on one occasion, Little Nemo.  Now, as a kid, I didn’t have the greatest attention span, but I always found myself getting absorbed in stories.  I watched movies mostly attentively, and shamed people who didn’t(To this day, I get really annoyed by people who play on their phones during a movie), and as soon as I learned to read, I could go hours without putting a book or comic down.There are some exceptions to this rule, however, and Little Nemo is one of them.  My memory’s not great, but I’m pretty sure I only saw it once, and didn’t really pay attention to it.  Even only a year later, all I could remember about it was the Princess Camille stuff, because even Little Naru loved him some princesses.  I only really wound up thinking about it a few tiomes in the years that followed, like one time when I was reading up on the history of newspaper comics, or when Finding Nemo came out, or when I found out it was an anime, or when The Nostalgia Critic and The Mysterious Mr. Enter did some really good videos on it, ...  But I never really started thinking about it seriously until I started reviewing anime, and I knew I’d have to hit it again eventually.  Well, almost five years in, that time has finally come.  I bought the movie online, let it sit on my coffee table for a few months(don’t judge me) and finally, I popped it in and watched it for the first time in over twenty years, and let me tell you, there’s a reason it bored me as a kid.There’s a lot to unpack here, so to stay focused, I’m not going to go too far into any of the behind the scenes stuff.  Production of this film was famously a nightmare, it’s apparently one of Hayao Miyazaki’s worst professional experiences, it was a huge bomb when it was released, and the production company, TMS, who were riding high after the success of Akira at the time, were so badly damaged by it that they haven’t been the same since.  I don’t personally know any more about any of this than I’ve been told, I haven’t exactly done any research into it’s history...  That’s not really the kind of thing I do here...  But it’s lack of success isn’t really a surprise to me, and if you’ve ever seen it yourself, it doesn’t take a lot of run time to pick up on the fact that it was never going to be anybody’s favorite film for any reason but childhood nostalgia.  The only thing I can really talk about here is my personal experience watching the movie, and if it helps, my thoughts as to why it flopped as hard as it did.First of all, the main character...  The titular Nemo...  Is a special kind of bland.  He has no personality to speak of, he has no interests or goals outside of visiting the circus and doing whatever the plot tells him to do, and if I had to guess, his companion, a little sentient flying squirrel with flight goggles on his head, was added to the story to make him more interesting in the new medium(it didn’t work.  also, how weird is it that they had June Foray in the cast, the voice of rocky, but she didn’t play his arguable rip-off?)).  He just goes with the flow while spouting off lazy little boy one-liners like Yippee!  Gee Whiz! and Wowwee!  He  doesn’t even immediately grasp that a princess is a girl, a conversation which...  to be fair...  Was even dumber in the NES game.  The worst thing about him isn’t how boring or bland he is, however...  It’s how little agency he has in the story.  for the bulk of the movie, he’s just following orders, going along with whatever the other characters want him to do, and when Flip pressures him to go back on some of these orders, he folds like origami.The first real choice he makes is to try and undo that mistake...  about twenty minutes after making it.  He gains some agency in the third act, where he’s leading the charge to the Nightmare castle to rescue everybody, but even then, it’s hard to get invested because you never feel that he has any connection to any of it.  He’s only known any of these people for less than a day, the whole world is just shallow eye candy with nothing substantial to offer, and I’m sorry, but a king who’s willing to hand a key to what’s basically the doors of hell to a child he just met fifteen minutes ago was asking for his kingdom to get taken over.  In stories like these, the hero has to have a personal reason to save the world he’s wandered into, but with Nemo, he just feels like our excuse to explore a bunch of Candyland backgrounds in a barely story-driven animation demo, and the moments of actual story feel either distractingly stupid or gratingly annoying.  When Nemo is being tossed around by spastic tutors trying to educate him on proper behavior, I wouldn’t care if he woke up, got up to use the bathroom, and then went back to bed and dreamed about running from monster tornadoes.  I’d be just as engaged.But perhaps the biggest problem is that we KNOW he’s just having a dream, and that there’s no more to it than that.  Right in the beginning of the movie, we see most of the characters from Slumberland walking down the street in a parade, which is how he came to dream about them.  That’s it.  They’re not real.  None of this is real.  This wouldn’t be such a big deal if the dream-like aspects were the whole point, and it was just supposed to be a trippy experiences, but there’s a story and plot involved, and there’s almost no urgency behind any of it.  If he fails, nothing is lost.  If he succeeds, nothing is gained.  There’s no interesting subtext, no metaphor to speak of, no commentary, just the classic artwork and imagination of Windsor McKay being shown off in a story that doesn’t do any of it justice.  I mean, the only thing that does any work moving the plot forward is the character of Flip, but his motivation in the story is so completely bankrupt that he almost feels like the personification of the audience screaming “Get on with it!”It doesn’t even manage to be dream-like.  Like I said before, dreams are weird.  They don’t have plots, they don’t contain full stories.  Little Nemo is too conventional of a story to even grasp the surrealism that any good dream-based narrative should, at the very least, be able to pull off.  Remember in Nichijou, when characters are put in bizarre situations like having to eat noodles off of a shoot before they hit the ground?  Or having to buy a snowman off of the shelf before it melts, and they do so with actual sincerity, like they believe these tasks to be important?  That’s how dreams work.  Remember Alice in Wonderland, or the old Nightmare Ned computer game?  That’s how dreams work.  Okay, the Nightmare Ned TV series had consistent stories, but at least they had the benefit of being smart and well written.  You wanna show me a dream with a solid narrative?  Make a movie where someone has to deal with a cult of people who brainwash each other into mutilating the bone structure of their faces, or getting stuck in a pizza place that’s a metaphor for purgatory.The actual story is bad enough, but there’s almost no creativity to the visuals, and while I get that the whole movie is based on a preexisting work, and they had established content to work with, but that shouldn’t have limited them so harshly.  It’s an adaptation, but the concept surrounding it was just ripe for updates.  They could have unleashed their imaginations upon the world, using McKay’s imagination as a pretty solid foundation for interpretation, but everything just feels so lazy and uninspired.  The Slumberland sets basically went from Candyland to the ocean to a dark and dreary underworld, and a King of nightmares(or something) who just looked like Chernabog on a juice cleanse.  That’s the best you got?  Give me a demonic three headed goat or something(can you tell I crowd-sourced some weird dream ideas for this review?)!  I haven’t been this disappointed since the villain in Insidious turned out to be Darth Maul’s edge-lord little cousin!  There are so many ways this movie could have been great, but sadly, they didn’t take any of them.Little Nemo, which has the additional subtitle of Adventures of Slumberland over here, is way out of print, but the Easternstar DVD is still really easy to find online for cheap.  The original comic is also easy to find online, but it ain’t cheap, and the books they’re contained in tend to be gigantic, and can be a pain to display because of it.  The entire Little Nemo franchise is in the public domain, so if you want to use it for yourself, you can do so without issue.When I reviewed Spirited Away, I went into detail on my revised feelings towards children’s media, and that a movie doesn’t necessarily have to be critically good for kids to watch it.  The only exception is when a movie teaches a bad message or could potentially provide a negative influence, and there’s nothing like that in Little Nemo, so do I recommend showing it to your kids?  I guess so, but I can’t honestly see them asking to see it.  It’s a fairly obscure movie, and if it didn’t develop a huge cult following after getting put out on DVD early this decade, then I doubt it’ll happen anytime soon.  If you have fond childhood memories of it and want to show it to your kids for that reason, go ahead, but there’s no guarantee they’ll like it.  I certainly didn’t.  That aside, it’s a pretty firmly forgotten movie, and while I’d love to see someone else take a shot at adapting McKay’s opus...  come on Disney, this shit has your name all over it...  This is one nostalgic movie you can leave right in your memories where it belongs.  I give Little Nemo a 3/10. that I couldn’t escape from.  But they can be completely nonsensical, too.  Maybe you’re fighting in a war with flamethrowers, but they suddenly turn into waterguns.  Maybe you’re running from a spider that can fit through any crack.  Maybe you’re beating up pedophiles, taunting serial killers, throwing horses at witches, fighting demons in the wild west, meeting people you don’t see anymore, running from a golden car like it’s a metaphor for Satan, or hell, maybe you get into a car crash but wind up in your living room, with your family ominously telling you “It’s waiting.”For little Nemo, dreams aren’t quite like that.  Every single one of his dreams is a lucid one, and he can use them to escape to big fantastical worlds, all by riding on his bed like it’s a magic carpet.  One day, after seeing a parade and wanting desperately to go to the circus, Nemo drifts off and is invited to the world of Slumberland, a country governed by a kind, jovial king and his prickly little daughter, and inhabited by a whole host of wild and zany characters.  Nemo is declared the King’s heir, and entrusted with protecting it from harm, but it isn’t long at all before one of these inhabitants, a chain-smoking green minstrel named Flip, tempts him into letting Slumberland get taken over by a terrifying sea of darkness, which leaves it in shambles and takes the King away to a faraway land.  With the order of a whole world now at stake, there is only one chance at saving it...  Joined by Flip, the princess, a wacky professor and his talking squirrel sidekick, Nemo must brave the horrors of Nightmareland to make everything right again!If I were to show you Little Nemo directly, there are two reactions I expect from you almost immediately.  The first would be disbelief at the fact that Nemo’s not a clownfish(although his world is populated by Clowns), and incredulity at the fact that it really doesn’t look like an anime.  It is, I assure you...  It was produced by Japan and released in Japan three years before it was released in the States, although I’d say roughly a quarter of the people credited to making it are american, including both of the screenwriters.  The production was a mess of almost legendary proportions, with huge names from both sides of the ocean coming into the project and then leaving it just as quickly, leaving influence behind but rarely ever any guidance on how to implement it.  Even Hayao Miyazaki himself was attached at one point, which is probably why the movie opens with a sequence of Nemo flying through the city on his bed.  It was ultimately produced by TMS, a company that made Akira and animated several american cartoons.And speaking of american cartoons, that’s exactly what this movie was based on.  Little Nemo was originally a newspaper comic that ran in the early 1900’s, which doesn’t sound like something an anime would ever be based on, and yet lo and behold, that’s what we have here.  Visually, this is exactly what I’d think of if I was told that an anime was being designed to look like an American product.  First of all, being that this WAS a product of TMS, the animation budget was high, so there’s a lot of fluid animation and graceful character movement, sometimes almost to a fault.  It is very lively, and it makes the movie feel really energetic, but there’s also a certain feeling of over-indulgence to it, like what the Nostalgia Critic might call movement porn.  It never stops moving, which can almost feel exhausting at points.  It’s one of those cases where something was new at the time, and had never really been attempted to such a degree, so of course it was impressive at the time for what it achieved, but looking back, it could have been done better.For example, there’s a scene where the cast engages in a dance at the palace, and Professor Genius starts doing a weird dance(I’d be surprised if The Duke of Wesselton wasn’t at least partially inspired by this), and then the king joins in, and for this strangely surreal moment, it looks like the two are moving in synch, probably through some sort of rotoscoping, despite being at least a foot apart in height.  It’s a really creepy bit of Uncanny valley.  Oh, and speaking of uncanny valley, there’s also the facial animations, which I actually kind of had trouble watching.  Characters were so far removed from your typical anime style that it honestly looks like something Chuck Jones would have animated while shit-face drunk, and this is reflected in the character designs.  Most of the characters look all right, if a bit generic, but the animation doesn’t always work in their favor.  Princess Camille, for example?  Whenever she lets her shoulders slump, she looks more arrow than human.  She looks like the love child of Bob Belcher and Marzipan from the Homestarrunner cartoons.  At least the demons look cool, I guess.When it comes to the music, I was actually kind of expecting the American and Japanese releases to have different soundtracks, but surprisingly, they don’t.  Even though this movie was originally released in Japan, the OST was comprised of English language songs.  On Wikipedia, the music is credited to a few American sounding names, including the Sherman Brothers, who are absolute legends in the field of family film musical scores.  The film’s main theme, which is simply named Little Nemo after the Japanese title of the movie, is beautiful.  I love it.  It works great in the film, carrying the kind of epic whimsy that can only be found in nineties children’s movies, and it’s just as strong when listened to on it’s own.  Melissa Manchester has an amazing voice, which I really shouldn’t have to tell anyone who’s familiar with her work, and it’s a testament to her strength as an artist that she can carry the Sherman Brothers occasionally awkward and flowery lyrics without ever sounding hokey or condescending.Unfortunately, this mark of inspiration doesn’t really carry over to the rest of the soundtrack, which sounds about as standard for a generic children’s movie soundtrack that you can get, with some of the songs being directly attached to scenes that were clearly added to the film just to pad out the run time.  This is no more clear than with the song Etiquette, which I think was supposed to be funny, but just winds up coming off as annoying.  Melissa Manchester is nowhere to be found on this track, but she might not have been able to save it anyway, because she wasn’t able to carry her majesty from Little Nemo over to the song Slumberland, which is just kind of boring over-all.  Songs like Fun and Laughter, The Boomps Song and Princess of Slumberland are safe, saccharine and forgettable, which is sadly par for the course with this soundtrack.  The instrumental tracks are okay, but they’re not the kind of thing that could ever set the world on fire, and there’s nothing about them that really justifies going out of your way to find them.The English dub is...  Well, it’s also okay.  There are a ton of really popular names credited to this film, including a pre-Simpsons Nancy Cartwright and a post-Vampire Hunter D Michael McConnohie.  Actually, there area ton of voice actors attached to this project whose resumes would surprise you, as even beyond famous names like Tress Macneille, Jennifer Darling, Sherry Lynn and the late June Foray, there are names that may have flown under your radar like René Auberjonois and Gabriel Damon, and I’m sad to say this, almost none of them brought their A-game to this project.  There are a few exceptions, like Laura Mooney in the role of the Princess, who was the only cast member who CLEARLY wasn’t trying; Bernard Erhard, who put his heart and soul into making King Morpheus the most likeable guy in the world, and strangely enough Mickey Rooney, who was obviously having a blast playing the mischievous and duplicitous Flip.  It’s not a great dub, but it’s passable enough, which is good, because western releases don’t include a Japanese language sub track.So, here’s an interesting little bit of trivia for you guys:  this was the first anime I ever watched.  It predates my experiences with Pokemon and Dragonball by nearly a decade, even.  When I was little, like really little, my Dad would often rent movies on VHS and bring them home for my brother and me to watch.  He’d go to the grocery store...  Wegmans, in my area...  Rent somne random movie with a G rating and bring it home for us.  For those of you who are confused by those last two sentences, ask your parents.  He’d bring home Disney movies, Don Bluth movies, straight-to-video shitfests(I saw Once Upon a Forest at least three times), and on one occasion, Little Nemo.  Now, as a kid, I didn’t have the greatest attention span, but I always found myself getting absorbed in stories.  I watched movies mostly attentively, and shamed people who didn’t(To this day, I get really annoyed by people who play on their phones during a movie), and as soon as I learned to read, I could go hours without putting a book or comic down.There are some exceptions to this rule, however, and Little Nemo is one of them.  My memory’s not great, but I’m pretty sure I only saw it once, and didn’t really pay attention to it.  Even only a year later, all I could remember about it was the Princess Camille stuff, because even Little Naru loved him some princesses.  I only really wound up thinking about it a few tiomes in the years that followed, like one time when I was reading up on the history of newspaper comics, or when Finding Nemo came out, or when I found out it was an anime, or when The Nostalgia Critic and The Mysterious Mr. Enter did some really good videos on it, ...  But I never really started thinking about it seriously until I started reviewing anime, and I knew I’d have to hit it again eventually.  Well, almost five years in, that time has finally come.  I bought the movie online, let it sit on my coffee table for a few months(don’t judge me) and finally, I popped it in and watched it for the first time in over twenty years, and let me tell you, there’s a reason it bored me as a kid.There’s a lot to unpack here, so to stay focused, I’m not going to go too far into any of the behind the scenes stuff.  Production of this film was famously a nightmare, it’s apparently one of Hayao Miyazaki’s worst professional experiences, it was a huge bomb when it was released, and the production company, TMS, who were riding high after the success of Akira at the time, were so badly damaged by it that they haven’t been the same since.  I don’t personally know any more about any of this than I’ve been told, I haven’t exactly done any research into it’s history...  That’s not really the kind of thing I do here...  But it’s lack of success isn’t really a surprise to me, and if you’ve ever seen it yourself, it doesn’t take a lot of run time to pick up on the fact that it was never going to be anybody’s favorite film for any reason but childhood nostalgia.  The only thing I can really talk about here is my personal experience watching the movie, and if it helps, my thoughts as to why it flopped as hard as it did.First of all, the main character...  The titular Nemo...  Is a special kind of bland.  He has no personality to speak of, he has no interests or goals outside of visiting the circus and doing whatever the plot tells him to do, and if I had to guess, his companion, a little sentient flying squirrel with flight goggles on his head, was added to the story to make him more interesting in the new medium(it didn’t work.  also, how weird is it that they had June Foray in the cast, the voice of rocky, but she didn’t play his arguable rip-off?)).  He just goes with the flow while spouting off lazy little boy one-liners like Yippee!  Gee Whiz! and Wowwee!  He  doesn’t even immediately grasp that a princess is a girl, a conversation which...  to be fair...  Was even dumber in the NES game.  The worst thing about him isn’t how boring or bland he is, however...  It’s how little agency he has in the story.  for the bulk of the movie, he’s just following orders, going along with whatever the other characters want him to do, and when Flip pressures him to go back on some of these orders, he folds like origami.The first real choice he makes is to try and undo that mistake...  about twenty minutes after making it.  He gains some agency in the third act, where he’s leading the charge to the Nightmare castle to rescue everybody, but even then, it’s hard to get invested because you never feel that he has any connection to any of it.  He’s only known any of these people for less than a day, the whole world is just shallow eye candy with nothing substantial to offer, and I’m sorry, but a king who’s willing to hand a key to what’s basically the doors of hell to a child he just met fifteen minutes ago was asking for his kingdom to get taken over.  In stories like these, the hero has to have a personal reason to save the world he’s wandered into, but with Nemo, he just feels like our excuse to explore a bunch of Candyland backgrounds in a barely story-driven animation demo, and the moments of actual story feel either distractingly stupid or gratingly annoying.  When Nemo is being tossed around by spastic tutors trying to educate him on proper behavior, I wouldn’t care if he woke up, got up to use the bathroom, and then went back to bed and dreamed about running from monster tornadoes.  I’d be just as engaged.But perhaps the biggest problem is that we KNOW he’s just having a dream, and that there’s no more to it than that.  Right in the beginning of the movie, we see most of the characters from Slumberland walking down the street in a parade, which is how he came to dream about them.  That’s it.  They’re not real.  None of this is real.  This wouldn’t be such a big deal if the dream-like aspects were the whole point, and it was just supposed to be a trippy experiences, but there’s a story and plot involved, and there’s almost no urgency behind any of it.  If he fails, nothing is lost.  If he succeeds, nothing is gained.  There’s no interesting subtext, no metaphor to speak of, no commentary, just the classic artwork and imagination of Windsor McKay being shown off in a story that doesn’t do any of it justice.  I mean, the only thing that does any work moving the plot forward is the character of Flip, but his motivation in the story is so completely bankrupt that he almost feels like the personification of the audience screaming “Get on with it!”It doesn’t even manage to be dream-like.  Like I said before, dreams are weird.  They don’t have plots, they don’t contain full stories.  Little Nemo is too conventional of a story to even grasp the surrealism that any good dream-based narrative should, at the very least, be able to pull off.  Remember in Nichijou, when characters are put in bizarre situations like having to eat noodles off of a shoot before they hit the ground?  Or having to buy a snowman off of the shelf before it melts, and they do so with actual sincerity, like they believe these tasks to be important?  That’s how dreams work.  Remember Alice in Wonderland, or the old Nightmare Ned computer game?  That’s how dreams work.  Okay, the Nightmare Ned TV series had consistent stories, but at least they had the benefit of being smart and well written.  You wanna show me a dream with a solid narrative?

This is one nostalgic movie you can leave right in your memories where it belongs.  I give Little Nemo a 3/10.', 'Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland is like a flash fusion between Disney\'s Fantasia, Peter Pan, and Jim Henson\'s The Dark Crystal. Many people watched this during their childhood, but I did not. I watched it for the first time a few weeks ago, and am completely fresh to the material. And boy, is it a gorgeous film, the landscape design, the animation, the score! The visuals are very pulchritudinous, but do the characters and story live up to this elusively complex, visual spectacle? Let\'s find out!⚠️ This review for Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland will have spoilers  ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe story incorporates elements of both storybook...dreamlands and Greek mythology. Probably the weakest link of the story is how transparent the plot is, as soon as King Morpheus gave Nemo the key, there was a voice in my head that screamed, ""That little boy is going to mess everything up, isn\'t he?"" The iteration of Morpheus in Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland resembles the description of the god in Ovid\'s Metamorphoses, with his ability to manifest into a human form, rather than simply being a formless entity. From his first appearance, to the irresponsibility he displays at the gala (after Nemo and Flip unleash the wrath of The Nightmare King), the mighty ruler is simply written off as an old oaf.I give Little Nemo the same benefit of the doubt as I give other children\'s films, but it does seem odd that a king, the ruler of all sleep and dreams,  would entrust a little boy with the power of an entire dimension and leave him alone with his only daughter, Princess Camille, after barely knowing him. It\'s similar to openness of Mufasa\'s trust towards the insidious Scar in The Lion King, except Scar was actually Mufasa\'s brother and not some random kid from another world. Nemo\'s decision-making was similar to J.K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter—the protagonist makes the worst decisions imaginable, as a device to progress the plot forward.Princess Camille exists to put the buffoonish men in their place, but her stubbornness alone isn\'t enough to prevent Slumberland from being plunged into darkness. The adorable sugar glider, Icarus, is often proven to have more sense than his human owner. I would say the crux of the film is a) not many of the characters are able to employ logic, and b) some scenes seem to drag on too long towards the end.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Masami Hata (director), notable works:* Aesop\'s World* Anime TV de Hakken!

It makes you wonder how different Little Nemo could have been, if he had stayed on! The main issues with the directing was the pacing. I have had similar issues with Mr. Hata\'s other films, The Sea Prince and the Fire Child and Nayuta specifically struggled in this regard, Chirin no Suzu didn\'t struggle with pacing as much because it was a very short film.Mœbius (character designs), notable works:As Jean Giraud* Blueberry* La Jeunesse de Blueberry* Jim Cutlass* Marshal Blueberry* XIIIAs Mœbius* Arzach* The Airtight Garage* The Incal* Les Maîtres du temps* Le Monde d\'Edena* Silver Surfer* Après l\'Incal* Icare* The Halo Graphic NovelCommentary: The original comics for Little Nemo, known as Little Nemo in Slumberland by Winsor McCay, are polychromatic and surreal. The choice to hire Mœbius as the designer of the project was perfect, because his comics have the same kind of perspective, detail,  and richness put into their panels! Mœbius is one of the most prolific artists out there. Dragon\'s Heaven (an anime and manga, originally created by the mangaka, Makoto Kobayashi) has a similar ambience to his Mr. Giraud\'s bibliography, it\'s clear that the creator of the OVA was heavily influenced by his art.I watched Little Nemo with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.Takuma Gōno as Nemo, notable roles:* Badrinath Harchand, Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor* Yūjirou Ishida, Yawara!Gabriel Damon as Nemo, notable roles:* R.H.

Disney\'s The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite films of all time, his voice as the grown-up Tod was really compelling and heart-breaking. His role in this film is not like that, at all. Flip is the sleaziest grifter out there and his greasy behavior leads Nemo astray.

Mr. Martin makes The Nightmare King very menacing, it reminded me of the Night on Bald Mountain segment in Disney\'s Fantasia!To wrap this review up, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland is a phenomenal achievement in animation. I\'ve never seen anything else quite like it. It seems to be a love letter to many of the other, foundational children\'s stories! The characters and story could have been stronger, but I still rate it a 6/10 and plan on purchasing the Blu-ray!Rating: ★★★☆☆ dreamlands and Greek mythology.

From his first appearance, to the irresponsibility he displays at the gala (after Nemo and Flip unleash the wrath of The Nightmare King), the mighty ruler is simply written off as an old oaf.I give Little Nemo the same benefit of the doubt as I give other children\'s films, but it does seem odd that a king, the ruler of all sleep and dreams,  would entrust a little boy with the power of an entire dimension and leave him alone with his only daughter, Princess Camille, after barely knowing him. It\'s similar to openness of Mufasa\'s trust towards the insidious Scar in The Lion King, except Scar was actually Mufasa\'s brother and not some random kid from another world. Nemo\'s decision-making was similar to J.K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter—the protagonist makes the worst decisions imaginable, as a device to progress the plot forward.Princess Camille exists to put the buffoonish men in their place, but her stubbornness alone isn\'t enough to prevent Slumberland from being plunged into darkness. The adorable sugar glider, Icarus, is often proven to have more sense than his human owner. I would say the crux of the film is a) not many of the characters are able to employ logic, and b) some scenes seem to drag on too long towards the end.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Masami Hata (director), notable works:* Aesop\'s World* Anime TV de Hakken! Tamagotchi* Chirin no Suzu ✅* DT Eightron* Elmer no Boken: My Father\'s Dragon* Go!

It makes you wonder how different Little Nemo could have been, if he had stayed on! The main issues with the directing was the pacing. I have had similar issues with Mr. Hata\'s other films, The Sea Prince and the Fire Child and Nayuta specifically struggled in this regard, Chirin no Suzu didn\'t struggle with pacing as much because it was a very short film.Mœbius (character designs), notable works:As Jean Giraud* Blueberry* La Jeunesse de Blueberry* Jim Cutlass* Marshal Blueberry* XIIIAs Mœbius* Arzach* The Airtight Garage* The Incal* Les Maîtres du temps* Le Monde d\'Edena* Silver Surfer* Après l\'Incal* Icare* The Halo Graphic NovelCommentary: The original comics for Little Nemo, known as Little Nemo in Slumberland by Winsor McCay, are polychromatic and surreal. The choice to hire Mœbius as the designer of the project was perfect, because his comics have the same kind of perspective, detail,  and richness put into their panels! Mœbius is one of the most prolific artists out there. Dragon\'s Heaven (an anime and manga, originally created by the mangaka, Makoto Kobayashi) has a similar ambience to his Mr. Giraud\'s bibliography, it\'s clear that the creator of the OVA was heavily influenced by his art.I watched Little Nemo with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.Takuma Gōno as Nemo, notable roles:* Badrinath Harchand, Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor* Yūjirou Ishida, Yawara!Gabriel Damon as Nemo, notable roles:* R.H.

I mean, how could you not. He\'s one of the biggest, classically celebrated, Hollywood names! Disney\'s The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite films of all time, his voice as the grown-up Tod was really compelling and heart-breaking. His role in this film is not like that, at all. Flip is the sleaziest grifter out there and his greasy behavior leads Nemo astray. His character reminded me of the ""talent recruiters"" in Disney\'s Pinnochio!Kōichi Kitamura as Professor Genius, notable roles:* Murao Mima, Key the Metal IdolRené Auberjonois as Professor Genius, notable roles:* Father John Patrick ""Dago Red"" Mulcahy, M*A*S*H* Roy Bagley, King Kong (1976)* Colonel West, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country* Dr. Burton, Batman ForeverCommentary: I don\'t remember any of Mr. Auberjonois characters in his other films, I have seen Batman Forever and miscellaneous episodes of M*A*S*H on TV, but I don\'t remember him. He plays his role very well. The English cast for this film seems to have been carefully curated, to fit each role. It\'s impressive!Tarō Ishida as The Nightmare King, notable roles:* Shikishima, Akira ✅* Tenkai, Kamui no Ken* Lazare d\' Cagliostro, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro ✅William E.

Mr. Martin makes The Nightmare King very menacing, it reminded me of the Night on Bald Mountain segment in Disney\'s Fantasia!To wrap this review up, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland is a phenomenal achievement in animation. I\'ve never seen anything else quite like it. It seems to be a love letter to many of the other, foundational children\'s stories! The characters and story could have been stronger, but I still rate it a 6/10 and plan on purchasing the Blu-ray!Rating: ★★★☆☆', 'What an odd little movie.

Some of the movie I remember watching as a kid, but other parts I seem to have forgotten.Story wise, tackling the idea of a repeating dream sequences can present problems, but the film seemed to mostly handle that well. The 'Oh, I'm still in a dream' notion does wear thin, but thankfully they don't dwell on that for too long. Other than that, the narrative is simple and family oriented. A good morality tale on keeping promises and finding the courage to fix...mistakes.I think that this film's animation has held up reasonably well, on par with other animated features of the 80's and 90's. Not as good as Disney Renaissance, but better than Rankin & Bass. Sort of that Don Bluth film area. Slumberland and its inhabitants are whimsical and colorful, while their nightmare counterparts can be appropriately frightening to younger audiences. Perhaps too frightening for some children, so grain of salt for parents.Is there an edited version of the English dub out there? I remember the clown character Flip being a typical hobo clown (light face makeup and dark mouth makeup), not a Minstrel Show clown with all racial baggage that carries with it. Now there's a third cringe joining Jynx and Mr. Popo in the world of Japanese animation transitions to the US.The English dub has some issues. Moments of missing or awkward lip flaps, line delivery that is mismatched with the tone, and dialogue out of sync are all present at one point or other. Thankfully, this is more of an exception than rule. The music is alright, if a little flamboyant at times.For a film that went through so many hands while in development hell, it has survived to be a decent film for the family.

Unicorns glaring and cursing out a...dude because he’s sitting with and talking with the femMC. And then, separately, a talking magical capybara shows up trying to NTR the male MC, while also trying to kill him.After being defeated, it forceably moves in with them (despite the femMC not giving a shit about it, and the mage being easily strong enough to stop this), along with a wolf they rescued. Both continuously try and disrupt the Charlotte/Allen dynamic, which is the only thing this show has going for it.This kills the crab.Dropped it halfway through episode seven. What I’ve written may sound amusing, but the absolute smuggness of the capybara’s voice actor, and its lines, is just so unappealing and cringy.  I was somewhat interested in the probably upcoming revenge arc against the femMC’s family, but it’s just not worth it.Was a decent 6.5/10 before the weird animal nonsense, is definitely a 4/10 or worse post episode 6.

Definitely do not recommend.', ""I know what you're probably thinking. How far can we stray from the light of God with such a cheesey premise? That was my first thought upon reading the synopsis. The promotional material does make the show look more innocent but nowadays, you know you shouldn't judge everything shown on the screen. Or should you?Our main leads Allen Crawford and Charlotte Evans couldn't be any more different. One earned the moniker 'Demon Lord' for his intimidating appearance and powers while Charlotte is a pure innocent girl . The idea of Allen trying to teach Charlotte to be naughty sounds controversial at first. We might get...the idea that Allen has perverted intentions or ulterior motives. However, the truth is that he just wants Charlotte to be more confident and enjoy life as it is. Compared to most people Allen has met, Charlotte is a truly honest and friendly person. Despite having met each other not for long, it felt like Allen and Charlotte were always destined to be paired up.Watching the show can be described as cozy, almost slice-of-life experience. While fantasy elements are factored in with an adventurous vibe, the show overall has an easy going momentum. Although Allen does have an intimdiating appearance combined with his deep voice, he is a far cry from what people actually believe him to be. In reality, Allen is a gentleman who loves to experience the freedom of life. He wants to share that freedom with Charlotte and that makes the bulk of their adventure. Let's get facts straight here. There's no ecchi or naughty fan service. This is one of the more innocent anime this year. Instead of using fan service, it builds on a relationship that slowly evolves over time with each episode.That being said, don't expect the show to be a one that is deeply narrative driven. While it has some deeper roots with backgrond stories, origins, and characterization, it's not complex either. On the other hand, it's also clear this show is not designed for a wide audience. It's almost niche with its romance in that it's too innocent and cartoony. Charlotte is protrayed as a young girl that is way too one dimensional. She doesn't undergo noticable changes and remains relatively the same person from the start to finish. The same can be said for Allen and his peculiar agenda. It doesn't also help that most of the supporting cast can't hold much of a candle to our main leads. Some show up for one episode and are never seen again. For those with recurring appearances such as Eruca and Miacha, they are there to just make our main characters look better.The show has a simple artistic style that mostly speaks for itself. It's adapted from a light novel that matches the characteristics of of the cast. Although nothing stellar can be said for the cherography or backgrounds, it has a simple fantasy look that appeal to that genre. Allen's character design gives him a masculine appeal, a sharp contrast to Charlotte's innocent charms. When watching the show, their character expressions often contrast each other in various moments. Unfortunately, Charlotte's reactions often comes off with too much cartoony moments. I suppose the show wanted to adapt her character in the safest way possible but it feels like if you've seen it once, you've seen it all.By no means is this show a masterpiece. This anime probably slipped under a lot of people's radars with its deceptive title. Plus, the fantasy genre seems to be oversaturated these days and this may appear as one of those again.

Sounds cliche? Yes because that's all you will find in this show, cliche up, down, left, and right.There is absolutely no story progression other than the show adding more and more insufferable, one dimensional, unnecessary characters that just muddied the already horrible pacing that the show has. Every single side character is so infatuated for absolutely no logical reason with the heroine who mind you has literally nothing going for her other than a sob story (very original!), when she is as flat as the rest of the cast. Dialogues are terrible, they are beyond cheesy it makes me want to rip my hair out of my head just listening to the characters talk to each other.Another thing is when the show would introduce a seemingly story turning plot device to the audience, only for them to reveal it's just another comic relief and nothing serious at all. I won't mind if they did this once, but no, they did it every single time to the point that you won't be able to take anything that happens in the story seriously anymore. I wouldn't even be surprised if they revealed that Charlotte's family framed her just for gags.For the love of all good things stay far away from this anime. This is supposed to be a comedy (and I'm really stretching the definition of comedy here) but instead I feel like I'm about to have a cardiac arrest for every painful seconds that passed watching this anime.

It’s funny, it’s cute, and wholesome.Allen is known as the “Demon Lord” but he’s not actually the lord of demons. He is just misunderstood because he lives in isolation in the woods, and people think he looks “scary”. Although he is pretty powerful, he is not violent, but overprotective of Charlotte since Charlotte has had a tough upbringing. She’s lived a sheltered life up until she started living with him, so he wants to introduce her to “naughty” aka the fun things she’s been missing out on...her whole life. The term “naughty” gets misconstrued with characters in the show thinking Allen is referring to “sexual” naughty things which is pretty funny because both Allen and Charlotte are clueless to this, even though it’s CLEAR they are crushing on each other pretty hard.It’s been an entertaining since episode one, and it’s one that I look forward to every week. If you’re looking for some lighthearted fun romance, I’d recommend giving this anime a shot! It’s super cute. her whole life.

If you’re looking for some lighthearted fun romance, I’d recommend giving this anime a shot! It’s super cute.', ""Charlotte is our generic pure-hearted naive main heroine who lives in a generic fantasy kingdom’s castle. Though she has some noble rank or other, being the daughter of a duke or something, she is the progeny of a mistress, so she is treated poorly by her parents. Think Cinderella and you’ll have the right idea. No, I mean it, the show explicitly tells you that she is Cinderella at one point.As it so happens, Charlotte is engaged to the prince... for some reason. Yet, the prince turns out to be a huge piece of shit and, out of nowhere, accuses Charlotte of all kinds of...false crimes and imprisons her... for some reason. Charlotte somehow escapes, runs away, and ends up fainting from exhaustion in a forest somewhere. There she is found by an ultrapowerful wizard who lives as a recluse in that forest... for some reason. This wizard, who has a self-evident dislike for people and socializing, decides to take her in and let her live with him... for some reason.Upon learning of her plight and that she’s basically lived her whole life as a slave, he endeavors to teach her how to be “naughty”. There is much ado made about the innuendo of the word naughty, but in this particular case, it basically means that he wants to teach her that it’s okay to be selfish sometimes, that it’s okay for her to have her own wants and needs, and that there’s nothing wrong with living for one’s own sake.Rom-com shenanigans ensue.What can I say? In recent years, I’ve slowly warmed up to slice-of-life shows where “nothing happens”, as it were. I’ve come to be able to appreciate a pleasant time spent in the company of pleasant characters, even if the show isn’t plot-driven. The problem with Ikenaikyo is that it was just too sinfully boring for my taste.As far as characters go, at least Charlotte adheres religiously to the conventions of her archetype, but therein lies much of her problem. She felt too derivative and identical to 100 other shy, pure-hearted heroines I can name off the top of my head. Her design did not help her stand out, either. Probably the worst thing about her is that this was perhaps the most high-pitched performance I’ve ever heard Saori Hayami give. I was not amused.Allen, on the other hand, just made no sense as a character. The information we are given at the start about who he is and what kind of background he has is in no way whatsoever compatible with the way we actually see him behave and react to things throughout the show. For starters, he is completely overpowered and likely the strongest entity in the world... for some reason. This is not an action show, so it’s not like that was really necessary, but fine. However, that’s not his real issue. The problem with Allen is that his character writing has no internal logic.We are told that he lives as a hermit in the woods, hidden away from the rest of society, because he is a misanthrope who hates people and hates socializing. Mind you, this isn’t some description given by a fallible narrator that the character in question then proves wrong. In so many words, he literally describes himself as such. Granted, this could lay the foundation for a reasonably interesting character arc where he learns to socialize from Charlotte, but that possibility faces mainly 2 challenges. First, Charlotte has no social skill in the first place. That’s the entire point of the show. Still, you could hand waive that away by saying that he doesn’t learn social skill per se, but rather he learns to like other people, that sort of thing. Ok, but that still doesn’t address the second challenge, which is that he is perfectly socially adequate from the very first time we see him on screen. To be sure, the series will concoct situations where other characters will state that he is socially awkward, but other than contrived scenes that simply create comic relief opportunities for the rest of the cast to point at him and laugh, he is a total normie – nowhere close to the edgelord the author would like you to think he is.Point in case, he effectively adopts Charlotte no questions asked, and as soon as he finds out what happened to her, he immediately believes her and becomes incredibly angry on her behalf. Bro essentially resolves to dedicate his life to making her happy for no reason whatsoever – already in the first episode, we see him spend sleepless nights trying to figure out ways to improve the life of this total stranger. It’s not even the case that he’s portrayed as a horndog who is doing this for her because he thinks she’s hot. For the first couple of episodes, he’s pretty much asexual. He is just a bona fide good guy everyman, which is completely at odds with every detail of his set-up.Also, he is the physical clone of Black Jack with that half-and-half B&W split hair color. I guess your mileage will vary with that aesthetic, but personally, I don't know, man. I'm just not about it.As for the actual rom-com, I suppose it wasn’t bad, and you might have a decent time with it if you’re into this sort of thing, but there was just far too much “nothing going on” for my taste, in addition to a self-contradictory protagonist.In a sense, I should say that Ikenaikyo feels outdated, because rather than a will-they-won’t-they-confess-to-each-other old faithful, this anime instead opts for the even more frustrating will-they-won’t-they-realize-they-have-feelings-for-each-other-in-the-first-place shpiel. I was under the impression that anime had graduated from that old trope – but even if it didn’t, at the very least, I have.Unless you’re a hardcore fan of the genre and present tropes, there’s not much reason to spend your time on this series. false crimes and imprisons her... for some reason.

There is much ado made about the innuendo of the word naughty, but in this particular case, it basically means that he wants to teach her that it’s okay to be selfish sometimes, that it’s okay for her to have her own wants and needs, and that there’s nothing wrong with living for one’s own sake.Rom-com shenanigans ensue.What can I say? In recent years, I’ve slowly warmed up to slice-of-life shows where “nothing happens”, as it were. I’ve come to be able to appreciate a pleasant time spent in the company of pleasant characters, even if the show isn’t plot-driven. The problem with Ikenaikyo is that it was just too sinfully boring for my taste.As far as characters go, at least Charlotte adheres religiously to the conventions of her archetype, but therein lies much of her problem. She felt too derivative and identical to 100 other shy, pure-hearted heroines I can name off the top of my head. Her design did not help her stand out, either. Probably the worst thing about her is that this was perhaps the most high-pitched performance I’ve ever heard Saori Hayami give. I was not amused.Allen, on the other hand, just made no sense as a character. The information we are given at the start about who he is and what kind of background he has is in no way whatsoever compatible with the way we actually see him behave and react to things throughout the show. For starters, he is completely overpowered and likely the strongest entity in the world... for some reason. This is not an action show, so it’s not like that was really necessary, but fine. However, that’s not his real issue. The problem with Allen is that his character writing has no internal logic.We are told that he lives as a hermit in the woods, hidden away from the rest of society, because he is a misanthrope who hates people and hates socializing. Mind you, this isn’t some description given by a fallible narrator that the character in question then proves wrong. In so many words, he literally describes himself as such. Granted, this could lay the foundation for a reasonably interesting character arc where he learns to socialize from Charlotte, but that possibility faces mainly 2 challenges. First, Charlotte has no social skill in the first place. That’s the entire point of the show. Still, you could hand waive that away by saying that he doesn’t learn social skill per se, but rather he learns to like other people, that sort of thing. Ok, but that still doesn’t address the second challenge, which is that he is perfectly socially adequate from the very first time we see him on screen. To be sure, the series will concoct situations where other characters will state that he is socially awkward, but other than contrived scenes that simply create comic relief opportunities for the rest of the cast to point at him and laugh, he is a total normie – nowhere close to the edgelord the author would like you to think he is.Point in case, he effectively adopts Charlotte no questions asked, and as soon as he finds out what happened to her, he immediately believes her and becomes incredibly angry on her behalf. Bro essentially resolves to dedicate his life to making her happy for no reason whatsoever – already in the first episode, we see him spend sleepless nights trying to figure out ways to improve the life of this total stranger. It’s not even the case that he’s portrayed as a horndog who is doing this for her because he thinks she’s hot. For the first couple of episodes, he’s pretty much asexual. He is just a bona fide good guy everyman, which is completely at odds with every detail of his set-up.Also, he is the physical clone of Black Jack with that half-and-half B&W split hair color. I guess your mileage will vary with that aesthetic, but personally, I don't know, man. I'm just not about it.As for the actual rom-com, I suppose it wasn’t bad, and you might have a decent time with it if you’re into this sort of thing, but there was just far too much “nothing going on” for my taste, in addition to a self-contradictory protagonist.In a sense, I should say that Ikenaikyo feels outdated, because rather than a will-they-won’t-they-confess-to-each-other old faithful, this anime instead opts for the even more frustrating will-they-won’t-they-realize-they-have-feelings-for-each-other-in-the-first-place shpiel. I was under the impression that anime had graduated from that old trope – but even if it didn’t, at the very least, I have.Unless you’re a hardcore fan of the genre and present tropes, there’s not much reason to spend your time on this series."", ""I quickly feel in love with this series, it's so funny, sweet and lighthearted!

"", 'I\'m Giving the Disgraced Noble Lady I Rescued a Crash Course in Naughtiness - Oh, how disgraceful, how naughty I am...to receive a free dose of mischief that\'s worth a lifetime of guilty pleasures from my benefactor? I don\'t deserve this...or am I secretly wishing for it...?We are so finally back to seeing absurdly long-for-no-reason named LN titles, one of which is author Sametarou Fukada\'s Konyaku Haki sareta Reijou wo Hirotta Ore ga, Ikenai Koto wo Oshiekomu (or just shortened to IkenaiKyo), which is as the title claims it: giving the oppressed a life of happiness as the most treasured girl in the whole wide...world, yeah. I know it sounds like a Disney-ish cringe premise where it partially fulfils the ""prince and princess"" plotline having both a wizard and maid be intimate with one another through activities that sounds like it came straight out of a Hentai plot premise, which absolutely isn\'t the case. It\'s definitely on the sweet, self-indulgence side...but in the same ironic way, it also shuffled itself into a corner.The story of a noblewoman who is the black sheep of her family begins with false accusations made in her name: the demotion from being a potential marriage partner to the family maid, and then complete exile as she makes a runaway from her family mansion, only to be chased by the guards warranting her complete death. But to this petite lady who had essentially run away from home, Charlotte Evans found herself in a part of the forest that\'s cordoned off by a rather misanthropic wizard by the name of Allen Crawford, whom people know has the fearful Demon Lord and dare not rouse him for his powerful magic. Being in his safety zone of a solitary mansion, Allen finds Charlotte\'s misanthropy a suffering, pitiful story and decides to change her life for the better...by introducing said ""crash course in naughtiness"", where nothing in life is ever that naughty, from indulging in sweet treats like cakes, to spending time being in one\'s comfort zone, literally being the ""wicked sorcerer"" guardian over the innocent girl\'s pampering, and leaving a trail of nothing but pure self-indulgence. If you\'re thinking that this is sweet as molasses, read on.To the Average Joe, IkenaiKyo is nothing more than the subservient fantasy rom-com between a hard-and-fast Demon Lord who is always conscious of his actions towards the innocence that is the former noblewoman, and you\'ll be right in every objective of the sense. Personally, while Allen and Charlotte\'s relationship is one that I can slowly warm to over time, there isn\'t really much of a plot per se other than trying to restore relations between Charlotte and the family who backstabbed her in the first place. To that extent, by having Charlotte around Allen\'s comfort zone is a good call, as this is equivocally her first dibs of experiencing the outside world, as well as the characters that would help liven up the potential couple\'s growth into pure, decadent happiness. Characters like Allen\'s own catnip sister Eruca; the mail~nyan Miacha Bastetos; as well as the Fenrir Lü, and hell capybara Gosetsu (who, when transformed into a human, he\'s a man in a woman\'s body...which is just plain WTF levels of bizarre), all add to the ""hilarity"" of Allen\'s co-existence with Charlotte by always pushing the latter\'s innocence to feel like Allen\'s efforts are more than just his subconscious way of caring for her, almost akin to forcing them to be the established couple. It\'s fun, but it can feel empty at times, not knowing where the story really wants to go.And in many ways, the source material itself is really the series\' Achilles\' heel. The LN clocking in at just 3 volumes since March 2020 (with the latest volume only released as of July 2021), and it\'s surprisingly not being published by the big corporations of neither Shueisha, Kodansha, nor Shogakugan (with the exception that Kodansha just recently licensed the manga adaptation of the LN for the US market). This feels like a pet project that gives the author lots of time to expand on his or her ideas (you can tell that the ideas listed in the anime have things in common with each other). But factor in the ""Time waits for no man"" adage, and it\'s a slow burn (for sure) that the anime is pretty much the closest thing to a near-complete, incomplete/ongoing adaptation that you\'re going to get. That said, regarding the studio collaboration of Zero-G and Digital Network Animation (who produced the god-awful Kimi wa Kanata, which was a spectacular box-office bomb), the production isn\'t as stellar but only mediocre to decent (given that Zero-G bears much of the production). The same goes for the music, which is neither remarkable nor memorable in my book.Despite the rather cuddly nature of the show, IkenaiKyo is a show that will no doubt serve its audience with cutesy moments and the like, but for the people who want to see a serious plotline, you\'re just going to have to find it elsewhere. This is a comfy show after all, made to impress those who are having a bad day and want some semblance of fictional happiness, and it does that formula well.

And needless to say, this wasn’t it. This is veryyyyyy innocent.Because of that, I was pretty disappointed, because I felt a bit misled.

And actually I would argue that this is one of the best animes of Fall 2023.But sometimes it\'s lack of distinct focus on the main characters drags the story down exponentially. These side characters are supposed to be around for comedic affect, and to get rid of...some of the seriousness that affects this anime.The big problem with this is that the seriousness and small time drama is the main enjoyment of this anime. These side characters all interrupt most of these plot sequences that happen, whether or not its just a small moment, or large, they do it almost every time.This actively stops the story from progressing sometimes, and somewhat feels like the anime is (possibly) artificially extending it\'s source material to be way longer than needed (I haven\'t read the manga, I just have the feeling that it is extended).Really this should cut half of the side characters that pop up every episode, it only really needs 3 comedic affect characters, and it seems like it has upwards of 6 characters to be this way every episode. This is a tad too much since half of them are just ""stand in the picture"" type of characters, where they just appear on screen for only comedic affect or to cut into a moment of seriousness.It seems like every time Allen and Charlotte end up meeting a new character, that the show cannot drop them, so they end up permanently in their group.Not even saying that some of these side characters are bad. Gosetsu is a really good side character, mainly because they do not push themself into every encounter with the MCs, and they are really well fleshed out and are not annoying with their character and what they say on screen. Eruca & Miacha both are good as a group, and actually push the story along for the most part.But then you just get into side characters who are just made to be annoying and distract from the story, such as Lu (practically wise is a dog). They technically are supposed to serve the purpose as a pet, but they since the anime gives them a voice and allows them to actively speak, it gets rid of the fact that they are a strong pet and makes them a distinct character as a whiny puppy dog with a voice.Lu would be a better character if they could not speak, like just make growl or bark, it would fix their entire character, if they are upset they could whine like a dog, bark to agree, etc. Instead of this the anime makes Lu have a very high pitched voice and basically have every feature of an annoying character that serves no purpose, basically characterized by ""Whaah, get away from her! She is mine!"" for everything they say. This also continues onto Natalia too, but just because they have been only used to be a violent intermediary between Allan and Charlotte, which gets very annoying in the last episode, since she just becomes like this for no reason other than ""My Sister!"".Then you get to the main characters, and they are really well constructed, make logical sense, and their personalities are fun to watch. Allen is somewhat generic in personality for a romance anime at the start, but as the series goes on their character really grows and becomes more elaborate. Charlotte\'s character also has this same type of growth, they have a great backstory, and doesn\'t use tons of tropes to get this information. The plot twists with them are really well done and make this a very well made anime overall.Overall, I think this is a very good watch, only disgraced by some moderately annoying side characters.If you get annoyed easily by side characters, it might be one to pass on, but I still think you should give it a shot.8/10, Greatly recommended to those who like romance. some of the seriousness that affects this anime.The big problem with this is that the seriousness and small time drama is the main enjoyment of this anime.

"", ""Konyaku Haki was very pleasant to watch and I recommend it.I'll try to keep this review concise, and won't spoil anything.This anime aims for a cute/happy vibe, one might say it's a cinderella story set in a fantasy anime world, and while it's not really original, it simply works. The shenanigans from the support characters are funny to follow, the animation is decent enough, it's not a high budget anime but at least, the quality keeps the same level throughout the whole season. There's enough events and characters introduced along the way to keep the story interesting, but maybe the rhythm is a...bit too slow at times.In addition, the cast of seiyus is really good, you'll reckognize Gintoki, Yor Forger and Anya Forger's voices for example.And that's about it, I can't really think of any huge flaws. Maybe this show isn't ambitious enough, but it doesn't seem like a fair criticism because it's good at what it's trying to be : a chill fantasy story with lovable characters, with some romance & comedy. bit too slow at times.In addition, the cast of seiyus is really good, you'll reckognize Gintoki, Yor Forger and Anya Forger's voices for example.And that's about it, I can't really think of any huge flaws.

Without them, it would just be another cringe-worthy isekai anime. The animation is seriously top-notch, and the MC, despite his boyish appearance, has a mature voice akin to Sakata Gintoki, which makes you want to take his character more seriously than you should.However, I do have a personal distaste for memory alteration and illusionary disguises. They often feel like cheap plot devices that allow writers to manipulate the story however they want. Plus, I\'m not a fan of the overly ""pure"" and happy characters in a world where everything seems...to be glowing.To be honest, there\'s nothing about the story, plot, or characters that really stands out to me. I can\'t wrap my head around how a loner like the MC, who supposedly goes to extreme lengths to avoid human contact, suddenly decides to save the main girl and forces her to live with him. It feels like a roundabout logic that I\'ve grown tired of.Overall, I found the plot to be lacking in cleverness, engineered to elicit shallow emotions of empathy from viewers. And seeing it countless times, I simply wasn\'t invested in it at all. The only thing I can see earning this anime such high ratings is its animation sequences, facial expressions and effects. However, I can acknowledge that there are people out there who enjoy stories like these, even if they\'re too pure for my taste.

More like bad things!Where these bad things will be taught by male wizards to the princess, I feel this is not too much of a problem because it is in accordance with the title, but the delivery of the story  that I find very annoying!Another thing that I find disappointing...is the uselessness of a man's superpowers, I read the synopsis that this man has invincible strength, and is very feared by the people around his area. and that's what happened in the initial episode when he saved the princess, However, the storyline changed drastically, this invincible figure was busy teaching the princess bad things instead of fighting which was more suitable for him.That's why I say that this anime has a ridiculous story! is the uselessness of a man's superpowers, I read the synopsis that this man has invincible strength, and is very feared by the people around his area. and that's what happened in the initial episode when he saved the princess, However, the storyline changed drastically, this invincible figure was busy teaching the princess bad things instead of fighting which was more suitable for him.That's why I say that this anime has a ridiculous story!"", 'Story:The story is about a girl that is abused, the studio clearly looked at several different stories like Cinderella.However this is to some extend as it takes it\'s own route completely which is a good thing, it really compliments the anime in that regard instead of rehashing a story and turning it woke just to suit a very small group. Charlotte was after her mothers death used as a personal slave to her stepmother. She was to marry a prince, but then this prince decided to betray her and fabricate a lie.

Both are just there for the sake of adding characters which is a shame.

Le Chevalier D'Eon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1013/Le_Chevalier_DEon,"['I am acutely aware that reviews that do not praise an anime are often flagged as ""not helpful,"" so We expect some backlash here but onward We press, as Louis XV might say.Le Chevalier D\'Eon is an anime that tries to draw off a lot of people who existed in European History, including the main character and several other characters with large roles in the show. The main hero is based on a cross-dressing French spy from the 18th century, given an original backstory to explain his gender confusion. Other, more recognizable characters, include Maximilien Robespierre, Catherine the Great, King Louis XV of France, and...King George III of England, among others. Being something of a history enthusiast, this new take on real historical figures was the main thing that kept me watching for most of the series.I was more than willing to take historical facts with a grain of salt. I don\'t want to be such a stick in the mud that I\'ll get hung up on the fact that the real D\'Eon wasn\'t really possessed by his sister\'s spirit or that one or two of the rules of Europe didn\'t die in exactly the same fashion, as long as the respectful nod to history was there. The problem is that Le Chevalier takes a larger and larger dump on history as the show progresses, completely perverting people and events while still trying to give us the hook of ""This is history!"" I won\'t spoil anything important, but let\'s just say that certain kings do not abdicate the throne voluntarily, the Seven Years War did in fact happen (whereas a peaceful preemptive resolution is introduced in the show), George III\'s wife was not Mary, Louis XV\'s uncle did not fight over him for the throne because he DIED 30 years before the anime takes place, and his son... well, you get the idea. And I can\'t even say the biggest offenders, because they\'re major plot points.Yet, after resmashing history into something unrecognizable, they have the gall to give us a scene at the end of the show, showing ""Robespierre"" selling his revolution propaganda on the streets, as if to say, ""Aha! See, it\'s just like history!""History aside, let\'s say you don\'t care at all about history. Many people don\'t. Does the show entertain? Does it have redeeming qualities? Perhaps it does, but they are few and far between.Briefly, let\'s talk about the characters. Most of them have very little personality and either come across as unlikable or cliches or both. I don\'t even know where to begin describing the main characters aside from what they look like or what happens to them. D\'Eon, he... wants to find out why his sister died. He likes France. That\'s about it. Teillagory, he\'s an old knight. He basically does nothing for the first 21 episodes except be the prototypical soft-spoken old warrior. Lia, she dies before the first episode, usually manifests back in reality only to kill something, and yet I\'m supposed to care about her. Oh, and we can\'t forget Anna. Anna is the biggest waste of screen time in the show. I don\'t know how anyone can care about this vapid woman and the way she just sits in Versailles, waiting for D\'Eon to come back home the entire series. She has lots of thoughts about how she misses D\'Eon, and you\'re going to hear a lot of them! None of them advance the plot either!The pacing deserves special mention for being a downfall of the show. You can divide the show into two parts. The first 19 or so episodes, everything sluggishly follows your four heroes around Europe as they track down bad revolutionary people for King Louis, interspersed with scenes of Anna writing letters or something equally boring. Then in the last 5 episodes, all Hell breaks lose, at the same time making a lot of the crap you have to sit through in the first 19 episodes pointless. There is wanton borderline-tasteless violence, far too many ridiculous plot twists to take seriously, everyone turns on everyone else, and it is far more of a mess than a satisfying climax of plotlines. And why is Cagliostro there for the whole show, including the finale, when he never does ANYTHING?The end leaves me feeling rather unsatisfied, even though that wasn\'t my biggest complaint. Still, I felt terrible for D\'Eon\'s sense of identity. I felt terrible that they tried to turn some of the bad guys into sympathetic figures and the good guys into bad guys and... no.I\'m glad that an anime decided to do something that isn\'t Japan-centric. They really tried to make something sophisticated, and in some ways it is. In more ways, the show is incredibly tacky. I have to give it points for being original, but all in all, I cannot recommend it. If you want to watch it anyway, just keep expectations at a safe level. King George III of England, among others.

You weep for those that are your allies, and you curse those that are your enemies. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing the truth. Death, while tragic, probably saves lives. And the existence of love and hatred, while grotesque and incomprehensible to most, is the core of life itself. You don\'t want...the truth because deep down the truth hurts.

Le Chevalier D\'Eon, the magical tale of a mysterious murder within hidden secrets within the French revolution within the territories of European countries (France, Russia & England) within the magical boundaries of reality within the entire world\'s stage. Shakespeare... Pssh... Le Chevalier D\'Eon puts all his so-called ""tragedies"" to shame. Witness the performance for the ages!Who do you think are the most powerful people in the world? Kings? Religious Leaders? Generals? Scientists? ""The People""? Poets? A divine deity? Hmmm... What changes the world? Murder/War? Communication/Words? Oh dear Le Chevalier D\'Eon. Not only does this magnificent show symbolize significant motifs - the core of human nature, Cruelty Vs Masculinity and more, but at the same time it delves into France\'s reality during the 18th century. Poverty of the poor, corruption of the government, the role of women (social hierarchy) and more. This is a tragic mystery that\'ll leave the audience confused and befuddled quite a bit, but if the audience can see through the act and see the core lying beneath the outer surface then wow, is this a performance to be seen!The story of Le Chevalier D\'Eon is so unique, it\'s unlike anything I\'ve ever seen before in anime. I won\'t talk more about the actual synopsis because you find that everywhere. There is magic within a historic show (Remember, the characters in the show actually exist in real history, and their roles in the stories are pretty much mirrors of their characters in real history). Pretty weird, and sounds pretty pathetic (magic) and boring (history)... Well, I can assure you that it\'s neither. This show makes history intriguing to say the last. Go watch the show if you\'re up for a one way ticket to masterpiece-ville. The magic blends in perfectly with the ominous mysteries lurking within France, England and Russia during a dark era in history. The magic (power of the psalms) symbolize the power of religion and the church in Europe during the 18th century and it\'s influence upon all the tragedies that occur during that bloody era. The beginning of the French Revolution in France, rise of Catherine the Great in Russia, failure of imperialism in England during King George III\'s reign and the churches dark secrets that make everything happen.The art and sound in this series is just the way it should be; it perfectly fits everything Le Chevalier D\'Eon is meant to symbolize. The portrayal of the settings (Versailles, St. Petersburg Cathedrals,), the characters, the special affects designs, everything is so realistic! How I love this show\'s old/classic art. Perhaps they could have given the characters more distinct faces, because some of them do look somewhat similar... But that\'s okay, because the marvelous clothing covers for it. The budget for this show is close to $0, therefore the art isn\'t all that ""beautiful"" so don\'t expect too much of a modern clear HD vision attraction. The music, ah yes. Where to begin...? The opening is beautiful, see the lyrics to the song as well, not only are the lyrics touching, but it fits the anime perfectly. The ending is decent. But the soundtracks that play at each key moment is perfection itself. The low hymms of the church that brings mystical darkness over the audience. The climax hype theme that excites the audience for the answers up ahead. The sad flute pieces that bring the audience to tears. The music is at the heart of this masterpiece.The only criticism I have to give this show is that although all the characters develop wonderfully in the end, no one is all that memorable and purely lovable or hate-able. I\'m not sure that\'s a good thing or a bad thing actually. Perhaps some like it that way (ambiguous) but I\'d like to have a character I can really feel attached to and feel for, but Le Chevalier D\'Eon didn\'t have that. The character development doesn\'t happen until towards the end of the series either. Every characters secrets are revealed in the last approximately 6 episodes, but the first 18 episodes there wasn\'t anything key revealed really. A bummer for a mystery show. But as for the positives for the characters portion of the story is that everyone\'s quite realistic, their motives that is; they have something that they\'re fighting to protect and no  bullcrap. No, although there is Psalms (super-naturalism), there is still realism. Secrets, companionship, betrayal, redemption and... death. Pretty much sums up the characters. But.. I did mention that this was a tragedy, so if all the characters that you cherish and pity end in a tragic way, then just remember, this is a tragic tragedy for the ages. I can assure you that you\'ll end up with teary eyes by the end. Especially for Anna. A tragedy for the ages indeed.The most underrated anime series I have ever seen without question. Not only on Mal is it rated something like a 7/10, lower than most crap, but even outside of Mal, nobodies even heard of the title, ""Le Chevalier D\'Eon"". Have you heard of it? Bet not... How depressing this world is. The world truly is a tragedy. Pointless crap like Sword Art Online becomes one of the most famous anime ever while Le Chevalier D\'Eon, a true masterpiece of literature is buried in poop, pissed upon and then flushed away into the abyss. Please don\'t let our anime community rot any more, and do yourself a favor by watching this show. Brace yourselves for the tragedy that will have the world upon it\'s feet, weeping and applauding!

Shakespeare... Pssh... Le Chevalier D\'Eon puts all his so-called ""tragedies"" to shame. Witness the performance for the ages!Who do you think are the most powerful people in the world? Kings? Religious Leaders? Generals? Scientists? ""The People""? Poets? A divine deity? Hmmm... What changes the world? Murder/War? Communication/Words? Oh dear Le Chevalier D\'Eon. Not only does this magnificent show symbolize significant motifs - the core of human nature, Cruelty Vs Masculinity and more, but at the same time it delves into France\'s reality during the 18th century. Poverty of the poor, corruption of the government, the role of women (social hierarchy) and more. This is a tragic mystery that\'ll leave the audience confused and befuddled quite a bit, but if the audience can see through the act and see the core lying beneath the outer surface then wow, is this a performance to be seen!The story of Le Chevalier D\'Eon is so unique, it\'s unlike anything I\'ve ever seen before in anime. I won\'t talk more about the actual synopsis because you find that everywhere. There is magic within a historic show (Remember, the characters in the show actually exist in real history, and their roles in the stories are pretty much mirrors of their characters in real history). Pretty weird, and sounds pretty pathetic (magic) and boring (history)... Well, I can assure you that it\'s neither. This show makes history intriguing to say the last. Go watch the show if you\'re up for a one way ticket to masterpiece-ville. The magic blends in perfectly with the ominous mysteries lurking within France, England and Russia during a dark era in history. The magic (power of the psalms) symbolize the power of religion and the church in Europe during the 18th century and it\'s influence upon all the tragedies that occur during that bloody era. The beginning of the French Revolution in France, rise of Catherine the Great in Russia, failure of imperialism in England during King George III\'s reign and the churches dark secrets that make everything happen.The art and sound in this series is just the way it should be; it perfectly fits everything Le Chevalier D\'Eon is meant to symbolize. The portrayal of the settings (Versailles, St. Petersburg Cathedrals,), the characters, the special affects designs, everything is so realistic! How I love this show\'s old/classic art. Perhaps they could have given the characters more distinct faces, because some of them do look somewhat similar... But that\'s okay, because the marvelous clothing covers for it. The budget for this show is close to $0, therefore the art isn\'t all that ""beautiful"" so don\'t expect too much of a modern clear HD vision attraction. The music, ah yes. Where to begin...? The opening is beautiful, see the lyrics to the song as well, not only are the lyrics touching, but it fits the anime perfectly. The ending is decent. But the soundtracks that play at each key moment is perfection itself. The low hymms of the church that brings mystical darkness over the audience. The climax hype theme that excites the audience for the answers up ahead. The sad flute pieces that bring the audience to tears. The music is at the heart of this masterpiece.The only criticism I have to give this show is that although all the characters develop wonderfully in the end, no one is all that memorable and purely lovable or hate-able. I\'m not sure that\'s a good thing or a bad thing actually. Perhaps some like it that way (ambiguous) but I\'d like to have a character I can really feel attached to and feel for, but Le Chevalier D\'Eon didn\'t have that. The character development doesn\'t happen until towards the end of the series either. Every characters secrets are revealed in the last approximately 6 episodes, but the first 18 episodes there wasn\'t anything key revealed really. A bummer for a mystery show. But as for the positives for the characters portion of the story is that everyone\'s quite realistic, their motives that is; they have something that they\'re fighting to protect and no  bullcrap. No, although there is Psalms (super-naturalism), there is still realism. Secrets, companionship, betrayal, redemption and... death. Pretty much sums up the characters. But.. I did mention that this was a tragedy, so if all the characters that you cherish and pity end in a tragic way, then just remember, this is a tragic tragedy for the ages. I can assure you that you\'ll end up with teary eyes by the end. Especially for Anna. A tragedy for the ages indeed.The most underrated anime series I have ever seen without question. Not only on Mal is it rated something like a 7/10, lower than most crap, but even outside of Mal, nobodies even heard of the title, ""Le Chevalier D\'Eon"". Have you heard of it? Bet not... How depressing this world is. The world truly is a tragedy. Pointless crap like Sword Art Online becomes one of the most famous anime ever while Le Chevalier D\'Eon, a true masterpiece of literature is buried in poop, pissed upon and then flushed away into the abyss. Please don\'t let our anime community rot any more, and do yourself a favor by watching this show. Brace yourselves for the tragedy that will have the world upon it\'s feet, weeping and applauding! Le Chevalier D\'Eon!', 'Watching Le Chevalier De&rsquo;on ended up being quite a saga for me. Back when it when it was initially airing, I was really enthusiastic about the series and was watching it as fast as possible - until AnimeYuki&rsquo;s &ldquo;as fast as possible&rdquo; became slow enough to hamper my interest with signs of limping plot development. So I put the show on hold and recently decided to watch through it with a friend from the start again. At first, beyond the stunning first episode, I thought the show had some significant flaws. From the start it was immensely pretty, Production IG going all-out on the production,...and the plot was original, well-researched and envisioned in amazing depth and complexity - however, this all seemed wasted by languid pacing and tepid characterisation. In short, despite having a great plot, for a long time the show alienated viewers with its verbosity, lack of humour and characters that were largely hard to sympathise with.Even until the very end, the main character, De&rsquo;on left little impact, and were it not for the eventual growth of his comrades the series would have been hard to finish. Durand is a warm, likable presence and easily one of my favourite characters; his plotline toward the end of the series was undoubtedly a highlight, being both gripping and intense. The youngster, Robin is ultimately transformed into a remarkable character as he battles with the emotional challenges of their journey - grief, betrayal, revenge. And last, but not least comes the conniving and bitterly honourable Teillagory, who is not as straight-forward as we are lead to believe. The majority of the cast really come out of their shells and reveal their true selves as the pressure of the plot-climax accumulates, which makes for a final run of about 7 episodes that are packed with emotion and poignancy.Yes, the series well and truly redeems itself, trading slow-winded for brevity, and packing a really strong punch for the show&rsquo;s climax. Those last 7 episodes are edge-of-your seat entertainment, and, quite frankly, exceptional in every way. I really mourn all those out there who dropped this show pre-emptively, as it truly teaches us the virtue that good things come to those who wait. Drawing from, and upturning the subtleties of the characters explored during the first half of the series, especially in terms of the ideology and approach to loyalty and patriotism, and slathering the audience with the answers to mystery after mystery, the plot explodes into a fiery culmination that extends to the very end of the last episode.As if just to mock those who did not persevere, this final run is also blessed with the very heights of Production IG&rsquo;s production efforts. The animation in this episodes is excessively good, and, in terms of the cel detail and fluidity of motion, up there with the very best of animation ever produced in an anime tv series, if not the best. But that&rsquo;s not all; beyond a generous budget these episodes display a sense of artistry that most anime cannot even approach. The background art is, in typical IG fashion, excellent, and a number of background works later in the series depict some really memorable locales and scenes. Let us not forget to mention that drawing a building as a background is a lot different to trying to recreate early France - the detail in the architecture is supreme. The directing in Le Chevalier only really shines as it approaches its end and there is more striking content to present, but when it shines it really shines. Honestly, I find it difficult to praise IG&rsquo;s work here enough, but I&rsquo;ll say that it ranged from impressive to astounding - high quality through and through, and more attention to detail being payed than I&rsquo;ve ever seen from an anime series before. Very rarely am I captivated by the aesthetic beauty of an anime tv series (as very rarely does it have it), but frequently was while watching this series - particularly in episode 18. Not to be outdone, the musical production is very much up to scratch, with a mature, classical composition that captures the spirit of the series very well, and grants it plenty of energy when it&rsquo;s needed. The sound in general, was in fact very good, with good sound effects, and a nice OP and ED capping each episode - they kind of grow on you.The plot is both a strength and a weakness of the show, its convoluted and complex nature meaning that it&rsquo;s very easy to become lost or confused, and, towards the beginning, bored. However, the layered complexity of the plot is ultimately very rewarding, as the end pulls everything together and explains it all, making for very enthralling viewing (the kind that cannot be achieved with a simplistic plot). Furthermore, the way that it is interwoven into French history and the roots of the revolution is really very clever, and even more impressive that it was pulled off believably. There is a lot of dialogue, and a lot of step-based progression earlier in the series which can make it feel like it&rsquo;s going nowhere. I do admit that some of the dialogue could have been trimmed here and there, but it certainly had direction, it just took time to build up a good momentum. I think the story is an ambitious one, in its scope and intricacy, the likes of which aren&rsquo;t often pulled of well in anime.IG have gone all out in bringing this ambitious tale of politics, knighthood and the supernatural to life, and came very close to making a masterpiece. The conclusion is wholly satisfying and thrilling, and the whole series is rendered with artistic flare and meticulous attention to detail. Its downfall rests with its first half, which doesn&rsquo;t provide enough emotional attachment or solid plot direction to make it captivating. Nonetheless, I urge everyone to press on until the show hits its stride and recommend it to everyone who thinks they&rsquo;re capable of this. and the plot was original, well-researched and envisioned in amazing depth and complexity - however, this all seemed wasted by languid pacing and tepid characterisation.

The building designs, settings are marvelous, although I admit I\\'m not familiar with the French architechture, it still managed to capture the western feel. Characters were designed to look realistic and thus, would not appeal to audiences who want either \\'moe\\' or extreme cuteness. The swordfights were perfect, they were swift...and clean, wasting no time in trying to bring down the opponent, without any extreme visual moves or \\'powering up\\' like in shounen animes. It is what you\\'d expect real fencing to be like, fast, graceful but brutal.Another important thing to note, the 4 musketeers actually looked tired near the last half of the series!

A spy that lived his life half as a man and half as a woman? and that he was only discovered to be a man after his death?That was what happened to the real Chevalier D\\'Eon. Tow Ubakata took the concept but changed it into an action fantasy novel, where vampires were involved and spells which are casts by \\'poets\\' are the main elements of the story. Also, D\\'Eon didn\\'t dress up as a woman like what history implied, but he was possessed by his sister, Lia instead and sets out to seek revenge. What impressed me was that even though this turned into a supernatural flick, he still managed to retain the important facts and elements of the actual person\\'s history, plus making it seem logical in a way.Even then, the story is rather slowly paced, and with the heavy amount of dialogue, it is easy for most viewers to get bored.There is a twist near the end though which unfortunately, did not surprise me due to the mistake of reading a spoiler posted by another person....Still, it concluded pretty wellCharacter:There are a lot of characters in this anime, each with rather complicated names which does cause confusion eventually. The 4 musketeers are the main characters along with er... D\\'Eon\\'s sister Lia.There isn\\'t much to say about D\\'Eon himself apart from his love for the country and people around him.

It has been licensed Stateside by Del Ray, and is up to three volumes Stateside, and six volumes in Japan.The anime itself was directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi (known for his work as director on Ruroni Kenshin and its OVAs, and Getbackers), and produced by Production IG (best-known for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC).  It is twenty-four episodes long, and ran on Japanese TV from August 19th, 2006, to February 24th, 2007, focusing more on the reality of 18th century life.  It has been licensed Stateside by ADV Films, and the sixth and final volume was released on December 18th, 2007.Story: The first episode kicks off with a floating coffin with the word &quot;Psalms&quot; written on it washes up on the banks of the Seine in Paris, with the corpse of a woman inside.  The woman is Lia de Beaumont, and her brother, d'Eon de Beaumont, a member of the secret police, begins investigating into her death.  Little does he know that Lia's is able to posess him, and that there is an international conspiracy against the monarchs of several European countries involving Poets who can recite deadly Scripture that he is about to get dragged into...The first thing that you need to know is that, yes, there is historical accuracy in here, and at the same time, there isn't.  For example, the details of living in the 18th century are fairly accurate, as are the basic characters of figures who actually existed (d'Eon, Queen Marie, and Louis XV, among several others).  However, as you go on in the show, the bastardization of history, especially in regard to some of the major characters, is going to become fairly clear.  So, if you like historical accuracy along the lines of Victorian Romance Emma, I'd stay away from this.The story itself is built on several layers of mysteries that will unravel as the story goes along.  And, admittedly, for just a bit over the first half of the series, the pacing is fairly slow.  However, at around episode fifteen, things start to kick into high gear, as the mysetries unveil themselves, and all kinds of plot twists and double-crossings rear their heads, making for an excellent second half.There was an amazing amount of detail put into the story, especially in how excerpts from the Psalms in the Bible are used, and relating historical figures back to their roots.  And all of it is explained by series' end, even bits you forgot about way back in the first half of the series.  It's not quite as epic as Baccano! was in its execution, but it's still fairly awesome.Know going into this that a lot of characters will be dead by the end, and that there is blood involved.  It's nothing to warrant a bolded warning, but it's still nice to know going in.Art: Production IG did an amazing job with this, as always.  Beautiful 2D and stunning 3D animation.  I'm especially happy that they recreated the palaces as closely to the real things as possible, and were fairly accurate to the period in the outfits that the characters wore.Music: The OP and ED are fairly standard J-Pop numbers, albeit fairly nice.  The background music is fairly dramatically orchestrated with a standard Western orchestra.  There are some recurring themes throughout that are nice, but as a whole, the music doesn't stand out much.Seiyuu: There are no names I recognize for this production, but there's no one who I think did a miserable job, either.Voice Actors: The first encounter I had with Le Chevalier d'Eon was a dubbed episode on a Newtype sampler.  The VA work for this wasn't half bad, I have to admit.  The lines did seem a bit cramped at times, but it could be far worse.Length: Twenty-four episodes is just the right length for this.  Any shorter, and it wouldn't have had the space it did to explore things (though, admittedly, it dragged a bit just over a third of the way through), and any longer, and it would've gotten tedious.Overall: A beautifully animated, excellent story of international intrigue, supernatural Scripture, and the life of 18th century Versailles that takes a while to get going, but kicks ass when it does.Story: 9/10Art: 9/10Music: 8/10Seiyuu: 8/10Voice Actors: 8/10Length: 9/10Overall: 51/60; 85% (B ) on October 21st, 2005.

What is brilliant about the Le Chevalier d'Eon character is that it takes the real life singular, makes it two characters here, and then brings them back together again. It explains the real life fall and ascension of monarchs, but with these made up characters and 'Psalms' playing a huge influence that was not there in real life.Now, the reason I only gave the story an 8 despite this...is that they never explore the concept of the Psalms fully enough. All we find it is about how the situation developed, but it does not focus on the actual nature of the Psalms as pertains to each person or their general nature nearly as much as I would have liked.An aspect I disliked about the story as pertains to characters is that, I assume in an attempt to remain more mysterious, it just hinted at the tension resulting because of its various characters manipulations and motivations, but it never discusses these enough or displays the animosity enough for my tastes. It could have made matters much more grandiose, and it always had this running undercurrent of compromising grandiosity for a false attempt at creating mystery. The only way it is mysterious is in not telling us the motivations clearly enough. I do enjoy the way they tried to weave the tensions unfolding in a kind of 'domino effect' manner, where we see only a few motivations at first, but then more and more.As for the characters themselves, the worst problem is that D'Eon is a simpering and insufferable wimp for most of the series. Most of the characters are highly enjoyable, however, so do not let this alone put you off. Even Anna, who is highly typical for an anime woman companion, but basically unimportant, character, is not repugnant.Most of the characters have pretty good voice acting, and definitely contribute more than denigrate to this series. Some characters, however, had fairly boring and unexciting voices, so I rated this as I saw it, which was 'usually exciting, but not enough to be a 9 or a 10'. The music is pretty much never intrusive, and, indeed, this is one of the few anime that is not obsessed with constantly bombarding you with it every single moment. It uses classical music well. The introduction music for each episode is fairly nice, but the ending music is pretty terrible (OST and whatever the ending is? I do not mean a segue into the credits or anything, which happens in some anime).I enjoyed this series more than I did due to its parts because it was one of the few which seemed perfectly paced and executed for most of the way. Some episodes are not so, but most left me thinking 'wow, that was really 20 minutes?' because it felt like it had been ten or so.Oh, the reason that I only gave the art an 6 was because of its poor attempt at simulating movement at times during scenes in an attempt to give rapidity or drama (like every time they leave Versailles, it is animated terribly, although I respect the attempt of what impact they wanted, it is just a terrible idea). The overall glossy feel is also distracting and lends itself to typically oversaturated coloring. The mouths do not seem to match up well with the voices at all, but that might be a flaw of the audio being off in my version, so I am not rating it down for that. is that they never explore the concept of the Psalms fully enough. All we find it is about how the situation developed, but it does not focus on the actual nature of the Psalms as pertains to each person or their general nature nearly as much as I would have liked.An aspect I disliked about the story as pertains to characters is that, I assume in an attempt to remain more mysterious, it just hinted at the tension resulting because of its various characters manipulations and motivations, but it never discusses these enough or displays the animosity enough for my tastes.

First of all, the reason this show deserves this score will be broken downStory:The Story is the biggest draw to this series, it features many people who actually did live, despite the fact that history is somewhat embellished in this show, it is done so perfectly it almost feels as if it is real, the writers on this show took the time to ensure everything makes sense (I.E. Real-Life D'Eon dressed up as a woman and even...claimed he was a woman and actually got recognized by the French Government as a woman, that is spun off into this fictional story that D'Eon's female side is manifested itself in a form of a fictional sister. If you read the personal backgrounds of most of the characters you will see that this story doesn't exactly lie about history, albeit most of these events likely did not happen they are re-told in a fictional perspective, Seriously, it would be better if you watched the show and just did some research on the characters, I can't spend all day on that.Artwork:I fell in love with the beauty of this series, The animation is gorgeous, the jaw-dropping 3D looks really amazing when they show the Palace of Versailles halls.Sound:Definitely a 10, the fact that this show has lots of fighting in it, means that it has to have good foley, from the sound of rapiers clanking to the sound of chanting monks. The sound is a definite plus.CharacterI would say the character development is very well done in this series, the writer's took the time to truly develop each and every character and you will see throughout this story that almost all the characters in this show evolve.EnjoymentI love this series, I just can't put it down. claimed he was a woman and actually got recognized by the French Government as a woman, that is spun off into this fictional story that D'Eon's female side is manifested itself in a form of a fictional sister.

First of all i\'d like to say that it\'s not an ordinary anime in terms of storyline and art style which gives it a some good headstart points in my opinion. So let\'s see my rates per section,Story: 7As i said Chevalier D\'eon storyline can\'t be easily compered to any other anime\'s storyline. As a historical anime it takes place in France in the time of Loui\'s XV reign some time before the French Revolution. It includes a variety of historical figures such as the King Loui XV, Madame de Pompadour, Marie...Antoinette and even Chevalier D\'eon himself (even if he\'s not faithfully portraited). It also takes a wonderful advantage of historical events as well, something which can be as good as it is bad since many people are unfamiliar with France\'s history. However with  basic knowledge of French revolution i didn\'t meet any difficulties to follow the flow, but since anime has a huge part of its fanbase in Japan and America it might be a little difficult for some people to relate the events. Now speaking of the story\'s flow. Chevalier D\'eon\'s first few episodes could be characterised as ""slow"" and ""unintriguing""  in some terms but i well petience shall always be rewarded and in this case it was rewarded indeed. At episode 10 or so personally it got my attention fully caughted. Many things remain a mystery until the later episodes where we have a rather too quick turn of events. Plus i\'d like to say that is not one of those ""lived happily forever after animes"". Quite a few characters deaths are included so if you ask for the happy ending anime this might not be for you. The negative thing with the storyline though is that the whole ""poets"" and ""psalms"" thing is kinda difficult to fully underestand with the first watch of the anime.Art: 9Well this was the most pleasant part of the anime for me! It is one of the few animes that prefered the semi realistic anime art style instead of more stylish anime styles. Where shall i begin; Let\'s start from the characters. Considering the faces i would describe them as pleasently melancholic specially the down pointed eyes. The rest characteristics such as face shape are more subtle yet characteristic for each character. The hair were quite pleasant too with natural tones and realistic hairstyles. The outfits however were simply eye gasmic in my opinion specially the ladie\'s ones (exept Lia\'s which was out of era since they gave it a lolita style as a tribute to the manga i guess). Lastly considering static scenes well ofcourse there was some static dialogue here and there but i don\'t think it was too much of a problem. The one thing that bothered me in art style though were the psalm\'s letters. They looked kinda like out of place watermarks in many points but well i guess they were added as a layer upon the frames since it would be quite troublesome to be drawn directly upon the scenes because of movement etc.Sound: 7Well this rate field is always the most short one for me. The anime had nice opening and ending songs however i don\'t seem to remember any characteristic music through the show. I think it might have lacked in this part but it doesn\'t concerns me thoughCharacter: 7Well character development in this anime could be this anime\'s weakest point. First of all we have the protagonish D\'eon. Again even if he\'s a main character he doesn\'t seem to have much depth. He is the usual idealist kind of guy who tries to ensure everyones safety with his qualities such as his siste\'s soul peace and to serve the king and his country. However one could say his other hald Lia spices up the interesting upon him a bit because of her abnormal story and presence. Durand from the other hand is the ""sacrise for what is really worthy"" character and even if he\'s a little bit cliche there is a interesting contrast between the first impression you get about him as he seems the egoistical type of person, the one who serves a secret and probably evil purpose and the later impression which is this of the one who puts his duty and personal favot away from his friends. For the most of the other character i simply say "" don\'t rely on the first impression because nothing is what it seems to be"". The most interesting character for me though was Robin. Yes the little red haired boy. He seems indifferent at first but after all the attrocities he has witness, the traitory and the cruelty of the world he get\'s a 180 degrees turn as he will question what is the right and what\'s wrong and in the end well i promise he puts all of his experiences from this story in a good place.Enjoyment: 7It was a pleasant anime indeed a bit confusing maybe but pleasant for someone who seeks a rare anime delicatessen. The characterisation historical might put off a lot of people but i promise it\'s full of intrigue, traitory, unexpected turns and it even contains romance. Just be patient through the first few episodes and i promise it\'ll pay off later as we speak of an one of the kind anime.Overall: 7 (with a mathimatically average mean) but for me it\'s an 8 Antoinette and even Chevalier D\'eon himself (even if he\'s not faithfully portraited).

I dunno, I just didn't like this show, and as much as I am trying to search for something positive to say...I can't. I just didn't like it. It was too weird, the story was sloppy and convoluted. I'm left wondering &ldquo;What did I just watch?&rdquo; No really, someone needs to tell me what was it I just watched!!ART/ANIMATIONThe animation style was not bad, however, personally it wasn't my cup of tea. Not a lot of seamless movement tho I guess the sword fights were impressive...enough, it just wasn't constant throughout the show. Overall artwise everything just seemed so somber looking.MUSIC/SOUNDMediocre music both OP and ED were not unpleasant but not memorable, just dreary sounding. There was also no BGM=background music as far as I can remember and if there was, that should serve as proof positive how forgettable it all was.PLOT/STORYTo twisted for words. The protagonist D'Eon's sister is murdered, so he goes undercover as her...only...to become her? There is also some legendary book of Kings [of unexplained origin] that names who the next king of France should be? But is it only the French that have such a book? Is there another book for England or Spain? Where did this book even come from? I mean if it's only France that has such a book then why is England and Queen Mary involved?? It failed to carry a steady pace or flow and just too illogical in some parts....however it does get better after episode 18.CHARACTERSThere was an obvious departure from the standard anime character design, they weren't super thin with huge eyes, a pointy chin and spiky hair. The art seemed more realistic but also more western. I also thought a lot of the characters were too pale. I suppose that's how the Japanese view the Europeans. Also, eventho I understand they were trying to capture the androgynous nature D'Eon, he just looked freakish. Either way I disliked it the design, I meant, it just didn't appeal to me. Personalitywise, the heroes I thought were OK, however a lot of the supposed villains in this series I felt were bit too hokey and caricature-ish.ENJOYMENTDon't waste your time, there are plenty of good animes out there.

Studios, the creator of such anime as Ghost in the Shell and Blood+. As such, it perfectly continues this legendary studio's penchant for superb anime. Let's take a look in this review, at this series.Adapted from a manga, this series tells the story of a young nobleman, Deon de Beaumont, who in the stormy age of Pre-Revolutionary France, battles a sinister evil which threatens his country and kills his sister, Lia. At first, he is appointed by the king, that great iconoclast of history, Louis XV, to bring back the fabled Royal...Psalms (a book believed to possess great alchemic power), a journey which takes the young knight and his companions as far away as Russia and England. Faced with death and destruction everywhere, Deon, who is still grieving for his sister, realizes an awful truth: that her soul, wanting revenge, is within him still, and comes out when he faces an enemy. Armed with the terrible Psalm of Vengeance, she wields her sword with absolute ruthlessness, slaying all that stand before her. It is their story that the anime proceeds to tell.That's for the story. The anime itself has been superbly executed. It will enthrall every viewer with its splendid character design (so unlike other anime: no huge eyes, no pink hair), awesome storyline and backdrops. Every episode gives edge-of-the-seat excitement; there's a new story waiting everywhere. History buffs will like the historical backdrop placed around what is obviously a fictional story. Characters like Louis XV, Marie-Louise Pompadour, and George III of England seem to resemble their historical counterparts to the last T. Places like Versailles and the castles of England are authentically rendered, making this anime a treat for history buffs.For other types of fans, too, there's much material available. The fans of magic will love the Poets' manipulation of the words in the Royal Psalms to create zombies and what not. Swordfighting fans will find that in plenty; every episode carries a swordfight or two. Those who merely content themselves with gawking at the female/male characters will also be satisfied, because this anime contains some of the most memorable characters in anime history: the handsome Durand among the males, and the ravishing Lia de Beaumont among the females. In all, this anime would make a must-watch for all anime fans.However, no anime is perfect, not even Production I.G.'s (look at Blood+). This anime could have done better with a faster pace and a shorter length. The story I.G. chose to tell wasn't worth 24 episodes. Also, the relationship between Lia and Deon (elder sister and baby brother) could have been accentuated. Lia in her later form as Deon's possessor seems far too like a bloodthirsty Boadicea than a kind and gentle elder sister whose ostensible purpose for possessing her brother is 'to protect him'. Granted, she is actually a secret agent, but somehow that excuse does not wash when one sees her brother taking horrible amounts of damage for her.Another complaint lies in the fact that there are no good antagonists. Madame Pompadour contents herself with just political intrigues, the Comte de Saint-Germain, a powerful Poet, does not make an appearance till the last episode. Even the face and voice of the opposition, Maximillian Robespierre, is so unlike his historical counterpart that he is almost unrecognizable. He has lost all of the reforming zeal that was so manifest in the real Robespierre, who became the hand of the Revolution of 1789. The directors attempt to resolve this by making Robin (previously an attendant of the French queen and a companion of Deon's) the new Robespierre, but the issue remains hanging still. The only 'good' antagonist is Louis himself. The ending, too, is exceedingly dry and confusing.That said, this anime is a definite 10/10 on my list for, even with its imperfections, the anime remains a superbly-crafted masterpiece which tells a highly-charged story about a time when the instruments of revolution changed from blades to words. While watching the series, I was time and again reminded of my favorite author, Voltaire, who lived in these terrible times and was the exponent of this new form of revolution and along with it, a haunting line from the movie V for Vendetta (I quote from memory): &quot;An idea cannot be killed, for an idea does not have a body. Men may die, but the idea lives on until, helped by the circumstances, it turns into reality.&quot; Psalms (a book believed to possess great alchemic power), a journey which takes the young knight and his companions as far away as Russia and England.

Execution of the premise... ah well... (inhales sharply). \'Rose of Versailles\' has 21st century successor with a Gothic (in the old literary sense) twist that gets it started with a bang, but a muddled middle act that\'s only partially counterbalanced by an emotional but not entirely coherent ending. Like \'Psycho-Pass\', this leaves me wondering what could have been.-Story-\'D\'Eon\' begins with the best first episode I have ever seen, hands down. It\'s fast-paced, exciting, and establishes the setting clearly without resorting to infodumps. I was completely hooked and expecting the ride of my life. And it\'s a very good...ride for the first arc, but when the second arc starts things begin to go off the rails.  While \'D\'Eon\' establishes itself as a supernatural murder mystery set in pre-Revolutionary France, it makes a jarring transition to political conspiracy about halfway through. The cast seems to forget exactly what they came to do and get tied up in political arcs that are only tangentially related to finding Lia d\'Beaumont\'s murderer. The ending certainly has emotional impact, but so many *WHAT A TWIST* moments are thrown on screen that it can be hard to piece everything together. The magic system behind the supernatural elements is never fully explained, there seem to be no hard and fast rules such as ""Equivalent Exchange"" to give it order and structure. But it does have plenty of \'cool\' factor in that the spells are activated by quoting various Biblical Psalms (although the one quoted most often is not Biblical but written specifically for the anime).The main theme of the story is loyalty: what are you loyal to? The old order is being challenged by the rise of the Enlightenment and the French monarchy is blissfully unaware of how close the country is to a full-scale eruption of chaos and ambition- exactly who and what do you swear loyalty too? Family, individuals, institutions, ideals? What price are you prepared to pay for your loyalty? How far are you willing to go? And what happens when loyalties conflict? The topic is covered in moderate depth, but never truly delivers any revelations beyond how hard it can be to pick the right side when the world is shaking around you- good but not earth-shattering. In short the story needed tightening up and better flow to take full advantage of its cool elements.-Art-When the art wants to be beautiful, it can be beautiful. During fight scenes animation fluidity is excellent even by 2015 standards, the lighting is dramatic, and the backdrops are gorgeous. The catch is that more low-key moments clearly have more basic art. Detail drops noticeably during long-distance shots and you can occasionally catch the character designs going off-model. If quality could have been consistently maintained this would be a 9 or 10, but alas it\'s hit-and-miss. The character designs are solid, none truly stand out as unique, but given that this story takes place within the context of (alternate) history there\'s only so far that they can go. Still, the designs made the characters immediately recognizable, which is important given the size of the cast. The CGI is fairly well integrated for its day, but the CGI\'s best work is in a case where it DOESN\'T fit perfectly: the mercury blood of the Gargoyle monsters is done in CGI and doesn\'t quite match the 2D animation it\'s paired with- which gives it a very otherworldly feel. The art has its stunning high points, but it\'s clear money and effort was spent unevenly.-Sound-A high point of this anime. The English dub actors all manage to fit the characters well, and Funimation avoided reusing well-know voices (as they are known to do fairly often). D\'Eon sounds confused but passionate about his cause. Durand gives little verbal clues that he\'s cynical, calculating, and not showing all his cards. Robin sound young and devoted without being annoying (not the easiest feat), and Teillagory fits the cool old man archetype to a \'T\'. The side characters have no weak points worth mentioning. I do have a pet peeve in a couple scenes where a ship\'s horn is clearly heard, even though it\'s a century too early for such an invention. The opening fits but doesn\'t stand out, while the excellent ending song ""Over Night"" by Aya has a very brooding, cold, and distant tone that has me looking it up on YouTube to this day. The background music sets the tone, but does little else.-Characters-There is some potential to work with here (The Queen of France carries around the skull of a small girl- don\'t tell me there\'s nowhere that could go) but overall development is fairly weak. The high point is Durand, he actually surprised me by showing sides of his character that didn\'t mesh with his initial impression, but still made sense given the development shown. D\'Eon has an intriguing premise in that he is constantly battling his sister\'s vengeful soul for the possession of his body (Jekyll and Hyde conflicts are fascinating for me) but his exact goals as a character are unclear. He DOES want to find his sister\'s murderer, but that storyline loses impact with all the aforementioned detours and delays the plot takes (though I believe he\'s supposed to be a conflicted character, so I\'ll go a bit easy on this weakness). Robin\'s arc was fairly obvious (nobody that idealistic gets through an anime like this unscathed), and Teillagory got rushed and not entirely convincing development at the last minute. The villains are uninspiring as well (except for a gleefully psychopathic man-child in Peter III of Russia) with no clear motivation beyond starting the French Revolution ahead of schedule.-Enjoyment-I was hooked from the very first episode, which played directly into a lot my biases by using a number of my favorite genres. But this anime suffers from a clear case of \'The Sagging Middle\' and some episodes between the first and final arcs I simply watched in order to not risk missing anything important. A re-watch also showed some cracks in the story I overlooked back on the first run through. Still, it\'s a historical fiction Gothic horror mystery thriller, so I never hated it (I can\'t exactly find a lot of anime in THAT particular genre anyway) and it\'s positives do make it moderately enjoyable.-Overall-A series that blew its potential is worse than a series that never had any, in my book. Refocusing on a more simple ""Find the guy who did it and get him"" plot would probably have helped the story (the recent American film ""True Grit"" used this plot very well) and digging deeper into the characters never hurts anything. But for all its faults, it\'s still worth a watch for people who like its genre (but fans of other genres will probably be harder to win over). DANG IT I REALLY WANTED THIS TO BE EXCELLENT AND ALL I GOT WAS A BIT ABOVE AVERAGE. (I\'m going to go read \'Dracula\' or \'Jekyll and Hyde\' now, I need some Gothic Horror...) ride for the first arc, but when the second arc starts things begin to go off the rails.  While \'D\'Eon\' establishes itself as a supernatural murder mystery set in pre-Revolutionary France, it makes a jarring transition to political conspiracy about halfway through. The cast seems to forget exactly what they came to do and get tied up in political arcs that are only tangentially related to finding Lia d\'Beaumont\'s murderer. The ending certainly has emotional impact, but so many *WHAT A TWIST* moments are thrown on screen that it can be hard to piece everything together. The magic system behind the supernatural elements is never fully explained, there seem to be no hard and fast rules such as ""Equivalent Exchange"" to give it order and structure. But it does have plenty of \'cool\' factor in that the spells are activated by quoting various Biblical Psalms (although the one quoted most often is not Biblical but written specifically for the anime).The main theme of the story is loyalty: what are you loyal to? The old order is being challenged by the rise of the Enlightenment and the French monarchy is blissfully unaware of how close the country is to a full-scale eruption of chaos and ambition- exactly who and what do you swear loyalty too? Family, individuals, institutions, ideals? What price are you prepared to pay for your loyalty? How far are you willing to go? And what happens when loyalties conflict? The topic is covered in moderate depth, but never truly delivers any revelations beyond how hard it can be to pick the right side when the world is shaking around you- good but not earth-shattering. In short the story needed tightening up and better flow to take full advantage of its cool elements.-Art-When the art wants to be beautiful, it can be beautiful. During fight scenes animation fluidity is excellent even by 2015 standards, the lighting is dramatic, and the backdrops are gorgeous. The catch is that more low-key moments clearly have more basic art. Detail drops noticeably during long-distance shots and you can occasionally catch the character designs going off-model. If quality could have been consistently maintained this would be a 9 or 10, but alas it\'s hit-and-miss. The character designs are solid, none truly stand out as unique, but given that this story takes place within the context of (alternate) history there\'s only so far that they can go. Still, the designs made the characters immediately recognizable, which is important given the size of the cast. The CGI is fairly well integrated for its day, but the CGI\'s best work is in a case where it DOESN\'T fit perfectly: the mercury blood of the Gargoyle monsters is done in CGI and doesn\'t quite match the 2D animation it\'s paired with- which gives it a very otherworldly feel. The art has its stunning high points, but it\'s clear money and effort was spent unevenly.-Sound-A high point of this anime. The English dub actors all manage to fit the characters well, and Funimation avoided reusing well-know voices (as they are known to do fairly often). D\'Eon sounds confused but passionate about his cause. Durand gives little verbal clues that he\'s cynical, calculating, and not showing all his cards. Robin sound young and devoted without being annoying (not the easiest feat), and Teillagory fits the cool old man archetype to a \'T\'. The side characters have no weak points worth mentioning. I do have a pet peeve in a couple scenes where a ship\'s horn is clearly heard, even though it\'s a century too early for such an invention. The opening fits but doesn\'t stand out, while the excellent ending song ""Over Night"" by Aya has a very brooding, cold, and distant tone that has me looking it up on YouTube to this day. The background music sets the tone, but does little else.-Characters-There is some potential to work with here (The Queen of France carries around the skull of a small girl- don\'t tell me there\'s nowhere that could go) but overall development is fairly weak. The high point is Durand, he actually surprised me by showing sides of his character that didn\'t mesh with his initial impression, but still made sense given the development shown. D\'Eon has an intriguing premise in that he is constantly battling his sister\'s vengeful soul for the possession of his body (Jekyll and Hyde conflicts are fascinating for me) but his exact goals as a character are unclear.

Most pathetic story I have come across for a while. The ending wasn\'t so much depressing as it was just extremely disappointing. It just got worse as it went on. From the beginning, I noticed something was off because the narrator sounded very old and very depressed. Having someone narrate the story to you in the past tense from the get go takes you out of the real-time immersion of watching an anime, besides the fact that the old man\'s voice gives an ominous foreboding, which I hate. The most jarring thing about this anime (a hard thing to pinpoint, since there...were so many) is probably the whole magical Psalms of the King idea. Somehow, reading the Bible gives you magical powers such as controlling other people\'s bodies and body parts and killing them in a painful way. It\'s like I\'m watching a shounen series. Text just randomly appears and scrolls along the floor, walls, ceiling, and across people\'s bodies, including their eyeballs. Am I watching Naruto? The second most jarring thing about this anime is how seriously it seems to take history, whilst not being historically accurate AT ALL. At least Samurai Champloo stated outright that it\'s not historically accurate at the very start. This anime pretends to be historical when it\'s anything but.Art - The art itself is fair, although the postures are bad. Characters are not drawn consistently, and tend to be QUALITY at least half the time. D\'Eon is drawn exactly like a woman. If I hadn\'t listened to the voice, there would have been no way to tell the difference between D\'Eon and his sister. Yes, this IS a bad thing. I expect a fully grown man to have a more prominent chin, heavier jaw and jaw muscle development and thicker orbital eyebrow bossing than his sister. Also, the third most jarring thing about this series was the 3D CGI. Besides the fact that I hate 3D CG with a passion, it looked absolutely horrendous in this series. The water, the building collapse, and sometimes EVEN THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. I am not kidding you, it is that bad. However, the fight scenes are animated quite well (I\'m not talking about the choreography, only the portrayal of motion) so that\'s something to look forward towards if you\'re a big fan of sword fighting.Sound - Mediocre. The ending song is okay, I suppose. The voices aren\'t particularly great.Character - Poor. The dialogue is terrible, there is not a shred of originality. Everyone says they want to serve France (or Russia), except for one or two guys who just want money, or to watch the world burn. It\'s boring at best and downright nauseating when you\'re subjected to the same trivial inane pretentious ass-kissing suck-up garbage from nobles who ""just want to serve their country"". Is it possible to create believable, consistent characters? Not according to the writers of Le Chevalier D\'Eon. The characters are there to show the struggle between ""honor and loyalty"". That\'s about it. In case you don\'t understand how honor and loyalty can conflict with each other, allow me to illustrate using a simple example from the anime. Teillagory is loyal to the deceased Louis XIV, but his honor compels him to overthrow Louis XV and replace him with Louis XIV\'s brother, because Louis XV sent knights to die on dishonorable missions. How does this make any sense? It doesn\'t. Characters switch allegiances every 5 seconds, it\'s hard to remember who\'s fighting for whom anymore. It\'s hard to build sympathy for characters who constant betray their comrades.Enjoyment - Practically none. It was a chore to sit through the labored, expository dialogue and the totally baffling nonsense that was the entire plot. Every time someone died, I felt a sense of elation as that was how the story moved forward. The entire story made no sense at all. Robespierre dying and then coming back to life and then dying again? WTF?Overall - About as historical as Naruto. If you enjoy watching fencing then this anime might be for you.

Otherwise don\'t bother.', ""Often considered the 'spiritual' successor to the classic shojo anime Rose of Versailles, Le Chevalier is much more fantastical, a little less historical, but still a kick ass series.  When I say 'kick ass' though, that does not mean that this is an action heavy series.  While there is action, the plot does not revolve around powering up and beating the badguys to a pulp.  However, can you say attack of the mercury-zombie-parisian-prostitutes?  Oh yeah, they went there.Story:The story is loosely (read VERY loosely) based on the life of the real life Charles D'Eon De Beaumont. D'Eon,...considered the patron saint of transexuals in some circles was a courtier, spy and professional fencer.  She also requested to be acknowledged as a woman during her life, so that is how I will refer to her.  The real D'Eon was indeed a spy in Russia, as well as England and considered one of the top fencers in the world during her time.  She did not, however, have a twin sister named Lia, which was largely a fabrication by a Russian Novelist. It is widely believed though, that D'Eon did in fact have some dirt on Louis XVThe setting takes us from the courts of Versailles across Europe to solve the mystery of Lia de Beaumont's murder.  D'Eon (depicted as male in the anime) only has one clue to go on, 'Psalms' etched in blood on his sister's coffin.  Almost immediatly stumbling into more than he expected, mysterious mercury infused corpses, magical psalms and political intrigue further complicate matters.  D'Eon, his fencing instructor Teillagory, the pageboy Robin and the dashing Durand set off to set things straight...and are joined by Lia, who's spirit happens to posess D'Eon from time to time to kick some ass!Art:No moe-moe here.  There are also no over the top transformation sequences, facial expressions, or 'going super saiyan' for lack of better terms.  The art takes a semi-realistic style, with rich scenery and beautiful costumes.  The production crew really did their research here in terms of period clothing and architecture.  CGI is used occasionally, but nothing over the top, keeping effects subtle.  If this sort of thing is your speed, it's almost worth looking at just for the scenery and architecture!Sound:Do yourselves a favor and avoid the English dub.  It isn't bad, just pretty monotone.  Given the choice between the two, I would pick the Japanese dub any day with this one.  BORN is a memorable opening, but nothing overly catchy, or one that would stand out from other anime openings.  The background music is very well done though (again, nothing catchy, but then, it's background music) with nothing particularly jarring.  Most of it is heavily based on European Classical compositions.  However, it can be a little monotone at times.Character:Hoooooo boy...History is a hobby of mine, and there are quite a few historical characters in this.  D'Eon, Louis XV, Madame Pompadorr, Maximilian Robespierre, Louis XIV, Comte de Sainte Germain, and these are only a few of them!  Needless to say, historical inaccuracy abounds, as in any work of historic fiction.  Again, read: mercury-infused-parisian-zombie-prostitutes.  If inaccuracies for the purpose of great story don't bother you, all should be well.Development for D'Eon himself is limited, given that he has to share a body and screen time with the much more interesting vengeful spirit of Lia.  The supporting cast is likeable, with heroes you love and villains you aren't sure whether to love or hate until their true colours are shown.  Durand and Teillagory get interesting developments, and Robin's subplot in the end will just plain knock your socks off.  The character given the most attention by far though is Lia, driven by revenge and a need to find out who killed her, and why she had to die.  It's not all that often the victim solves her own murder.  This does not mean though that all the minor characters are complete write offs; they are all needed and intricate pieces of the puzzle.Enjoyment:I had to cage up my inner history-geek, but it was a very enjoyable series.  The plot though, is a big strength as well as a huge draw back.  The show is very plot heavy, which leads to a lot of expository and dialogue (think Death Note in Period costumes).  If that sort of thing bores you, I can almost guarantee you won't be able to stay awake through the whole series.  For fans of the murder mystery genre, supernatural, historic-fiction and of course, cross dressing pretty boys, this is one for your completed list.Warning:  Contains Character Death, intense fencing, nudity, zombies, blood, loss of limb, coarse language, alcohol/drug use, prostitution, disturbing imagery, and parisian-mercury-zombie-hookers.  Not for young children.  I'd say PG-15 just because of the intellectual capacity needed to folow the plot without fanservice of any kind to tide you over.Overall:  8 considered the patron saint of transexuals in some circles was a courtier, spy and professional fencer.

Barely anyone has heard of it and with a 7.2/10 score on MAL, people get discouraged from even picking up this masterpiece of a series.As far as plot and story go, the anime is extremely unique and has an engaging, complex, great story filled with twists and turns and a mystery that had me on the edge of my seat. However, it's not perfect and thus there are some minor faults with the story. Firstly, the show pretends to be extremely complex (it still is to an extent) while...in reality kind of sidelines some of the stuff that gets introduced and just moves on to something else completely, this leaves some confusion and I did find myself kind of forgetting some of the stuff that happened in the anime while I was watching it. Also theres a lot of fake-out deaths just for the shock factor like seriously half the people just die to be found alive in the very next episode. But it has a pretty good ending.As for the characters, most of them are pretty well-written and have depth, and development and their motives are easy to understand. The anime is 24 episodes and tries to juggle many different characters in the story so not all of them are written well, especially the main protagonist, D'eon. His fucking comrades are more interesting than this bitch is. Durrant is in my opinion the best character in the anime and his sacrifice was moving. Teillagori is interesting and his betrayal by the end of the series kinda feels forced as if it came out of nowhere and uses 3 minutes of backstory to justify it only for him to also later die. He could've been more fleshed out. Robin was the character I didn't like at the beginning yet his character development at the end makes him an extremely better character than D'eon. I kinda think I would've liked it more if D'eon chose the path that Robin chooses by the end. Even Lia is more interesting than D'eon. D'eon's literal character is thathe's the cool, generic main character who's loyal as fuck to France even if Louis XV was a piece of shit and even in the end he doesn't change. Also, Anna is just the most unnecessary wasted character in the entire show she literally doesn't have any personality other than waiting for D'eon and then dying at the end for shock factor. As for the antagonists, Louis XV's reveal, in the end, was pretty awesome and he is a good antagonist albeit with very little screentime. Maxmillian too is entertaining to watch albeit his character could have been written better.Also the opening song is pretty well done as it not only is fun to watch but also contains hidden meanings that by the end of the series when you watch it becomes evident.In terms of pacing, I would say the anime is kind of a mess in the sense that some episodes feel slow while events in that episode move pretty quickly. I think the anime could have been better and more fleshed out if it had more episodes. Most of my complaints with it would be taken care of if there were more episodes to flesh out the story.As much as this review seems negative don't get me wrong, this show is still an entertaining hidden masterpiece that needs more recognition. Its as of now in my top 15 anime and I look forward to the day it gets what it deserves even if that day seems unlikely. 9.0/10 in reality kind of sidelines some of the stuff that gets introduced and just moves on to something else completely, this leaves some confusion and I did find myself kind of forgetting some of the stuff that happened in the anime while I was watching it.

I usually enjoy shows with a historical backdrop, and this is the reason why I first approached the series. Actually, that might have been the only saving point of this show, how it utilized actual historical events and fit them into the fictional existence of the Psalms and D\'Eon\'s sister Lia.I rated the story as mediocre because it starts out in a promising way, the first couple episodes carefully setting up the plot points and characters that will eventually develop, these few first episodes are crafted well enough to hook your interest in the series, and they made me genuinely...curious as to where it would all develop, yet as the story progressed, while some enigmas were answered (which honestly you eventually suspect on your own), the use of the Psalms, their meaning, significance and ultimate goal become so convoluted and contradictory it made me feel that this particular element was misused in the story or unnecessarily exploited it. The last episode compressed some of the progress I would have rather seen explored within the series itself rather than packed as an epilogue.Why is anyone giving high ratings to the art? Besides the first DVD which is lovingly and crisply animated, the remainder of the show the quality goes down the drain. This was ultimately proven when one of the characters has a flashback of his journey with his comrades, and in every scene he was in he looks slightly different, yes you know it\'s him, but there was such differing drawing standards from one episode to another, sometimes  the drawing just looked downright lazy. Backgrounds are always lush and beautiful though, plus the use of 3D is well done, I\'ll give it that.Another pet peeve for me was the costume choices... for a historical piece I was expecting more accuracy in the depiction of the fashion of the period. Most of the female characters are dressed in styles from different fashion movements, and Lia\'s ""lolita-esque"" ensemble with ankle length skirt would simply be nonexistent and inappropriate at the time. The lack of variety of fashions (ok, fine it\'s anime they will wear the same outfit over and over) was also a disappointment since these characters were nobles and would not be caught in the same outfit twice.Characters were given a 6. D\'Eon was bland. Lia\'s potential was not explored further. The rest of the cast fit into some sort of expected role. The only two that were of interest or showed some growth were Robin and Maximilien. I simply could not get over how plain Ana was, every single time she came on screen... that short hair? No noble woman in the Palais Versailles would ever have her hair styled in that manner during that period... agh Ana...Music was wonderful.Overall, halfway through the series I considered dropping it since I had a feeling of where it would all go, but kept my hopes up for something better after reading other reviews. Now I regret sticking to it instead of watching something else. The ending was not completely unsatisfying and they do their best to tie up all lose ends. Yet, it did not leave me with great excitement to share this with other people. curious as to where it would all develop, yet as the story progressed, while some enigmas were answered (which honestly you eventually suspect on your own), the use of the Psalms, their meaning, significance and ultimate goal become so convoluted and contradictory it made me feel that this particular element was misused in the story or unnecessarily exploited it.

Most of the female characters are dressed in styles from different fashion movements, and Lia\'s ""lolita-esque"" ensemble with ankle length skirt would simply be nonexistent and inappropriate at the time. The lack of variety of fashions (ok, fine it\'s anime they will wear the same outfit over and over) was also a disappointment since these characters were nobles and would not be caught in the same outfit twice.Characters were given a 6. D\'Eon was bland. Lia\'s potential was not explored further. The rest of the cast fit into some sort of expected role. The only two that were of interest or showed some growth were Robin and Maximilien. I simply could not get over how plain Ana was, every single time she came on screen... that short hair? No noble woman in the Palais Versailles would ever have her hair styled in that manner during that period... agh Ana...Music was wonderful.Overall, halfway through the series I considered dropping it since I had a feeling of where it would all go, but kept my hopes up for something better after reading other reviews. Now I regret sticking to it instead of watching something else. The ending was not completely unsatisfying and they do their best to tie up all lose ends. Yet, it did not leave me with great excitement to share this with other people.', 'Style - The animation is pretty good, although it did use 3D REALLY badly at some points and faces are often stiff and/or badly drawn. 2 out of 3.Character - The characters seemed to serve little purpose other than to advance the plot by doing unexpected things. There are very few moments of character development (D\'Eon writing a letter to his lover does not count as character development) where we learn about a character\'s past and his motivations. As a result, the actions of characters such as Durand and Teillagory are completely unintelligible to us, simply because nothing has been revealed about their past...or their motivations. 0 out of 4.Story - Anything but historical. You might do well to know that not only did D\'Eon not have a sister called Lia, but that Lia did not even exist, only tales which claim that D\'Eon disguised himself as Lia to meet the Empress of Russia. But this is missing the point. The entire anime is based around the Psalms Of The King which has the magical power to choose who will be the king. Oh and, you have to kill the Empress of Russia and use her blood to read the book. Oh and only Lia can read the book because she was somehow supposed to be the king of France. Also, the book only allows certain chosen people to lift it. Also, Robespierre gets resurrected. A certain phrase comes to mind (""It\'s magic I don\'t have to explain shit""). Actually, I understand where this occult interpretation of the Bible comes from. When the Japanese first encountered Christianity, they thought it was a book of spells that allowed them to kill enemies and reanimate the dead.

It basically tries to discuss what is considered to be true loyalty: should you only be loyal to your king, or should you also be loyal to your country, or maybe even to your own conscience? The best part is how they delivered this great theme. The writers didn't give out their interpretation right away. Instead, using almost every character, even the king himself, the show offers a variety of different interpretations of loyalty, and let the...viewers decide which one is the true loyalty. It really shows that the writers do have a deep understanding of what they are trying to deliver.PlotThe plot rivals that of A Prayer for Owen Meanie which is my favourite novel. It has some religious elements but never relies on them too much. It has a lot of government conspiracies and political conflicts but never forgets asking questions toward its theme. It tries to discuss a more or less philosophical question but the plot is full of twists and never becomes dull. The story also takes the viewers to different countries in Europe at that time which is very interesting to watch, especially to a person who has little knowledge in European history such as myself.CharactersSimply perfect. They really did a great job developing the male lead who initally holds a strong sense of loyalty to his king but starts to question it as the story progresses. All the side characters are great too. All of them have some great backstories and none of them are truly good or evil. I think the best part is that most of them do actually have an air of true knight and noble chiasma, something you rarely see these days.MusicThe OP, ED, and BGM are all great.AnimationYou may be disappointed if you are looking for any basketball-sized eyes. Instead, this artists followed a more realistc style throughout the show, and I absolutely love it. The animation is gorgeous, especially in the combat scenes and the breathtaking background design.I strongly recommend this show to anyone who is sick and tired of all the shounen crap these days.

I hold a deep disdain for historical fiction titles that take themselves too seriously to hold any relevance or entertainment. I am also intensely confused by the Francophile tendencies of the anime industry. Le Chevalier D'eon is based loosely on the story of Chevalier D'eon who was a French spy who once donned women's clothing to carry out the King's will in Russia. Naturally, Production I.G. could not resist adapting this EPIC story of a cross dressing, French spy from the 1800's into a TV series.But enough of that, despite a satisfactory and complete ending, Le Chevalier D'eon...suffers from miserable pacing issues which damage any sliver of suspense it tries to build with a convoluted plot and arrogantly-written, flowery language. While the animation staff does a satisfactory job choreographing fight scenes and adapting the anime style for this rendition of Western history, the animation is nothing to call home about. And in a sweeping attempt to create drama, the creators decide to kill 90% of the characters for no apparent reason in an act that would have reached true comedic tragedy if it weren't so humorless in its tone.

Three big things that stick out with this series are how complex it is, its historical accuracy of the final days of monarchy rule being the norm in 18th century Europe and having...a large number of characters that it focuses on. D'Eon's quest to recover a stolen item for King Louis XV and find answers about Lia's death lead him to also journey into Russia and England where he encounters inner conflicts within the monarchies of both countries and later in his homeland of France. Influential figures within the monarchies of these countries are unsatisfied with the present directions of their nation's policies under their present rulers and will do whatever they can to claim the throne, even having to resort to assassination and abandoning their status and loyalty to their home country.While Le Chevalier D'Eon presents a fictional account of these events with the incorporation of the occult, it does accurately portray the norms and political tensions present within 18th century European society. Besides accuracy in designing the clothing, mannerisms and items of the era, Le Chevalier D'Eon prominently focuses on the touchy side of having a monarchy with royal officials abusing their power and trying to usurp the throne, those being the ruling power becoming malcontent with sacrificing individual desires for the needs of the country and the touchy political relations between foreign nations over territory. The series also touched upon signs of rebellion stirring up with the commoners and those who gave up positions of authority in their monarchy due to their disgust over the large divide in resources available between the common class and those of the royal and wealthy elite. I haven't seen a series touch upon such issues with European monarchy since I seen Rose of Versailles two years ago.With the series divided up into arcs focused on the journey of D'Eon and his three companions across France, Russia and England, Le Chevalier D'Eon introduces a large cast of characters who make up the ruling body and influential positions within each country's monarchy, as well as some antagonists trying to shake up their country's political system with their corrupt and terrorist acts. Many of these characters are fleshed out enough where you get a sense of their motivations and beliefs in regards to how they view their country's present situation. Some of these characters are even revealed to have a past connection to Lia which allows the viewer to better understand the type of person she was and slowly unveil more details concerning the facts surrounding her death.There were only a couple issues I had concerning Le Chevalier D'Eon's plot and characters. The show doesn't give every prominent character depth as shown through a few of the show's antagonists such as the crazed Pyotr III. In addition, the final three episodes of the show put out a lot of information regarding everything that took place throughout the series which went against the slow buildup that Le Chevalier D'Eon had with unveiling its information in earlier episodes and it got quite daunting for me to take in every bit of information revealed all at once.In terms of visuals, Le Chevalier D'Eon quite often gets inconsistent with its animation style. Some shots feature slick looking CG renderings of the inside of palaces like France's Palace of Versailles while settings of village locales tend to be drawn in a watercolor style that looks rather washed up in quality. Clothing designs for characters are great to look at and are accurate for the time period in which this series is set, yet the facial designs of said characters are simple and on the plain side. In terms of animation, the series does usually resort to still shots to simulate scenes of conflict yet also shows well choreographed and fluid sword fighting scenes which occur quite frequently in this series.Overall, Le Chevalier D'Eon was a solid and surprisingly complex series featuring an expansive cast of characters which the series gives focus on, an accurate depiction of the flaws to a traditional monarchical system and the large number of plot threads that the series tackles through D'Eon's journey.

It was interesting seeing D'Eon morph from himself to his sister Lea Beaumont, who was assassinated in Russia (yes it's historically accurate).  It showed him as he went to Russia disguised as his sister.  The events...that transpired were kind of sad, but France was a falling kingdom and changing into a free government.  It also showed the importance of faith in hard times.There wasn't a lot of fighting and it really didn't need it, because the story flowed.  The enjoyment factor was high as you watched and discovered, what place D'Eon Beaumont and the musketeers had in shaping French history and their relationship to King Louis.This was a great anime series.

I am a huge fan of the eighteenth century, and they did a fantastic job at depicting that in this story. Remember that this is a tragedy ahead of time.Warning: There may be spoilers, and vague descriptions.Story:We start off with a coffin drifting in a canal in Paris. Outside is in blood ""Psalms"" is written, and inside lies the body of Lia who is D\'Eon\'s sister. D\'Eon is a loyal servant of King Louis XV of France, and leaves Versailles to serve as the secret police of the King in Paris to try...to find what happened to his sister. From there on you are introduced to the other characters and the mystery of the ""Poets"" who recite verses of the Psalms to reveal their powers for both good and evil. The story itself is composed fairly well, and you need to be aware that this is a tragedy, and it will end as such. Though with that said the ending is satisfying for the most part. Everything to me seemed to wrap well together though the transformation was a throw off at the end of the first episode. The story is wrapped in adventure, mystery and religion.Opinion:Le Chevalier D\'Eon was fantastic. I loved the historical characters that were injected, though I found the abdication of a certain king rather inaccurate. The show of course has it\'s flaws. I would have wished for a slightly more joyful conclusion, but alas I was disappointed there. Though the sounds I found fairly good, along with the script, and then the opening theme is just phenomenal. I love the song and wish it had a cover in English. Overall I give the series a 9/10 respectfully. I took a point off due to the ending and the artwork that feels a little off nowadays. Though there is nothing wrong with it.

The plot or setting itself is fairy interesting and unique. Starting with rather unusual location for Anime to be placed at and an odd setting that mixes bible and zombies with some supernatural powers. Sounds interesting right?No......truthfully the story tries to be convoluted, tragic and rather grand. But in fact it feels more like a a really bad stage play that attempts to be serious, but feels too much of a comedy to be a serious.I simply got extremely bored almost the whole time I were watching this Anime, but because of the setting/plot I didn\'t want to drop it as were somewhat intrigued how it would end. And in short.. I felt I wasted my time.If you want a bad stage play that takes place in France and few other countries that has zombies in it and bible verses. Then check it out. Otherwise, it was simply boring for me.✦Art & SoundArtstyle was unique I guess for the most part. Although the way characters looked, I did not like that muchAs for OST, it was good enough. Few noticeable soundtracks.✦CharacterSigh... bad actors? That is how I sum the up. Characters felt forced, boring and fairly disappointing. I were more interested in side characters than main ones. Only main one I somewhat enjoyed was the tip fedora old man.As for side ones . Can\'t mention as the reason I somewhat liked them would be spoilers.But anyhow... ""meh"".✦Enjoyment & OverallTo sum it up. I don\'t like stage plays.  And this Anime felt like one. As well lot of boredom and disappointment were also in the mix.

This is just horrible.First of all it is boring. It took me MONTH to watch all episodes when previous anime I chose, I watched in one day.Characters are just pathetic, retarded, stupid etc. (I can write here whole vocabulary of negative adjectives). I don't want to write spoilers here but I will say that mainly it has to do with the so-called loyalty to their king. Come'on, who would be loyal to such pathetic retarded trash? Louis XV was shown here as the biggest trash ever. It is...no longer called loyalty but stupidity (to know why watch it to the end by I advise you don't even try - I admire myself that I managed to finish such a shit and I started suspected if I am not masochist, the only reason I didn't drop this anime is that I never drop anything I watch).Ending is plainly stupid and senseless.Don't watch this shit - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED :) no longer called loyalty but stupidity (to know why watch it to the end by I advise you don't even try - I admire myself that I managed to finish such a shit and I started suspected if I am not masochist, the only reason I didn't drop this anime is that I never drop anything I watch).Ending is plainly stupid and senseless.Don't watch this shit - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED :)"", 'First of all - what have I just seen? This is an anime focused on actual historical personalities, which heavily involves fantasy elements and magic references.Unfortunately, it comprises of the worst superficial characters ever, which have zero development, while the series progress. Everyone acts and feels the exact same way as if nothing around them changes. They do not grow or even make decisions - they only repeat the same lines over and over again as a magical chant, never analysing the messages of life.Without revealing anything, I would say that the lead character won my utter outrage with their final decision on how...their life should be. I do realise such events do mess with your mind, but should anyone really end up like D\'Eon? What is the message at all? Most likely, this was just an attempt to ""patch up"" the storyline to the actual historical events...and it was made poorly.The anime interpretation is quite a letdown compared to the actual Chevalier D\'Eon, who is a complex and somewhat tragic individual with a peculiar story, still surrounded by mystery; someone with actual diplomatic achievements.I believe the challenge of interpreting world history got the best of this anime\'s creators, so their fear of ""messing up"" resulted in bland, unlikeable characters, who only act, when forced to.The ""revelations"" and ""plot twists""  happened during the last three episodes, which made them look under-cooked and uncalled for.My last disappointment was the music, which was almost absent. Having in mind you are in lavishing Versailles, this is rather unfulfilling.Bottom line is, I have watched this after Gankutsuou, as I was looking for a similar feel, but Le Chevalier D\'Eon failed quite miserably.I am giving the anime 5/10 for the art, which is beautiful and because unfortunately, I have seen much worse. their life should be.

I like how the story takes place in France, which is different from many series' setting. Unfortunately, it seems this series sacrificed it's creativity for its unique storyline. The first episode had a rather nice flow to it, but after that it began to slow down.The flow was so bad, I considered stopping the series after the third episode. Giving it a chance though, it didn't even pick up until about the 19th episode! What kept me watching was simply the oddness of...where the story was going. Without giving away too many details, there were just things that didn't make sense.Characters:The characters are one of the things that will confuse any viewer! Not only are the men shallow and unrealistic, they also contradict themselves through the whole story! The main character seems to have a total break with reality as the story progresses, due to his sister possessing him more and more. His sister who supposedly wants vengeance against her killer, only kills everyone she comes in contact with! To top it off, the bad characters are made to be almost sympathetic...while the good characters are almost...evil!Art & Sound:The art and sound kept me actually watching this series at times. Set in historic France, the series captures some fantastic artwork. The viewer begins to feel lost in France, unfortunately having to follow the character's story. Little details clearly meant something in this series, as the sound is great as well. I really can't complain with the art and sound.Enjoyment Overall:I'd say unless you skip to the last few episodes this series isn't really worth watching. The only reason I'd ever ask someone to watch this, is if it was a time killer. The characters are awful, the storyline destroyed by the flow, and the art barely holds this series together. For not having known much about this series, it held a little value. Parts of this series seemed so predictable, all I could do is laugh. where the story was going.

It\'s a realistic depiction of the behaviour of the so called masters, for whom their loyal ones; though valued, were just a toy. We get to see one of the most accurate of human behaviour plausible to the viewers. The anime delves deep into topics like loyalty, betrayal and honor, and how somepeope were bound to them, no matter what happens- even if the masters had ill motives towards them, even if they knew it was bad- but they stil wouldn\'tl break the knot of loyalty and...alleigance to maintain their honor as a knight. This anime delves into the life of the hideous people for whom loyalty would\'ve been just as bad as death. No one is good nor bad, you simply can\'t trust anyone in this age.Again in the characters aren\'t developed or fleshed out that well, but they somehow represent their historical counterparts pretty well, like Robespierre is rebellious; D\'eon and Lia are loyal no matter what. And even though the character development isn\'t best, the show does great job at hiding the real motives of its main characters (and their emotions) and springs them out are out really well towards the end when majority of the show\'s revelations are made.The plot of this story is major thing of this series on paper, but as i said prior the real deal of this series is exploring things related to human behaviour and historical problems so the plot is there to carry the story to its revelation. The murder-mystery saga ends at episode 13, the real deal starts after that. The Magic in this story isn\'t necessary since removing it wouldn\'t have affected the plot a lot, but it was pretty well explained, except for a certain things.This anime is a slow burner, and not for everyone. Quite a lot of episodes are elongated and later the climax is sorta rushed, but again its accurate to how it would\'ve happened historically. In a blink of an eye.The anime\'s historical accuracy is laughable at times, but its characters are as expected well portrayed, so now problem there from my side.Animation, and Visuals are great, but the animation gets really sloppy at times, and it isn\'t moe or other ""cute shit"" in anyway. The backgrounds are low-key gorgeous to look at, and I feel like I\'m in France so props for that.Music and Soundtrack is great as well, and I love the OP its beautifully written and describes the emotions of our main character.The only bad thing is that even though the show is accuarate, realistic and simply well made, it isn\'t the memorable like other shounen-type shows, so the strength\'s of this show are it\'s weaknesses.All in all it was a great show, which gave great insights on how royalty and power would really work in the olden days, with a gripping supporting plot added to it. It was a great show, with just few squabbles along the way.So I\'ll give this show a 9.2/10 or 92/100. alleigance to maintain their honor as a knight.

Mostly it seemed to be not the interesting since there was not enough suspence in my opinion and I couldn't geat attached to most characters.However, the main highlight was the arc with Queen which I actually found very enjoyable. It had some interesting characters like Queen herself and some unexpected turn of events which were good and sad.What completly ruined the series for me was the set...of unexpected events that started to happen in several last episodes one after another. For me they seemed to be there just for the sake to be unexpected without having any actual thought behind them. A lot of the things that happened looked so random and out of place that I just couldn't comprehend them and was in WTF mode for the whole time... there could be so many other solutions yet we got the worst possible scenarios and mostly out of nowhere.Because of that I can only give series 6. of unexpected events that started to happen in several last episodes one after another.

I think it was short though and there should be more to the storyline that just a simple 24 mins so it seem they cut the storyline down. However it was still pretty interesting ', 'I felt the story line was a little weak on this OVA. It seemed to lack the well developed flair that most Detective Conan episodes have.The art was just like any other Detective Conan show.The music and sound were right on.The characters I had problems with. Personally I do not care for characters that copy other characters. Since the three children were basically knock offs of Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, and Genta I did like them at all. Their personalities were slightly different but it was clear they were suppose to be knock offs.The OVA was cute for a one time watch but that...is all it will get out of me. is all it will get out of me.']"
Mikan Enikki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3345/Mikan_Enikki,"['Here we go again with yet another Nippon Animation anime show. And this time around, it\'s an anime adaptation of a manga series known as ""Mikan Enikki"". Or ""Mikan\'s Picture Diary"" as it\'s translated.Mikan Enikki is an anime show based on a manga of the same name by Miwa Abiko and animated by, you guessed it, Nippon Animation. Now, i\'ve already talked a bit about the studio before in my reviews of Vickie the Viking, Wakakusa no Charlotte, Dogtanian and the three Muskehound and Corrector Yui. So you should probably be familiar with the anime studio by now.Not much is known about this show\'s popularity...since it lasted for 30 episodes with 2 specials created and sadly faded to obscurity.Now while i said that it was based off the manga, i said it very loosely because there are many occasions where the studio did made some changes and made some new stories and characters to differenciate from the manga.But is it any good? Let\'s find out:The show started with a boy named ""Tom"" who was about to go home with his friends until he noticed an orange cat. At first, he never saw a cat whose fur was orange which was odd to him. But he tend to ignore it and move on. While he was going home, the orange cat decided to follow him and eventually reached home, which surprised Tom for seeing the cat following him. So he decided to ask his parents if they would adopt the cat. The parents agreed to keep the cat with them and call him ""Mikan"".It seems like things were going fine until Tom noticed something suspicious about Mikan. He noticed that the cat could laugh and has been drunk after coming back to his room to sleep. He had no idea what was going on with Mikan. So later that night, he decided to sneak onto him to find out who he really is. In which he found out that the cat was drinking Sake and not only that, but he was also talking and standing with only two hint pants. Tom got shocked with what he just witnessed and decided to take him to his room to find out what was up with him and why he was capable to do thoses things.From there, Mikan explained that he came from another village where he was taken care of by his late grandfather known as Tatsuzo. Who he originally also called Mikan ""Tom"" as well. However ever since his passing, he had to leave the village because Tatsuzo\'s neighborhood couldn\'t accept him as a real cat, but rather, as a speaking yokai-like creature.Tom felt bad for him so they decided to resolve to speak with Tom\'s parents to explain that Mikan is no ordinary cat and convinced them to let him live with them even if he can speak and stand with two hint paws. In which the parents agreed to, but in exchange, do not let Mikan get caught speaking to a human being.So from there, the show would tell the adventures and misadventures of Mikan, his family, his friends and what he would do through out his life.Now with all that said, let me say that the story so far has been great! Each and every stories were quite fun, interesting, hilarious, serious and sometimes a bit sad as well as there are a few moments where we\'d see Mikan in some serious situations. Such as having a fight with other cats and sometimes trying to save others from getting injured.The story is very well written, as well. As you get invested into the anime, more and more you\'ll end up loving alot about this show and it\'s episodes it\'s been told.My favourite episodes are the ones involved with Mikan\'s reunion with his brother named ""Jerry"". And yes, their grandfather really did called them both Tom and Jerry (Totally not violating copyright infringements!)Anyway, i loved the episodes with Jerry because we get to see Mikan trying to understand Jerry\'s feelings and trying to help him out whenever he can.But like i said before, the anime is loosely based off the manga. So there were things that were changed from the manga (Like Mikan\'s backstory for example) and some of the chapters were never adapted into the anime. Like for example, the chapter where Mikan and his friends went into each worlds where there were magics and dragons. That was never adapted into animation.And also, unlike the manga\'s stories where tend to be long and introspective, the anime\'s stories are much shorter, eventful and suspenseful.Not to mention, some of the characters\' personalities have changed here as well. For example, Mikan acts like a selfish troublemaker and does whatever he wants, while the manga despite being nosy, is well-behaved. Or how Kelly got pregnant in the anime compared to the manga version.So you can easily say that the anime\'s story execution is more or less original than you may think so.But is it a bad thing? Nope. I personally think they did a great job at telling it\'s own stories than just trying to adapt the manga faithfully.Though i do wish that we\'d have more episodes to have an proper ending because the anime\'s ending was more of a cup-out ending than it was an open-ending to the show. I\'m not gonna spoil the whole show for all of you, so you can watch the anime for yourself to make up your own thoughts on the ending.Now that i got the story out of the way, let\'s get into the characters:First, there\'s Mikan, who like i said earlier, is one crazy troublemaker who does whatever he pleases. He\'d talk, stand on his own with his legs and often times play his own harmonica that he received as a present. I had a great time seeing this cat being himself. Seeing him do what he knows best, having fun playing around with Tom and of course being a troublemaker himself, he makes me giggle seeing him do something that\'s not normal.There\'s also characters that i do really enjoy. Such as the Kusanagi family. Tom is an ingenuous and caring kid who does anything he can to resolve the problems with Mikan even if they bicker at each others. His parents, Tojiro and Kikuko, are a very loving couple who rarely argue againts each others, but instead, do what they know best to make Tom\'s life and Mikan\'s life much better.There\'s also the cats themselves like Kurobochi, who portrays himself as a lady\'s man who always falls in love with a cat named ""Hana"", there\'s Botan, who is the fattest of the group who\'s always honest with Mikan\'s troubles and wants to stay away from his crazy stunts, there\'s Kelly, who would later become Mikan\'s love interest and more.Same thing with the human characters. There\'s Kyoko, who would serve as a love interest, Sera, who appears later on in the show and becomes friends with Tom when they start talking to each others and a few more.All of theses characters do serve a purpose to each episodes\' stories and do make the show more interesting and fun to watch.The animation looks nice to see as well. While the character designs aren\'t anything new here, it gets the job done. Since this is Nippon Animation we are talking about, they do a pretty good job with what they know best. Giving more life to the characters\' designs and animations and the backgrounds as well.The same thing can be said about the sound as well. The music is very well composed. You get some moments where the background musics can fit well into scenes that happen and the OP and EDs are very cute, fun and catchy to listen and sing to.And as far as the voice acting goes, the seiyuus do a great job at giving their all with their voices for the characters they voice in. Including Tarako (The second voice of Monokuma from Danganronpa series) as the voice of Mikan.So in conclusion, what do i have to say about Mikan Enikki? Well... It\'s yet another great hidden gem from Nippon Animation! NA does it yet again with this anime.The story is great, the art and animations are very cute, the characters are fun, the music is great, the voice acting is spectacular and of course i had a great time with this one! This is easily my favourite pet anime show ever.And the good news, people, is that the anime has been fansubbed by Ibuki Fukoi fansubs, So you can pretty much find this anime through torrents or pirated sites like gogoanime for example.But seriously though, if you\'re an animal lover and an anime fan, don\'t miss this show out. In fact, give it a watch if you can. It\'s a show that will definitely get you invested into it more and more as you watch the show. I know this because after i finished this show, i was satisfied with it. So i thank Nippon Animation once again for yet another masterpiece.I give Mikan Enikki an 9 out of 10. It definitely is a really great anime to watch cute cats doing cute things, even the more serious ones, too.Anyway, that\'s been my review of Mikan Enikki. This is José Diogo and i\'ll see you guys on the other side. since it lasted for 30 episodes with 2 specials created and sadly faded to obscurity.Now while i said that it was based off the manga, i said it very loosely because there are many occasions where the studio did made some changes and made some new stories and characters to differenciate from the manga.But is it any good?

This is easily my favourite pet anime show ever.And the good news, people, is that the anime has been fansubbed by Ibuki Fukoi fansubs, So you can pretty much find this anime through torrents or pirated sites like gogoanime for example.But seriously though, if you\'re an animal lover and an anime fan, don\'t miss this show out. In fact, give it a watch if you can. It\'s a show that will definitely get you invested into it more and more as you watch the show. I know this because after i finished this show, i was satisfied with it. So i thank Nippon Animation once again for yet another masterpiece.I give Mikan Enikki an 9 out of 10. It definitely is a really great anime to watch cute cats doing cute things, even the more serious ones, too.Anyway, that\'s been my review of Mikan Enikki. This is José Diogo and i\'ll see you guys on the other side.']"
Mirai Nikki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8460/Mirai_Nikki,"[""This OVA isn't as bad as people are making out to be. In fact this is less of an OVA and more of a trailer presenting some scenes from the first volume of the manga and showing what it would look like in anime form.After watching this I can say that it looks fantastic.From a story perspective this OVA was really confusing. A first timer may understand about the future diary and not a whole lot else. However this OVA were different scenes made to sorta tell a story, not really the whole thing. If an actual anime was made it would be...much more coherent. Speaking of which, the parts that were shown were faithful to the manga almost perfectly. Once you realize which scenes they are animating, they are all pretty much identical word for word.Art and coloring was very good as well. What I saw was animation that was on par with Highschool of the Dead and The World Only God Knows. Yuki looked fine and they did a good job with his facial expressions. Yuno did look a bit strange but we barely got to see her. People complain that her breasts are too small but if you compare the scenes from the anime to the manga she's about the same. The only real trouble spot was the CGI used for Deus. It's clear they didn't have the budget to do better but if this series got turned into a full project it would get a bigger budget and in the process look much better. In other words this can be fixed.Voices were alright. I personally have no problem with Yuno's voice. Honestly we saw too little of her to really tell but in the end if she really is that bad they can hire a different actor if they make it into a full series. Other voices were fine and most characters sounded how I expected them to.Overall the OVA gave me the feeling that Mirai Nikki should give. It was a little creepy with action and suspense.There is definite potential for an excellent anime here, no questions asked. All the flaws are easy to fix. Once they iron out the kinks this will be a masterpiece. Asread has made good anime before like Shuffle!, and Ga-Rei-Zero. Both series were good. Have some faith.

(My birthday – a coincidence? Hahah! …Not the year, of course.) It basically takes a bunch of random scenes from the first volume of the manga and shows how they would look in animation form. I was actually rather pleased with the scenes they depicted, since they were very accurate (almost word-for-word) with the manga.For those of you who don’t know what Mirai Nikki is, it means “Future Diary” in English. It’s about a boy, Amano Yukiteru, who isn’t very interested...in many things. The one thing he does like to do is record daily events in his diary in his cell phone – he calls himself an “observer”. He also has an imaginary friend, aptly named Deus Ex Machina. One day, Deus decides to make Yuki’s cell phone into a “Future Diary” (Mirai Nikki) which records his future for the next consecutive ninety days, as if Yuki had already made entries for them. At first, Yuki thinks he is the only one with this mysterious diary, until he has a near-freakish encounter with Gasai Yuno, the most popular girl in his school. Suddenly, Yukiteru is plunged into a dangerous survival game where having your cell phone broken or destroyed means that you yourself will die as well.Getting back to the OVA, it’s quite obviously aimed at people who actually read Mirai Nikki, which makes sense considering that it was bundled with volume eleven. As stated before, I was pleased with the OVA in general – the scenes were adapted accurately, the animation was pretty good, and the seiyuu were good as well. I’ve always imagined Yuno’s voice a little deeper for some reason, but it’s passable as well. The only thing I’ll nitpick at is that Deus’ CGI looked a bit weird, but that’s really all. All in all it is a good OVA for the manga, although I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who hasn’t actually read it before. In all honesty, it seems more like a long trailer than an actual anime episode (which is what it was probably meant to be, anyway). I really do hope that Mirai Nikki gets a chance to become a full-fledged anime series, since it has a lot of potential and, judging by the OVA, it’d look pretty good, too. And with the manga having just ended, I hope that an anime series is in order.(Coincidentally, as I post this review, the anime is nearing its end.) in many things.

This looked like an animation and concept test. Much like how marvel studios leaked a concept animation for Deadpool.So when I watched this particular OVA I was doing it to clean up loose ends with the series. (Like I do with all series).Watching it right off the back I could tell it was a trailer or a concept test footage.However if you are wanting to get into the series I would suggest watching this first, (there are spoilers, but they are very mediocre and don't really ruin anything).It was also a reminder about...how much I love Yuno Gasai as a character.I am giving it a lower score because of the fact that it is a concept trailer, and doesn't seem to flow correctly how much I love Yuno Gasai as a character.I am giving it a lower score because of the fact that it is a concept trailer, and doesn't seem to flow correctly"", ""So after having watched 12 episodes of Mirai Nikki (TV) and being thoroughly impressed by it, I decided it would be worth spending the 8 minutes it takes to watch the Mirai Nikki OVA.In my honest opinion this is more of a preview or a commercial than anything else. Scenes switch so fast without any explanation that it is next to impossible to tell what is happening unless you have watched the show like I have. In fact, it appears they squeezed the first 2 episodes into this 8 minute long ova. So if you think about it this is just pretty much an 8...minute long trailer.So overall I rate this trailer a 3, simply because I feel this wasn't meant to be watched as anything other than a preview; if it was the actual anime adaptation I would have given it a 1. It does serve its purpose as a preview though and I'm sure if you were a Mirai Nikki fan before October 9, 2011 this might have been cool to see, but today it serves no real purpose. minute long trailer.So overall I rate this trailer a 3, simply because I feel this wasn't meant to be watched as anything other than a preview; if it was the actual anime adaptation I would have given it a 1.

Even though there wasn't much music I already can say its well orchestrated. They, even had a ending song and its very excellent! they should use the song for ED If Mirai Nikki gets turned into an Anime. The characters are what I expected to act like Yuki always acts nervous and intimidated and for Yuno we haven't get to see her yandere side of the trailer. All we could really see is that she loves him but I still realizes its her. And like the two people below me say, Deus looks like crap I mean I can tell its him but the CG is pretty bad, a little to much CG is perhaps correct. If the studio had the budget and time I bet they could make Zeus look good but as for now, no. The voices suit all the characters just fine except for Yuki's while it is acceptable I just can't help but think his voice sounds to young I kinda expected him to have a much  more deeper voice but, meh. But overall I really liked the OVA to all the Mirai Nikki fans out there I know you crave more of the series and this OVA may not satisfy all of you but has sure has for me. Its so powerful that it just draws you even more of the series to be turned into a official Anime. I have been a Mirai nikki fan for sometime now.

After reading the manga I was really looking forward to this. I was a bit disappointed though for a few reasons. This was more of a trailer. It started by speeding through the intro to the manga not even giving a chance to anyone who hasn't seen the manga to understand the plot. Then, all of a sudden it jumps to what happens a few chapters later giving no context.It feels really rushed. Almost no time is given to get to know the characters, (that goes double for Yuno who I was looking foward to seeing). All of a sudden things are happening and...anyone who hasn't read the manga (which is awesome!) is left in the dust.If they intended to make an anime out of this I hope the pace is slowed down a lot. In my opinion this story should be told in about 50-80 episodes. anyone who hasn't read the manga (which is awesome!) is left in the dust.If they intended to make an anime out of this I hope the pace is slowed down a lot.

In short it was suppose to serve as the introduction to one of the best series of last year.I say suppose to as it did not do a good job.What it managed to do in eight minutes was introduce the protagonist Amano Yukiteru, the basis of the story and give us a peek of what was to come.Normally that would be fine but it lacked what made Mirai Nikki such a big hit. Killing, blood, mystery and the Queen of Yanderes, Yuno.Yes, as intricate...and interesting as the story goes it is incomplete without Yuno. With little about her in this OVA, viewers are either misled, unconvinced or oblivious to Yuno\'s murderous and insane antics.It\'s just not right to start the series believing Yuno as ""normal"".Now the OVA did show off the stellar animation and the perfect backdrop of music but being as condensed as it is, it\'s hard to follow and even confusing.If you really want a taste of Mirai Nikki just watch the first episode of the series.

Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51458/Lv1_Maou_to_One_Room_Yuusha,"['I went into this one expecting mediocrity, especially given its mundane premise, blobby visuals, and initially-sub-7 rating, but it proved to be much, much more than that. There are nuanced character motivations, layered political schemes, and a surprising amount of humanization/justification for behavior that normally gets reduced to just ""bad"" in simpler shows. While no conflicts or plots are taken too seriously, each one gets multiple takes from different perspectives. The two main characters also have great chemistry with each other.I am recommending this show because it goes well beyond what I had initially expected and far beneath its seemingly surface-level tropes. It reminds me...of the first season of Hataraku Maou-sama (2013), Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou desu (2021), and even Porco Rosso (1992) with its themes of redefining yourself and failing to fit in.

While the ""raunchy comedy"" part of that description is certainly fair (*cough* Zenia\'s ass *cough*), the rest isn\'t, and discarding the series on those grounds would be missing the forest for the trees.The main thing that sets Level 1 Demon Lord apart from the typical example of its genre...is how much informed effort went into writing its characters into the setting. The author takes the popular fantasy premise of a group of heroes vanquishing the demon lord and deconstructs the aftermath of such a group having to live with the consequences in the new world they\'ve helped create. They had trained and honed their skill to fight the demonic threat, but nothing prepared them for what was to come.This is an inherently interesting subject to explore. It\'s easy to delude oneself into thinking that if somebody becomes renowned for their superior skill or efforts in doing something particular, they should be expected to perform just as well in other aspects of life. But the bar on that burden of expectations becomes unreasonable even when you\'re doing something much less heroic than literally saving the world. Especially so when any single one of your actions is scrutinized, and at the same time all sorts of unsavory people are trying to take advantage of you and your fame. Previous season\'s Oshi no Ko dedicates a lot of attention to this theme.Unsurprisingly, our hero Max has failed to live up to that and become a valued member of the new society that owes its livelihood to his heroic deeds. Taking a number of bad hits to his reputation right from the start, he chose to keep a low profile to protect himself and his friends from scorn and abuse, knowing that he shouldn\'t be caught involved in something that would be spun as unbecoming of a hero. But by his mere existence, Max attracts bad encounters. This lifestyle turned him into an impoverished alcoholic deadbeat, and the show doesn\'t attempt to sugarcoat that. A horrible, crushing situation to find oneself in—not just for himself but also for his friends and admirers. But as disillusioned and bitter as it gets, but, even at his lowest point, he still upholds his humanity and the virtuous principles that made him a hero—because that\'s who he is.And this is where the (adorable) Demon Lord steps in. Having resurrected after ten years... prematurely, in an androgynous childlike body, but still full of admiration for his fated rival, the Lord immediately goes to check out how Max has fares after their epic showdown. And seeing his sorry state, doesn\'t become the selfish deadweight as would be expected of a typical shitgremlin character, but rather takes Max\'s side and actively helps get his life back on track to be worthy of the person he was at their first encounter. It\'s a heartfelt relationship based on sincerity and respect, which makes their onscreen dynamic a joy to behold.There\'s a depth and charm to these characters that you can\'t help but notice already by the end of episode 2. At that point you already know you want them to succeed. And the best part is that the series isn\'t even a slice-of-life account of Max\'s rehab: it has an actual plot that involves the rest of the hero crew who adapted to the new reality in their own separate ways. Every episode brings forth some new development; other characters have agency, various events are happening, and things are moving forward. There is very good music (some heavy metal for once!) and voice acting to complement the plot and characters, too, and surprisingly expressive animation to top it off.Now, to address the elephant in the room, which is Zenia—the Demon Lord\'s trusted secretary—and her monumental body features. She\'s pretty much the fan service character (it\'s even more egregious in the manga, having one of the scenes literally subtitled as the ""obligatory money shot""), and the camera never fails to show off her curvy assets in the most distractingly blatant ways possible. Personally, I feel right now it detracts from the show more so than it adds, but maybe they\'re going somewhere else with it. In any case, this is mostly limited to her character and doesn\'t really occupy a lot of screen time as the show goes on.To sum it up, if you want a genuinely sweet and interesting buddy comedy that deals with some very heavy themes but still has more than enough levity to avoid becoming Welcome to the NHK, do yourself a favor and give Level 1 Demon Lord a chance. is how much informed effort went into writing its characters into the setting.

Taking a number of bad hits to his reputation right from the start, he chose to keep a low profile to protect himself and his friends from scorn and abuse, knowing that he shouldn\'t be caught involved in something that would be spun as unbecoming of a hero. But by his mere existence, Max attracts bad encounters. This lifestyle turned him into an impoverished alcoholic deadbeat, and the show doesn\'t attempt to sugarcoat that. A horrible, crushing situation to find oneself in—not just for himself but also for his friends and admirers. But as disillusioned and bitter as it gets, but, even at his lowest point, he still upholds his humanity and the virtuous principles that made him a hero—because that\'s who he is.And this is where the (adorable) Demon Lord steps in. Having resurrected after ten years... prematurely, in an androgynous childlike body, but still full of admiration for his fated rival, the Lord immediately goes to check out how Max has fares after their epic showdown. And seeing his sorry state, doesn\'t become the selfish deadweight as would be expected of a typical shitgremlin character, but rather takes Max\'s side and actively helps get his life back on track to be worthy of the person he was at their first encounter. It\'s a heartfelt relationship based on sincerity and respect, which makes their onscreen dynamic a joy to behold.There\'s a depth and charm to these characters that you can\'t help but notice already by the end of episode 2. At that point you already know you want them to succeed. And the best part is that the series isn\'t even a slice-of-life account of Max\'s rehab: it has an actual plot that involves the rest of the hero crew who adapted to the new reality in their own separate ways. Every episode brings forth some new development; other characters have agency, various events are happening, and things are moving forward. There is very good music (some heavy metal for once!) and voice acting to complement the plot and characters, too, and surprisingly expressive animation to top it off.Now, to address the elephant in the room, which is Zenia—the Demon Lord\'s trusted secretary—and her monumental body features. She\'s pretty much the fan service character (it\'s even more egregious in the manga, having one of the scenes literally subtitled as the ""obligatory money shot""), and the camera never fails to show off her curvy assets in the most distractingly blatant ways possible. Personally, I feel right now it detracts from the show more so than it adds, but maybe they\'re going somewhere else with it. In any case, this is mostly limited to her character and doesn\'t really occupy a lot of screen time as the show goes on.To sum it up, if you want a genuinely sweet and interesting buddy comedy that deals with some very heavy themes but still has more than enough levity to avoid becoming Welcome to the NHK, do yourself a favor and give Level 1 Demon Lord a chance.', 'One room hero is one of my unexpected hits of the season. It’s a rare example of a post-fantasy modern society and follows a former hero on his path to find purpose again. A fresh premise combined with great comedy, insane but loveable characters and some political drama make this a very entertaining watch.When it comes to fantasy shows, we’ve seen plenty of hero goes on a quest to defeat the demon lord style shows in recent years. We rarely get to see what that world looks like in the future and what happens to our heroes. If it’s one thing history has taught us,...it’s that people have incredibly short memories and will quickly forget all you’ve done for them.What I like about One Room Hero is that it covers that unfortunate reality. Max goes from hero to zero quite literally. He has lost all motivation and purpose in life and things look bleak. That is, until he meets his former adversary, the demon lord. He and the demon lord form an unlikely but genuinely beautiful and organic friendship. I really enjoyed seeing their chemistry and how silly every moment they had on screen was. Seeing both of them try to live in a world that quite frankly no longer needs heroes or big villains was incredibly interesting.While there’s no real consistent overarching story, at least not until the final third or so of the show, it manages to remain engaging through the introduction of dynamic and hilarious side characters who bring their own quirks to the story, comedic situations and heartwarming emotional and personal growth moments for Max. It starts off very slice of life focused before branching into a more serious direction later on, but those slice of life moments had a degree of gravity to everything that’s to come later.Visually, the show is very pleasing to look at. It features a bright colour palette and some solid character designs. I haven’t read the manga yet, but I’ve heard some fans complain about how a few characters were “nerfed” if you get my drift, but as an anime only everything was fine for me. The animation is ok to decent up until episode 11 where the studio seemingly unlocked their full potential and went crazy with the action.In closing, one room yuusha is definitely worth checking out. It’s a shame that it aired in such a stacked season where it flew under the radar, but if you’ve been looking for a funny anime to watch or something new, this is a great candidate. Fresh story, well written characters and a fun ride.One room yuusha gets 8, out of 10. it’s that people have incredibly short memories and will quickly forget all you’ve done for them.What I like about One Room Hero is that it covers that unfortunate reality.

But also in context of strong characters having natural chemistry together. Having strong out going personality characters can really push an anime far.

Unfortunately, in times of peace and a rapidly evolving society -which goes from a generic medieval fantasy world to modern-day capitalist Japan in ten years- there is no need for a Dragon Quest-esque hero. After the ancient Demon Lord resurrects in the body of a gremlin...so it can enact revenge upon its greatest enemy, he’s disappointed to find Max hungover and lying in his own filth.

We're sometimes bestowed with a unicorn in anime comedy: a show that doesn't critically rely on big breast physics or sexual harassment to deliver its jokes. And this summer, unfortunately, we are again deprived of such unicorn. But we do get the next best thing, the anime equivalent of a narwhal: a well-executed comedy that has lovable side characters and flawed yet charming protagonists. Yes, we're talking about Lv1 Maou and 1 Room Yuusha, the anime about...a gremlin sidekick paired with a perverted yet overpowered protagonist who has crippling porn addiction and severe lack of motivation.A lot of things can go wrong when you're writing a story where the demon lord is trying to learn about the human world. You can mess up badly and write a harem story about your Demon Lord working in WcDonalds while amassing a cast of most deplorable characters in existence. What salvages Lv1 Maou & 1 Room Yuusha is its setting and lovable characters. We're gifted with a humble and polite Demon Lord (Maou) who, while committed to being evil, try to help the hero regain his lost glory. Maou serves as the voice of reason yet is also innocent of many flaws that Max has. Max, despite being the hero, lacks any heroic characteristics. He's a cancelled hero in his post-glory era due to womanizing. He's a bum who spends time loafing around and watching pornography. And the story is structured around the comedic events that occurs as Maou try to straighten up Max's behavior.It's refreshing to see Maou work diligently to get Max back to his former glory. The show doesn't take itself too seriously. There are still residual cringe humor and fan-service shots that is usually delivered through Maou's magic-lacking secretary:Zenia. But when compared to many other series, this shows does a well job of avoiding blatant ecchi and also avoids creating a harem. Zenia is still a likable character who is committed to helping Maou gather intel despite her lack of magic. We're also introduced to Max's former friends: Fred and Leo. While they seem like antagonists at first, they are still allies of their old friend Max.The art isn't anything special. It's simple but it fits well with the story. Maou is drawn like chibi character with 3 eyes, which allows him to amplify both comedic and emotional scenes. Max is drawn like a deadbeat adult-manga protagonist and it allows a lot of anti-climatic scenes. Zenia is drawn for fan-service. The animation is also good and always nails the comedic timing.One of the most surprising element of this anime is voice acting. Naomi Oozora has done voice acting for many gremlins but she does an excellent job of portraying Maou in both his chibi form and in the adult bishoujo form. It's a demanding role since Maou is a child but acts like an adult, a nagging housekeeper, and also a blushing heroine. The voice acting across the board is good, but Naomi Oozora stands out by perfectly portraying Maou.The Opening and Ending themes are good, but for some reason, the OST feels like someone took the DVD from Bleach:Sennen Kessen-hen and made a Soundcloud version of it. It's still good but the similarity between some of these tracks is comical.Overall, I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for a comedy anime. It's feels like a modern-day version of Tentai Senshi Sun Red or an actual funnier version of Hataraku Maou-sama. At times, it also resembles OnePunch man with Max resembling Saitama a lot. It's not a masterpiece or an era defining anime by any means but it is definitely a lighthearted comedy that will probably bring you a laugh or two. a gremlin sidekick paired with a perverted yet overpowered protagonist who has crippling porn addiction and severe lack of motivation.A lot of things can go wrong when you're writing a story where the demon lord is trying to learn about the human world.

Ten years later the fiend reawakens. In the body of a small androgynous child. Eager to fight his adversary again he quickly tracks down Max. Unfortunately the last decade wasn’t kind to the former hero. He became a lazy slacker neet. After the initial shock the Demon Lord decides to move in with Max and get him in shape both physically and mentally so they can have their rematch.Not gonna lie, the premise...is the reason why I watched this. It sounded awesome. The reality… isn’t as interesting.For starters let’s have a look at the characters that matter for the plot:Max - The Hero who led the team, then defeated the Demon Lord a decade prior. Today he’s washed-up, lives in a small one room apartment, and has plenty of scandals under his belt. He acts like he doesn’t really care but he still holds on to his old, holy sword and even talks to kids about his adventures proving he is, at least to some degree living in the past. He tries to avoid trouble but he gets dragged in anyway.Maou - The reborn Demon Lord. Despite being quite masculine in his previous incarnation he now has a body of an androgynous but still rather feminine child. He has the ability to transform into a young woman and doesn’t seem to want or can change into other human forms. He has an unhealthy obsession with Max. Like really unhealthy. Instead of taking care of his domain, maybe preparing for the reawakening of the demon king, he decides to take care of Max. Not in a Hitman: Code 47 kind of way but more like a mother or wife way. He cooks, cleans and tries to get the former hero on his feet. He even gets flustered when Max says something nice about his cooking or is looking at his adult female form stunned.Zenia - officially a secretary of the Demon Lord. She’s the reason why he’s wearing a sailor’s uniform with a skirt. Unofficially practically everything that the demon lord needs. She’s proficient at gathering information doing that for the last ten years so that the Demon Lord would be up to date. She can’t really hold her liquor. She got drunk and caused a commotion and trouble for Max after just one beer. Let’s be honest, she’s in the show as eye candy and little more. Despite that I think she’s the most underutilised character in the show.Fred - no, not the barber Fred from “Courage the Cowardly Dog”, this time we have a cleric Fred. He’s one of the members of the Hero team that kicked the Demon’s Lord ass. Friend to Maou and Leo even though he has a strange way of showing it at times. He serves as Chief Secretary at the Royal Bureau of Magic aka a government slave. He’s competent, skilled, confident and likes to have an upper hand when “negotiating”. He cares for his friends but shows it in a very tsundere way.Leo - Another member of the heroes party. Leo was the tank of the team. Strong, loyal and always having a positive attitude with sometimes infuriated Fred. After the Kingdom tried to swindle his people out of  natural resources on their land he was forced to declare independence and with that started a civil war. He did that but made sure to not kill any soldier on the opposite side. He’s strong, like to fight and is loyal to his friends. Of course that doesn’t mean he’s not more than willing to get into a fight with them.The cast is pretty strong with most characters having some pretty good motivation to their actions. If I have to be honest, the worst one is Max. He’s the only one without any true motivation or goal. It seems like everyone is doing something except the hero. Well… that’s not entirely true. He does reject both his friends when they try to involve him in their conflict. He’s as passive as passive can be. A reborn Demon Lord moves in with him? Cool. He’s practically kidnaped and forced into a “field trip” to another nation? No problem. I get he’s supposed to be a washed-up loser but come on. That’s overkill. He does bare minimum, just to keep himself alive. It takes a war for him to stop being pathetic and even then it’s pretty much a stretch to call him a hero again.When it comes to the plot itself it’s a weird mix. The show starts off as a comedy but as the show progresses it begins to show a bit of political thriller and at the end it’s almost a full on political action thriller. I don’t really mind that. I have a soft spot for well written political thrillers. This one.. Is not it. The problem is mixing comedy and politics. The comedy doesn’t really hit with all the conniving and manipulations and the politics isn’t a good match for the type of characters Max and Maou are. Despite Maou sometimes acting like a proper demon lord and trying to recruit the hero and other characters to his side, he mostly acts like a wife or girlfriend. It kills the drama for me. Especially that some of those moments are played completely straight.World building has some problems as well. The part that I truly don’t get is why the war with the demons even happens. There is a point when we see the Demon Lord instruct his minions to not kill humans mindlessly as they do not reincarnate. That shows that Maou cherishes life. So why the war? Why would someone who doesn’t want to kill humans go to war with them? The only reason I could think of is that it’s the result of humans benign humans and feeding people some bullshit to get the riled up and forcing demons to defend themselves. It’s a huge hole in both world and character building.Apart from that the writing isn’t anything special. It’s just a middle of the road comedy that plays with some romcom tropes. To be honest it did get me to chuckle now and then and the relationship between Max and Maou is a pretty interesting one. Threading the line between a bromance and a full on romance at times. I liked it. It took cliche tropes that got old a decade or two ago and put a nice twist on them.All in all it’s not a bad show but it’s not great either. The potential is there and the show ends in a way that promises more things to come and those things could be more political in nature. I wouldn't mind that to be honest. If the writers would do a better job at balancing the politics and type of comedy this could be a really solid show. is the reason why I watched this. It sounded awesome. The reality… isn’t as interesting.For starters let’s have a look at the characters that matter for the plot:Max - The Hero who led the team, then defeated the Demon Lord a decade prior. Today he’s washed-up, lives in a small one room apartment, and has plenty of scandals under his belt. He acts like he doesn’t really care but he still holds on to his old, holy sword and even talks to kids about his adventures proving he is, at least to some degree living in the past. He tries to avoid trouble but he gets dragged in anyway.Maou - The reborn Demon Lord. Despite being quite masculine in his previous incarnation he now has a body of an androgynous but still rather feminine child. He has the ability to transform into a young woman and doesn’t seem to want or can change into other human forms. He has an unhealthy obsession with Max. Like really unhealthy.

This Anime certainly has a similar vibe with Devil is a Part-timer and I'm Quitting Heroing, but it is also a distinct entity by...itself. The comedy is on point, at times when the plot turns a little heavy it hits well, and the light hearted moments are done well too. The dialogue seems decent, and the flow of the story is sustained.Characters: Most of the characters feel and behave like actual characters rather than types, which is a rather pleasing sight in an Anime of this kind. Their individual character traits distinguish them from others, and the chemistry between them is used extremely well to move the plot along. Quite impressed so far.Animation: This is one of the better animated shows of the season. The scenes flow from one to the other fluidly, the general outlines are sharp and appealing, and the sequences have a neat colour to it. Also, the opening animation was certainly worth a mention from a character centric standpoint, though the still frame count kind of sticks out like a sore thumb.Music: The music for the most part is decent and well integrated, it compliments well what is shown in the screen. Also a special mention to the Opening theme, one of the best of this season so far as far as music is concerned.Voice acting: Given the absolutely stacked line up of Seiyuus, this deserves a special mention in that department. All the more reason to look forward to it.Enjoyment: Personally I've enjoyed this very much. A tinge of light hearted humour, a touch of heaviness, a peal of merriment and a awful lot of good sustained plot, a good recipe for enjoyment.

The Demon Lord is resurrected. While 10 years was not enough time to restore himself to his previous power level, the Demon Lord rushed his own resurrection because he was anxious for a rematch with his nemesis, Max, before the human’s death. As such, the prematurely resurrected Demon Lord, who looks like a thick loli now for whatever reason, goes to the Human Realm to face his opponent in glorious combat once more. What he finds, however, is far from the stuff of legend. Fame went to...his head, and after numerous scandals, his degenerate behavior caused Max to be shunned from society. He has let himself go and now lives as a complete NEET.In essence, it’s an idea that has been done to death in comedy – previously revered and legendary character has now fallen off and is the butt of every joke. I find this premise fairly ridiculous, and I’ll reiterate what I said about Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. A dude who has literally saved the entire world would earn carte blanche to do literally whatever he wants forever, but that’s neither here, nor there, so I digress.Given this sad state of affairs, through some kind of pretzel logic, in order to revitalize his rival and bring him back to his former glory, the resurrected Demon Lord essentially decides to become Max’s live-in maid. Hilarity ensues.While a lot of humor is derived from it, the narrative logic is thin, much like in The Devil is a Part-Timer!, so don’t try and think too much about it, but unlike the aforementioned show, which I did not enjoy, this is not massively popular, so I did not go into it expecting anything impressive, and as such, felt adequately entertained! It was still weird, though. Let us forget about them being mortal enemies for a moment. The Demon Lord is a dude, but comes back as a loli (not a shota), and whenever he walks around town with Max, he transforms into a presumably barely legal bombshell chick. Why am I telling you all of this? Because I got the distinct impression that the show is trying to softly ship them, which was just bizarre. No actual romance happens, to be sure, but the finale was pretty sus.On an unrelated note, I’d like to note that though the show explicitly states that Max has ‘let himself go’, the dude is still crazy strong and in shape, it’s just that there’s stubble on his chin now and his eyes have lost the sparkle of youth. What I specifically want to point out here is that I find Max to have the ideal male anime action hero physique, much like Zoro from One Piece and Laxus from Fairy Tail, though those 2 have their over-the-top shots. Max is muscular, unlike some scrawny git like Naruto or Ichigo, but also not cartoonishly big like Escanor from T7DS or some Baki character. The show also doesn’t feel the need to constantly explicitly point out to the audience the fact that he is in fact muscular, like Amazon’s Reacher. You don’t even really see him without a shirt. You can simply tell that the dude has a perfectly built and proportioned strong physique that’s hiding in plain sight. Show, don’t tell.As for fanservice, yeah, there’s some, but nothing too outrageous, so if you’re thinking about watching this show for a quick tug, don’t.I will say, though, that while there is no action to speak of throughout the series, the finale features a protracted three-way battle that put on a pretty impressive spectacle. Not only was it a pretty light show, but this random gag show made me actually invest in the mechanics of the fight and the abilities of these dudes that weren’t foreshadowed or explained before in any way whatsoever. There’s even one particular scene where this massive rock gets shattered, and there’s an incredible number of particles flying around on screen, and 2 characters are jumping from flying rock shard to flying rock shard, chasing and hitting each other, and the 3D camera movements tracking them were legitimately amazing. If you’ve seen One Piece Film: Z, and you remember the fight between Sanji and Bins, the Mosa Mosa guy, then you know exactly what I’m talking about.In the final analysis, if you find this kind of parody humor to your liking, give it a go, but it’s not overly deep or brilliant, so I’d posit that there are lots of other shows that would better occupy your time. Like I mentioned earlier, The Devil is a Part-Timer! feels very similar and is massively popular, so setting my personal dislike aside, there’s a good to fair chance you’ll enjoy it. A much better recommendation, though, would be YuuShibu (#83), which, apart from sharing an almost identical premise and being a whole lot funnier, is also just downright softcore porn.

Especially when it comes to the Demon King, if you know what I mean. The review can wait. Would you do him? Him? Her? A homie who looks like a child most of the time but can also look like a hot girl and also cooks like a pro chef? It might just be the way... Oh and I'm signing the contract. Sorry, not sorry.Ehem, anyway, I expceted something like Jahy, Jashin or Demon Girl Next Door but it doesn't quite work as well overall. The...action parts are better than expected and the occasional fanservice was fairly nice while not detracting too much from what was happening. The characters are quite specific and might not be to everyone's taste though. The hero is an asshole with a heart of gold but the asshole part is not downplayed. If you'd like to see a washed up hero who rarely gives a damn and goes to adult cinemas to rub one out then you would enjoy him. There is also (one) room to grow which might bethe ned game of his character. The Demon King is confusing in so many ways though... As a character they work but... It's technically a dude but most of the time they look like a child... Gremlin... Kinda... Thing... And sometimes they look like a hot girl... They certainly behave in a feminine way and most likely have a crush on the hero and would probably not mind getting it on as a female... You see what I mean? It is a good way to explain why the hero doesn't want to stick it in the Demon King though. And I guess if you are an immortal being who can change appearances then you would play both teams anyway.The supporting cast is nice but desperately needs more screen time. Fred's entourage can be fairly fun and they would probably shine with more development, Zenia is hot and endearing and the hero party can also be quite entertaining and charming if given enough time.Overall it's definitely not bad and can get better with more episodes.Oh and both the music and action can be pleasantly surprising.

Who in the hell does someone take this story and fills it with joy so fresh, it keeps with you for life?Fantasy can come in a lot of ways, but the inherent way that\'s overused, is by people being put into that situation and living out their days as such. Not in mangaka toufu\'s Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha a.k.a Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero, where the situation is reversed, and in the cusp of what I like to dub this season as ""(studio) Silver Link Mondays"", this show really has taken...a full swing and bat to its premise, showing a vastly different side of the story that while not new, has heart written all over it.The story goes of the typical ""human defeats the Demon Lord/King"" premise, where the aforementioned Hero and his companions defeat said Demon King, to which the latter vowed to have a fair fight as revenge in time to come. And within that time, the Demon Lord has resurrected 10 years later with her fanservice-y cliche secretary receiving her arrival to face off with the Hero, and she\'s hoping for a rematch against him. Sadly, that brave young hero 10 years later, is a recluse of a NEET, an unemployed, non-functioning member of society that loves to just be himself in his apartment, spending his life in the destined one room that\'ll see his retirement through from life to death. And the Demon Lord is unhappy that the hero has turned out like this and determines to shape him up for the rematch of the modern day.If you\'re thinking that you\'ve seen something like this before, yes, it\'s inspired by mangaka Wakame Konbu\'s Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! a.k.a The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!, based on the exact premise that both the demon lord and the hero have descended onto Earth to continue their fight amidst the daily driven life of the average layman. And while the hero Max is basically just Kazuma but older, and seeing the Demon Lord Maou, which she is shrunk down to the size of an elementary kid, together with her kinda-pervertic secretary Zenia, that one room apartment of Max\'s is where all of the hijinks of adventures start, from the rematch to meeting his party members again, though working in ways that they\'ve changed from how they\'re like 10 years ago.Starting off with Max, the typical young hero who\'s full of life, now becomes like a senile middle-aged man who wants nothing to do with the hero life. Heck, his Excalibur sword is even thrown at one side and left to rot as it is, for someone who just wants to eat, sleep, and do whatever he wants to do. This infuriates Maou, whom by the dastardly approach of hers to force Max to do her bidding, literally thinking of any and every solution just to get Max off of his couch and working again, from exercises to even being a YouTuber, and it\'s hilarious as heck, other than the fact that there\'s a spirit lingering in the cupboard for gags. But bring him out of his apartment, and there lies the rest of his party: the cleric Fred, the warrior Leo, and the mage Yuria. Apparently, the business between Fred\'s kingdom and Leo\'s own established Gamma Republic creates civil unrest between both sides, and mini wars ensue control of the realm, though clearly, Max does not want any of the trouble coming to him, as much as Maou perseveres to whip him into shape. But as time progresses, Max is forced to choose a side, and against the people that he worked with in the past, he has to make a decision to come back into heroism or stay stagnated forever. It\'s quite the comeback story for a NEET who\'s so done with life, but not so when pushed to the limit.I\'ve been noticing recently of studio Silver Link\'s collaboration with the smaller studio of Blade, and it has basically been this way ever since Spring 2022\'s Shijou Saikyou no Daimaou, Murabito A ni Tensei suru a.k.a The Greatest Demon Lord Is Reborn as a Typical Nobody, as means to split the workload between both major and minor studios. And so far, it seems to be working with delivering just the bare minimum in production values, though really, it\'s nothing to scoff at. It just is servicable at best. That said, MADKID\'s OP song for this show is definitely outside of the Shield Hero realm of banger songs, and like Nenne\'s ED, are just as equally decent at the very least.Stories like Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha can be fairly easy to come by if you look hard enough, though it\'s at the expense of the comedy gags that\'ll keep you busy with what the original source material has going for it. And while this is not one of my low-key favourite shows of the season, I feel that it\'s fairly underappreciated for a story so typical that the characters essentially make up for the lack of enthusiasm.It\'s works like these that has an objective to stand out, and for better or for worse, mangaka toufu has done it here to get some enjoyment. It\'s a decent show, and really, it\'s the ""hook, line, and sinker"" adage that\'ll get you if you give this show the chance that it deserves. a full swing and bat to its premise, showing a vastly different side of the story that while not new, has heart written all over it.The story goes of the typical ""human defeats the Demon Lord/King"" premise, where the aforementioned Hero and his companions defeat said Demon King, to which the latter vowed to have a fair fight as revenge in time to come.

Apparently, the business between Fred\'s kingdom and Leo\'s own established Gamma Republic creates civil unrest between both sides, and mini wars ensue control of the realm, though clearly, Max does not want any of the trouble coming to him, as much as Maou perseveres to whip him into shape. But as time progresses, Max is forced to choose a side, and against the people that he worked with in the past, he has to make a decision to come back into heroism or stay stagnated forever. It\'s quite the comeback story for a NEET who\'s so done with life, but not so when pushed to the limit.I\'ve been noticing recently of studio Silver Link\'s collaboration with the smaller studio of Blade, and it has basically been this way ever since Spring 2022\'s Shijou Saikyou no Daimaou, Murabito A ni Tensei suru a.k.a The Greatest Demon Lord Is Reborn as a Typical Nobody, as means to split the workload between both major and minor studios. And so far, it seems to be working with delivering just the bare minimum in production values, though really, it\'s nothing to scoff at. It just is servicable at best. That said, MADKID\'s OP song for this show is definitely outside of the Shield Hero realm of banger songs, and like Nenne\'s ED, are just as equally decent at the very least.Stories like Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha can be fairly easy to come by if you look hard enough, though it\'s at the expense of the comedy gags that\'ll keep you busy with what the original source material has going for it. And while this is not one of my low-key favourite shows of the season, I feel that it\'s fairly underappreciated for a story so typical that the characters essentially make up for the lack of enthusiasm.It\'s works like these that has an objective to stand out, and for better or for worse, mangaka toufu has done it here to get some enjoyment. It\'s a decent show, and really, it\'s the ""hook, line, and sinker"" adage that\'ll get you if you give this show the chance that it deserves.', ""One of the better releases this season which people put down.I liked One room hero mainly for how good its comedy was and the chemistry between Max and the demonlord who reincarnates to find the hero being a miserable but funny mess and the potential for comedy was utilised decently between them and the other side characters.The setting of the world was good although going from old europe to modern japan was a bit off but funny since they used the modern day to make more gags and not just slice of life stuff.the characters are what you'd expect from a comedy so not too...much detail is needed as the primary focus was the comedy and then story which picks up in the second half of the anime.The story also wraps up so the creators aren't trying to scum a season 2 with some kind of cliffhanger at the end, although it's not a big fullfilling conclusion and is more of one fitting of a comedy.With all that in mind I'd say it's definitely an anime which will make you laugh just from how much Max is put through because of a demon that looks either like a child or an insta thott. much detail is needed as the primary focus was the comedy and then story which picks up in the second half of the anime.The story also wraps up so the creators aren't trying to scum a season 2 with some kind of cliffhanger at the end, although it's not a big fullfilling conclusion and is more of one fitting of a comedy.With all that in mind I'd say it's definitely an anime which will make you laugh just from how much Max is put through because of a demon that looks either like a child or an insta thott."", 'In a sea of isekai and ""ordinary Japanese schoolboy"" anime, this series stands out as a breath of fresh air. Its story is not just unique but captivating, with characters that are both well-written and original, setting a standard for character development in the genre. The lore and storytelling mode draw a delightful parallel to ""Isekai Ojisan,"" yet manages to surpass it with its depth and engagement. Visually, it shares a similar art design with ""Meikyuu Black Company"" and ""Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!"" which adds to its charm.

With a title like that one would think this to be an anime adaptation for some narou isekai. Combine it with an art style straight of 1990s and you will get a recipe of the most overlooked anime of this season. In actuality this anime is probably among the best anime of this season, here is why.StoryThe main plot of this anime is pretty simple. Ten years after getting defeated be the hero party, the demon lord resurrected and then live together with the washed up hero to make him great again. It\'s a great vehicle...for them to explore the secondary plot, the political conflict between two nation and two ex hero companion. Now I did said ""political"" but it is far from complex, the way they presented it is actually really simple but nuanced.

All characters in this anime are likeable especially our two main characters. Max is our main protagonist, he is your typical tsundere cynical main character that hate the world but not really. What make him great character is the fact you can see all his good (and bad) traits from his action and along the story you start to actually understand why Maou really like him. Next is Maou themself, they are a demon lord (hence why we call them maou) that get reincarnated into a cute sized moth demon. From their design you would think they will have a bratty personality. While they do have some moment of flair, their personality can be described as a really supportive but strong minded wife. They will be there for Max but they will not afraid to speak or act up when they are not agree with Max. Overall they are a really lovable and pleasant person. Oh and there are hints of romance between Max and Maou, which is really cute.Art/SoundThis anime is not among the most highest budget production of this season for sure.

', 'I think it was fine and could recommend the first 8 episodes, but the remaining 4 ruined my experience, personally; it felt like there was a major tonal shift from slice-of-life and comedy to action and ""friendship"" (and a bit of intrigue), which simply made the last episodes not enjoyable/funny to me.  The way that the territorial/friendship conflict was handled towards the end made it difficult for me to laugh at the small attempts at slapstick; the contrast in vibes was simply too jarring.

Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/521/Mermaid_Melody_Pichi_Pichi_Pitch,"[""Oh boy, where to begin on this review...Story: Basically it's another &quot;Magical Girl&quot; anime plot, a girl who has the ability to transform must fight this evil group of villains with her friends/comrades as a Super Sentai team. The unique part of this anime is that the Mermaids don't attack, they SING, and their songs are painful to the villains' ears. Other than that, it's all cheesy.Art: This depends on how you look at it. To me, the dresses for Lucia, Hanon, and Rina are full of many colors! (Practically every shade of pink, aqua, and green respectively.) On the other hand, the characters' appearances...are okay, except it's too overdone. (I.e. Doumoto Kaito with the most repetitive hairstyle of any Bishounen.)Sound: What I found unusual was that Lucia's voice is different compared to other Magical Girl heroines. While their voices are high-pitched, Lucia's is lower, unless you count her screaming. Hanon and Rina sound okay. The MMPPP songs can really get to you, even though they're all about love.Character: This is what bugs me. Basically, the Mermaids' objective is to unite the Seven Mermaid Princesses in order to defeat the enemy. The problem is, for 52 episodes straight, ONLY LUCIA, HANON, AND RINA APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SEASON!! What about the other four? Well, Caren appears halfway through the season, but she distances herself from them. Noel and Coco were captured so they're stuck with the enemy until the finale. And Sara is a good guy turned bad. Wow. (Did they expect girls to love the main trio more than the four Mermaids in the back?)Enjoyment: IT WILL GET ANNOYING. At some point, you'll realize that there's too many fillers. Luckily, Wikipedia has already identified the episodes important to the storyline so you can figure it out from there.Overall: Obviously the ending was anticipated. When the last episode first aired, it was already confirmed that a second season, Pure, would be in the works. (Personally I liked Pure more than this season.) It was an okay anime, it did introduce me to all the beautiful songs in MMPPP. Still, there were obvious flaws that could've been fixed.Rating: 8/10 are okay, except it's too overdone. (I.e.

In fact, I would wager that most adults (especially males) would find this series cringe worthy.However, if you like magical girl series and cute character driven stories, I believe that Mermaid Melody might just be right for you. Keep in mind that the target audience of the seres is very young, but an older person can still enjoy it.The baseline story isn\'t very complex, which is fine. It is essentially about mermaid princesses who are temporarily living on land who fight the evils dwelling below the sea....with music. For some known reason, singing...drives just about any bad guy crazy, so these mermaids transform into super soldiers and put on musical performances to defeat the bad guys.What really makes the show worth watching is the character interactions. Each girl meets certain people on land that help shape who she is in different ways, and some of these interactions result in love, heartache, etc. There are a lot of ""fillers"" in the show, but I would argue that a lot of these fillers often have something to do with the lives and personalities of the characters, and in that way, I believe Mermaid Melody has some very slice of life qualities. Most of these episodes unrelated to the plot are actually fun to watch, and usually used as a device to set up  romantic turmoil between the main character Lucia and her love interest Kaito.Beyond this, every single character in the show (no matter how small the role) is given episodes to develop her character. Even the bad guys have episodes/scenes created to humanize them and make them likable. Since Mermaid Melody is a kids show (targeted at kids between 6-15 I\'d say) most of these villains arn\'t very threatening and it is overall an incredibly non violent and light hearted show.My one real issue with the series is that the music is recycled every episode. Since the girls sing to defeat their enemies, they often use the same songs over and over again. While these songs are cute and catchy, you get sick of them fast. I\'d say the best thing you can do at that point is fast forward when you see the girls ready to go into j-pop mode. It\'s really not a big deal.The art is simply adorable, and perfect for a young girl\'s show. I am surprised how clean it looks given that the show is fairly old. It\'s nothing special at all, but it is nice.Mermaid Melody is a show best enjoyed if you want to watch something simple, light hearted, and fun.

I watched Mermaid Melody because someone said it was good... It\'s anything but in my opinion.Story: (3)The story is really bad. Other than the small twist with the girls being mermaids and fighting enemies with music, nothing about it was interesting or original. We basically just watch the characters mingle a bit, an enemy appears, then is ""destroyed"" by the mermaid\'s singing. That sums most of the episodes that I watched.Art: (7)Best part of the series. Even then, the character designs weren\'t the most original and...some characters look REALLY similar. The designs are very beautiful, just not much to my taste. Backgrounds were good too, but kept the focus mainly on the characters.Sound: (7)Voice acting is a bit over-dramatic in some points, something very annoying. And while I enjoyed the songs a tiny bit the first time, the way this anime over-uses the same songs destroys any enjoyment a person could possibly get from the songs. Since every battle scene has the same song, I just skipped through it after my hope that it would change was crushed.Character: (2)This part made me want to rip my eyes out. The characters are so stereotypical and plain it\'s sad. Hanon is a girl that just wants to have fun and get the guy she wants, Lucia is a love-sick girl that\'s very ditzy and stupid, the villains are all boring and plain... I don\'t even want to go on! I think that if some work was put into character, I might have even enjoyed this series even with it\'s bad story. But no, bad story and bad characters.Enjoyment: (2)Unless you\'re a big fan of the magical girl genre, you probably won\'t be able to stand this. Every episode seemed to drag on for me.Overall: (3)I don\'t see how people can get through 50-something episodes of this series... They have my respect for having such patience! I don\'t know whether this series gets better or not later on, but it was such a big disappointment I\'m not even willing to try. some characters look REALLY similar.

Since every battle scene has the same song, I just skipped through it after my hope that it would change was crushed.Character: (2)This part made me want to rip my eyes out. The characters are so stereotypical and plain it\'s sad. Hanon is a girl that just wants to have fun and get the guy she wants, Lucia is a love-sick girl that\'s very ditzy and stupid, the villains are all boring and plain... I don\'t even want to go on! I think that if some work was put into character, I might have even enjoyed this series even with it\'s bad story. But no, bad story and bad characters.Enjoyment: (2)Unless you\'re a big fan of the magical girl genre, you probably won\'t be able to stand this. Every episode seemed to drag on for me.Overall: (3)I don\'t see how people can get through 50-something episodes of this series... They have my respect for having such patience! I don\'t know whether this series gets better or not later on, but it was such a big disappointment I\'m not even willing to try.', ""Okay, so MMPPP is a great anime, if you like magical girl shoujo romance. You would like it if you watched Sailor Moon or Wedding Peach, but the romance isn't as pleasing. It's very easy to get angry with Kaito, who in my opinion treats Lucia (the main character, who is the Pink Pearl Princess and is Lucia the human) kind of meanly and gets mad if Lucia doesn't bring him a bento or bread that she made or whatever. After awhile, you grow to love him though, because you can see him and Lucia becoming more romantically involved.The songs get boring after awhile....The best song, Legend of the Mermaid, isn't used for a long time, but it's great when they start singing it again. Caren has an AWFUL voice. The best voice is Lina/Rina, who is also a great character. She provides a lot of the comedic relief to the anime. Hanon can get very annoying: Her infatuation with Mitzsuki is very shallow, she seems to only like him because of his looks, and it's nothing like the romance between Katio and Lucia.What I really liked about this anime is how the villains aren't like the Sailor Moon-type &quot;Villain of the Day.&quot; It's always the same ones, the Dark Lovers, except when the very annoying, very lesbian Black Beauty Sisters appear (but the BBS actually have a pretty decent song). The forbidden romance between Yuri, a Dark Lover, and Hippo, Lucia's sort-of sidekick/protector, is really sweet. And actually, the Dark Lovers are funny most of the time. You don't just get the good guy's story, but also the bad guy's story in a way.All in all, Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch is a great anime, and I was very happy with it. I look forward to watching MMPPP Pure! The best song, Legend of the Mermaid, isn't used for a long time, but it's great when they start singing it again. Caren has an AWFUL voice.

While this alone may not sound appealing,  the story is actually not banal at all, as it is filled with numerous twists and deep messages. It was marketed as an anime mainly for children, but adults can enjoy it and find a more profound meaning.A very unique thing about this anime is the fact that the mermaids do not involve themselves in physical fights, rather they sing to defeat their enemies, the songs are pleasant to hear...and they contain motivational and positive lyrics.The show is filled with very funny jokes here and there and each character has unique fun traits.The main character, Lucia Nanami is really the coolest female character I have ever seen, she is all cute and clumsy, but very serious and tough when it is needed.This anime got me into the mahou shoujo genre, which I never expected to appreciate.Recommended 10/10 and they contain motivational and positive lyrics.The show is filled with very funny jokes here and there and each character has unique fun traits.The main character, Lucia Nanami is really the coolest female character I have ever seen, she is all cute and clumsy, but very serious and tough when it is needed.This anime got me into the mahou shoujo genre, which I never expected to appreciate.Recommended 10/10', ""THE WORST ANIME I HAVE SEEN!THE CONSTANT SINGING...THE CLICHE CHARACTERS...THEIR LOVE INTRESTS...I can't explain how horrible it is.

"", ""Started: 3/2/17Finished: 7/30/17I first discovered this show 10 years ago (back in 2007 I was 13 and in the 8th grade, I was preoccupied with other anime) and I saw fan AMVs of Mermaid Melody and I passed it off as another typical MGA (Magical Girl Anime). During that time I'd only ever believed Sailor Moon,  Cardcaptor Sakura and Mew Mew Power-the 4Kids dub- to be the only MGA that mattered.Now, I’m 23 with a small child and I want child appropriate anime for him to watch.This is perfect.Story: the story was nice to follow, even with a slow start, it eventually left...me wanting  more after each episode. It has a  nice and not too complex set up for a young viewer to follow. Also, I have not read the manga yet (I’m planning to so I can give an honest review) but this show has a manga series to match, making it a perfect first series for a young viewer to follow.Character: I don’t care what anyone else has to say about the characters in this show, I liked how they differed and kind of mimicked the stereotype of character tropes in anime. You had the airhead, the mature one and the cool silent type as well as the cute boy and the mysterious character(s) AND the expected love interests among the characters.Art: The artwork wasn’t bad but it didn’t make my toes curl; it’s pretty basic, but it’s reminiscent of the shows I use to watch as a kid in the early 2000s on FoxKids and WBKids and Cartoon Network.Sound: I didn’t mind the voice actors and their acting at all, I felt they all fit the characters quite well.  The music was catchy and memorable, it was definitely one of the best things about this show.Entertainment: As I mentioned previously, the music was by far the most entertaining thing about this anime. The story lines each episode were decent with a few standing out and sticking with me (examples: episodes 19, 25, 27,28, 30, 35, 38, 42, 44, 45, 46 and 50).Overall: This was  a very good anime (score: 8) I recommend it to a viewer who is a fan of the MGA genre, a music lover, and to small children who are beginning their life long journey of anime -girl OR boy- let’s not gender discriminate, people!I started the second season which is titled “Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pure” on 8/4/17 and from what I can tell you after viewing the first two episodes, it looks like it’s  darker and more mature than that of its predecessor.

I have no idea how I managed to watch all of it to be honest.My first impressions of the anime: Bad art, annoying voices, and annoying characters. Know what? My opinion didn't change much. I didn't have any high expectations of the anime, I kinda expected it to be this awful.The songs were kinda catchy though, but not really worth the effort of watching how ever many episodes there are.Story line is a 1. Was there a story line? The story...line didn't have much a to do with anything until the last 5 episodes. And they were drawn out and boring.Then again, it was kind of my fault.

I couldn't stand it, and sometimes I wanted to teleport myself to the world of Mermaid Melody and kill them all. I do admit that it got better, good enough for me to at least be ableto stand them... But if you really want to know, this anime can be summed up in the following words.PredictableClicheGirlyFirst off, before you rant at me with all the anger of your heart, let me say this-- it's just a matter of opinion. If you like girly anime where the main character tries to...hide her true, magical identity from her crush while still trying to impress him, then this is for you. If you like the shows about a not-so-ordinary girl that goes to school, finds a crush, and tries to protect herself and the world from evil, then yes, this is highly recommended. You need to watch this. The art is decent and sorta cute, and everything is bright and happy.But if you're like me? Steer very, very, VERY clear of this show. If you're the type who loves deep storylines with unique characters and a very enthralling, difficult puzzle to put together, then spare yourself of this excuse for an anime. The plot is repetitive, predictable, and so very NOT deep. There are no puzzles to piece together, and if there are, it's all spoon-fed to you in the same episode it was introduced.I may be the type who adores a good horror with a lot of gore, but I'm not a senseless jerk. I like plot, and character development. This show had none of it. It's fine if it's not a horror, but does it have to be a total fail?Anyway, I'm just stating my opinion. Spare me of arguments, because honestly, this show is just incredibly cliche. It's sooooo stereotypical, like the average magical girl anime. If you like that thing, watch this now. But as I've said before, if you're like me, try to completely erase this title from your mind.Thankfully, the music isn't all bad. The voices (in the Japanese version, at least [is there even an English version anyway?]) are decent, actually good. The songs are catchy and they will grow on you (probably). Anyway, the sound was the only saving grace of this show, for me at least, and though I've heard THOUSANDS of times better, this was still good.All in all, this show isn't highly rated in my book, but it's decent enough if you like magical girl and shoujo. I won't say any spoilers, but the ending is decent (though, sort of cliche) and it works with the anime, I guess.Take a second look at the kind of shows you like to watch, and depending on your opinion, and the things I said in my review, decide if you're interested.

So, I just sat and jammed to the \'music\' and looked at the pretty colors.Things change. Lol.Story(7/10): I\'m not gonna spoil anything, plus it\'s such a drag to write a synopsis on something most people here already know or are at least a bit familiar with. To be honest, I don\'t completely understand what the main plot in this series is. Is it saving the mermaids? Or defeating Gaito? Both? Idk, but I was engaged nonetheless....While it was entertaining, the series is 52 episodes long, so some of the pointless filler was not appreciated at all. Leave room for some character development. A lot of the time, I was left wondering what the main focus is, or thinking ""where tf are they going with this?"".I also do not appreciate how half the series consisted of the main trio defeating their enemies, and they\'re all like ""dammit I lose again! I will get youuuu"".Reminds me of Dora the Explorer, which is not a good thing. However, the parts of the show which consisted of actually rescuing the remaining princesses were really good. Good enough to save the rating from hitting a 5, which it could have.Art(8/10): I feel that the characters were drawn really well. Transformation scenes were cool, as well as the design of the mermaids. I liked the vibrant colors, and the diversity of the characters\' looks. Nothing wrong here.Sound(6/10): One might say that this rating is a bit harsh considering how I quite enjoyed this anime and it\'s sound played a rather significant part in it. Yes the opening and ending themes are nice, and the character\'s voices are fine. The songs were pretty okay, for teen jpop from the early 2000\'s. I can say that an impressive effort was put into making each song sound different from the other (no shade there \'Idolm@ster\' huh?). Heck, the villain songs were even better.Given all this positivity, one would think that my rating would be higher, right?WRONGGG. Here\'s why...The songs were repetitive, and I mean REPETITIVE. The same song would be played for the next 10 or so episodes and when my computer has a problem buffering, it becomes my worst enemy. First two times, I\'ll jam to it. One would think that 100 times would be more than enough. Apparently not, for whoever produced this.Also, there\'s something about the conversation part of the sound that puts me off. Maybe its the background music, which I hated btw. I dunno, it just sounded cheap.Not very impressive.Characters(2/10): Easily the worst thing about this anime. Main characters are boy-crazy idiots who seem to think with their feet and not their brains. I\'m talking about Luchia and Hanon (Don\'t worry, Rina will get her chance to go completely OOC and blush every five seconds in the second season).Anyways, if you add all the words spoken throughout the season, and subtract the names ""Kaito"" and ""Tarou-chan"" from the two girls\' vocabulary, you will be left at about 10. Like come on, these girls were raised in a castle,  so they should be expected to have at least a few ounces of dignity! Very painful to watch for the most part. The actual love interests are not very interesting either. The main guy, Kaito, although very important, makes me want to flip a table. You can\'t search for your mermaid, and lead on a human girl, who is in fact the one you\'ve been looking for, but you aren\'t aware of that. In the end, he finds out the truth, and everything is all peaches and cream from then on, but here\'s my problem: why tf are all these characters so stupid?Luchia has the same voice and necklace as your mermaid! And she\'s also obsessed with you. Take the hint and at least ask the girl. If she admits it, she won\'t have to suffer the consequences, and no one gets hurt, because you found out, and she didn\'t have to tell you. Ugh the cringe.But then I remember, good decisions are not good for any plot.Now the villains:Even more stupid, especially when it comes to recognizing their enemies on land. No wonder they always lose. Their leader, Gaito is no better. He\'s lazy, and has no reason at all for the things he does do. And you expect me to feel sorry for him in the end because he was lonely? NAH!Characters were awful. They stunk. I hated them. Bye.Enjoyment(8/10): Hahaha, I enjoyed this anime for the wrong reasons. I like seeing people dumber than myself get themselves into situations for the dumbest reasons and use their ""kawaii popstar powers"" to get themselves out. Art was cool. The last three episodes were eventful. Characters sucked. But I enjoyed this.Confused aren\'t ya? Hahaha, just go see for yourself. If you like shoujo anime, you\'ll get a kick out of this.

Mermaid Melody has been one of my first magical girl animes as a kid, and watching it at this age made me realise that there were flaws in this anime.Story: 6/10. So, Mermaid Melody is a story about a mermaid, Luchia, who saves Kaito's life from a wave. She entrusts her pearl to him so that when they meet again, he gives it back to her. However, her kingdom, along with the other Mermaid Princesses', are in danger because Gaito wants to conquer the seven seas. And...it's up to Luchia, Hanon and Rina to save them, along with the other mermaids. This sounds like a very interesting plot. The main character is given many situations to deal with, and it's solved with the help of her friends. The only major flaw about it is Gaito's motive in ruling over the oceans. I highly doubt there's a proper or wise motive in his actions.Art: 9/10. For an anime broadcasted in 2003, the art style is following the trend of large, expressive eyes. There aren't as much animation errors, and all in all the animation is flawless. My only pet peeve is that Luchia's design kind of breaks the cohesiveness of all the other mermaids, or maybe the person behind the designs of the characters opted for something that would fit her better personality-wise.Sound: 10/10. The music is very amazing. Each song gives off a very nostalgic feel. However, if you don't favour this sound of jpop then maybe this anime isn't for you. That aside, the music will get to you, and maybe make you cry.Character: 8/10. The characters are very well developed. There aren't much stereotypes or tropes that I can find, however I like how, namely, Rina is portrayed. She may seem unapproachable at first, but she's actually a very warm and caring person, and even has her funny moments as well. Hanon, whist she loves oogling over handsome guys, she still cares about her friends. Kaito, besides the fact that he's very popular and very good at surfing, he has flaws. He'll be blunt at times and say stuff that he doesn't mean, whilst at the end of the day, he still has some human decency. As for Luchia, she is also very flawed. She gets jealous easily, can be reckless and even bratty at times. But she has a big heart, she's very courageous and she also has many talents. I take away 2 points for some unnecessary filler characters that appear and serve no purpose to the story.Enjoyment: 10/10. The anime was quite awesome. Yes, there are fillers here and there, but sometimes there are times where the goal takes a bit longer to achieve because of the persistence of the villans. This anime won't suit you if you dislike filler and repetitive episodes that end up giving the episode a format on how the story goes. All in all, I like this series.Overall: 8/10. Mermaid Melody is an amazing anime. If you enjoy filler episodes, music, fantasy, romance, and female leads in general, you should watch it. I really hope someone happens upon this anime and gives it a reboot in some sort of way, in manga form or anime form. The reboot can take care of flaws that the original had, and even explore popular concepts in anime today. it's up to Luchia, Hanon and Rina to save them, along with the other mermaids.

He'll be blunt at times and say stuff that he doesn't mean, whilst at the end of the day, he still has some human decency. As for Luchia, she is also very flawed. She gets jealous easily, can be reckless and even bratty at times. But she has a big heart, she's very courageous and she also has many talents. I take away 2 points for some unnecessary filler characters that appear and serve no purpose to the story.Enjoyment: 10/10. The anime was quite awesome. Yes, there are fillers here and there, but sometimes there are times where the goal takes a bit longer to achieve because of the persistence of the villans. This anime won't suit you if you dislike filler and repetitive episodes that end up giving the episode a format on how the story goes. All in all, I like this series.Overall: 8/10. Mermaid Melody is an amazing anime. If you enjoy filler episodes, music, fantasy, romance, and female leads in general, you should watch it. I really hope someone happens upon this anime and gives it a reboot in some sort of way, in manga form or anime form. The reboot can take care of flaws that the original had, and even explore popular concepts in anime today."", 'This is typically the type of anime I don’t watch because I sure I won’t enjoy it.Well, it was in fact fun to watch.The story 6/10 :The story was very interesting but what made it bad was how it was presented.Out of 52 episodes I would not be surprised if 30 of them were fillers adding little to no content to the story.The art 6/10 :The art was nice, but you really notice that some parts were rushed and very poorly animated or drawn. For a kids show it totally fits, but for the critic side it isn’t really that nice....The sound 7/10 :The global OST was pretty nice since it was made for an Idols/Magical Girl type of anime. For the songs I only heard the French translation and they weren’t bad for once.

And then we have characters such as Caren who’s barely into 7-10 episodes. For Kaito, his character wasn’t really developed until really late in the episodes.

Well, let me explain. I wanted to enjoy this anime. I didn't mind the art or the story (though by Magical Girl/Shoujo anime standards, the story is VERY cliche). Hell, I enjoyed music of this anime, and of course, the characters were.... okay. But the one thing that kept me from enjoying this anime were the voices of the characters. I was watching the original Japanese version with English subs and oh. my. freaking...god do the voices grate my ears! Especially the voice of Lucia/Sara. Like idk what it is about her voice in particular that makes me want to bang my head against the wall and scrape my brains out. Sorry for the bit of graphic description there.In the past, I did try watching Mermaid Melody but something always made me not want to watch it. At first I thought it was because I always get so easily distracted by other animes and stuff but seeing as this is my fourth attempt to watch this series in like three years, I'd say, I've figured out the root cause of my dislike for this anime. And that's the voices... The actors sound like they haven't had any voice acting training at all. Or maybe it's the poor quality video that I've been watching? IDK. Lucia's voice in particular is what really annoys me. Mainly because she sounds like a boy trying to be a girl. Or like a female voice actress voicing a young preteen male character pretending to be a girl. Not that there's anything wrong with that because I've seen male characters pretending to be and identify as girls before, but I think I'm used to my shoujo heroines sounding more feminine and having a sweeter, nicer voice or something. Something that sounds like the voice of a preteen girl with a magical girl secret.Will I come back to this anime someday? Maybe. Idk. Today maybe a slightly off day for me where I have very little patience in dealing with what sounds like mediocre voice acting. This anime does have an interesting concept since most magical girl animes don't feature mermaids (most magical animes feature cat girls--or other animal girls with ears and tail or deal more with the heroines controlling over the main elements of wind, fire, air, ice, and electricity). So until then, I'm putting this anime on hold.When I do come back to this anime, I will delete this review and give a more indepth review. god do the voices grate my ears!

To put my opinion out there really simply without being biased by nostalgia, I think Mermaid Melody is SORT OF good.  It\'s REALLY good if you\'re really into...the ""magical girl"" thing, *because the plotline is rather typical for series in this genre.*My favorite aspect of this anime, by far, is the art.  *I am in love with the cutesy-bright girly color scheme.*  I like that the main character in human form looks sort of like an elementary school Britney Spears, and as a mermaid she of course looks like an adolescant Sailor Moon because damnit all magical girls have to look exactly the same when they transform apparently.  Put simply, its cute... and I like that the whole thing is just so CUTE and just CUTE and CUTECUTECUTE.So overall, while this series may not be for everyone, it\'s definitley super kyoooot and if you want a moronic magical girl storyline with super ultra adorable artwork, this is the one for you.

You won\'t regret watching it, even if you are an adult looking for something cute to watch.PROS:-The plot and story are really fun and surprisingly make sense. There are the main characters, sure who steal a lot of the spotlight but all...things considered, they spend a lot of time exploring different character side stories which I found better than the main character arc.-The love story with the main characters is cutesy, sure, but trust me the side characters and even some VILLAINS get a love story that is slightly better delivered.-I was surprised that a show made for kids managed to have some Lil easter eggs like in season 2 they brought back ____ from season 1 which I enjoyed.-The songs are amazing, I would 10/10 listen to most of them again.-The villains and bad guys are given some side stories that may cross with the main characters which are great because of character devolvement!CONS:-Repetitive songs (that is fine, just fast fwd the songs) BUT they do change the songs every 2/3 eps!-Some may find the main character a bit ""basic"" but I don\'t have anything against her.OVERALL: This is such a great and classic anime!

But even though I watched it as a teenager, and then rewatched it as an adult, I do think there\'s some enjoyment to be had in this anime despite how much of a mess it can be.Story - Six years ago, Lucia Nanami, the mermaid princess of the North Pacific Ocean, met a boy named Kaito Domoto. She saved him after a tsunami struck the ship he was on and gave him her pearl. Now six years later, Lucia...goes to the human world to retrieve her pearl. There she gets reunited with Kaito and also meets two other mermaid princesses - Hanon Hosho, the mermaid princess of the South Atlantic Ocean, and Rina Toin, the mermaid princess of the North Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile the main villain of this show, Gaito, wants to capture the mermaid princesses and use their pearls to call Aqua Regina, the sea Goddess, and use her power to control the oceans. He\'s already captured two princesses, Noel and Coco. His minions, the Dark Lovers, would do anything to get him what he wants. Lucia, Hanon, and Rina can use their pearls to transform into idols and defeat the villains with their songs.Also we have the romance between Lucia and Kaito. Lucia isn\'t allowed to tell Kaito she\'s a mermaid because if a mermaid confesses to a human, they turn into bubbles. But if the human realizes it on their own, then its okay. I know, pretty confusing.The story is okay. The idea of mermaid princesses who defeat the villains with their songs was interesting. And later, we have the Black Beauty Sisters who have songs of their own that can hurt the mermaids. Though the whole thing about how ""if mermaid touch water in their human forms they\'ll turn back into a mermaid"" was inconsistent because we\'ve seen the girls in rain multiple times and nothing happens to them. But in one episode Lucia is scared to go in the rain because she may turn into a mermaid?Also the whole thing about Kaito having to realize Lucia is a mermaid was so dragged out. He realized it in episode 13, then forgot because he lost his memory due to losing his power.But otherwise the story is decent. It gets a 7/10Art - The art is pretty good. I love the backgrounds of the North Pacific Ocean kingdom. Though I wish we had seen the other kingdoms as well. 7/19Sound - Since this show is all about singing mermaids, the sound should be good. All the songs were amazing. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 10 is Karen\'s voice. I know its cliche to complain about her voice but it could get so.... high pitched when she\'s singing. 9/10Character - Lucia was a decent protagonist. She\'s fun, energetic, cheerful, pretty standard magical girl protagonist stuff. Though her jealousy over Kaito did annoy me a bit, but thankfully that was called out in one episode and its not a problem in the second season.Hanon was pretty fun and I\'ve gotta say, I\'m so glad with how they handled her crush on Tarou. Hanon has a one sided crush on him and while Tarou does care for her, he doesn\'t reciprocate her feelings (which he shouldn\'t because he\'s her TEACHER). And her crush did make her annoying at times but otherwise I liked her.Rina is probably my facourite of the trio. The way she started off as an aloof girl but slowly developed and got out of her shell was lovely. Her obsession over plasma TVs was also funny.Hippo was a standard magical girl mascot. He was funny at times. What really made me like him was his tragic romance with Yuuri. THEY DESERVED BETTER DAMMIT.Nikora and Taki were also fun to watch.Kaito was an okay love interest. As I mentioned before, I didn\'t like how long it took for him to figure out Lucia\'s identity. He literally realized it in episode 13, then forgot because he used his powers. And then remains oblivious for the rest of the anime. Even his SIX YEAR OLD COUSIN figured it out faster than he did. But when its done well, his relationship with Lucia is beautiful.Now for the villains. I adored the Dark Lovers. They could be hilarious and the way they bicker a lot but ultimately care about each other as a family was wonderful. I really missed their presence in the second season.The Black Beauty Sisters were a delight to watch and their songs were top tier. My only complaint is the weird incest thing going on between them.Sara was great too. It was cool to see a mermaid princess who turned to the dark side. Her song is the best one of the first season.Gaito was.... okay. He didn\'t do much in the season and relied on his minions and his tragic backstory was only revealed in the last episode.Overall the characters were enjoyable. 7/19Enjoyment - Aside from Kaito taking the entire show to figure out Lucia\'s identity, this show is pretty enjoyable. It could be a mess at times but the characters could be such a delight to watch. 7/10Overall - This was my second magical girl anime after Sailor Moon, so it does hold a special place in my heart. Rewatching it as an adult, I can see a lot of flaws. But its still enjoyable enough to be one of my favourites. 7/10 goes to the human world to retrieve her pearl.

This was, however, a core part of my childhood, and it still is one of my favourite series.Mermaid Melody is an series from 2003 made for TV, and it shows its age. Its animation is not that good, the dubs are from okay to pretty weird sounding depending on which one you look at, and the storyline isn't something that you won't be able to live without.BUT, and this is a big but. It has heart. I know how cheesy and stupid that sounds but it is true. It's a series with heart,...a series where the characters LOVE each other, platonically or romantically. It's a series that, to its credit, delves into topics like abandonment, unrequited love, teenagers learning how to live life outside of their small bubbles, etc.The characters have personality and depth, even if they don't seem to have, and personally I find Sara to be quite the compelling story (not sure if that one happened here or in Pure).Both this one and its sequel are series that, if you can tolerate the flaws, are very charming and have lots of clear love and care on them. If you absolutely can't tolerate the voices (understandable with some dubs), go to subs or even the manga.Overall, give it a chance like you would give a chance to a series you found when you were 6-8 zapping on TV. This is what it was made for, and it's the perspective that will most benefit your viewing.Lots of love and see you at the paradise of the seven seas! :) a series where the characters LOVE each other, platonically or romantically.

Oh! Edo Rocket,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2152/Oh_Edo_Rocket,"['Now that helpful votes don\'t exist anymore, I\'m completely untethered and can review the most obscure anime possible without feeling any pressure to review seasonal stuff. What better way to kick off the new MAL than with Oh Edo Rocket, an anime that you\'ve never heard of, and nobody cares about.Oh Edo Rocket was based on a stage play that heavily relies on political satire. It apparently used the Edo period as a metaphor for the Japanese politics of the 1990s and the reactionary policies that accompanied the lost decade. Basically, if you don\'t know who Yoshiro Mori is, just assume everything is going...to fly over your head. Funimation figured this out quickly after agreeing to adapt this one, so by the 3rd episode the dub stops making any attempt to follow what the characters are actually saying. It never quite reaches Ghost Stories level, but a character will say ""Even a mosquito can blow me down"" then the dub will add a character screaming from offscreen ""THAT JOKE DOESN\'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE IN ENGLISH!"". I think the reason this series is so disliked online is that people watched the sub and just felt like ""What the hell is this? I don\'t get it! Is this referencing something?"". However, if you just watch the silly dub, you can actually have a fun time with this series.Oh Edo Rocket\'s plot is very loosely based on the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. This story is interspersed with the story of young rebel who wishes to make fireworks, but everything is tightly regulated and repressive because it\'s the Edo Period. This anime is fucking bonkers with a tone that is all over the place. We could have predicted this since the anime was a Sho Aikawa script. This is the same gentleman who wrote such classics as Genocyber, Legend of the Overfiend, Angel Cop, and the Violence Jack film trilogy. I still remember a line from an old ANN review saying ""Oh no! You\'ve hired rogue anime writer Sho Aikawa! What have you done?!"" However, Oh Edo Rocket has a double dose of crazy since the stage play was written by Kazuki Nakashima, who you probably know for writing Gurren Lagann and Batman Ninja. In one episode, a corrupt policeman murders a young mother and drains her blood for his vampire girlfriend, leaving her baby to freeze to death in her arms. 5 episodes later, there is a big dance party on the moon, and everyone is invited! I\'m serious. It\'s that kind of anime.This anime had zero ability to market itself to gaijin, but it actually wasn\'t cheap to produce. This was a 26-episode anime by Studio Madhouse that looks gorgeous and cost a pretty penny. The opening theme was sung by Puffy during the height of their popularity. You know, the JPOP band that got so popular that they had their own non-anime cartoon in America. That Puffy!I would recommend this anime as both a highly unique experience and a time capsule of an earlier period in American anime dubbing. When everything under the sun still got a dub and often dub studios were forced to accept random anime that they didn\'t want so that Japanese animation studios could recoup their losses. In 2022, some of the best seasonal anime like Kongming can\'t get a dub. It\'s hard to even imagine there was a time when something like Oh Edo Rocket would receive a dub and be physically in America. My buddy found this in the bargain bin of an anime con and fell in love with it. None of us have seen a copy of it since in the wild. You can find them online, but if you go to anywhere that sells anime DVDs, you just don\'t see this one. I hope all of this was enough to convince some of you to give this one a try. to fly over your head. Funimation figured this out quickly after agreeing to adapt this one, so by the 3rd episode the dub stops making any attempt to follow what the characters are actually saying. It never quite reaches Ghost Stories level, but a character will say ""Even a mosquito can blow me down"" then the dub will add a character screaming from offscreen ""THAT JOKE DOESN\'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE IN ENGLISH!"". I think the reason this series is so disliked online is that people watched the sub and just felt like ""What the hell is this? I don\'t get it! Is this referencing something?"". However, if you just watch the silly dub, you can actually have a fun time with this series.Oh Edo Rocket\'s plot is very loosely based on the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. This story is interspersed with the story of young rebel who wishes to make fireworks, but everything is tightly regulated and repressive because it\'s the Edo Period. This anime is fucking bonkers with a tone that is all over the place. We could have predicted this since the anime was a Sho Aikawa script. This is the same gentleman who wrote such classics as Genocyber, Legend of the Overfiend, Angel Cop, and the Violence Jack film trilogy. I still remember a line from an old ANN review saying ""Oh no! You\'ve hired rogue anime writer Sho Aikawa! What have you done?!"" However, Oh Edo Rocket has a double dose of crazy since the stage play was written by Kazuki Nakashima, who you probably know for writing Gurren Lagann and Batman Ninja. In one episode, a corrupt policeman murders a young mother and drains her blood for his vampire girlfriend, leaving her baby to freeze to death in her arms. 5 episodes later, there is a big dance party on the moon, and everyone is invited! I\'m serious. It\'s that kind of anime.This anime had zero ability to market itself to gaijin, but it actually wasn\'t cheap to produce. This was a 26-episode anime by Studio Madhouse that looks gorgeous and cost a pretty penny. The opening theme was sung by Puffy during the height of their popularity. You know, the JPOP band that got so popular that they had their own non-anime cartoon in America. That Puffy!I would recommend this anime as both a highly unique experience and a time capsule of an earlier period in American anime dubbing. When everything under the sun still got a dub and often dub studios were forced to accept random anime that they didn\'t want so that Japanese animation studios could recoup their losses. In 2022, some of the best seasonal anime like Kongming can\'t get a dub. It\'s hard to even imagine there was a time when something like Oh Edo Rocket would receive a dub and be physically in America. My buddy found this in the bargain bin of an anime con and fell in love with it. None of us have seen a copy of it since in the wild. You can find them online, but if you go to anywhere that sells anime DVDs, you just don\'t see this one. I hope all of this was enough to convince some of you to give this one a try.', 'During festivals in Japan it is customary to shout ""Tamaya!"" or ""Kagiya!"" when the fireworks are lighting up the sky. I knew about this, but I had always wondered why they would shout something like that. Now I know.Oh! Edo Rocket is about a firework maker named Tamaya Seikichi and his friends in Edo during the mid-1800\'s. A time that was hard on anyone with a profession that leaned more towards entertainment and suchlike, well to be quite fair it was probably hard on most common people living in Japan during this age.I normally don\'t write reviews about animes I have given a high rating,...I\'m not good at praising things, but I felt I need to hype this anime up a bit since it\'s clear that it\'s not a very popular anime, atleast not here on MAL.I\'m going to start out by saying that this is a fairly original anime, not just because it\'s about a firework maker, not just because of the mix of character design and art, but also because of the themes that the anime lean towards. It is common to see comedy and drama mixed together, but it\'s not common to see the kind of comedy you usually expect to find in parodies and spoof animes such as Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei or Pani Poni Dash! just to name a few mixed with sometimes very serious dramatic scenes. I especially liked the few, subtle, but very funny references to other anime, fairly recently produced anime at that.There was a story in Oh! Edo Rocket. Initially you don\'t see it, but after a while you realize there\'s actually a story that\'s being told and it actually progresses with one defection at episode 20, but still it\'s refreshing to see an anime that actually has a story that\'s not afraid to go in the right direction. I\'m getting a bit fed up with all the sidetracking of recent series I\'ve seen. But above all I am getting really pissed off at the fact that most animes have endings that hardly are endings at all, they\'re either really bad because the manga isn\'t finished or the money grubbing productions companies might want to make a sequel because they made enough profit so they make cliffhangers that make the movie cliffhanger seem like a good movie (it wasn\'t, it has Sylvester Stallone in it and I think the director just let him say anything he wanted instead of reading the script). Oh! Edo Rocket has a distinct ending that actually ends the anime. Well to tell you the truth there are two endings, imagine that!

Edo Rocket is a mix of crazy comedy and serious drama, and like the fireworks that feature so prevelently, it explodes wonderfully.*Insert synopsis here*The show doesn't take itself very seriously at all. The show is heavy with humour, and is quite fond of self-reference, as well as some pop culture (Such as the very apt 'Men in Black'). It also has no problems breaking the fourth wall (ie. admitting it's fictional), and you'll regularly see modern conveniences, such as the TVs used to show some flashbacks.The humour is well executed, and despite the numerous comedy series I've seen, I never really felt this series'...humour to be rehashed/stale.When the show isn't being funny, it's likely going through a fight scene. Yes, I said fight scene, and there are a fair few of them, I won't spoil why. The fights felt pretty standard to me. Decent, but nothing special.Between the humour and fights, there isn't really a lot of space, so you could be forgiven for thinking that's all the show has, but somehow, they managed to sneak in a serious drama amidst all the craziness, and it gradually grows to take a firm place in the series. Saying anything more would probably spoil it, though. The show does start to slow down near the end, but you'll probably have already decided if you're sticking with it by then.The artwork is quality as far as I can tell, all standard styling though. A few characters are SD (stumpy), but I don't consider that a problem.As for sound, well, as usual, I didn't notice much. The OP and EDs weren't anything special, but they felt appropriate. The OP DID annoy me though, as the first few 'riffs' sounded nice, but then it just went silly. I felt kinda cheated.Summary: In my opinion, this is a great comedy series. There IS some good drama in there, but the comedy is the star. If you're not into comedy anime, I can't say this one would change your mind.

If you watch it in English you will find it generally stays true to the story however, some Japanese references will be lost and put into a reference people in North America can understand. One example is in one episode you will hear them talk about Shows from North America like Dexter and the mentioning of HBO.The Show takes place in the Edo Period of Japan, it's a time when many forms of entertainment have been outlawed, One of the people affected by this Sekichi Tamaya, a...fireworks manufacturer tries to put on shows for the entertainment of the people of Edo but he quickly finds himself dodging the authorities who try to arrest him for breaking the law, he comes upon a mysterious girl named Sora who asks Sekichi to build him a rocket to the Moon and that is how Oh Edo Rocket begins.What I like about this show is that it perfectly balances the Serious and the Not-So-Serious, it knows when to be funny and when to advance the plot. The story is very well-written, High Marks here for originality because i never thought I'd be seeing a story like this.The Artwork in the story is rich, vibrant and full of color. I still have no idea why Shinza, Santa, Rokube's Wife and Rokube are drawn so radically different from some of the other characters, If I can ever get to ask Mr. Mizushima about that, it will be the first thing I do.The music in this show is fantastic and it's very memorable, but it will likely appeal to those who enjoy Jazz music like myself.As for the English Dub performances, this is probably one of the best English Dubs I've heard, Vic Mignogna has a lot of Detractors, there will be people who hate him and people who like him on a personal level. Some people say there were roles he did ruin. I think Vic is a great actor when he is given roles that are very strange or bizarre, his Character in this one, Tetsuju is probably one of the funniest characters ever written for an anime, I can tell you that once you see him in this role you will likely agree with me that this and not Edward Elric is the best role he's done in his career, he pretty much steals the show everytime he's on screen in this one.Other standout performances include Chris Cason as the tragic figure of Genzo and new-comer Jonathan Brooks as the sly Ginjiro. The Leads are well played by Greg Ayres and Brina Palencia, who in my opinion always gives a great performance. Tyler Walker did a great job with voice-over on this series, but it should come as little surprise because most of his dubs have been fantastic (Even people who don't like Blassreiter overall, have admitted that he did a fantastic job with the actors on that show.)I would definitely say the one problem with this show may be that it maybe went six episodes too long. A major plot point wraps up on episode 20. However, as I look at the episodes beyond 20, I think there would be a few things that the audience would be clamoring to find out if it ended at 20 that only get resolved in the final couple of Episodes (I.E. Genzo's fate).Overall, Oh Edo Rocket is worth checking out if you are clamoring for something unique and different. It's not for everybody but if you want to laugh hard, this is the cure! fireworks manufacturer tries to put on shows for the entertainment of the people of Edo but he quickly finds himself dodging the authorities who try to arrest him for breaking the law, he comes upon a mysterious girl named Sora who asks Sekichi to build him a rocket to the Moon and that is how Oh Edo Rocket begins.What I like about this show is that it perfectly balances the Serious and the Not-So-Serious, it knows when to be funny and when to advance the plot.

But if you are into this type of genre it is one THE best shows. It is based of an amazing and popular play in Tokyo so the funding seems to be top dollar considering universal japan was involved. I really enjoy the bits of random humor and of topic and out of place lines or object thrown in to get a laugh. Even though humor is prevalent the plot is amazing and the music is just plain awesome. The characters actually have levels unlike so many anime out there where everyone...is typecast. There is some filler and the plot is dragged at some points but not enough to anger anyone it usually lasts maybe a tenth of an episode.I highly recommend it. I can't shower enough praise on this work. is typecast.

So when I bought the 2007 series  Oh!-Edo Rocket on Specs, I wasn't expecting much from it, so why even see it? Because of 3 things:1. It was made by Madhouse and it's their first comedy anime series that they made.2. It's directed by the guy who worked on Fullmetal Alchemist3. It's based on a play for the...Gekidan Shinkansen theater troupe by Kazuki Nakashima, who's the creator of Gurren Lagann.After finishing the series. I was fairly entertained with series with top notch fourth wall jokes and wacky humor, fun characters and great animation by the great Madhouse but it does fall short in a few things that were overlooked in the show.Oh! Edo Rocket takes place in Edo in the year 1842, the thirteenth year in the Tenpō era where government reforms banned all luxuries, from plays, performances, inventions and fireworks. Seikichi, a young fireworks maker, is determined to make an amazing firework so that he can bring a possible change to his town but everytime he fails, he's pursued by government officials including Akai, who despises the residents of the Furai Row House because the block is always full of trash and he cleans it up everyday. That is until a girl named Sora (obvious parody of Sora from Kingdom Hearts game series) comes to Seikichi's home and requests him to make a firework that can send her to the moon and his reaction to her request does not go well. Thinking that it might be a good chance to show off his firework skills, he accepts the offer and the quest to send her back to the moon begins.The story is so non-sensical that it's just hilarious. This is a series that makes tons of crazy forth wall jokes despite being in the year 1842 from residents knowing animation cuts in certain episodes to Shunpei mentioning Madhouse's animation budget in one episode, to a part where helicopters appear out of nowhere, it's a crazy show that relies on some incredibly akward but funny forth wall jokes that surprisingly never drag the story down. Hell, there's a scene where Toyama uses an old TV as a computer to write blogs and there are characters that are not even alike to others. For example, Rokubei has huge teeth, while her wife has a round mouth and strangely, no one seems to care. All in all, the characters are weird, but not terrible. They do develop over the course of the series and to be fair it works. Seikichi may be an arrogant kid at times and bit selfish but he is willing to risk his life to make that rocket for Sora and the others are also well developed but for spoiler's sake, I won't spoil more and just let you know how these characters develop overtime when you see the series.The animation by Madhouse is excellent. While not one of Madhouse's best works, you can clearly see the animators put some great effort into the series. The backgrounds are full of big and little details to see, the coloring is great and some visual aspects of the show are incredibly chaotic but creative in their own little world. Character models and animations are incredibly good and their animation movements are life-like than other anime shows. The music is also great, giving it a big humorous comedic edge to the shows tone (except the opening and ending theme of the series, there awful) and the dub is simply the best I ever heard. The actors are having a blast with their roles, including Brina Palencia as Sora and Greg Ayres as Seikichi, but Vic Mignogna as the crazy fireworks maker Tetsuju steals the show and it's clearly one of Vic's best underrated voice performances in the show. So what prevents this show from getting a higher rating?  Well it's because the show changes the tone from comical to extremely dark and gritty. While it does work in the story and for other characters like Akai and that blue beast, it becomes a fully different thing than the comedic episodes that we watched in the first few minutes in the series and it tries too hard to be a serious plot cause this is a show that makes fun of pop culture references and modern advertising, so why go all dark all of the sudden? But at least it picks up the humorous tone in the last six episodes (despite being unnecessary), so it doesn't ruin the show. Also, everything gets resolved in episode 20, but then it decides to go on to six more episodes and while it does offer some moments of laughter, it runs out of steam in the end of the series.Oh! Edo Rocket is a fun little gem that's worth the time to experience with friends who want to have a funny good time at home. While it isn't masterpiece material and reviewers complained about this to this series, it's not supposed to be a masterpiece. It's a show that makes fun of history, pop-culture references and they even make fun of their own anime, so really what the hell were they expecting after watching the series? Madhouse's version of Ghost In The Shell?. But either way, It's still a fun show and it deserves to be seen by people who haven't heard of this show.

I at first thought that there just wasn’t any interesting anime left out there to be found. This opinion finally changed when two weeks ago my Netflix decided to recommend Oh! Edo Rocket for me to watch instantly. At first I was very nervous due to the fact that I tend to stay away from English dubbed anime (the exception being Dragon Ball Z and Ouran Host Club) but I was whiling to give the...show a chance. Once I finished both seasons, I was very, very happy that I gave myself the initial push to watch the show.Story: 6.5/10Initially, the show took its time to reveal the entire cast and what the whole plot was going to be revolved around. To sum up the plot, a fireworks maker finds himself head of a very ambitious project to help a friend and with the help of the entire neighborhood, they intend on making the best firework the world has ever seen. What makes the story so interesting is that the show gradually adds characters and plot twists where needed. I only found myself getting a little bored in the final stages of the show. The show can be split into the first major story arc, two or three filerish episodes, then the final couple episodes to finish it off. Overall, the plot is interesting and the characters never get boring.Animation: 8/10Another very strong point for the show is its animation. A lot of the character models are very well done and are nice to see every episode. Some of the cast are poorly drawn and have excessive exaggerations to their models on purpose and it doesn’t conflict with the overall look of the show. The color scheme is very appealing as there is an overall emphasis on bright, almost neon colors for the fireworks. Sora, the main character is stunning to look at and this quality never lets up throughout all twenty six episodes. It is a very appealing show to watch.Sound: 8/10NOTE: THIS IS REVIEWED ON WATCHING THE ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION OF THE ANIME, NOT THE ORIGINAL JAP. AUDIO.In the past, English dubs have really ruined the overall experience of some anime for me. Funimation however have really put together some great English dubs including this one. The voice acting is superb and I am almost whiling to say is better than the original Jap. audio. You are not getting any generic sounding lines from these guys; each line is done very well. The music is also very good as it fits in with the show fairly well although I am not a fan of the opening theme which consists of some J-popnonsense.Characters: 8.5/10What makes or breaks a show for me is always the cast and how well their interactions play out for my tastes. The animation can be flawless and the musical score can be the best the world has ever heard but if I cannot feel for the characters and what is going on in their lives, the show is a flop in my opinion. The cast here get along very well and you actually feel for each and every one when something good or bad happens. The main character Seikichi can be pretty whiny in some situations but he has goals he wants to accomplish and he won’t let anyone get in his way. The main villain, Akai, really gets beneath your skin and you hate his guts from the moment you meet him. Overall, the cast actually feels like a family and when they are struggling, you want them to succeed.Overall: 7.8/10This show was simply like a present you find behind the Christmas tree that you didn’t notice at first. For the first time I can actually thank Netflix for recommending me a show to watch. Its very well written backed by an amazing cast, great music, great English dub, awesome artwork, and a well flowing story. After leaving this show, I have faith that I can once again take a plunge into an anime without the feeling that I will be let down by a half hazard attempt to throw something together. If you like comedies with a very small hint of romance, then this is the show for you.Enjoyment: 8.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

I\'m sure that 3 years ago or something, I would have watched at least 6 episodes, and perhaps 5-8 years ago, I would have watched the entire thing.Oh! Edo Rocket is a show made in 2007, but it really feels like it was made in 1995 for how crappy the animation is. It feels like I\'m watching Orphen, but instead of a crappy formulaic adventure magic show, it\'s instead a crappy formulaic comedy action show.I don\'t really care what genre it is, or when it was made, the show should have some sort of structure and pacing. Oh! Edo Rocket...does not really have anything desirable. It plays weird jazz OST in tense fights, it does quick jumps from one scene to another that have basically no relationship with each other, each depicting completely random dialogue and interactions. Best of all, none of it is remotely funny. Any attempts in comedy is clearly a failure. Random does not equal funny OK? Bobobobo is extremely random, but it\'s also hilarious. Oh! Edo Rocket just makes you scratch your head wondering what just happened because some random crap happens to a random character. Each scene involves a different character, and in the few minutes you have to see the character, you really don\'t care about them. ""Funny"" scenes just make you wonder what the hell the punchline is, and it never comes.The art is horrendous. CGI is god awful, and so are the OST. Fight scenes are mediocre at best, and there\'s a lack of detail when it comes to the choreography. Character art sometimes have over-embellished features for a comedic tone and effect, but they\'re crappy regardless. Even the standard faces and animation is just bad.It\'s a nonsensical random anime that probably culminates into some serious plot line that I don\'t care about since the characters are terribly crafted and made.

I mean, after all, it is essentially just a treasure hunt, which is pretty exciting, but something that isn't too uncommon.

I know some people say One Piece's art is just horrendous, but personally, I just think that those individuals aren't very open minded, and that, in fact, One Piece's art is actually quite unique, and unlike many others. So the quality...of the art just lies in personal opinion I think.Sound:One Piece has some of the greatest music and sounds in all of anime. This movie lives up to the reputation. Simple as that.Character:If you're a One Piece fan I'm sure you'd agree that the series's cast is just phenomenal. But this is about the movie. So, putting the main characters aside, this movie features a style of One Piece characters that make it the great show it is. An old baasan who's like 2 feet tall that's stuck in a treasure chest, a foolish, yet apparently genius, central enemy who is destined to rule the world, and two of his loyal henchmen who sport afros and mohawk things.

"", 'One Piece Movie 7: Karakurijou no Mecha Kyohei ReviewStory (5/10) AverageMore Specifically (5.50/10) Average+The story for the 7th movie is weirdly average it started off weird and random and the for entire movie it was just the Star Hat Crew messing around on this Island trying to figure out if there is a treasure that exist on this Island. It\'s really empty when it comes to substance and it is what it is and it is average it had a couple cool scenes and I\'ll some credit to them and talk about them later but yeah it\'s an average movie story but this is is...indeed a little less on the substance when it comes it.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodThe art style and animation was good, still not movie quality because as far as my research tells me these movie were still coming out annually so as far as seeing something we have never seen before it\'s still not quite present. The coolest thing animation wise was at the very end of the movie when Luffy did that spinning kick move cutting through the mechanical device on top of the turtle, but other than that everything was was just good and reasonable. Oh and another thing why was there so much focus on Nami\'s breast in the movie? I decided to count how many times the animators went out of their way to make her tits jiggle just for the sake of jiggling and capped at 12 times. Yeah it\'s nice but it was indeed random because yeah we do see it in the actual anime but honestly it\'s rare. The most we get are just camera angles of her body (which they did in this movie also) but man like I said it felt like it was borderline Fairy Tail level and it\'s also weird they did it for Nami anytime she moved but not once for Robin who\'s body is basically identical to hers. No clue I guess the animators had a thing for Nami this time around.Sound (7/10) GoodSound was good nothing amazing nothing horrible.Characters (7/10) GoodThe Straw Hat Crew was present for majority of the movie doing their thing nothing too entertaining this time around just same old crew (I\'m ready for Franky and Brook honestly).Enjoyment (6/10) FineMy enjoyment for the movie was fair. It didn\'t feel like the movie really go anywhere. Honestly it just felt unnecessary nothing except the ending felt like it was worth keeping my eyes open because I was indeed dozing off by the time the movie reached the hour mark.Overall (6/10) FineMore Specifically (6.50/10) Fine+I thought with this movie having some sort of ""Mech"" theme going on that I would see something rather cool (like Franky cool) but nothing really worth it in this movie honestly the Straw Hat Crew destroy them with ease and even though the movie should have been over in a flash since the enemies could give them a decent challenge with dragged on for and hour and a half can\'t give this one a 7 but I do think this movie is around the 6 status. indeed a little less on the substance when it comes it.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodThe art style and animation was good, still not movie quality because as far as my research tells me these movie were still coming out annually so as far as seeing something we have never seen before it\'s still not quite present.

But I just really wasn't feeling this one.It, like, set a new standard for movie plots that just drop you into the middle of things, which I've never been a fan of. And a lot of the rest of it just fell flat. It went in for a lot of jokes that weren't particularly funny. I'm not sure how to describe it other than it felt like the writers took a few of each character's basic, wacky personality traits and cranked them up to eleven. Nami was...particularly rough in this regard. Even apart from the fact that someone on the animation team was apparently really into the Nami fanservice... This movie had to break some sort of record for the number of times she smacks around her own crew mates. And it's not like that never happens in the show, when they're being particularly rowdy, but it was really over the top here. And that pretty much sums up the portrayal of all the characters in this movie. Like the writers were given bullet point notes on who they all were but maybe weren't super familiar with them themselves.And the story itself was just really basic and kind of dumb. The villains were too obvious and just about impossible to take seriously. The mecha island promised in the title should have allowed for a really cool setting, but the mecha creations weren't even what really shined in that aspect. I felt nothing for anyone over the whole course of the movie. It's actually got a pretty decent score on here, so there must be fans who liked it.

It is also the first movie that is not dedicated to a crew member, despite the fact it could have easily be about Franky with all the robot scenes. I guess he was still not added to the crew because of the anime being so unbearably slow. For the same reason, the movie is about nothing in specific. It has no theme, no tension, no message, it is as hollow as a Bleach villain. Seriously, you watch this thing and you wonder what’s the point.So ok, it is a filler...mission but it should still make you feel like the story matters enough for you to care about. Yet it doesn’t since you are given no reason to care. There is this treasure they are looking for, and this song that hints its place, and there is this king with weird contraptions and… that’s all of it. How incredibly boring! Where is the drama, the tension, the imposing villain, the soul crushing moment or realization?To be honest, there is a reason for making this movie, and does not regard a character but rather a special ability. It’s there for showing for the first time in a featured film Luffy’s new Gear powers. So basically you have to tolerate 70 minutes of boredom before he magically gains a new super ability to beat the big boss. And it’s not like there was no other way to beat him with all the stuff he has managed to break or deflect in all the previous episodes or movies. Did he really need superhuman strength to beat a mook robot? So not even that is important plot wise and it’s just something they added to make Luffy look like he trained at Kaio’s place and learned Kaio Ken out of screen. BOORING!There are other things bad in here as well. First of all for some reason Chopper’s voice actress was replaced by someone else. Not a big issue since everybody was completely useless to the plot but WHY the change? Couldn’t they wait for her to come back from whatever issues she had? And then there is Nami’s boobs. They kept getting bigger in the show but it is this movie that makes them bounce like they are sentient. Seriously, they bounce a lot to the point it is making he to look like a slut. Was that supposed to distract the viewer from the boring plot? How distasteful!A completely boring movie I do not recommend to anyone.

The story is typical of a filler chapter for those times when the anime reaches the manga. The art is the average of One Piece at the time, although I think there are several examples of a drawing worse than the serie. The original characters are pretty bad and ridiculous, there is nothing appealing of them. The most memorable one is an animal lol. And on top of that, to make the...whole movie even more annoying, there is a special focus on Robin and Nami, especially Nami, to sexualize them for no reason. There are scenes and animations that are irrelevant and that are unique and exclusively fanservice for the public, a fanservice that is not so excessive in other movies or in the series. In summary, I give it a 3 because I laughed watching it at double speed, but it is not something that I recommend seeing in itself. whole movie even more annoying, there is a special focus on Robin and Nami, especially Nami, to sexualize them for no reason.

While most of the One Piece films have been hit or miss, I feel like this one was the most pathetic. Like a half empty bag of chips. Bland Junk Food.Story: The story is relatively simple, though I don\'t think it is necessarily worse than any of the previous movies. I don\'t actually have much to complain about in terms of concept. It gets the job done, but nothing more. There were plenty of questionable aspects to the whole thing. It\'s riddled with plot holes, making it sort...of weird to watch.Art: This is probably the worst looking One Piece film. I know the anime was struggling in terms of pacing at this time, and it shows bright as day here. The animation was really rough throughout most of the film, utilizing a lot of noticeable shortcuts. The most animated things here were Nami\'s breasts, shaking in just the most uncomfortable and awkward way possible. The artwork is also a complete mess, half the time resulting in off model and sloppy characters. The blatant and unnecessary CGI looked terrible and made me laugh at scenes I clearly wasn\'t supposed to.I know I shouldn\'t let a Mamoru Hosuda film set my standard for future films. But One Piece Movie 6 set the bar so high in terms of visual quality, anything less would naturally leave me disappointing. In comparison, this film may actually be the worst looking of them all. Films 1, 2, and 3 were much shorter and a lot more conservative in terms of visual spectacle, so they don\'t flop nearly as badly. Movie 5 still looks bad, but at least it had some interesting uses of lighting and colour in places.Characters: This film\'s alternate title is ""Nami beats up Luffy the whole time as he figures everything out through happenstance."" Luffy is slightly out of character for most of the film, doing things that seem like him on the surface, but end up not feeling nearly as natural as they should. The other Straw Hats fare better in general, though Nami is very much on edge for most of the movie. The villain is a complete joke, although the film acknowledges this and uses it as part of the joke. This doesn\'t really change the fact that he is completely not intimidating. You can\'t just set up how stupid someone is just to try and make me care about an emotional climax. I don\'t believe the fact that the Straw Hats should have struggled with any of this. Any problems that arose were products of negligence.Conclusion: In the end, this film falls on it\'s face and fails hard. It\'s boring, stupid, and ugly. While I don\'t think it\'s necessarily my least favorite One Piece film (that title going to films 5, 3, and 1 in descending order) it\'s probably the most pathetic. I feel very little towards it aside from mild annoyance and the conviction to never waste my time with it again. of weird to watch.Art: This is probably the worst looking One Piece film.

Movie 5 still looks bad, but at least it had some interesting uses of lighting and colour in places.Characters: This film\'s alternate title is ""Nami beats up Luffy the whole time as he figures everything out through happenstance."" Luffy is slightly out of character for most of the film, doing things that seem like him on the surface, but end up not feeling nearly as natural as they should. The other Straw Hats fare better in general, though Nami is very much on edge for most of the movie. The villain is a complete joke, although the film acknowledges this and uses it as part of the joke. This doesn\'t really change the fact that he is completely not intimidating. You can\'t just set up how stupid someone is just to try and make me care about an emotional climax. I don\'t believe the fact that the Straw Hats should have struggled with any of this. Any problems that arose were products of negligence.Conclusion: In the end, this film falls on it\'s face and fails hard. It\'s boring, stupid, and ugly. While I don\'t think it\'s necessarily my least favorite One Piece film (that title going to films 5, 3, and 1 in descending order) it\'s probably the most pathetic. I feel very little towards it aside from mild annoyance and the conviction to never waste my time with it again.', ""Given how rich and detailed the world of One Piece is, it is actually impressive how bland and uninteresting this film is. The plot is a nothing fluff piece, the villains have no identity or sense of purpose, and there isn't a single theme to be found. The movie does not even try and compensate with cool action scenes or great character animations. The movie is ugly as sin for the most part, and it is difficult to tell if it worse in motion or in stills.Movie 7 is famous for two things, Luffy accidentally discovering Gear 2 and the boobs. On the first count...it undermines what makes Luffy special as instead of him critically thinking about his power and what it could do as is implied in canon he just looks into one of the more unique power ups in the series. For the second, it is so far past attractive to be repulsive. It is almost impossible to take Nami or Robin seriously when their boobs flip out at every opportunity. OP has been criticized for its character designs, and much of that is fair, and this represents one of the lowest points of the story. This quality of character art and animation is unforgivable in a feature length production.There is no reason to watch this.Strong 2 it undermines what makes Luffy special as instead of him critically thinking about his power and what it could do as is implied in canon he just looks into one of the more unique power ups in the series.

It is the first movie that is not dedicated to a crew member, despite the fact it is heavy on machinery and could have easily been about Franky. He was still not officially part of the crew at the time and the unbearably slow anime wasn’t helping. As a result the movie is about nothing in specific. Without a character to focus on it has no real theme or message. And no, being a filler story is not an excuse.The plot is about a treasure they are looking for, and...there’s this song that hints its place, and there’s also this king with weird contraptions and… that’s all of it. How does any of that connect to the show or the crew or the themes? I mean, sure, it’s the first film featuring Luffy’s new Gear powers, but that is just what he can do at that moment in the story. It doesn’t mean anything for the character, the same way Super Saiyan 3 didn’t mean anything for Goku in any movie. You just tolerate 70 minutes of boredom until the protagonist gains a new super ability to beat the big boss. It’s not like there was no other way to beat him with all the stuff he has managed to break or deflect in all the previous episodes and movies. Did he really need superhuman strength to beat a mook robot? Thus not even this fan service moment is important.The only other point of notice is Nami’s boobs. They kept getting bigger with each passing season and now they bounce so much they have a life of their own. That is how you are supposed to be distracted from the boring plot. Distasteful! A completely boring movie I do not recommend to anyone. there’s this song that hints its place, and there’s also this king with weird contraptions and… that’s all of it.

One Piece: Episode of Alabasta - Prologue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28683/One_Piece__Episode_of_Alabasta_-_Prologue,"[""Alabasta, one of the most loved arcs of One Piece, and I'm sure many of us watched or at least know of the movie of that arc where they recap what happened in a short one-hour animation, One Piece: Episode of Alabasta - Prologue is as its title suggests, a prologue to the movie where they cover up the events of Whisky Peak ignoring the rest of the arcs leading up to Alabasta (Little garden and Drum island).Surprisingly, this one stands out as a really solid 15 minutes recap, with beautiful animation, the highlight was, of course, Zoro and Luffy's dual.However, abut downgrade was Vivi's...character design, the rest of the characters still felt the same, only with an upgraded quality of animation, but the case of Vivi was totally different, it's it a whole other character impersonating her, you could tell from looking at her face, she had that special uncanny look at her that makes you rather uncomfortable, she looked okay before, I wonder what made them redesign her.One other thing was her clothing, it matches the Manga. As some of you might not know, in the Manga, Vivi wore a shirt of different pattern that had explicit circles that exploits some sexuality, so they had to change that on the original Anime adaptation, but it seems they didn't bother with that here and had her wear that questionable shirt instead. And talking about sexuality, all the females look to have gained a cup size upgrade to an overwhelming extent. character design, the rest of the characters still felt the same, only with an upgraded quality of animation, but the case of Vivi was totally different, it's it a whole other character impersonating her, you could tell from looking at her face, she had that special uncanny look at her that makes you rather uncomfortable, she looked okay before, I wonder what made them redesign her.One other thing was her clothing, it matches the Manga.

It was fine but ALL of the fun moments were not included (yeah probably to make the movie shorter, should have include some parts atleast) and most of the parts were shortcut. This one so far is my least fave movie in One Piece. I guess I expected too much in this recap. All in all, I had to say that this arc is one of the best!but I just don't get it why some people just didn't like this Arc. It was one...of the legendary arcs out there. Noland and Kalgara's story was heartbreaking. It was the best. Luffy bell the rang, proving to Cricket that the Sky has been in the sky all along. I FELT GOOSEBUMPS and I will never get tired of that moment.

Look, I wasn't a huge fan of the Skypiea arc to begin with, but this 'Episode of:' was just terrible and god-awful boring. I could only sit through half of it before giving up.Condensing an arc THAT big into such a limited time can be difficult, so I understand needing to be a bit choppy, but this was over the top. Watching this felt less like watching a story/arc, and more like looking at a check list of things that happened. That is completely boring to watch, and...seems kind of pointless even bothering to make this if its impossible to get any kind of entertainment out of it since all you're getting are the facts. It was incredibly choppy covering main events (which were therefore not well explained, some points not being explained at all, it was like getting the answer to a mystery no one told me about), and therefore the narrative was all over the place.Time management was shoddy, they spent a long time focusing on the background of the current story, and therefore didn't have enough time to adapt the actual CURRENT story. Furthermore, they didn't even bother to animate the entire background scene- they literally just took a huge clip from the original anime and put it in, again making me wonder what the point of making this was.Look, if you've seen/read One Piece and you enjoy watching these reanimation stuff, dont bother watching this. There is absolutely no entertainment value, they didn't even keep in the best parts of the arc- the jokes. Recaps can still be entertaining; this one really wasn't. And if you haven't seen One Piece before- or you currently are and just wanted to skip all the episodes for the Skypiea arc (its an essential arc so I wouldn't skip it anyway), just go read a synopsis of what happens in it- you get the same exact amount of information without having to sit through a near 2 hour long 'Episode of:'.Tl;Dr: There is no story, only an animated list. Art half the time was old animation. Sounds are the usual old music. There were no time for characters to be themselves. Got absolutely no enjoyment from it seeing as they purposely took out anything that can be enjoyed from it (it even lacks a sense of nostalgia). Overall, you'll get more from reading a wiki page of this arc than you will from this. seems kind of pointless even bothering to make this if its impossible to get any kind of entertainment out of it since all you're getting are the facts.

Hearing a new recap movie on the horizon got me skeptical as usual. Recap movies don't always work out well. And I was right.But this movie actually surprised me somewhat. Watching some of the scenes, I couldn't help get this craving to rewatch One Piece. the scenes they did include were phenomenal. The animation was well done, and the music stayed true to the old One Piece. I felt like a kid a again every now and then.But the rest of the...time, I was just confused. It really felt like the story was exponentially shorter than I can recall. They just removed so many of the iconic moments that made this arc so great. I mean, barely any of the crew had any growth, or proper fights.So they got the wonder. But none of the suspense was there. This movie just reminded me of a time way back, when the Straw Hats weren't as unstoppable as they'd one day be. I mean pre-haki, where they were basically just fodder for even what we today consider mid-tier. This movie made it felt like Skypeia was a literal breeze to them. Take the ship, go to the cloud, beat a god and sail along merrily. Sure, that's basically what happened in the series , but it wasn't nearly as easy then.In short, this reminded me of the adventures I so dearly miss years ago, but just left me craving for more then a simple drop of the ocean.Overall, I give it a 6. time, I was just confused.

The only fights they even adapted somewhat fully were:- Luffy\'s Group VS Satori- Ganfall/Wiper VS Shura- Luffy VS EnelThe rest were just either images in a montage or the very end of the fights, like:- Luffy VS Wiper- Enel VS Kamakiri- Chopper VS Gedatsu- Zoro VS Ohm (Though this got a bit of the beginning for...context)So If you wanted to watch this 1 Hour 45 minute special for the fights I recommend just waiting for Youtube clips.- Only the key elements of Jaya (Mainly the exposition) are added to I think the first 20 minutes or so, so we really only get to meet Cricket, the Saruyama Brothers barely even speak. So no, Mock ---Town, No BB (In Jaya at least), no Bounties, no South Bird, just ship falls, meet Cricket, learn about Sky Island/Knock Up Stream, and ride the current into the Sky.- The crew is barely in the White Sea for long, and they changed it to Enel sensing them with Mantra instead of the the gate with Amazon. Because of this, we meet Ganfall relaxing on a Beach while the Waver they found in the shipwreck is just one Conis rides.- The almighty Pagaya (Conis\' Father) does not appear at all, so he doesn\'t die, so, I guess that\'s a plus?- The Monster Trio still fight the sky fish, just the fish were chasing Conis not the Merry.- Instead of the Trials, Enel sends Satori to fight the ""invaders"" on the beach, where Chopper and Suu are kidnapped by a lobster with the merry and become the sacrifice.- Because of this, Zoro and Robin with Conis have to take a random Dial Boat (Explained by having Luffy send Zoro to protect them) while Nami takes the Waver Conis left. This is weird because Usopp just stays with Luffy and Sanji and does nothing, without the reasoning of being stuck in the forest like the original.- Also, Ganfall never gives out a whistle, so instead of the iconic whistle scene with Chopper, Ganfall just hears our reindeer friend yell very loudly in pain.- Instead of having the Noland Flashback in one go like the original, they split up about three times. -Also, they did NOT reanimate the Noland Flashback, they just cleaned up the original and made it fit to the new aspect ratio, so a majority of this special is stock footage from 2 episodes.- Shandians are just there really, they only one of importance here is Wiper. Aisa is barely in this and doesn\'t even venture to Upper Yard since Conis is already there.- Because of the changes, so many inconsistencies.- Enel VS the Five Survivors is trimmed, but the important bits are there I guess.- Enel Face is on point.- The biggest crime of this special, No Usopp Spell.- Sanji get\'s his sacrifice scene reanimated, looks pretty good.- Though fast, the ascension of Giant Jack is good, it\'s nice to have that and Luffy\'s fireworks and golden rifle in one big scene.- Special ends with Luffy\'s final blow on Enel, Cricket sees the shadow, Ganfall and the Shandian Chief say the war is over, and Luffy and Nami sitting on the cloud after Enel\'s defeat. I mean, you didn\'t even include the giant party or even the Merry falling from the sky, like come on?- They added Ace VS BB to the end credits for some reason, looks good, just randomly there.- They threw in the animation from Namie Amuro\'s tour for when she sang Hope as well in the credits, which is pretty nice.- Soundtrack was nice, filled with the classics, but there might have been one new one for Luffy\'s fight with Enel.Overall, I wouldn\'t say the special is bad persay, there\'s is just no substance whatsoever. I mean, if you were going to adapt Skypiea as a Special this isn\'t the worst thing they could have done, but it\'s not the best either. Like Episode of East Blue, this is not a substitute for the original Arc in the Anime and is more like a way to experience key moments with the modern animation. There is only one positive from this special, from the lack of fights and the heavy use of stock footage I can tell that Toei is not going to shit on the Luffy VS Katakuri fight since it seems pretty obvious they\'re saving their best animators for that and needed to cobble together something for the yearly requirement of an OP Special.Final rating: Just go rewatch the Skypiea Arc because I know some of you skipped it, trust me, the Skypiea Saga is good and this special doesn\'t really do it justice. context)So If you wanted to watch this 1 Hour 45 minute special for the fights I recommend just waiting for Youtube clips.- Only the key elements of Jaya (Mainly the exposition) are added to I think the first 20 minutes or so, so we really only get to meet Cricket, the Saruyama Brothers barely even speak.

You are mistaken. It will ruin your experience. Let it be a newbie this isn't even fair for someone like me who is following this series since it's inception.It never builds up anything, just straight up bad cuts, no character introduction, random characters pop out of nowhere and just jerk some tears up on screen.When I first watched Skypiea arc, it was scary for the fact the main boss kicks ass and weird mantra power was a surprise. I was scared that Luffy will eat dirt this time.This 'Episode of...Sorajima' should have been atleast 4-5 hours long to do justice to actual story telling of the series. Sorajima' should have been atleast 4-5 hours long to do justice to actual story telling of the series."", ""One common running theme with Toei Animations is that you will never get a 100% satisfying adaptation that does the source material justice, well, there are some very few occasions where that doesn't apply, like the recent 3 movies and some of the major episodes of the show, but unfortunately One Piece: Episode of Sorajima could not level up to those exceptions. Talking about One Piece, we all have come to know that the anime adaptation gets its share of weekly beat up from the studio, the Manga and Anime are like night and day, two sides of the same coin that's one is way...below the other in terms of quality. Not even the original adaptation of the Skypea arc from the anime from way back had managed to live up to the viewers' expectations and was infamously regarded by a great number of fans to be one of the worst arcs in term of pacing. But at least, this special does leave you appreciating how faithful the anime was to the source material when the Skypea arc was first animated.- Story (6/10):We all know what the arc was about, so spare the lengthy introduction.We all know Skypea was prequel'd by the beloved mini-arc Jaya, they just had to skip through 95% of it to rush into the sky island stuff, which is understandable enough, for instance, there are no light spots on either Teach or Bellamy, and let's, of course, no forget the two Monkey brothers that were affiliated with Montblanc Cricket, they were included on some still images though, but never were given any proper introduction. Not just that, but also many rememberable things were skipped liked the classic Zoro Tarazan screen (classic), and the scene where Wiper destroyed Enel with a reject Dial to only restart his heart and come back from the dead, we never got introduced to how the Skypeans live and how things are being ruled over up in the sky. Things like Ganfall meeting the straw hat and Satori fighting Luffy, Sanji and Ussop were changed entirely.Everything felt very out of place and in the wrong chronological order, sometimes you're put into a flashback, and then immediately skip a lot of (important) content to only find yourself following some of the major battles which almost all were only still images, that looked lazy, cheap, and more than anything else, disgraceful.One of the greatest flashbacks of One Piece, the one that tells the story of Noland the lier, for me, it was the greatest thing and the most interesting part of Skypea, also, the most one packed with emotions, but here, it was just, why even bother. The storytelling was just a bunch of rushed conflicted nonsense being juxtaposed, if anything, it made me appreciate the older Anime adaptation more for what it was, simple of its time, but still lives up quite strong to date, if anything, better than this ordeal.- Art (7.0/10):You'd figure that Toei Studio would put a greater effort into high budget projects like One Piece: Episode of Sorajima, but oh boy, not this time around.From the looks of it, they tried desperately to adopt the pre-time skip art style into an older part of the story and guess what, the results weren't pleasant at all. Everybody from the crew looks super weird for the most time, especially Robin, I wouldn't call that Robin to be fair, some kind of imperfect clone maybe? Imagine mixing Robin and Nami together, that what we got instead, looking at her “circular” face was totally uncomfortable.I was looking forward to seeing some of the big moments animated with an up to date animation, I think I shouldn't have had any high expectations, I knew the old stuff will always have a special charm to it, but this we got wasn't even close. At best, if not being skipped like Enel vs. Wiper, we got some lazy still images and that was that.- Sound (8.5/10):I've always enjoyed the voice acting in One Piece, now those are people doing their jobs the way they should, no slopping and no laziness. Not only that, but the majority of the old soundtracks that we rarely ever get to hear nowadays make a return, and a strong one in fact filled with nostalgia.- Character (7.0/10):I'd hate to give this any lower score because everything was rushed, caught up in an incohesive mess, no character was given enough time to “shine” so to speak. I've talked how the backstories didn't make any great impact, and for that, from a new comer's perspective, not a single one of them made the cut.- Enjoyment (5/10):Now, I a big fan of One Piece, and I'm not being biased here, to say the least. I can shove up my face any content consisting One Piece all day, that's how big of a fan I am. Yes, the special was disappointing in a big way, they cut off a lot of my favorite parts, and changed a lot of things that were perfect before, and as the people in my profession say (I am a developer); if it works don't touch it. That quote should become universal and sacred, it can rescue franchises. I had my share of laughs here, It seems the minimal remaining of humor did endure the wounds of time. Classic One Piece.- Overall (6.7/10):It all comes down to what you're expecting at the end. If you're waiting for some mind-blowing thing to happen, then don't. If you're waiting for this special to change your mind about the Skypea arc as a whole (because probably you're one of the people who didn't enjoy the arc in the first place), then it would most probably disappoint even more. But more importantly, if you're a newcomer, or a first-time watcher and still not caught up, and decided to skip the Anime arc and watch this instead as some sort of compensation, then I beg of you to not do so. This is as bad as a retelling can get, way more complicated than the Anime arc.It was not one of the best specials of the series, it would probably rank down the chest somewhere. below the other in terms of quality. Not even the original adaptation of the Skypea arc from the anime from way back had managed to live up to the viewers' expectations and was infamously regarded by a great number of fans to be one of the worst arcs in term of pacing. But at least, this special does leave you appreciating how faithful the anime was to the source material when the Skypea arc was first animated.- Story (6/10):We all know what the arc was about, so spare the lengthy introduction.We all know Skypea was prequel'd by the beloved mini-arc Jaya, they just had to skip through 95% of it to rush into the sky island stuff, which is understandable enough, for instance, there are no light spots on either Teach or Bellamy, and let's, of course, no forget the two Monkey brothers that were affiliated with Montblanc Cricket, they were included on some still images though, but never were given any proper introduction. Not just that, but also many rememberable things were skipped liked the classic Zoro Tarazan screen (classic), and the scene where Wiper destroyed Enel with a reject Dial to only restart his heart and come back from the dead, we never got introduced to how the Skypeans live and how things are being ruled over up in the sky. Things like Ganfall meeting the straw hat and Satori fighting Luffy, Sanji and Ussop were changed entirely.Everything felt very out of place and in the wrong chronological order, sometimes you're put into a flashback, and then immediately skip a lot of (important) content to only find yourself following some of the major battles which almost all were only still images, that looked lazy, cheap, and more than anything else, disgraceful.One of the greatest flashbacks of One Piece, the one that tells the story of Noland the lier, for me, it was the greatest thing and the most interesting part of Skypea, also, the most one packed with emotions, but here, it was just, why even bother. The storytelling was just a bunch of rushed conflicted nonsense being juxtaposed, if anything, it made me appreciate the older Anime adaptation more for what it was, simple of its time, but still lives up quite strong to date, if anything, better than this ordeal.- Art (7.0/10):You'd figure that Toei Studio would put a greater effort into high budget projects like One Piece: Episode of Sorajima, but oh boy, not this time around.From the looks of it, they tried desperately to adopt the pre-time skip art style into an older part of the story and guess what, the results weren't pleasant at all. Everybody from the crew looks super weird for the most time, especially Robin, I wouldn't call that Robin to be fair, some kind of imperfect clone maybe? Imagine mixing Robin and Nami together, that what we got instead, looking at her “circular” face was totally uncomfortable.I was looking forward to seeing some of the big moments animated with an up to date animation, I think I shouldn't have had any high expectations, I knew the old stuff will always have a special charm to it, but this we got wasn't even close. At best, if not being skipped like Enel vs. Wiper, we got some lazy still images and that was that.- Sound (8.5/10):I've always enjoyed the voice acting in One Piece, now those are people doing their jobs the way they should, no slopping and no laziness. Not only that, but the majority of the old soundtracks that we rarely ever get to hear nowadays make a return, and a strong one in fact filled with nostalgia.- Character (7.0/10):I'd hate to give this any lower score because everything was rushed, caught up in an incohesive mess, no character was given enough time to “shine” so to speak. I've talked how the backstories didn't make any great impact, and for that, from a new comer's perspective, not a single one of them made the cut.- Enjoyment (5/10):Now, I a big fan of One Piece, and I'm not being biased here, to say the least. I can shove up my face any content consisting One Piece all day, that's how big of a fan I am. Yes, the special was disappointing in a big way, they cut off a lot of my favorite parts, and changed a lot of things that were perfect before, and as the people in my profession say (I am a developer); if it works don't touch it. That quote should become universal and sacred, it can rescue franchises. I had my share of laughs here, It seems the minimal remaining of humor did endure the wounds of time. Classic One Piece.- Overall (6.7/10):It all comes down to what you're expecting at the end. If you're waiting for some mind-blowing thing to happen, then don't.

As from wiki ""King of Bandits Jing is a series of short, usually disconnected stories starring the young boy who calls himself Jing, the Bandit King. Although Jing\'s reputation seems to extend throughout the universe of the series, many enemies underestimate him, not expecting the ""great"" King of Bandits to be a ""little kid"".""Quite accurate, a different story each episode. I admit, a few episodes did have a bit of charm to them, and the short romances that Jing experiences in the series were somewhat cute,...but that\'s all the series gives. A light story, that allowed the creators to put little thought into the series. It can work, and I\'ve seen it work, but Jing does not pull it off in a way I found satisfactory.--Art: 6--Though art, as is most things, is down to the viewers taste, I don\'t have much complaints about it. It\'s wasn\'t great, but I was happy with it. I\'ll leave it at that.--Sound: 5--I found the music, the opening especially, to be very standard. Nothing stuck out all that well to me, and I was happy to skip it while watching. Overall, I don\'t particularly remember any of the music, nor am I bothered by this.--Character: 3--I actually found the characters really boring, Jing was a \'cool\' young dude who didn\'t say much, somewhat carefree even. But nothing original really made me interested in his character. As for that stupid bird that followed him, all I could think of was that annoying parrot from \'Aladdin\'. Minor characters that Jing ran into in the series did have a bit of appeal, but again, nothing really interested me or stuck out as original. I didn\'t even find them to be well done cliche\'s.--Enjoyment: 3--Some episodes entertained me, strangely enough one would be the episode with the Ghost Ship. I have been complaining about cliche\'s but sometimes they can appeal. A little, anyway.--Overall: 4--Each episode left me with a feeling of disappointment, and sometimes confusion. I had no idea where the series was headed, and the \'ending\' if you call it that was completely unimpressive. If you want a light-hearted series that doesn\'t demand much attention, however, then perhaps you should try it out. I\'d imagine it may also very suitable for younger viewers, but it\'s nothing special. but that\'s all the series gives.

For that reason I wasn't really captivated by the anime. Starting from episode 6 though, it got alot more interesting and I started to really enjoy it. It was alot of fun to watch and the characters are totally amazing. With some difficulties at the beginning,...the anime ended up being really great and I can only recommend it. It might not be a masterpiece, but it is definitely worth watching. the anime ended up being really great and I can only recommend it.

I would recommend if you want a few short stories, which is what each episode pretty much was, but all and all it was ok.Zarroc- it was good.Tadgh: For starters, I really liked the art style, it was what attracted me to this anime in...the first place.

Verstärkt wird dieser Eindruck noch von der Hauptstory, oder besser ihrem fehlen. Zwar gibt es anspielungen auf eine teifere Handlung doch wurde viel Potenzial verschenkt indem diese Idee...nicht weiterverfolgt wurde.

I like reading and watching anything that has to do with thieves and assassins. I saw the name and decided to give it a try from the name along. I recalled seeing the Jing’s character design once in the distant past, but other than that I went in blind. I wasn’t really impressed in the beginning, nor was I particularly satisfied when the last line of credits scrolls on the final episode.Story: 4/10So I found out pretty quickly that the whole story is basically a teen with his feathery partner going through a...city to steal whatever valuable items are there; and winning the heart of some lady along the way! This happens every.single.episode.Now repetition is fine for children’s shows, and when you only see an episode about once a week or so. This is because the story doesn’t get as old as quickly. However, binge watching this show was extremely hard for me because it had the same pattern for the entire 13 episodes. The show was episodic as well, meaning that the episodes had no connection with each other, with the exception of the last 2-3 episodes, as the last heist of the series was told throughout those episodes.Needless to say I just got bored with it halfway through, and I really got no enjoyment out of it in the end. It played off the same mechanics, with a bit of comedy thrown here and drama thrown there.Art and Animation: 6/10If I could give just one word to describe the art in Ou Dorobou Jing it would have to be “outdated”. The show was released in 2002, and it clearly looks like it. This isn’t a particularly a bad thing; the style is pretty classic for a shounen of the time (and it makes me feel nostalgic). However, it’s not aging well nearly 13 years later with the rigid lineart and bright colors. The animation is nothing special either, pretty stagnant scenes throughout the show. If you are a person that is really into art and animation then this won’t give you a very great aesthetic experience.Sound: 5/10I honestly can’t remember a single moment while watching this show where I stopped and appreciated the sound quality of the show. The background music in the series was pretty forgettable; the opening was a classic mild jrock that was appropriate for the show in my opinion, which was carried over to the ending in style and essence. They both had recognizable and somewhat catchy beats, but again it was nothing impressive.As for the voice acting - I only watched the english dubbed version. 2002 was when dubs were still pretty bad (but improving) so if you watch it dubbed you’ll notice some misportrayal or underemphasis of emotion, annoying voices, and overacting. That being said I thought that it was translated well enough and the recording quality was better than some other shows that I have watched.Character: 5/10The characters were pretty bland throughout the show. Everyone in the series with the exception of Jing and Kir were only covered in one or two episodes, which didn’t allot much time to background stories. In every episode there was one girl that had her own backstory and was supposed to be the “love interest” that always ended up liking Jing by the end of the episode. These girls were basically all the same in my opinion, and I just did not care about a single one of them.Jing and Kir are the protagonists of the show, which means you would think that you would watch them grow and develop. Well you would be wrong. I will admit that there is something to a lack of backstory for a protagonist - it makes them mysterious, and we must accept Jing is a well known bandit king and take it with a grain of salt. This frees up time to show off what Jing and Kir do best: steal valuables and do it well. However, the two never grown beyond more than a quirky and comedic duo who are good at stealing. They run into mild conflict in every episode, but nothing that creates a lasting impression of Jing or Kir as characters. This left me a little disappointed.Overall: 5/10It wasn’t good, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t what I was expecting. The show felt more or less “filler” - esque and about halfway into the show I was just done with the repetitious story. There was nothing in particular that made me want to continue it other than the fact that I didn’t feel it was bad enough to drop completely. This combined with a lackluster ending left me feeling almost cheated out the time I could have spent watching something that I really would have preferred to watch. city to steal whatever valuable items are there; and winning the heart of some lady along the way!

In most animes the ova will involve the characters just messing around at home or at the beach or at the hot springs, etc. But this one actually has a story, and a fleshed out one at that. The studio also does a good job at fitting the ova in-between the two seasons, even though they made this after the second season concluded. The only drawback I found, was a few little inconsistencies with the characters' personalities, but that can almost be expected in ovas. The sound and music was just as good as the main story, so you...won't be too disappointed there. If you want to see more of Owari no Seraph after finishing the main story, this is for you, as it adds more action and a good mini-story.

So, is it good? Well, let's hop on and find out!Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThis particular episode takes place after the events of season 1 and sees Yuuichirou and friends attempt to rescue a little girl who has been kidnapped by a vampire. Here's the thing, though: the vampire took the girl, not to feed off her, but to protect her because he sees her as replacement for his dead sister. Now,...it's a race against time for Yuu and his friends to rescue the girls before the vampires can reach the traitor.Without the larger story of the first season, on its own, this OVA is actually pretty good. I know that these kinds of episodes are just one-off stories that don't hold strict continuity with the greater narrative, but that allows viewers to enjoy small adventures with the characters without having to worry about continuity. (7/8)CharactersOne of my biggest criticisms against the first season is that Yuu was too focused in his quest for revenge and he doesn't really become heroic till the second half of the season, so it's good to see that the OVA features more of the nobler and more sympathetic Yuu, instead of being a angry, revenge-driven jerk.I also enjoyed the introduction of a sympathetic vampire in the form of Shahar. Aside from Mikaela, he seems to be the only sympathetic vampire in the series. The OVA is pretty good at getting you to feel sorry for him. His vampire status damns him and his guilt of drinking his sister's blood damns him. Watching a vampire get attached to a human must have been a sobering experience for Yuu, just like watching Mikaela alive after all those years. Hopefully, this will lead towards more development for Yuu. (8/10)ArtThe visual quality was great. Everything, from the character designs to the action scenes, looked amazing. Overall, there wasn't much to screw up here. (8/10)SoundPraise should be given to the voice actors for their performances. Miyu Irino does a great job as Yuu. Also, I admit I'm not the biggest fan of Yuki Kaji, but his performance as the tragic Shahar was amazing. The supporting actors also do wonders with their material and do a fine job at bringing their characters to life. (8/10)OverallIn closing here, the OVA was great. Sure, you don't need to watch it to understand the greater story of Seraph of the End but it's still enjoyable because the lack of greater continuity allows you to enjoy it as a standalone story.

Precure All Stars Movie New Stage: Mirai no Tomodachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12221/Precure_All_Stars_Movie_New_Stage__Mirai_no_Tomodachi,"[""I know that people may hate a bit of spoilers but I guess I just warn you first that I may reveal a bit that you may not want to know.Firstly, was the story. In my point of view it was something unexpected. It was focused on a special character for the movie rather than the latest pretty cures(in this case, Smile Precure). That made the story a bit interesting cause its not that I don't like to say Pretty Cure fighting monsters and stuff, its just that I hate to keep seeing them a lot in the movies repetitively like the Pretty Cure DX...3. It seems that Toei have decided to change for something new and see how the fans would to accept it or not and how they react. Sadly as I know, many people do not seem to enjoy it and even say that Pretty Cure are getting from good to bad.I put these down to the fact that there are no speaking lines for Max Heart, Splash Star and 5 Go Go and I do agree with. It was quite a disappointment but I always look for a brighter side in every anime I've watch(to avoid biasness). In the brighter side, they change the story differently and for the first time, an old villain turn nice to that special character for the movie.And also they change the opening which I prefer. I'm starting to get sick hearing the same song at the start of every All Stars movie(but I still like it).Only the ending was something I don't like cause they use Smile Precure Ed. Should Toei have made another new Ending Song? But I pretty much like the new opening anyway.Thus I would say the overall was actually quite good to the fact they change for something new and want to see how fans like it or not(though I know many are not happy with it). But I love to see all those old group transformations for the latest 4 groups and their weapons which I miss them. (I only watch up to Heartcatch Pretty Cure by the way) So in overall I think the movie was great and scored better than the DX movies and the enjoyment was good.In conclusion, if enjoy something that are different that are usually is and also want to see Smile Precure in action(if you haven't watch the series yet), then you better watch this one then. If you a hater that have watched this anime /movie or someone who like to see the old precures and fighting, don't watch this one which I highly recommended for this group of people. I'm trying to be fair in both ways so that many people can be at an advantage from this review. 3. It seems that Toei have decided to change for something new and see how the fans would to accept it or not and how they react. Sadly as I know, many people do not seem to enjoy it and even say that Pretty Cure are getting from good to bad.I put these down to the fact that there are no speaking lines for Max Heart, Splash Star and 5 Go Go and I do agree with. It was quite a disappointment but I always look for a brighter side in every anime I've watch(to avoid biasness).

I just watched this one yesterday and I thought that this Pretty Cure All Stars New Stage wasn't all that good.Though, like always, the art of this movie is really good so I'll give it a 10, no mistakes or mess-ups.The story was alright. It was touching too so I'll give it a 7 because it's also kinda like too cliche. At least, for me.For sound, it was all right. Though I've heard things about the sound not matching the subs or was it because of the...site I was watching it from. I looked and it looked like it didn't match the characters speaking. So I'll have to give it a 6 at that.CHARACTER. This is the part that got me disappointed about this movie. It's good that Smile Precure made their appearance in this movie, but it was all about them as well as Suite Precure and Ayumi. The Veteran Precure made an appearance, but they didn't even get to meet the Smile Precure. All they pretty much were were cameos. Except Heartcatch and Fresh who met Smile and Ayumi, the main protagonist of the movie. Speaking of Ayumi, she turns into a Cure named Cure Echo which barely did anything. She didn't fight or anything, she just talked to her friend named Fu-chan (Fusion) then turned back to her normal form. I expected to see a lot of fighting scenes in this movie as well as all the Cures getting all together like the other All Star movies and turning to their Super forms from the cheering and unleash some huge attack. All of this is why I'll give it a 6.As for enjoyment, it was good movie. I'll give it an 8.Overall, I'll give this movie an 8. It has flaws in it, but it's very cute and very good! site I was watching it from. I looked and it looked like it didn't match the characters speaking. So I'll have to give it a 6 at that.CHARACTER.

The only crossovers I\'ve ever seen are the Fairly Oddparents and Jimmy Neutron crossovers called the Jimmy Timmy Power Hours. I have some memories of them, but I don\'t have any interest in watching them again. Speaking of crossovers, Toei LOVES to do these with the Pretty Cure franchise, and has been doing it since 2009, when Fresh Pretty Cure was first made. While it is fun to see characters from other related series interact, Toei\'s had a habit of making these movies more about milking it\'s cash cow, selling...toys, and catering to children rather than making the crossovers actually mean something. I will admit, I haven\'t seen the All Star movies 1 through 3, though I hear they\'re pretty bad, so I won\'t watch them. However, my interest became piqued when I read about the story for a new series of Precure All Stars movies, the New Stage, the first movie having a completely movie original character as a main character, even moreso when I learned the girl is shy, moved to a new town, makes a new friend who happens to be the movie\'s villain, and other issues normal people like her can relate to. Out of curiosity, I downloaded the movie and watched it all the way through. I expected nothing but a really bad, choppy, cheesy story put together for the purpose of selling toys. What I got was...entirely different.One day, a strange, gooey, Silver Surfer-esque dinosaur version of Godzilla called Fusion attacks the city. The Pretty Cure from all generations (from the first series to Smile. This movie was made in 2012, as Smile was airing) manage to defeat it, but because it\'s a liquid monster, it leaves spawns all over the place in order to regenerate when it has enough strength. A young girl, Ayumi Sakagami, sees the footage on the news and is inspired by the Pretty Cure, but she\'s new in town, shy, and unable to make friends. One day, she helps a little yellow blob on the street. It warms up to her and she names it Fu-chan. The grow extremely close and become the best of friends. But what Ayumi doesn\'t know is that Fu-chan is actually one of Fusion\'s spawns, and the girls from Smile and Suite Precure take notice when Fu-chan begins eating everything Ayumi claims to hate, including the entire city. When she finds out what Fu-chan has been doing, she\'s horrified and wants to tell Fu-chan to stop whatever he\'s doing. But she\'s just a normal girl with no powers like the Pretty Cure do.Movies tend to typically have better animation than their respective TV series, and New Stage: Mirai no Tomodachi is no different. While the animation did look a little clunky at times, I think they did a rather good job at animating the fight choreography and hand-to-hand combat, and it remains fluid even during the normal, every day scenes. It does, however, lose points for reusing transformation sequences from the show, which most movies based on magical girl anime or giant robot anime tend to do anyway. The soundtrack, while nice, didn\'t really leave an impression on me except for the opening theme song, Eien no Tomodachi (Friends Forever or Eternal Friends) which is surprisingly good! It\'s very rock based and not overly saccharine or J-Poppy like other magical girl anime songs tend to be (like the G3 My Little Pony theme songs). It\'s the kind of song that makes you want to get up and go, and puts you in a very energetic mood. But other times the soundtrack reused tracks from other series during the transformation and final attack scenes (and from what I hear, Precure itself has a notorious reputation for reusing music pieces from other series for some reason).The main problem with the Pretty Cure All Stars movies is that they always have to make EVERY SINGLE PRETTY CURE FROM EVERY SINGLE SERIES appear, often at the expense of making certain teams have absolutely no speaking lines or roles other than plain reinforcement or back up, which both wastes animation and serves no overall purpose than to move the plot forward. I learned in fiction writing class that you cannot create characters just for moving the plot forward. That\'s not a good way to treat characters. Not only that, the other problem with the All Stars movies are that there\'s just so many characters that they just aren\'t able to fully utilize them all, only focusing on certain characters (in this case, the Smile and Suite Precures). Sometimes a huge cast of characters can work, but other times it really drags a medium down if done wrong, especially in a movie, where character development is already limited by an hour and a half time duration, and you just cannot devote that kind of time to developing 28 Pretty Cures. Really, Toei needs to quit with these crossovers, especially since lately they\'ve been giving older characters the shaft in terms of screen time and attention, but then again, even if they did get more screen time, it still wouldn\'t save this movie.However, Mirai no Tomodachi does have some saving graces, though, and I think I\'ll get lynched when I say this, but I\'m going to say it anyway: One of those saving graces is Ayumi. She\'s pretty much the main character in the movie, and I really like her, as I can relate to her situation quite a bit. She\'s moved to a new town because of her father\'s job, she\'s shy, and has trouble making friends. I\'m pretty much in the same situation right now. I thought she had a lot of character and development in here, and I loved her chemistry with Fu-chan. While a little bit bland and nothing noteworthy, she\'s a fairly realistic character with down to earth problems people can relate to. Two more saving graces are the villain and the story. The story is simple this time around, and it\'s all the better for it. It\'s less about killing a bad guy, and much more about friendship, the benefits of just talking to someone instead of beating around the bush, and how important it is to clear up misunderstandings between friends. I really like a story like that, and I thought it was done really well here despite the occasional cheese. The villain is also very simple, but far from your typical cliche anime villain, though I would have liked to learn more about his past and why he attacked the city in the first place. This is a major step up from the previous All Star movies (granted, I haven\'t seen them, nor do I plan to).Unfortunately, it\'s not a perfect movie, as it\'s still riddled with problems, the most egregious being a big, blatant Deus Ex Machina that comes absolutely out of nowhere for no reason other than to move the plot and make Ayumi ""special."" The explanation for it was rather flimsy, too. Honestly, I think the whole movie would be better off if it WASN\'T a crossover movie featuring every single Pretty Cure out there. If you\'re going to use Pretty Cures just as plot moving devices and treat them as reinforcement, then I think the movie would be much better off if it just cut the rest of the Pretty Cures out completely except for the Smile Precures and spend MORE time on Ayumi. That way, the animators could use the budget and storytelling potential to improve on it and use whatever potential the movie didn\'t use in the end. Why bother throwing in Precures in the first place if you aren\'t even going to give them speaking lines or utilize them properly?! I\'ve heard complaints about the movie, the most ridiculous being that Ayumi got too much screen time. In my opinion, the movie would have been a lot better had it been just about Ayumi, and not a massive crossover made to pander to children and sell toys. The creators could have made this into a very nice movie and developed her into a more interesting character.But, for what it\'s worth, I do appreciate this movie for trying, and for actually trying to put in an effort to make this movie into more than just a giant toy commercial. It played it safe and it\'s riddled with problems, I admit, but I like it for what it is. It\'s nothing groundbreaking or anything, nor is it the best movie ever, but I like it\'s themes and message, and it actually does attempt to deal with some subdued, realistic drama rather than just killing another bad guy. I really wish people would give Ayumi some slack, though. You should all be happy she isn\'t really annoying like Chibiusa from Sailor Moon or Tagiru from Digimon Xros Wars: Time Traveling Hunter Boys!All in all, while still a big cash grab, it\'s a cute movie that\'s good for a bit of light entertainment. toys, and catering to children rather than making the crossovers actually mean something.

By this I mean that there's a slight  improvement comparing to...the anime standards. I also enjoyed the voice acting. the anime standards. I also enjoyed the voice acting."", 'Mirai no Tomodachi is done. And it\'s very weird and feels off for a few reasons. These reasons don\'t exact hurt the movie on their own, but when combined into a single period of just over an hour, they become problematic. For starters, the movie\'s main focus is not on any Cure strictly speaking, but rather a normal human named Ayumi takes center stage; add to this a somewhat blank personality and a bad moral, and it\'s not great. The movie\'s worst offense however, is that the entirety of the cast is placed in minor roles and, excluding a brief appearance at the beginning, almost...the entirety of the Cure teams are completely absent. A lot of them don\'t even get major speaking roles. The only Cure teams present with big roles are Suite\'s, Smile\'s, and Heartcatch for about half the movie. And this...isn\'t looking great. Let\'s get into it.To start the movie, Fusion (the main villain from the Precure All Stars DX movie, the wiki tells me; he\'s a combination of Zakenna, Uzaina, Hoshina, and Kowaina, the monsters of the day from the first four seasons) has somehow reformed and attacks the city, though the Precure, all standing as silhouettes on a ferris wheel for some reason, defeat him instantly, and rather cheaply, it\'s simply part of the opening theme animation. Anyway, they didn\'t do such a great job after all, and globby little Fusion-bits fall across the entire town, with one of them getting into a fairy tea party or something..? Anyway, Ayumi has moved into the neighborhood and is basically every ""new kid in town ever;"" she doesn\'t want to see her new school, she hates where she lives, she can\'t relate to anyone, she\'s lonely, she has no friends, blah blah blah. On her way home from school, she spots a Fusion bit and mistakes it for a bug squirming under a leaf and rescues it. To be honest, I find it hard to believe that ANYONE, let alone a 14-year-old girl, would see a yellow squishy blob under a leaf, and think to themselves: ""Hmm, it\'s probably a bug that\'s stuck. I\'ll save it and let it crawl/slide onto my shoulder, name it Fuu, and make it my friend."" But that\'s exactly what Ayumi does. ...If Ayumi was FIVE YEARS OLD and not a middle schooler (her friends said they\'re as old as the Precure roughly. That means Ayumi is about 14) this would be reasonable. Just to establish the plot, the Suite and Smile teams know Fusion survived for some reason and both run into Ayumi and literally chase her halfway across town to apologize for bumping into her. I get that they want the girls to look super generous and outgoing, but this is ridiculous. Hibiki and Miyuki come off as if they\'re stalking Ayumi, with her terrified reactions and attempts to flee. (Continued in new message)So Ayumi takes ""Fuu-chan"" home and these scenes aren\'t exactly in this order, but it\'s easier for me to put them like this in two separate storylines. Ayumi ends up needing to ""teach"" Fuu-chan stuff such as how small it is and how to get bigger by eating. Um....no comment, but it\'s pretty obvious even watching this for the first time that things are going to spiral out of control. Things reach a point when Ayumi\'s mom scolds her for playing her game too long, and Ayumi completely overreacts, running out the door crying that she hates her mom. Not only that, she claims that she wants the entire city to disappear. Ayumi acted so selfish and spoiled in this movie that it really pissed me off and I honestly hated her parts. With the Cures, all that really happens is Suite and Smile teams meet each other and fight Fusion. ...Horribly. Despite learning quickly in the fight that Fusion can not only combine with other Fusion globs, but that it can also directly absorb their attacks, they continue to attack regardless. Eventually the Cures confront Ayumi, who once again becomes dramatic, running away with Fuu-chan and refusing to let the Cures touch him. MORE AGGRAVATION. This thing TRIED TO KILL PEOPLE and wants to LEVEL THE ENTIRE CITY. How are we supposed to feel ANY SYMPATHY. He was even the main antagonist in a PREVIOUS MOVIE. Because of Ayumi\'s selfish desires, Fuu-chan becomes evil again and tries to destroy everything, like ya do. Ayumi realizes her mistake and decides to confess her open feelings to Fuu-cha-I\'m going to call it Fusion. Along the way, the other Cures are finally bothered to show up, thanks to the summoning Miracle Lights. (was there really no better use for them?) They hold off the Fusion globs so Ayumi can get to plot-relevant Fusion blob.Oh no though, Ayumi is captured (YAY!) Although in the most aggravating part of the entire movie, she BECOMES A CURE (which she happened to have a desire to become earlier.) This particularly annoyed me because I don\'t think a selfish girl like her who\'s overdramatic about everything should be a Cure; it makes as much sense as letting Milk be a Cure. Anyway, now Cure Echo, she has a heart-to-heart with Fusion and they wanna protect each other I think. Oh and there was some part about Fusion launching a boat into the center of town that was stopped by all the Cures. Fusion agrees to step down, though the rest of the fusion globs apparently disagree...if that\'s possible..? Smile protects them with Fuu-chan\'s power aiding them and Cure Echo powers down back into Ayumi. And apparently all of the girls now go to Ayumi\'s school together. Idk if you can tell but I honestly had major issues with this movie and I\'m not happy how they resolved it, nor am I happy with the limited screentime for...ANYONE. I mean we had BARELY even half the fairies here. I\'m afraid this is the first All-Stars that I really hated. 3/10. the entirety of the Cure teams are completely absent.

Princess Nine: Kisaragi Joshikou Yakyuubu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1846/Princess_Nine__Kisaragi_Joshikou_Yakyuubu,"[""Story: Ok with out giving any spoilers this show is basically about a group of girls that were braught together to form an a girls baseball team and enter into the baseball tournament which only has boy baseball teams, this may not sound interesting at first thats understandable since i know many people arent into sport themed or sport based shows but this one is different. This show tells us the story of how the all girls baseball team overcomes different problems and shows the true power of woman/girls unlike those fantasy style shows where the girls always have something in them from the past...or dont exceptional training. Here its based on their atitude and what they believe in as a girl. Of course theres romance in there to but i think the main focus of the story is the group of girls as a whole.Art: I'd have to say the art isnt something to fancy and isnt something to plain. its just nice and fits nicely with the show.Sound: The voice actors and the characters i personally think matched perfectly with each other.Character: You see quite a bit of character development through out the minor characters each with an episode or more introducing them and showing their own problems that they receive help from their friends. There is one character how ever, the main character of the show you really see her and her emotions come into play expecially when one event occurs to her and her attitude takes a complete turn of course you would have to watch the show to have a look at what event im talking about. The romance between the boy and the girl isnt as in depth as some anime's are but you can see their relationship grow and change through the show but as i said before its mainly focused more on the development between team members.Enjoyment: I really liked this show expecially the idea of what boys can do girls can to and shows the true power of girls when we work together true we may be weak when we're alone but thats why this one is amazing as even when their alone they still have the determination and attitude.Overall: This was a good show story was amazing as far as i can tell i would recommend every girl to atleast try this show even if its the first few episodes. or dont exceptional training.

Princess Nine is a sports drama about a baseball team of girls trying to overcome adversity and prejudice to be acknowledged as equals to the boys when they try to get involved in the national tournament to take part in competition at Koshien Stadium. Much of the series focuses around the team coming together and dealing with a number of obstacles that halt their efforts at competing in the Koshien tournament such as the school principal, tensions between some of the teammates and scandal. The series does give focus to the personalities and...backgrounds of each of the girls, many of whom fulfill a specific character type yet are likeable for the most part. The first half is actually rather solid in its developments with the girls teaming up, training and learning to be a cohesive team despite their differing personalities and dealing with those trying to thwart their formation.While having a likeable cast though, Princess Nine does have some pretty significant issues. The series apparently dug into shoujo anime cliches in setting up its plot, the biggest hurting the series being its melodrama and romantic predicaments for its second half. Princess Nine has a big habit of greatly exaggerating on a number of the dilemmas faced by the characters throughout the title's run, which tend to get rather overbearing at points. The romantic developments on the love triangle that are focused on in the second half prove to be the biggest setback to the use of melodrama in this series as it has no major relevance to the main plot on the girl's baseball team and is rather bland due to the exaggerated dramatics that the series pulls with the whole thing, which even lead them to affect the girls at points during their baseball games and take away from that aspect to the plot. Also, the Koshien tournament's depiction in the anime is rather underwhelming with only one or two episodes devoted per game on ir and much of the romantic melodrama dominating the storyline by that point.In terms of presentation, Princess Nine sports standard quality visuals with reasonable detail and subdued color tones on character designs and scenery. The animation has its rough moments with character designs usually getting off-model and reused animated frames coming from a number of baseball scenes. The soundtrack consists of dramatic and upbeat tracks that do their part at trying to enhance the melodrama of the series, but are rather forgettable and don't match up to the epic scale they attempt to portray.While the girls among the team are a likeable bunch and get some solid developments, Princess Nine's melodrama and romantic developments get way too much emphasis as the series presses on, eventually getting to a point where they are more prominent than the struggles of the girls being recognized as well as the boys' teams. While having its solid moments, I don't think I'm hopping back to this series anytime soon. backgrounds of each of the girls, many of whom fulfill a specific character type yet are likeable for the most part.

In actuality, Princess 9 is very likely the worst sports anime to ever have been made.I had my reservations when looking at the cover, but figuring it was probably just  made in the late 80's, I  picked it up. My estimation was roughly a decade off.  The great character designs attempt to hide this fact, but unfortunately my sympathy vanished when the story began to circle the drain.The series begins promisingly enough, the first 8 or so episodes are decent, and in fact the last few are too. The fact that...i don't remember the middle of the series is indicative of its poor quality.I personally am not a fan of anime that cut every possible corner and have repetitive filler episodes, though most people seem to like them. If you are one of them I recommend you buy this series right away, surely there is no shortage of people trying to get rid of their copy.If you insist on watching the anime, I would suggest that you watch the first disc and the last disc, then seal it away so it can wait in anticipation for its next victim. i don't remember the middle of the series is indicative of its poor quality.I personally am not a fan of anime that cut every possible corner and have repetitive filler episodes, though most people seem to like them.

Overall, it focuses more on romance than sports, so if you were looking for a really sportsy anime, this might not be your thing. But, it has Sailor Moon-like romance that makes up for that loss. I picked up this anime because I was browsing on Crunchyroll, in the mood for a sports anime. I was instantly hooked. I totally recommend. Its got to be in my top 20 favorite anime. I kept watching at the start of this anime because of the opening and the art style. But the story gets better and better. ', ""One of the best villains is in this anime...After finishing the 26 episodes you realize this is a whole different anime then you first believe. What makes this so great, it's the secret story within the anime.  At first glance it looks like an all female baseball team overcoming sexism and playing against male baseball teams but Hiroki proves it truly is a man's world.From episode one and forward it present itself to be that of a feminist driven anime fighting for women's right and they can compete with the boys. After finishing the series those cringy scenes were actually satire....From over the top president of the school feminist to speeches about there being not difference between a girl and a boy when it comes to baseball it was all satire.The whole show present the females to be overly emotional.  The female baseball team was only started because the president of the school saw the daughter of her first loved play baseball.  After being married to another man she still can't get over him.Hiroki is the saving grace of this anime. He had knowledge their was going to be a female baseball team from the beginning and start to work quickly on Ryou(MC) saying he is her boyfriend.  He later has his childhood friend Izumi with a promising tennis career join the female baseball team too.  What a great villain Hiroki is, he manipulated these girls to win. Toying and stringing along these girls from episode one and that love confession to get Ryou to throw those predictable pitches, masterful. This is not a show about a girl baseball team it's about one man's ambition. An almost 10/10 anime because of Hiroki. I have to admit I was scared when Ryou said Hiroki was the enemy I was like SHE KNOWS but she was being cute and talking about in baseball term. Truly a unique way to go about it and there was a little foreshadowing in episode 13 where the girl manipulated the opposite sex.

I realized I hadn't watched many of Baseball anime and at the same time, I stumbled across this. With only a little over 7,000 people having it on their list and a short run manga that seems to have dropped off the face of the Earth, this show turned out to be the very definition of a hidden gem.The story is of a chairwoman deciding to start a baseball (not softball) team at her all girls school and have the team compete against the dudes. A problem with this is that she only has a...pitcher that she found in a street league. The early part of the show is focused around building this team with a hodgepodge of girls from other sports and walks of life. If you watch the intro or outro, then its not a surprise who they pick up. Keep in mind that this is a 90s shojo. So on top of training this ragtag team and battling the school authority, there is also a lot of romance drama. and sometimes normal drama. The story is full of 90s tropes and cliches, but they seem to work fine.Another thing this show has going for it is some great 90s animation and artwork. All of the main character girls are well designed. The only guy that has an interesting character is the coach. When it comes to the Sports part of the show there is a lot of reused animation and/or quick cuts. However, there are also some good animated batting and diving catches.The sound design is very good. The OP and ED are nice bookends to every episode. The two songs are reused a lot during the show. There's also some good orchestral music whenever the MC pitcher throws a ball. It really adds to the intensity. The baseball sfx are all fine, nothing much to say. The last thing is that THE DUB IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE SUB. I cannot stress this enough. Crunchyroll has both and I watched a couple eps. of each and the the characters were much better defined in the dub.The Main characters are good. From the coach, to the manager, to the players; there's not a bad one in the bunch. The side characters and Mr.Love Interest can get a bit generic though.While I enjoyed its sports side, this show is more about what happens off the field. The romance can get a little tiring and some of the drama surrounding the girls being allowed to play can seem like a drawn out formality. However, the bond between the teammates carries the show effectively enough, that watching never seemed like a chore.Overall, I will tell the void that this show should be watched as clearly no one knows about this show. I was worried that because it wasn't popular and didn't get a second season, that it would have an unsatisfying ending.

The sports anime genre consisting of literal hundreds of animes really only has 16 true ""sports"" animes focusing on girls, and Princess Nine was my first one. In terms of idea, the plot of Princess Nine was pretty solid. I was ready to start cheering for a girl\'s baseball team taking on boys; however it was the execution that failed for me.Personally, I look for two things in a sports anime: coming out of the anime with more knowledge about the sport than I came in with and seeing a strong team dynamic. Princess Nine really...didn\'t do either in my opinion. Because the school needed to recruit players, the team only all comes together in episode ten or so which leaves that much less time for developing their team dynamic. Though even with all the girls together, Princess Nine seems to enjoy focusing on anything but baseball. A love triangle begins to form in the very beginning and manages to drag itself all the way to the end of 26 episodes miraculously adding absolutely nothing to the plot that whole time. It involves two of the best players from the team and only develops tension and negativity between the two which really bummed me out because it affects their performance in the games as well as their teammates. Not only that, but I look forward to seeing teammates help pick each other up, get to know each other, and encourage one another, but those two stay negative for nearly the entire anime.In addition, not many relationships between the team were built, there was the pitcher and fourth batter, a brief development of the pitcher and catcher, and a couple of the fielders becoming friends, but other than that, the team continued to feel a little bit disconnected for me. Thus, because of that I felt I was really only cheering on one person at a time rather than the entirety of the team, and this was pretty much solely because of the love triangle! Trying to develop 9 characters in 26 episodes is pretty challenging because of the time you have to work with, and therefore some picking and choosing inevitably has to happen with who the writers want to develop. And they picked one of those to be the guy in the love triangle.I honestly am really frustrated with the love triangle because it just took so much time away from the team and baseball in general which makes no sense considering everyone including the guy involved in it PLAYS BASEBALL. I really didn\'t learn much about the sport at all because of that unnecessary subplot, and the girls on the team seemed to just suddenly know how to play it--one was recruited from track and field, but once she joined the baseball team, she was an expert. The anime really didn\'t show the girls spending a lot of time improving and that\'s because they really didn\'t get to play baseball that much!Despite all this, the team was likable and they did have a few scenes that showed some real deal practicing. I also didn\'t dislike anyone, and if given more time, they probably could\'ve formed some really cool relationships. I liked the eclectic mix of players Princess Nine had going on I just wish they\'d been given a little more love.The anime was made in the 90s, and the art reflects that, but the character designs are quite good in that each girl looks individual and not simply the same as everyone else but with different hair. The animation did reuse a lot frames when they were playing baseball, but besides that, it was pretty solid.Its soundtrack was nothing to complain about but also wasn\'t anything I\'d choose to listen to in my free time.Enjoyment wise Princess Nine was a roller coaster for me. I really loved seeing the girls goof around with each other or pull each other up when they made a mistake and got down about it. When they really started to play some baseball I got into it and really had a good time cheering for the pitcher and the batters, but a lot of the time the games ended quite quickly and the plot went right back to the love triangle causing those enjoyable team instances to actually be sort of rare.When the anime focused on the love triangle I really didn\'t feel like watching and just got frustrated. Not only that, but those struggles from the triangle poured into some of the baseball games affecting the girl\'s performance, and I don\'t understand the reason for that. What\'s the point on having the girls improve if they\'re just going to start to suck because of a boy who adds nothing to the anime besides problems for the team? There were so many other places to take his character to make him more likable as well as more beneficial. He and his baseball team could\'ve become the girl\'s rivals and they could\'ve pushed each other to get better or he could\'ve been their batting coach since he\'s such a ""genius batter"" or he could\'ve even teamed up with the girl\'s current manager and become a much more positive influence.That being said, Princess Nine had great potential and showcased instances of team dynamics and relationships between the girls, but the pointless inclusion of a love triangle took too much time away from the main plot as well as the actual baseball and prevents it from being a great anime. didn\'t do either in my opinion.

My response was that it\'s because it\'s a good anime.So, to clarify why this is so biased: This was my first real obscure anime. I\'d grown up watching Dragon Ball once in a while and had watched Cowboy Bebop, but I never truly veered too far off the beaten path. Then, doing research for what was essentially the set-up for a joke, I needed...to find an older anime about girls\' baseball. This is what came up. So I used the name, referenced a character and thought I was done. But I wasn\'t. I find out that this show was on Youtube (which, now that I understand the anime industry better, I shouldn\'t have done that). I watch through the entire show. While not my point of no return into becoming a weeb, it was absolutely a starting point that led me to want to find more anime.With that out of the way, you can understand why it\'s hard for me to talk about this show objectively. The criticisms about the love triangle is valid and I would absolutely agree that the guys kind of have no real personality (Hiroki is the most dull love interest I\'ve ever seen). The girls however, are full of it.My favorite character is and will always be Seira Morimura, the speed demon second baseman with the maximum amount of attitude. If anything, I would\'ve loved to have seen so much more of her. In terms of the best developed character, Izumi is really all you need to look towards. The show\'s protagonist may technically be Ryo, it\'s Izumi\'s story for most of it. Each girl has something to prove and each really does get to have their own moment to shine (except maybe Hikaru). It\'s hard to introduce 9 characters and get you to recognize and care about each of them, but Princess Nine delivers in that sense.I\'m unsure of who to suggest this for as I found it on a sheer whim, but it\'s just a close favorite of mine. After watching more anime, I\'ve definitely found anime that I\'ve loved so much more, but you never really forget your first. to find an older anime about girls\' baseball. This is what came up.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED, DO NOT READ THIS.Princess Nine comes in just below my favorite sports anime of all time, Ping Pong the Animation. What puts it above more popular titles such as Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basuke?Simply put, girls.Obviously a huge part of the show has to revolve around the fact that it\'s a girl\'s baseball team, not softball team, but the extent to which Princess Nine capitalizes on its all-female protagonists is amazing. Princess Nine highlights and then conquers the patriarchal perspective on sports in general that women are...inherently worse.Before you call me a bra burner, let me clarify something— yes, it is true that women will tend to be worse at sports and be less physically strong because of biological constraints and societal pressures, but this does not mean that a best-of-the-century female baseball player cannot go toe-to-toe with male baseball players.The underlying conflict of the show, particularly throughout the first half, is not Ryo versus her opponents or herself or anything like that, but overwhelming individual talent versus biological and societal differences between men and women. The Kisaragi Joshikou baseball team is comprised of multiple girls who possess amazing talent worthy of rivaling many of the top male baseball players, and at their head is Ryo, whose ability is equaled only by her pitcher-of-the-century father, and it is their struggle against the patriarchy (smash the patriarchy!) that lies as the backdrop to its narrative.When they are given the opportunity to participate in Koshien, this conflict largely becomes relegated to the background as we are hit with a level of inter-character drama that I can\'t say I\'ve seen in any other sports anime to such an extent, but which really makes me question how much Princess Nine truly is a ""sports anime"" in the way we think about. With the first nine episodes of Princess Nine going without actually seeing a baseball game, and beyond that only showing four baseball games across about six of the twenty-six episodes, Princess Nine makes its clear priority the romance and drama over the sport itself, something that comes both as a welcome relief since so many sports anime concentrate so purely on the sport, and as a hindrance to the gravity of the games themselves, since they are built up so little as to make their ultimate outcomes seem, at times, predictable and/or unrealistic. It is a wonder that the impairment of the Kisaragi Joshikou baseball team being all girls is not enough already, and that they have the time between practicing to have so much drama at all. The combination of these two makes Princess Nine seem, at times, a bit too ""anime"" in its presentation of the overall story, but this is largely unnoticeable by the effectiveness of the drama that is taking the place of the sports.This kind of storytelling, which balances being undeniably about a sport with being overwhelmingly not just presentation of that sport, is incredibly distinct— if it has been done before to the extent it is done here, I have not seen it, and generally I\'m a huge sucker on gender commentary stuff sooo you know go that.Speaking of being a huge tsundere toward feminism because I totally am a liberal cuck while pretending to not be one, I have zero issue with the arc of Ryo and Izumi playing worse because they are lovesick at the ending. This is because, A. People are lovesick in real life, regardless of gender, so it\'s believable, B. It\'s kind of awesome to see a sports competition come to a head with romance, because this wouldn\'t be possible without there being an openly same-gender relationship or having a female team competing against a male team on even ground. It\'s fucking great.Being done on the subject of freshmen in high school, it isn\'t surprising that Princess Nine is largely a coming of age story. Izumi\'s ultimate decision at the end to give up her pretend-relationship with Hiroki and to admit defeat in the battlefield of romance to Ryo, is a powerful demonstration of character development, maturity, and the strengthening of her friendship and rivalry with Ryo. She, ultimately, is nearly as much a main character to Princess Nine as Ryo is, largely because her character growth is so intricate in contrast with Ryo\'s fairly common arc of becoming strong without any man to help her and just becoming strong in general really. Because her and Ryo\'s screen time overwhelm those of the other girls, it would already be difficult to fault the show for making the other teammates so cliché and seemingly unsuited to baseball.However, giving them their own spotlight, I have only criticism to give. After all, how is it remotely possible that an aspiring fashion model with no pension for physical fitness could, even after a couple months of intensive training, come close to the aptitude that the best baseball teams in the nation have? How is it possible that a girl whose time is largely spent pursuing academics and who has repeatedly been turned away from baseball by her father, can still be one of the best catchers on the team? I\'ll believe that Mao got good because we saw her training at catching really fucking hard, but it seems all Yoko had to do to prove herself as a worthy teammate was take baseball seriously for one moment. For that matter, though, I think it would\'ve been nice to see everybody, Ryo included, training a little harder than they did. Izumi seems to be the one putting in the most effort in training and it was also shown that she was an extremely fast learner and already physically fit, so how did she ultimately end up as just a heavy slugger and not by far and away the best hitter on the team?There was a storytelling technique I saw here that was never precisely predictable, but extremely awesome to pick up on. Whenever one conflict is happening, another is, always. They come in pairs and they come strong. When the press come at Kisaragi Joshikou and Ryo because of her father\'s scandal, she ends up hospitalized too. Both the conflict with Kisaragi and Ryo are happening at once. When Ryo and Izumi are hung up on Hiroki, Koharu also struggles with her father\'s poor health. This is constant throughout the show, and something I may try to use myself. inherently worse.Before you call me a bra burner, let me clarify something— yes, it is true that women will tend to be worse at sports and be less physically strong because of biological constraints and societal pressures, but this does not mean that a best-of-the-century female baseball player cannot go toe-to-toe with male baseball players.The underlying conflict of the show, particularly throughout the first half, is not Ryo versus her opponents or herself or anything like that, but overwhelming individual talent versus biological and societal differences between men and women. The Kisaragi Joshikou baseball team is comprised of multiple girls who possess amazing talent worthy of rivaling many of the top male baseball players, and at their head is Ryo, whose ability is equaled only by her pitcher-of-the-century father, and it is their struggle against the patriarchy (smash the patriarchy!) that lies as the backdrop to its narrative.When they are given the opportunity to participate in Koshien, this conflict largely becomes relegated to the background as we are hit with a level of inter-character drama that I can\'t say I\'ve seen in any other sports anime to such an extent, but which really makes me question how much Princess Nine truly is a ""sports anime"" in the way we think about. With the first nine episodes of Princess Nine going without actually seeing a baseball game, and beyond that only showing four baseball games across about six of the twenty-six episodes, Princess Nine makes its clear priority the romance and drama over the sport itself, something that comes both as a welcome relief since so many sports anime concentrate so purely on the sport, and as a hindrance to the gravity of the games themselves, since they are built up so little as to make their ultimate outcomes seem, at times, predictable and/or unrealistic. It is a wonder that the impairment of the Kisaragi Joshikou baseball team being all girls is not enough already, and that they have the time between practicing to have so much drama at all. The combination of these two makes Princess Nine seem, at times, a bit too ""anime"" in its presentation of the overall story, but this is largely unnoticeable by the effectiveness of the drama that is taking the place of the sports.This kind of storytelling, which balances being undeniably about a sport with being overwhelmingly not just presentation of that sport, is incredibly distinct— if it has been done before to the extent it is done here, I have not seen it, and generally I\'m a huge sucker on gender commentary stuff sooo you know go that.Speaking of being a huge tsundere toward feminism because I totally am a liberal cuck while pretending to not be one, I have zero issue with the arc of Ryo and Izumi playing worse because they are lovesick at the ending. This is because, A. People are lovesick in real life, regardless of gender, so it\'s believable, B.

Shoujo has two things primarily working against it. One is that there's rarely a good budget like its shounen counterpart, so stock footage, sparkles, and lots of talking are used as storytelling devices. The other is that shoujo tends to be aimed at women and faces more scrutiny than shounen, so shoujo is (largely) emotion and character dynamic heavy.My issue is that this show starts strong thematically with a frank discussion about the issues women face to this day. It then turns around and has the team fail...to achieve their dreams because of a love triangle involving two of the girls and a boy from the rival team. So the moral I got from this show is you are either single and alone, or in a relationship and happy, and either way you fail. Because women can't possibly be treated as equals. And that all our actual problems (because relationship woes are the only viable thing) can be solved by a big strong man. Lovely.Had the girls lost because they were out skilled, that would have been fine. But they didn't. This is a pseudo feminist work that is insulting to its audience. to achieve their dreams because of a love triangle involving two of the girls and a boy from the rival team.

This is a pseudo feminist work that is insulting to its audience."", 'A "" charming mediocrity"" best describes my opinion of Princess Nine, there are many tropes and just things the show doesn\'t do that well, that calling this show \'good\' is a bit of a stretch to me. But despite this I did find it somewhat charming, whilst there isn\'t much particularly good with this series, I did enjoy my time with it.Princess Nine is pretty much about forming a female baseball team, in a league where only men are allowed, to overturn the rules and prove that women can compete on equal ground with men. It doesn\'t solely focus on this in fact there are...only three baseball games in the 26 episode run, the rest is either focused on training, recruiting (for the first half), on a romance sub plot, or on trying to stop the school counsellors, parent association, baseball association etc for not allowing a girls team to play in the baseball league.The problem with this show is none of the aspects were done that well, the baseball isn\'t really in depth and most of the game isn\'t about tough opponents but just a mental issue the pitcher has, its okay to do this sometimes but all the games is that the girl\'s team could be winning if they were playing their best but something is stopping them. I want to point out the first official baseball game match for being particular bad, if the point of your show is to show that woman can be on equal ground, having the female team seduce the men\'s team because they don\'t think they can compete on equal footing is missing the point.Despite it not being very developed I did enjoy watching the baseball game\'s unfold, it was just kind of fun, it was predictable and filled with tropes and certainly not anything new, but enjoyable none the less. I would of liked it if this anime had more baseball focused episodes, more on the opponents team, more on our main heroine\'s team and just more on baseball in general; I think that would have improved Princess Nine quite a bit.The romance plot kind of went on for too long, various misunderstandings made it kind of annoying at points, I sort of liked the couple but the love triangle did go on for way too long and various misunderstandings which prolonged the drama only served to annoy me.The various associations stopping the girls did too, it made sense that somebody would try and stop them, their against the norm, but having four or five upsets of them not being able to play, because some group is trying to stop them just got annoying, it just felt like filler from the actual content, as you never believed any of these groups would actually stop the team from playing, as them playing was the entire point of the show.I probably enjoyed the recruiting arc the most travelling across Japan or searching the school to find other girls suitable for the team, they even go to a remote fisher village to find a girl capable of the \'wave motion swing\' it was a bit silly but the character introductions were nice enough which make up most of the first half.The characters to carry on this train of thought, you could probably guess what I\'m going to say, some of them are tropey, the MC\'s naivety, the rival, and some of the cast aren\'t anything you haven\'t seen before in another show due to their common personalities. All the characters do have some sort of issue they have to contend with so its not like there is nothing to them, but they don\'t feel that changed and there still isn\'t that much to them at the end of the day. Despite the non distinctive and tropey cast, none of them are dislikable or annoying (well most of them at least) and most of them felt charming due to the tropes, they\'re not good, but they are not annoying or dislikable either.The sound and animation is fine the OST is a bit repetitive but it does its job the opening and ending aren\'t terrible but okay. Their isn\'t a lot of action in terms of animation, but its fine it representative of its time and consistent.I actually kind of liked the dub it was a bit cheesy and silly but that also had its own appeal.Overall this show is mediocre to me, there is nothing exceptional here, but despite that I enjoyed most of it and found it charming, even though it was predictable and tropey, knowing what you are going to get has its appeal as well, and it was an easy watch. This show isn\'t good and nor would I recommend it, it has a blend of romance and sports  and it ends up doing neither of them that well, there are better anime for both of these things. I only watched this show due to the random button on Crunchyroll. My time didn\'t feel wasted and that is about all I can give to Princess Nine.For a better Baseball anime I would suggest Ace of Diamond, its a bit long but focuses a lot more on the baseball element of the show. only three baseball games in the 26 episode run, the rest is either focused on training, recruiting (for the first half), on a romance sub plot, or on trying to stop the school counsellors, parent association, baseball association etc for not allowing a girls team to play in the baseball league.The problem with this show is none of the aspects were done that well, the baseball isn\'t really in depth and most of the game isn\'t about tough opponents but just a mental issue the pitcher has, its okay to do this sometimes but all the games is that the girl\'s team could be winning if they were playing their best but something is stopping them.

As I thought about how to go about my review, I realized simply telling the reviewer that the series falls apart in the second half doesn't really cut it in regards to helping people figure out whether they want to pick up this series based on my review, though for some people - the ones who aren't fond of spoilers, that is actually enough of an explanation, that while it does start well enough in story and character it starts falling apart in the second half.Those who want a bit more depth before deciding to pick...this series up, well - here it goes.The series does start off well enough, with characters who are quite enjoyable and growing through their own arcs. There isn't any real filler to the show, as each plot point is a plot point one would expect to be covered by any Sports series, though in the same regard the lack of games being shown is one of this shows major weaknesses as was the ending.The best way to put it is that the drama created by the romance plot ended up really taking away from the story towards the end, but makes the daughter of the woman who put the team together look petty beyond belief. I also found myself majorly concerned with the fact, as one of the few Anime of the sports genre to feature a female cast and focus on female athletes that the ending effectively becomes cheapened by the probably unintentional message that girls will always let their romantic drama get in the way of succeeding, for that ultimately is why the team loses - the romance drama prevented the girls team from playing to their fullest.This message might have been rectified if they had allowed our favorite alien doll girl to reach the ball, which would have also completed her arc out by showing she is able to do things without her alien friend, but instead it's just out of her reach. They could still have the significance of the guy the pitcher is head over heals for being the only one to hit her lightning ball without also having the significance of girls ultimately not being as good as the boys because of their inability to get past the drama or reach past their physical limitations to a new level, which is actually the exact opposite message the show was trying to present.Which is exactly why I felt the need to put the spoilers I did in my review. There is a VERY specific message to this Anime, that girls can do exactly what the boys can only for this message to be trampled upon in the very last minute. Okay, so I get the fact the pitcher is expected to bring the team to a certain goal by the end of three years, and if there were sequel series this would definitely have been achieved. The problem is, the kind of ending that shows up in this series is exactly the kind of ending which will result in no sequels, by trumping the message.This isn't to say the Anime wasn't enjoyable. I enjoyed all of the character arcs except for the love triangle, but this includes the rather weird and out there alien doll girl arc. All the characters are lovable, except for the daughter of the woman putting the team together - she almost became likable with how she tried hiding her true intentions, but there was no hiding her true intentions for her final faux pa.

Princess Nine is certainly no masterwork, but it features some really great character drama, intense action scenes, and a cast you really want to see succeed.Two gripes: (1) The boy drama is pretty bad, and the climax in the final episode is very nearly derailed by insisting said boy drama take the spotlight instead of the MUCH more interesting rivalry. (2) It's too short. Much of the run-time is spent gathering and training the team, so, by the time we get to actual baseball, there aren't...enough episodes left, and we're left rushing through what seems like a season's worth of material in a few episodes.Beyond that, Nine is just plain fantastic. The art gleefully bends and warps a baseball in all kinds of unnatural ways to communicate the intensity each moment I've never been so entertained by a little white sphere! Every major character visibly grows throughout the series, and they also contribute to the team both as players and as personalities. It's an ensemble cast in the very best sense of the word: These characters need one another, and - when they pull together - amazing things can happen.Also, screw the boy drama, Ryo and Izumi just need to kiss already! enough episodes left, and we're left rushing through what seems like a season's worth of material in a few episodes.Beyond that, Nine is just plain fantastic.

The girls lose, and I\'m glad, because two players couldn\'t pull their heads out of their lady parts long enough to play a game.

Led by Ryo Hayakawa, the preternaturally skilled pitcher (and daughter of a disgraced professional player), and urged on by school chairman Keiko Homuro, they struggle to break through the glass ceiling of sexist school administrators, bigoted league commissioners and disrespectful opposing squads. Through hard work, determination and the eccentric management of ex-pro baller Kido, the Kisaragi Nine prove themselves formidable on the diamond despite institutional opposition and their own mismatched personalities. Drama inevitably ensues, however: Ryo learns the truth about her father, and it nearly destroys her will to play baseball,...while she also engages in a rivalry with Keiko\'s estranged daughter Izumi, who quits tennis to become the team\'s star hitter. Their rivalry comes to a head due to a love triangle with Hiroki, the star of Kisaragi\'s Boys Team...which becomes even more tangled when they face Hiroki\'s team in the league championship!Most sports anime revel in both cliches and melodrama, and boy howdy does Princess Nine have both! The series is a love letter to classic baseball movies, with a pre-credits sequence referencing Field of Dreams and homages to A League of Their Own, The Natural, Eight Men Out and just about every other sports flick you can think of. This homage means that no genre trope or splash of melodrama is left unturned: of course Ryo is a fourteen year old girl blessed with natural talent, able to strike out semi-pro adults with her wicked fastball. Of course she recruits Koharu, booted from a boys baseball team and living in exile with her fisherman father, by facing her in a beachside pitching duel as the waves crash around them! Naturally, an arc where Ryo runs away and nearly drowns saving two orphans climaxes with her dead father visiting her in a dream, while Izumi treks five miles through the rain to her hospital bed, then yells at her to get better.If this seems like criticism, it\'s not really. Cliches have their place, and it\'s endearing how straight Princess Nine plays them. The energetic earnestness works in the show\'s favor: while the narrative features few surprises, it sells it with high-energy presentation and likeable characters. If the main cast are archetypes, they\'re fun: Seira the tough gal who brains gangsters with billiard balls; Mao the hulking but shy catcher; Yoko the conceited model with a heart of gold; the meek principal\'s daughter Kanako and spacy Yuki, who only talks to her ""alien"" doll Kiki. The show doesn\'t have enough time to give them equal focus, but their feuding-but-affectionate dynamics leads to a lot of fun. A lot of the show involves the characters working out their strengths on the field and their problems off; Yuki gets a surprisingly affecting focus arc, while Koharu\'s closeness with her dad makes her more than a standard tomboy character. If it\'s a foregone conclusion that Kanako stands up to her dad and Yoko turns down a contract to play with the team, well, consider the genre.The bulk of the drama focuses on Ryo and Izumi. Ryo is a standard Perky Protagonist Girl, with preternatural pitching skills and a lot of pep. She\'s gradually beaten down by the difficulties she develops, though, forcing herself to draw upon inner strength she didn\'t know she had. Her Hero\'s Journey is rough, but fortunately she has a doting mom, a gruff but caring manager and a team full of girls who has her back. Especially Izumi: initially joining the team to spite Ryo and her mother, she develops an affection for her teammates that pokes through her haughty exterior. Izumi makes clear that she values winning and self-respect; but she also realizes it\'s unfair to put all the pressure on any player. In their first real match, she chews out her teammates for forcing Ryo to carry the burden of their mistakes - and considering that she and Ryo are barely on speaking terms at that point, it\'s no small thing.The show\'s portrait of team work and female friendship makes the dynamics work and the plot. The feminist themes are \'90s You Go Girl Feminism: the men are largely strawman misogynists while Keiko\'s determination is portrayed with the frostiness expected of an anime feminist. If the show isn\'t terribly deep in its treatment of the glass ceiling, it\'s still cool for its message of how girls and women can break through. Through individual skill and determination, certainly, but having each others\' backs is more important. The Kisaragi Nine needs to work as a unit to survive: when Ryo or Izumi have an off-day the team needs to pick up the slack, and usually does. Which extends off the baseball diamond: when the eccentric Yuki has an unexpected mental breakdown, the team rallies to show her value to the team and her worth as a person.Princess Nine stumbles a little in its last arc, when the love triangle takes center stage and the expected tropes pile up. Naturally, Ryo and Izumi\'s budding friendship is torn apart by petty scheming and misunderstandings; unsurprisingly, it affects both of their play during the final tournament. Hiroki is a hunky cipher; we get his friendship with Izumi, but there\'s no reason for him to fall for Ryo except that she\'s the main character. Ryo\'s own childhood friend Seishiro is more appealing, and has a subplot where he dates the team\'s spunky first base woman Hikaru. So it\'s hard to get involved as the romantic drama spikes near the climax, with Ryo intentionally walking Hiroki until Izumi forces things to a head. Still, the finale ends on a satisfying note: the team narrowly loses, but proves their worth to the boys and forges friendships that, we hope, will endure beyond the series. while she also engages in a rivalry with Keiko\'s estranged daughter Izumi, who quits tennis to become the team\'s star hitter. Their rivalry comes to a head due to a love triangle with Hiroki, the star of Kisaragi\'s Boys Team...which becomes even more tangled when they face Hiroki\'s team in the league championship!Most sports anime revel in both cliches and melodrama, and boy howdy does Princess Nine have both!

Her Hero\'s Journey is rough, but fortunately she has a doting mom, a gruff but caring manager and a team full of girls who has her back. Especially Izumi: initially joining the team to spite Ryo and her mother, she develops an affection for her teammates that pokes through her haughty exterior. Izumi makes clear that she values winning and self-respect; but she also realizes it\'s unfair to put all the pressure on any player. In their first real match, she chews out her teammates for forcing Ryo to carry the burden of their mistakes - and considering that she and Ryo are barely on speaking terms at that point, it\'s no small thing.The show\'s portrait of team work and female friendship makes the dynamics work and the plot. The feminist themes are \'90s You Go Girl Feminism: the men are largely strawman misogynists while Keiko\'s determination is portrayed with the frostiness expected of an anime feminist. If the show isn\'t terribly deep in its treatment of the glass ceiling, it\'s still cool for its message of how girls and women can break through. Through individual skill and determination, certainly, but having each others\' backs is more important. The Kisaragi Nine needs to work as a unit to survive: when Ryo or Izumi have an off-day the team needs to pick up the slack, and usually does. Which extends off the baseball diamond: when the eccentric Yuki has an unexpected mental breakdown, the team rallies to show her value to the team and her worth as a person.Princess Nine stumbles a little in its last arc, when the love triangle takes center stage and the expected tropes pile up. Naturally, Ryo and Izumi\'s budding friendship is torn apart by petty scheming and misunderstandings; unsurprisingly, it affects both of their play during the final tournament. Hiroki is a hunky cipher; we get his friendship with Izumi, but there\'s no reason for him to fall for Ryo except that she\'s the main character. Ryo\'s own childhood friend Seishiro is more appealing, and has a subplot where he dates the team\'s spunky first base woman Hikaru. So it\'s hard to get involved as the romantic drama spikes near the climax, with Ryo intentionally walking Hiroki until Izumi forces things to a head. Still, the finale ends on a satisfying note: the team narrowly loses, but proves their worth to the boys and forges friendships that, we hope, will endure beyond the series.']"
Munou na Nana,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41619/Munou_na_Nana,"['“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I\'m not sure about the universe.” ― Albert Einstein / a.k.a I don\'t quite understand the hate for this show. Why? Because you\'re plain stupid/dumb to understand, that\'s mean.What defines humanity as a whole? It\'s the age-old argument of stupidity. From psychology to physiology, all humans are ironically wired to have a level of stupidity, whether by a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning or temporary slow-mindedness. Don\'t attempt to go and defend yourself by remitting the ""ignorance is bliss"" adage, because while it doesn\'t equal stupidity, ""\'tis folly to be wise."" Don\'t get me...wrong, the paradigm of ""We\'re All Stupid"" applies to everyone, regardless of your ability of perceive conceptualized notions. But rather than setting yourself up for failure, taking up irrational, emotional-filled oversimplifications of a mental state will be the moment to overcome stupidity and achieve true rationality. And that\'s what Talentless Nana aims to achieve here: over-complicated ""No shit, Sherlock"" acts of playing the ""stupidity"" game, down to the last culprit call to pursue and claim their reasonings, even to the satirical extremes of logic and twist the game even further down the rabbit hole.So strap in for the school-themed spatial ride, and prepare to be Crewmates, because: ""There are multiple impostors Among Us!""If there is one quote to sum Talentless Nana as a whole, it\'d be this quote by Dorkly: “Blessed are the ignorant fools of the world, for they know not the unspeakable horrors that await us all.” Nevertheless, who would\'ve expected an unknown mangaka like Looseboy to precede a formula, that is now all the rage with Innersloth\'s Among Us, by 2 years no less? Yes, the show starts off as a generic My HeroAca rip-off of sorts, par with the Hero and Villain factions of the ""Enemies of Humanity"": siding into both Talented and Talentless (you can put two and two together and make five of who and what they are, it\'s all filled out for you). And no, in the sense that by the end of the first episode, it takes all that and tugs it all out of the cliff in one fell swoop, just like the Talentless Nanao Nakajima. That\'s how you make a convincing first impression that this is more than just your generic Shounen superpower-fest show, and yessiree, it\'s full of SUS. This show doesn\'t try to sell on its world-building and unrealistic qualities of shock factors, because it really does not need one, as predictable as it can be.This show only reinforces that pink-haired yanderes full of psychological thriller-esque characters are here to stay, and they certainly aren\'t dumb, and that\'s the case of female MC Nana Hiiragi. Being sent from the human side to a Hogwarts-esque concealed island filled with generic typical My HeroAca setting of ""Talented"" people for assassination purposes, you might think that she is just dumb to plainly follow orders from the higher-ups, but over the course of the show, there is some semblance to that and then some that\'s not quite so.First off, her role as the assassin against the egoistic ""Talented"" kids: she\'s pretty much given a smartphone that dictates all Talented and their kill-counts, but overtime, it also makes you question if covering all your tracks is worth the hassle of not being found as a psychopathic secret impostor for killing strategies, by hook or by crook. And none better at that to exert her extroverted and convincing personality of persuasion as the class leader to buy people into her segue. Secondly, her backstory covered in the 2nd half of the anime shows us the true picture of Nana as a whole: Talented or Talentless, she\'s just as victimized as some of the characters, and for that reason, an anthropology of how she\'s dealt with the knives of death and revenge growing up. And that I believe is what sells on her character aesthetic: being an annoying and hideous girl that\'s full of sus, but also having an imperfect heart, regardless of reasoning. A Moriarty that\'s unlike one if I can infer at best.And that brings me to the next ""No shit, Sherlock"" MC character: the ""Talented"" immortal Kyouya Onodera (and I can already hear you say: ""BOO, another dumb character!""). Again, I implore you to hold your horses. Yes, a stereotypical introverted and observant Sherlock Holmes character he IS one, and no, his thought processes are really exquisite to follow and figure out in the same-old Holmes\' fashion of ""How does a deranged assassin\'s mind work? And how does he/she go around committing the crime with little to no evidence strewn from the start?"", so much so that without question you\'re immediately sunk into the crux of the conflict and figuring out who might be the potential culprit. You tell me: ""Kyouya is yet another dumbfounded character to not believe that Nana is behind it all."", but the truth of the matter is: ""If Nana is found out as the main culprit, why would this story and setting exist in the first place? There\'s always gotta be something beneath the surface that no one could ever predict."" And you\'d be right on saying this, because it only keeps getting better.But, if there one character I can single out ""playing dumb"", it\'s Michiru Inukai. At first, she seems like most other characters that likes to play the similar archetype game at first, but like Nana, where you get to understand her better, lies in her traumatic past of being a loyal dog (er, I mean, friend). The ""Talented"" girl that was shunned for just about everything in her life, from the ire of normal human beings to largely being oppressed for the fact that she is a Talent. At the very core of Michiru, lies 2 different beings: one of a descent of hidden motives (that gives a headache to Nana), and the other, what you see in the anime: a kind-hearted girl that genuinely cares for the people around her, akin to a puppy licking people\'s wounds but with the inability to cure illnesses, and what\'s detrimental is that for the Talent she has, it reduces her life expectancy. So, a divisive character that can be attuned to both sides of the story, that is what makes her character special.Otherwise, I have no words to defend the ""Talented"" students, because yes, they\'re all just plain dumb: infused for B-roll comedy (a.k.a fatso Moguo Iijima and his 3 henchmen) and plot devices to transcend both Nana and Kyouya into deep rabbit hole territory. I know, I know, there\'s the shapeshifting ""Enemy of Humanity"" human-feline Jin Tachibana with his love for animals with a psychotic-but-smart mindset, only appearing at critical times for Nana\'s sake in the 2nd half, but as problematic as he is, his role is better played out in future proceedings of the manga.Speaking of the manga, it wouldn\'t be a one-trick pony to go off the rails with filler/original content (well, except the last episode\'s final moments anyways), this is one of the few manga-to-anime adaptations that has extremely close levels of concise pacing. Small nitpicks aside, not one level of detail is left from the manga, and everything depicted in the anime is an entirely 1-for-1 screenplay of shots. So for manga readers (and any hopefuls wanting to pick up the manga), what you see and read in the manga, the anime does a heck of a plentiful and focused job adapting Looseboy\'s source material, and props to series composer Fumihiko Shimo for paying attention and re-enacting to the precise T.ANN\'s Steve Jones commented this: ""Talentless Nana is the Heybot! of Death Note."" And I have to say that he is absolutely right, because director Shinji Ishihira directed both shows (save for the old-school ""Shr(i)ek"" that was Fairy Tail and the radiance of Log Horizon), and his directorial duty shines even brighter now with Talentless Nana at studio Bridge. Capturing the intricate details of the manga for such a low budget studio is no easy task, and combining the easy-going Heybot! setting with the psychological-thriller suspense of a screenplay, it\'s as the cool kids say: it\'s (consistently) Poggers.In addition, the music and voice-acting is the extra layer to top to what is (IMO) already a pretty good show, even further. Miyu Tomita\'s OP ""Broken Sky"" is a great opening to get you invested into the nuances of the by-parallels of the various scene-shots (that kinda spoils the entire show in general, but not by much). What\'s even better is Chiai Fujikawa\'s ED, having performed for Shield Hero\'s EDs and the 1st ED of Digimon Adventure (2020), her musical class only keeps going up and higher. That\'s a few roles to take in for such a young 25-year-old music artist, but another masterful composition of a song that only raises her popularity even more. Not forgetting some notable veteran VAs that excel this show to new heights: Nana\'s VA Rumi Ookubo (to which Nana is a +1 to her well-played pink-haired repertoire), Kyouya\'s VA Yuuichi Nakamura (the king of SoL male MC) and Michiru\'s VA Mai Nakahara (part-total psychopath of Higurashi\'s Rena, part-sweet mother of Clannad\'s Nagisa). Honestly, a terrific job well done.Overall, I\'m not here to judge your tastes whether you consider Talentless Nana a boon or bane, it\'s either that you love the hell or hate the unrealistic ways of the show. Regardless of the insane amounts of ""forced"" plot twists and cliffhangers that left you wanting for more, I\'m here to give an alternate view of why I think this show is ""beneficial"" to the current times, and only picking up after Among Us got famous overnight. Yeah sure, you can process it as a ""marketing ploy"", anything goes.If you like it, then hey, fancy a mystery thriller? If not, I\'ll foreword with the cliché of ""there is better shows out there that\'d pique your interest more."" wrong, the paradigm of ""We\'re All Stupid"" applies to everyone, regardless of your ability of perceive conceptualized notions.

Maybe 1 twist can make me fan of the anime that I hated before and vice-versa. But I am actually forced to review this anime coz I am so annoyed by the positive review this anime has which also contains some 9/10.People really thinks this is GREAT anime ? and one review even said this is a hidden gem of this season. Like WTF ? First thing first this anime...is kind'a popular to call it hidden gem and second thing if this anime is gem then gem nowadays has no fkcing value.This is gonna be more like me ranting and bashing on this series than the review. But still lets start.First thing I would like to point out before I start my rant. The first episode of this anime is actually really good. It starts off as a total My Hero Academia rip off. The world which is assaulted by the monsters called ''Enemy of Humanity'' and to stop that the teenagers with supernatural powers are gathered who are called '' The Talented '' in an school and one of them is Nakajima Nanao who has almost no friend coz almost every author wants to make the characters generic asf. One day a girl named Nana Hiiragi transfers in their school who has the power to read mind and she befriends our guy Nanao. For almost the entirety of the first episode the boy named Nakajima Nanao is presented as the main character of the story. But at the final minute of the episode 1 it is revealed that Nana is actually the main character of the story after she is revealed as the serial killer with no super power who wants to kill all of the '' Enemy of Humanity '' which she thinks are '' The Talented '' people. And it was revealed that she has no superpowers. Her mind reading power is fake and she just has good deductive skills and by using her GIGA BRAIN she will kill every talented student in the school.And my god I loved that episode. I thought It was gonna be the child of My Hero Academia X Death Note. But my god I was wrong. It is one of the most frustrating shows I have seen in  while. Characters are total fools who probably have the brain in their ass.First thing. Nana is first shown as a girl with power to read mind and she even demonstrate her skills for 2 or 3 times in the class. And after it was revealed that she has no such power. Most of the demonstrations she did in the class looks absolutely illogical. Every student thinks Nana has mind reading power and she don't even need to hear what other says to know what they are gonna say. But still she asks questions like '' What are you trying to say ? , What are you saying etc a lot of times which definitely means she couldn't read mind. But characters in this anime are so dumbfucks that they will just overlook it.Every time a character dies , dies when they are with Nana and still she isn't the prime suspect. She will say something like '' Oh Enemy of Humanity attacked him from behind and ran away'' and every mfking characters will believe in her. Lets be real if its the first time it is easy to overlook but all of the characters who died were with Nana before they died. And how the fuck Enemy of Humanity only appears infront of Nana and not any other students. How does that makes sense ? If I were in that school no matter what my suspect will be Nana and Nana only coz it is logical and there are enough reasons to suspect her but no one does ( except for 1 guy ). More like most of those students won't even try to investigate about those cases they won't give a shit bout their friends dying.One character who has power to see future knows Nana is the one killing the guys out there and he even has the proofs but he won't say anything Why ? coz he wants her as a girlfriend. Okay that was frustrating to even hear. His over confidence in his skills got his killed in the end ( serves him right.) But it was all because of his over confidence not the smartness of Nana so it doesn't shows us about how Nana will kill those bastards even tho she is powerless which is the main focus of the story.Every time Nana kills a character she just gets away with it not because she leaves no traces behind and she always use 100% safe tactics but people just don't care and are just dumb. Using her innocent face and some crocodile tears she is always able to make other believe in her. And every fucking characters believes in her even tho it is obvious Nana has something to do with the guys dying.I have a 9 yrs old brother and I must say my brother is 2x more smarter than the characters in this anime.If I were in that school this anime would've ended in ep 2 coz with the things that are happening after Nana came to school and everytime she is with a character they die. I would suspect only her and even 10 years old kid will have enough brain to suspect her.*Art is mediocre.*Characters are just 1/10. If I could give it lower than 1 I would give it 0.1/10. Stupid shits. More like the most stupid characters in all of anime.*Story is kind'a good more like it is enough to make me want to watch it.*Sound is unmemorable. I already forgot almost every OST.*Main character is an edgy bitch who is smart because other characters are just too dumb.Should you watch this anime. Definitely not. Even if you liked Death Note and you are a huge fan of anime like that still don't watch it. It is one of the most frustrating and stupid anime ever.Thanks for reading.Have a good day / night.I am open to criticisms regarding my review so feel free to comment on my profile. is kind'a popular to call it hidden gem and second thing if this anime is gem then gem nowadays has no fkcing value.This is gonna be more like me ranting and bashing on this series than the review.

The answer is nuanced. Much of the alleged stupidity is actually deep ignorance, which is different, and the ignorance has been caused on purpose. It is revealed very early on.First, a general point: If you follow the full narrative, it is very clear that people irrationally believing in propaganda and other convenient lies is intentional. It is even clearer if you read the manga.""Humans don\'t believe the truth. They believe people.""""People believe what they...want to believe and hear what they want to hear.""It is not a bug; it is a feature. The author is trying to make a point here, and he is not trying to hide it. Call it social commentary if you like. More about that below.If you abuse existing misinformation and other characters\' motives, it isn\'t really plot armor. It is not as though you need additional coincidences for it, aside from the existence of the misinformation and the motives in the first place. Sure, some of the characters are legitimately too trusting or have issues with their mental health. ...Which can still sometimes be suboptimal writing, but that is different than plot armor. Not to mention, several of the events and beliefs are 1) explained in greater detail later on or 2) setups for future plot points with interesting payoffs. This doesn\'t apply to nearly everything, but sometimes you should be patient and try to look at the narrative as a whole.Well, let\'s go over some points and hope it won\'t turn into a full essay.[Obligatory spoiler alert, though I will try to avoid saying the biggest spoilers outright. There will be many mid-sized spoilers though.]1) Blaming the Enemies of HumanityIn Among Us and also in Danganronpa, for instance, the players and the characters are immediately told that there are killers among them. That is the premise. Here that is not the case, and there are potential scapegoats, most notably the dreaded ""Enemies of Humanity."" Original name, I know. (Nice troll, author.)Anyway, these aliens conveniently happen to be invisible or be able to influence people\'s minds, or at least that is what many characters believe. And why is that? Because the belief has been perpetuated by decades of government propaganda, all the way down to their textbooks. Often you don\'t even need to suggest to them that the Enemies of Humanity are at fault; they will recite their textbooks and general knowledge and come up with the idea by themselves. This is a central part of the premise that was established immediately, and even before the events of the series, most of the characters had assumed that these aliens were already on the island, so of course that is their default explanation for problems. In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, they will believe the alien option. Imagine a story in which the characters genuinely fight against aliens. If a few of them die, would their first assumption be blaming a human killer? No, that would be the wrong genre. Though usually the aliens are not quite as well hidden.Is it dumb to believe in government propaganda and conspiracy theories? Sure. It says something about people\'s poor critical reading skills. But that is only to be expected. Mankind is dumb like that. Look at the conspiracy theories tens of millions of real-life people believe in with far lesser propaganda efforts, not to mention their belief in all kinds of entities without empirical evidence.Keeping that in mind, they are mostly reasonable in not assuming that there is a grand government conspiracy out to get them. Come on, that can\'t be real, right? There is seemingly no evidence of it. So if that particular conspiracy happens to be real, they are walking into it blind. Good job with the brainwashing, shady government conspirators. There is a nice quote about it later on. ""People believe what they want to believe and hear what they want to hear. ... How would that benefit them?"" (I omitted a part there to tone down the spoilers.) Incidentally, the idea of mind-controlling aliens is also a setup for a future plot point. It has some ironic payoff that I don\'t want to spoil too much.2) Suspicious alien attackStabbed by an invisible alien? Suspicious, right? Yes, but if you have been indoctrinated into believing that invisible aliens are a thing, less so. And there was no apparent motive for the self-stabbing anyway, so figuring it out required several logical steps that indoctrinated people would not bother to take. Still, Kyoya rightfully points out that it is suspicious that it retreated after a single attack, and he isn\'t wrong, but let\'s think about it for a minute. If the best this alien can do is a relatively weak stab attack, and the building is full of super-powered humans about to rush in, retreating might not be a bad idea. Even if it is invisible, it isn\'t hard to guess where it is if it tries to stab people. But maybe it would opt to self-sacrifice to take out the mind-reader, probably a big threat. That would have been an interesting argument for Kyoya to make.3) Why not reveal everything to the class the moment you learn the truth?Without evidence? That wouldn\'t go so well. And they lacked evidence, with the exception of Tsunekichi. (More about that below.) Second, for many of them, it would not have helped them achieve their goals. I am not going to go through each person\'s motives individually.4) Just ask her to read your mindIt happens multiple times during the series, and there are plausible ways out of them. And there apparently are convenient limitations to her mind-reading ability. Nana states that she cannot reliably focus on specific thoughts or parse very specific pieces of information from them, including particular strings of letters or numbers such as passwords. Also, the presence of many people creates background noise that can cover the target\'s thoughts.And it is not as though the students are constantly badgering each other to show off their powers. Even with a mind-reader it is natural to primarily try to have a normal conversation. Would you really ask them to focus on your thoughts instead of talking? Then they might find out things that you don\'t want them to, and it would be considered rude regardless.5) Precognitive photosTsunekichi had strong empirical reasons to trust the accuracy of the photos. He had tried to defy them before, but it had never worked. What was dumb was not anticipating what was done with the photos, though it was true that the tampered material had not been handed over voluntarily, which made it seem more plausible. The way his character was written, it seems that his fatalism had turned him so passive and uncaring of anything that he could barely be bothered to take any measures to protect himself. He is someone who had given up on actively living his life for the most part. So I guess you can substitute stupidity for mental illness.By the way, here is a possible interpretation of how the photos work:It seems clear that the predictions made by the photos take into consideration how the characters react to those photos. Tsunekichi was refusing to head to the murder scene before the photos were tampered with, and that happened because of the existence of the initial photos. Nothing that happens to fulfill the photos ever seems to violate normal laws of physics. The conditions just happen to be right for the outcomes.So the events had to progress roughly the way they did because otherwise the pictures would not have come true, and they had to come true. The events played out as they did because the characters are who they are. It is not as though we should assume that people have metaphysical free wills. Their actions are predictable, at least by some superpowers that can make normally impossible calculations.If Tsunekichi was the kind of person who would reveal the information to the class or would figure out that the fake photo was fake, he likely would not have got the photos in the first place because then the existence of the photos likely would have prevented those events, and he only gets photos that come true. He could have got a different set of incriminating photos though. If this is the case, what actually ruined Tsunekichi was his fatalism because that is what lead him to behave as he did.Tl;dr: It is all about causality and determinism. (Let\'s not get into a quantum mechanics fight in this context, please.)6) Mind-reading the spirits of the deceased""But that is not how mind-reading works!""Well, how does mind-reading work in real life then? Let alone in this fictional world? Yeah, I thought so. Also, they were already doing necromancy in the same room; speaking to the spirit of the corpse is only a few more steps beyond that. Some talents can be broad and multi-purpose, developing into slightly different directions than what you\'d initially expect. This seems especially apparent after reading the manga further. That doesn\'t mean that the ability can\'t be too convenient in that particular situation. That applies to many other talents though, including the necromancy that was literally going on in the same room.This isn\'t about tactics, but I did find the irony pretty funny. It is adding insult to injury: first the person gets killed, and then people are pretending to speak on behalf of his spirit.7) No autopsyTsunekichi was running around telling everyone about the girlfriend thing, so her being the victim of blackmail, assault, etc. was very plausible, most of which was actually true. If she had killed him, it would have probably been by stabbing or blunt trauma, but there were no signs of those. And in that case, she would have openly admitted to self-defence. (The method of killing was the reason against that option.)8) No zombie ""autopsy""People were crept out by the necromancy and allegedly Tsunekichi\'s suffering on top of that. The decision comes down to how willing they are to torture Tsunekichi\'s soul to maybe learn about the Enemies of Humanity. I could see them not caring about him and going through with it anyway, so it is reasonable to argue that it was out of character for some of them. You can call it dumb if you like, or being too kind-hearted. It is not ruthlessly efficient, for sure. Maybe Kyoya would have liked to go through with it anyway, but the others would have dragged him out of the room if necessary.9) Letting a captive free in exchange for helpLetting another character free in exchange for letting them use their talent to ""speak"" to their loved one beyond the grave. That isn\'t plot armor though, more like emotionally manipulating people by abusing their romantic feelings and state of mind. First of all, she was not planning to kill her captive at that point anyway, and only decided on that later. Exposing everything to the class wouldn\'t work because of the lack of evidence. She should have taken more precautions though. Barricading the door, for instance. Though it was plausible, given the state of mind of the person in question. But still, barricade the door. Then they probably would have had to talk their way out of it.10) ""Barricading"" in a shedThe point of the plan is that it wears the opponent down and makes her easier to find while also lowering the chance of her exposing anything to the class. (Not that she had any evidence, and it would have run contrary to her motive anyway.) The time of sunrise was not a deus ex machina because it is easily predictable. The real problem was whether sunlight would deactivate the zombies. Even though it was very likely that sunlight had some effect, judging by the time of day a particular zombie appeared in school, it was not certain that all zombies are equally affected, and furthermore it was possible that the sunlight worked on the zombies too slowly. If they immediately went on a full assault, maybe there would have been enough time to get something done. There was the threat of a hypothetical trap, but still.11) Blindly following the leaderYes, it is dumb to blindly follow charismatic leaders, but that is what people do. They follow their Great Leaders and trust their words. Look around and read the news. People are actually pretty dumb in that sense.12) Not seeing through facades in generalYes, it is dumb to let yourself be too easily influenced by a nice smile, kind demeanor, and convenient words. People are dumb like that. Well, I suppose realism isn\'t everything in fiction though. Narratively, many of the scenes are supposed to be about emotional manipulation instead of foolproof game-theoretical solutions. And you don\'t really see the latter pretty much anywhere in fiction; you pretty much only get impossible predictions and unlikely coincidences, with a few exceptions. There is of course room for improvement in the manipulation department too, though it was still very amusing to see.13) Too often near the victimsWell, three times as far as most characters think. Still, it creates more suspicion, as mentioned several times and especially addressed during the events of episodes 4 and 8. Not to mention that being the leader puts her in contact with more people, which makes her a likely witness. This was stated multiple times.14) Michiru is gullible and trusts her friends too muchLiterally canon. Even the narrative openly acknowledges it. It was done on purpose because it is used in a few later plot points. In the case of the incriminating photo, there is also the additional point that based on earlier photos, it seemed that they could indeed be inaccurate. It still should have rung alarm bells though.15) Why not call the phone instead of a body search?Sounds and other alerts can be turned off, you know. It might be worth a shot though because it is not like there is any downside to it, even if the chances of it working are low.16) Why don\'t they simply have the military level the island?Explained in episode 2. They have to know enough about the abilities first, and even if you ask them first, they won\'t always be honest. And an all-out assault may be too apparent, and word might get out. It is still an option if all else fails.17) Why doesn\'t the school take the deaths and disapperances more seriously?Remember what the purpose of the school is. Why would they? The idea of having them stay on the island is addressed a bit more closely later on anyway. And they did halt the classes when the corpses of the victims started showing up.18) Why don\'t they halt the classes the moment some people stop showing up for class?Then they would never have class because they keep skipping class anyway.19) Why don\'t the students take more action?The moment victims start appearing, they increasingly go hide in their rooms. Gathering everyone in one place or trying to leave the island would be problematic too. That said, some of them are not barricading in hard enough, and you can see the result. On the other hand, isolating too much can make it easier to be picked off one by one, especially if there really is an alien menace or a third-party killer around. They could set up a system for keeping tabs on each other in some organized way, not that it would be foolproof. If you try to move around in groups, people will be reluctant to do so if they can\'t trust the other members. This is even more of a problem if there really are mind-controlling aliens who can influence people with weak psyches. Then people really would bunker down in their rooms, whether it is rational or not. Giving Nana some kind of security escort would have been a good idea though.20) Just go look for the aliensBy wandering in the woods in small groups? Or burning down the woods altogether? I suppose they could do so, not that it would help much against invisible aliens. They could also attack spam in a systematic way and see if they manage to land lucky hits. I think barricading in their rooms is the more likely action they would take though.21) Should have done more researchThis is a great idea, actually. The schemes would have been more effective if they had done much more research into the characters\' abilities beforehand. And they probably should have. The downside is that it gives the enemies more time to organize, as was about to happen, but it probably would have been worth it anyway.22) How about not revealing that you are a mind-reader and leaving the talent question open?Not a terrible idea because several students do that. It comes with its pros and cons though. It makes you appear more suspicious because people will be cautious of your unknown ability. Though mind-reading is already quite powerful in its own way. Not revealing it also removes the chance to tell people the helpful ""info"" that mind-reading brings. And if mind-reading is only your fallback option, people will be upset that they only learned about it afterwards.23) The schemes are too simpleSimple schemes are actually more effective. Why would you want your schemes to be so complex that you need multiple flowcharts? In real life, you can\'t predict other people\'s actions with arbitrary precision. The kinds of schemes that rely on outrageous predictions against astronomical odds will probably fail. Of course, there are many works of fiction (including quite a few anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, etc.) in which characters carry out such predictions and are lauded as geniuses. But they are not actually geniuses because the works do not present the actual means to carry out those predictions. Here the plans are plausible to construct.Here the narrative at least presents plausible and semi-plausible explanations for the events instead of the usual completely arbitrary impossible predictions and very unlikely coincidences. I would rather take flawed human reasoning than the kind of reasoning that is impossible for anyone except the omniscient. Yes, I prefer characters to be fallible humans than perfect (or ""perfect"") god-like entities.So what is this series actually about? Good and evil. Not ""the good heroes vs the evil monsters"" kind but the more nuanced kind in which characters sometimes actually think about their moral decisions.We get something with visceral malice, dysfunctional conscience, effective dark comedy, heaps of deception and irony, and surprisingly interesting dialogue. How despicable actions can you carry out until your conscience kicks in? Anything and everything, or is there a limit? And what kind of strain will this place on your future interactions with people? If you keep lying repeatedly, how difficult it will be to convince someone when you are actually telling the truth? As a result, the drama is actually dramatic and the comedy is actually funny. The quality of the dialogue is also surprisingly high, especially including the protagonist\'s inner thoughts. It is written in a witty way, juxtaposing a facade of seemingly simple lines with more analytical, viscerally heavy-hitting dialogue that tramples on the appearances. Meanwhile, the plot is regularly throwing twists at the reader, and some of them can actually be surprising, which is not something that happens all that often.Now, some people call this series a ""Death Note clone"" or ""Among Us + My Hero Academia,"" but I actually think it is something else. Those interpretations may have been effective at spreading word of this series and granting convenient titles to videos on Youtube, but they are also somewhat misleading. This series doesn\'t have to be Death Note or Among Us. It can be its own thing, and it is better that it is its own thing instead of trying to mimic those other options too closely. For instance, I don\'t think it is trying to be about outrageously complex mind games with characters somehow predicting dozens of moves ahead. It is more about the moral weight of murder, deception, manipulating public opinion, and exploiting people\'s weaknesses, and all the long-term consequences that come with those actions.There is actual moral tension, shifting moral alignments in a relatively believable way, a powerful sense of hatred and malice, dynamic character relationships strained by past deeds, and tons of delicious irony. The character relationships and interactions can be more dynamic than might appear at first. All of this also results in nice dark comedy that goes far beyond the norm. It blends in well with the drama and doesn\'t feel out of place.The dark comedy really is very delicious here. I often found myself laughing at the ironic deception, the thinly veiled threats, the outrageous juxtaposition between cheerful and dark thoughts, the dissonance between people\'s outward behavior and inner thoughts, and the relationships strained by what happened many episodes ago. It hasn\'t been marked with the comedy tag, but who cares? It fits my sense of humor better than most comedy I\'ve seen in anime, manga, light novels, etc. There is also meta-commentary and subversion of various common tropes. Seemingly generic heroic characters end up as something different, and tropes related to generic main characters are showcased, then brutally subverted.A few of the characters eat up the vast majority of focus, development, and the best dialogue. But better a few good characters than none at all. And the characters should often be introduced more organically, longer before their main role is played out.The voice actors did a great job here, Nana\'s especially. I also liked many of the facial expressions, the color-coding for inner monologue, and some suitably over-the-top visual choices like non-existent wind indoors for a big mental showdown, complete with dramatic music. The opening and ending songs are catchy, the opening especially, and the lyrics for both are very fitting. By which I mean that they are nightmarish in a personal, knife-in-the-heart kind of way. want to believe and hear what they want to hear.""It is not a bug; it is a feature. The author is trying to make a point here, and he is not trying to hide it. Call it social commentary if you like. More about that below.If you abuse existing misinformation and other characters\' motives, it isn\'t really plot armor. It is not as though you need additional coincidences for it, aside from the existence of the misinformation and the motives in the first place. Sure, some of the characters are legitimately too trusting or have issues with their mental health. ...Which can still sometimes be suboptimal writing, but that is different than plot armor. Not to mention, several of the events and beliefs are 1) explained in greater detail later on or 2) setups for future plot points with interesting payoffs. This doesn\'t apply to nearly everything, but sometimes you should be patient and try to look at the narrative as a whole.Well, let\'s go over some points and hope it won\'t turn into a full essay.[Obligatory spoiler alert, though I will try to avoid saying the biggest spoilers outright. There will be many mid-sized spoilers though.]1) Blaming the Enemies of HumanityIn Among Us and also in Danganronpa, for instance, the players and the characters are immediately told that there are killers among them. That is the premise. Here that is not the case, and there are potential scapegoats, most notably the dreaded ""Enemies of Humanity."" Original name, I know. (Nice troll, author.)Anyway, these aliens conveniently happen to be invisible or be able to influence people\'s minds, or at least that is what many characters believe. And why is that? Because the belief has been perpetuated by decades of government propaganda, all the way down to their textbooks.

Not ""the good heroes vs the evil monsters"" kind but the more nuanced kind in which characters sometimes actually think about their moral decisions.We get something with visceral malice, dysfunctional conscience, effective dark comedy, heaps of deception and irony, and surprisingly interesting dialogue. How despicable actions can you carry out until your conscience kicks in? Anything and everything, or is there a limit? And what kind of strain will this place on your future interactions with people? If you keep lying repeatedly, how difficult it will be to convince someone when you are actually telling the truth? As a result, the drama is actually dramatic and the comedy is actually funny. The quality of the dialogue is also surprisingly high, especially including the protagonist\'s inner thoughts. It is written in a witty way, juxtaposing a facade of seemingly simple lines with more analytical, viscerally heavy-hitting dialogue that tramples on the appearances. Meanwhile, the plot is regularly throwing twists at the reader, and some of them can actually be surprising, which is not something that happens all that often.Now, some people call this series a ""Death Note clone"" or ""Among Us + My Hero Academia,"" but I actually think it is something else. Those interpretations may have been effective at spreading word of this series and granting convenient titles to videos on Youtube, but they are also somewhat misleading. This series doesn\'t have to be Death Note or Among Us. It can be its own thing, and it is better that it is its own thing instead of trying to mimic those other options too closely. For instance, I don\'t think it is trying to be about outrageously complex mind games with characters somehow predicting dozens of moves ahead. It is more about the moral weight of murder, deception, manipulating public opinion, and exploiting people\'s weaknesses, and all the long-term consequences that come with those actions.There is actual moral tension, shifting moral alignments in a relatively believable way, a powerful sense of hatred and malice, dynamic character relationships strained by past deeds, and tons of delicious irony. The character relationships and interactions can be more dynamic than might appear at first. All of this also results in nice dark comedy that goes far beyond the norm. It blends in well with the drama and doesn\'t feel out of place.The dark comedy really is very delicious here. I often found myself laughing at the ironic deception, the thinly veiled threats, the outrageous juxtaposition between cheerful and dark thoughts, the dissonance between people\'s outward behavior and inner thoughts, and the relationships strained by what happened many episodes ago. It hasn\'t been marked with the comedy tag, but who cares? It fits my sense of humor better than most comedy I\'ve seen in anime, manga, light novels, etc. There is also meta-commentary and subversion of various common tropes. Seemingly generic heroic characters end up as something different, and tropes related to generic main characters are showcased, then brutally subverted.A few of the characters eat up the vast majority of focus, development, and the best dialogue. But better a few good characters than none at all. And the characters should often be introduced more organically, longer before their main role is played out.The voice actors did a great job here, Nana\'s especially. I also liked many of the facial expressions, the color-coding for inner monologue, and some suitably over-the-top visual choices like non-existent wind indoors for a big mental showdown, complete with dramatic music. The opening and ending songs are catchy, the opening especially, and the lyrics for both are very fitting. By which I mean that they are nightmarish in a personal, knife-in-the-heart kind of way.', '***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***My god, not even my first break-up when I was a teenie disappointed me like this anime did. I think that the comparisson is pretty accurate. Desilusion, a bad time, the feeling of “why did I keep on with this, when it was such a waste of time?”, and the consequent response of “I wanted to know how this was going to end, or if this can be saved”. All those things are in common.Munou na Nana is an anime that began strongly and that had a huge potential but, as you can expect from my rating, this ended up being the...whole opposite. The story takes place in an island for special kids (and I’m not only talking about their abilities) that are supposed to protect the earth from the “enemies of humanity”, where there is a school that is a sort of Boku no Hero Academy. And actually, that’s your first impression. Nanao, the human that it’s called the ‘protagonist’, is a talentless guy in a talents school. Later on, is revealed that Nanao is not talentless as such, but a guy with the talent to nullify the other’s talents. At the same time, while you’re told his story and how he suffers because no one knew his secret ability and everybody bullied him because of that (I’m sure the CIA told him to kept it secret in order not to control the world), the new girl in the class makes her apparition and gets along with him, a cheerful annoying girl whose talent is to read minds. I was yawning the entire episode until I watched the end of it, when the thing got spicy. I was amazed and thought that it was a great idea that I made it through the end of it, because my expectations grew after that exact moment when, in the final minutes, Nanao gets apparently killed by the new girl, Nana, letting you know that she is sent by the government in order to destroy and eliminate every enemy of humanity. The interesting part of it, is that the enemies of humanity are, indeed, the students that are caught up in that island and, of course, that place is not to educate them, but to have them separated from the rest of the world so they could be killed in mysterious ways. Excellent way of cheering up the party with this finale and that revelation, isn’t it?I waited up for the next episode to release, and I was so excited, but then it declined a little bit. I didn’t lose hope and tried to see the positive out of it, and it kept for the next two episodes. I even wrote and published a preliminary review saying this was going to be great! After the fifth episode, I had to delete it because, at that moment, I didn’t feel any of the positive things I said before.The plot continues with Nana killing another classmates, breaking that mask of cute girl from time to time to show her real behavior, having dark thoughts and openly expressing her hate for the other students, of course, when she’s alone. Another thing that was revealed previously is that she has no talent. She can’t read minds, she’s just instructed in body language and is careful enough to understand what’s going on in her surrounding. Suddenly, as more classmates keep disappearing, a  solitary cold guy from her class starts to suspects her and they begin an interesting and indirect war, where both of them try to develope the other’s intentions. At that point, I thought it was still good. But as it progresses and she starts killing indiscriminately, you realize how it gets even stupidier with every episode. Every person dies when she’s with them, and every times she excuses hemself with her fake cutie attitude, by saying that they were attacked by an enemy of humanity (what they believe that are monsters). And that’s it, her sacred word is never doubted, so no one suspects her and no one investigates, and I’m not only talking about Nana, but the school itself, everything is so weird, the professors don’t care at all for their students and neven hear them, and the students don’t even suspect a thing. Sometimes there’s even people that almost witnesses the crime and that, if they had two functional neurons making sinapsis, could easily deduce she was the serial killer. Of course, they don’t. I mean, she kills a stupid guy and, when she’s right next to his body, a stupid girl comes in and asks what happened. This stupid guy that was killed had the ability of premonitions and could keep them as photographs. The stupid girl, while examinating his body, finds out a picture of Nana killing Nanao, and she doesn’t even doubt of her. She just asks “Nana, what’s this?”.And this foolishness is repeated every episode. Her classmates never do anything except for Kyouya, the only guy that suspects her and follows her anywhere, and everytime tries to accuse her. He demonstrates in the first episodes that he is smart enough to play the game along with her, but suddenly, after ten episodes and actually knowing she tried to kill him, he still thinks that she can read minds and even gets dazed by her manipulations. Amazing. And that point is important because that makes me real mad because of how nonsensically convenient it is. A lot of times she makes huge mistakes in her ‘minds reading’ and ALWAYS puts the same excuse “haha, I’m sorry, I’m tired and I can’t focus”, and everybody says haha that’s ok. Sometimes, she even says things, by deduction, that every person with those acclaimed neurons could realize by themself, and everybody just gets surprised and reasure she can read minds. I’ve seen secondary characters that are shameful, cringey,  ridiculous or naive, but these are all those adjectives together but multiplied by 2000. It gets to a point where the stupidity of those characters and how blind they are  (that, of course, is a plot convenience) is shooking, illogical, and that you, as a viewer, actually wonder if the human being who made this story is trolling you or just thinking you are as braindead as them. After a little time you even feel insulted. Mangaka-sama, I’m not asking you to write those characters with an IQ of 160, nor to make them capable of beating her in that wit game, I’m just asking for them to, at least, suspect her or to lose trust on her. Nevermind, I’m not even asking for that, I’m begging you to give them a brain. Amen.Another poor thing about this anime is how they abuse of cliffhangers. Cliffhangers are great, are surprising, catches your attention and so, but when you use it A LOT, it looses its taste and you already expect it. Every episode is stupid and you are there, knowing that Nana is going to kill twenty students more and no one will ever notice, and you are already waiting for the cliffhanger. And you already know that the next episode, when the cliffhanger is solved, Nana will end up being free and innocent to everybody. Is not only that they abuse of this resource, but they actually never maintain what happens on that cliffhanger, since in the next episode, everything will return back to normal as if the cliffhanger never existed. Why did they make it for, then? Is obvious that they are doing that because they are desperate. Some episodes were boring and, just when you get something interesting, boom! Cliffhanger. After six episodes, they should already know that people are not falling for that anymore. Oh, yeah, I forgot, they think the audience is incredibly stupid.After a bunch of episodes of this one-dimensional pseudo yandere simulator and her mental deficient classmates with no personality, you get to know her past and her real personality. She likes mental games, she adores chess and Shogi, she’s a manga reader and her parents were killed, apparently, by an enemy of humanity that climbed up her window when she escaped from home to go get the last volume of her favourite manga at almost midnight. Relatable. When she knew what happened she felt guilty. Nevertheless, she reveals to her only friend in the academy (The stupidiest of them all, a cutie cringey girl whose voice is annoying and that’s the one that defends Nana to death) that, after all those years, she doesn’t even feel sad about it, she doesn’t feel guilt, nor hate, nor regrets. And when I thought that this could be an interesting detail of this character, she starts to think about that incident all the time. Until then she was a cold ass killer that never thought about her parents, and hastily she can’t stop thinking about it and, even though she said two mintes earlier that she doesn’t feel anything for that, she totally contradicts her statement in order for us to feel empathy for her, or that at least we think for one second and in the last two episodes, that she is not plain and hasn’t a poor writing. A lame resource, but it’s not that I was expecting anything from this show right now.The rest of the cast… I don’t want to keep defenestrating them since they are poor little humans betrayed by biology itself, who forgot to make a brain for them. Although, I have to make a summary. Kyouya, who I mentioned before, is a guy (with no development at all, of course) who at first hides his talent, but that later demonstrates that his ability is to be inmortal. This is the one who actually had a big potential since he was the only one whose neurons weren’t on a hunger strike at the beginning, but that didn’t last long, because episodes later he started with a nonsensical behavior. The idea was that he wanted to confuse Nana and make her think he trusted her, but it seems that the one that he confuses is, in fact, the viewer. Let’s see: he, at first, suspects her and almost spits that out to her face, and prooves he is not THAT stupid and that he could be at her level. Further on, he starts to make things like trying to be friends with her for no apparent reason. Okay. If we could understand him just by his actions, yes, it’s logical if we are confused (or if we don’t understand his reasons) since we don’t know what he’s planning to do or if it’s all just an acting to keep an eye on her. But no, the anime shows us his thoughts and his reasoning, and that’s where we see that he is actually not planning anything and he is just dumb enough to not realize obvious things. He just behaves like that because of the relief comedy of him not knowing how to make friends and so. And even when he does approaches Nana to investigate her, he gets fooled by her and her “psychic powers”. At the beginning, I thought he was just pretending to be fooled by her, but no, when they show you his thoughts, you really know that he doesn’t have a clue about Nana not having any talent. And is contradictory! By moments he unfolds an entire intelligent deduction, and by moments he is an idiot who doesn’t know where he is standing. Then, what is the point of this? Kyouya is a wasted character who wanted to be a smartass and forgot the first five letters of the word.The rest of the cast is even lamer. Inukai Michiru is the most adorable and stupid of them all, an hypocrite who swears that wants to help and save all the people she can, but that blindly denies that Nana is the one hurting and killing everybody. If she really wanted to make a good, she would, at least, wonder why Nana is always when the assassination takes place, why Nana never lets her heal nor inspect the victims’ bodies, why Kyouya steady accuses Nana, why she found a pic of Nana killing Nanao, if she was that sacred deer she believes she is? Is ridiculous. However, by the last episodes, we also see Michiru’s past and how she and Nana are becoming besties, using Michiru as the moral trigger that pulls Nana over the threads and makes her wonder if she’s doing a good deed in name of humanity, or if she’s just being used and deceived by the government. Of course, despite she’s a smartass that can cheat an entire bunch of obtuse students, she’s slow enough to question her actioning after twelve episodes and several cold kills, but nevermind. We, the audience, are even slower, we’re not gonna notice that flamsy construction, aren’t we?After those that I mentioned, I had a headache, so I’m not gonna extend more on this. The rest of the characters are the same and worse. You got a fire guy that is the enemy of an ice guy, you have the bullies, and so. All of them respectfully adore Nana and follow her anywhere. The persons she killed, died because of their non-base-confidence and because of that adoration for her leader (who was chosen as their leader because ‘why not?’). I mean, how can you be so confident when there is a serial killer in the island where you are trapped, and when every classmate of yours is disappearing? Not even one character is compelling nor act in a logical way, in order to ease the task to Nana and to make her look like a great unbeatable character. It’s like feeling strong when you’re winning an arm-wrestling against a one-handed person. Another plot convenience that insults you in the face.In terms of animation and sound I don’t have complaints, but I don’t have compliments either. Everything is common and nothing I would recall. Some VA are annoying and some characters design are likeable since they are very different from each other. The uniform is nice, too. They also abuse of the resource of the darkened face when Nana is in a hurry, and abuse even more of the red and blue background, like some sort of cheap Death Note. At first that one was interesting though, but when they use it all the time to leave the Nana’s voice-off, it loses its effect, and it’s worse when they try so hard to make Kyouya fit the blue side, as if he could be a real opponent for Nana. Guess what? He’s not.In conclusion, this is a regular animated show with no praising audiovisual work, with flat, awfully silly and absurd characters that will get to your nerves, with a story that started with a really good premise and that ended up in just a “wannabe” with a lot of ridiculous plot armors and the over-use of repetitive resources that were not used as they should. One undeniable thing is that if we need to pass through twelve episodes to say this is worth it, it is definitely not. A plot twist can be good, but there’s no plot twist THAT good to save a whole disaster as big as Munou na Nana. Normally, I try to make a closure that equals bad and good points, but in this anime there’s nothing I can save, so… Don’t. Don’t watch it. Unless you’re as stupid as the public they are aiming with this show, of course, but that’s up to you. whole opposite. The story takes place in an island for special kids (and I’m not only talking about their abilities) that are supposed to protect the earth from the “enemies of humanity”, where there is a school that is a sort of Boku no Hero Academy.

It got boring cover, boring MC and everything seemed like trash. Later on someone said that this is best shows in season with Majo no Tabitabi. I was really curious why someone would say something like that.So, I started to watch first episode. It was so boring. Generic shonen male protagonist in generic setting and then there was this generic pink haired potential love interest for that generic protagonist. I was bored in halfway of episode. I was so close...to dropping it that point. But the ending was something totally different. Whole episode flipped like Gakkougurashi! I was hooked in instant. I watched rest of episodes after that.This series is sooo good! This psychological thriller is going to be instant classic like Higurash or Gakkougurashi!I don't want to say much so I don't spoil anyone but it is really rare to see anime like this one. to dropping it that point. But the ending was something totally different. Whole episode flipped like Gakkougurashi! I was hooked in instant. I watched rest of episodes after that.This series is sooo good! This psychological thriller is going to be instant classic like Higurash or Gakkougurashi!I don't want to say much so I don't spoil anyone but it is really rare to see anime like this one."", '*No spoilers* Read the edit at the endThis anime... dayum, was I not expecting this. It\'s a real breath of fresh air. Honestly, it\'s a hidden gemIn terms of story, most of the 1st episode seems pretty lackluster. Even the synopsis on MAL is pretty repulsive... At first, it seems like a cliché story about your typical shounen MC who somehow has a ""useless"" power that\'s in some way super brokenEverything makes you want to drop this anime but the author saved this series with a last minute switcharoo - honestly, I won\'t spoil what happens, but the whole plot turns upside down and the...whole focus of the story becomes a totally different person. From then on, with each following episode it keeps surpassing my expectations. If you like mystery, plotting, psychological, a very calculating MC, you\'ll love thisIn terms of characters, it seems a bit goofy at first but it gets a lot better on the second episode and forwards.

While this doesn’t completely sum up the series, it’s a pretty good introduction to the world.I’ll preface by saying Munou na Nana is one of the only manga I actively enjoy reading these days. So when I found out that it was getting an anime adaptation I had pretty high expectations for the series. I believe those expectations were met and came away with this in my top four shows of the season.What makes this series so special for me is that Nana is a morally grey character. A lot...of times we tend to see the world as right and wrong, black and white, etc., when in reality it’s usually grey. Everyone is evil from someone’s point of view, and this anime and manga really test your ability to accept other perspectives. If you judge Nana from the perspective of her classmates, you will find her to be an evil character. If you put yourself in her shoes, you see that things are not quite that simple.On top of the moral ambiguity, the arc that the anime covers is really a battle of wits. It’s Nana vs Kyoya as she races to complete her task of eliminating the students, while he gradually closes in on her. I think the tension between the two throughout the season is amazing. The internal monologues that detail the characters’ strategies that allow you to gain an insight and understand their actions really well. There’s no leaps in logic because everything is explained to you piece by piece. I’ve never seen it, but I’ve been told there’s a lot of similarities between Nana and Death Note in this regard, so if you liked that, you’d probably like this.Art and animation are solid enough. This isn’t a battle shonen, so I don’t expect super fluid animation, but when needed it’s more than adequate. I thought the OP performed by Tomita MIyu was one of the best of the season and the ED is my pick for ED of the season. I thought the OST in general was well put together.In the end, the mental and tactical warfare between Nana and Kyoya provided 12 weeks of consistent entertainment. On more than one occasional you’ll be forced to reconsider whose side you’re on and what’s right and wrong. adapdation wise, I have no issues with the anime, so based on my love of the manga, Munou na Nana gets 10 watches out of 10. of times we tend to see the world as right and wrong, black and white, etc., when in reality it’s usually grey.

It builds up everything in its favour in the first episode, only to discard it in the subsequent ones.  Although the concept works, the execution and the characters, especially the characters, don’t.The show is a murder mystery, but not for us. We already know “whodunnit” in the first episode, but the characters don’t. It’s set in a world where some children manifest superhuman abilities, and are sent to a...remote island to train their powers to perfection in order to defeat the ‘Enemies of Humanity’; but little they know, they are the very force they’re training to fight against.Yes, that’s right, the “heroes” are the “enemies”, and an assassin is sent to the island, by some government officials, to kill them off before they become aware of this fact; but little did the officials know that developing superpowers makes you dumb as fuck and all of the children would probably perish via the process of natural selection. The characters are literally dumber than kindergarteners. It’s like they left their brains at home before coming to this island.Nana, the main character and an assassin, is talentless, i.e has no superpowers and has to convince everyone that she has one using her superb deductive skills. She masquerades as a person who can read minds. The premise is interesting, really interesting, but what drags this show down is undeniably the mentally challenged characters. They just don’t care. They don’t give two shits if someone dies, or if someone goes missing. One bullshit explanation from Nana is all it takes for them to channel their inner simp and believe her instantly.Think I’m exaggerating? Consider the following scenario.A transfer student arrives at your high school. She starts hanging around a guy. The next day the guy is absent. And the day after that, and the day after that too. Turns out he’s dead. Also, in the meantime another guy dies and he was also seen hanging around the transfer student. Another one dies, and this time the transfer student is literally caught with the dead body.Now, using just 1% of your brain, who do you think is the most sus? The transfer student, right? WRONG! She couldn’t do it. Because how could she? She’s so cute and also the class leader.I just described the first 5 episodes of the show and except one guy no one even suspects her. The only guy who does suspect her, Kyoya, is my favourite character and my hero. He managed to defeat his inner simp and bonk away his horniness for justice.I kid but I really do feel like Kyoya is the only good character in the series. Nana is simply annoying at times and I’m not going to reiterate what I already said about the majority of the cast.The mysteries themselves are pretty good. I could see that the author was especially inspired by Detective Conan as the show makes many references to DC. What bothered me most about the series, besides the idiot characters, is the show’s reliance on coincidence. Nana is saved countless times by sheer luck, or should I call it plot?She accidentally leaves an incriminating picture of hers in a room, but Kyoya doesn’t find that very picture when he searches that room. Kyoya has been portrayed as a methodical and scrupulous person, but turns out when plot calls characterisation can just jump off a cliff.Michiru, the dumbest bitch to ever exist, literally sees Nana in a picture killing a guy, but does absolutely nothing about it. Some stupid explanation from Nana about “how the picture is not true” is all it takes for her to believe Nana.Seriously, when I say the characters believe in Nana, it's almost similar to how religious people believe in their God. Countless times in the series she’s not able to read minds, and even though it’s her supposed power, and no one bats an eye. She can pull some random stuff out of her ass about how “her power comes and goes” and no one thinks anything of it. Remember, this is a girl who’s been allegedly involved in 4 murders while having no alibi for any of them.As I stated above, even though the braindead characters reduce some enjoyability, the actual mystery is really good at times. I especially like the whole arc when Nana kills the necromancer girl and how she would get out the events following that. The whole event was well planned out and didn’t feel forced. I was genuinely intrigued during the resolution of that case. This show could’ve done so much more if it had some better characters and the characters had better judgement.We get some backstory for Nana, and it felt like the author wanted to make her story really tragic, but it backfired as the whole thing is narrated by Nana which felt more like the author’s attempt at fulfilling his obligation towards us instead of creating a compelling case for his character. Same thing goes for the exposition we get about Michiru’s life before she arrived at the island.The animation and music are nothing special. The music was tone deaf at times.Tl;drAs I said earlier the concept is really good, but bad execution, dumb cast, weak character work really hurt this show in the worst way possible. remote island to train their powers to perfection in order to defeat the ‘Enemies of Humanity’; but little they know, they are the very force they’re training to fight against.Yes, that’s right, the “heroes” are the “enemies”, and an assassin is sent to the island, by some government officials, to kill them off before they become aware of this fact; but little did the officials know that developing superpowers makes you dumb as fuck and all of the children would probably perish via the process of natural selection.

I'm loving it honestly, to the point I've even started reading the Manga because of it. That's just how much I'm enjoying it. Here is why!The anime starts off like a typical setting you'd see in most shows, with a simple setting of heroes and a villain to face. Pretty standard stuff, which isn't bad, but it lays the groundwork for what is to come. It's a genuine surprise when it happens, and it becomes a completely different show then previously imagined. It went from an anime that could be seen as alright, or good watch, to being one of...the stand outs of the season honestly. You'll love it from start, to it's eventual finish. It's first few episodes have shown that, and I cannot wait to watch more as the story goes along.The characters are a mixed bag so far, some are bland, but others are obvious stand outs, and seem to have most of the attention and for good reason, to help push the plot along. Both are very good, as it's good to have characters to fit a certain element, but also have great leading characters to like and get behind. Not that the more background cast are bad, but more the focus is on certain characters than others. Which is perfectly fine by any means. Mainly our pink haired girl herself in Nana, whom can be seen at first as a typical cute and happy go lucky girl, but that is oh so far from the truth. Which is great.The art is simple, but it's colourful, and well detailed in parts. Not off putting at all, along with the sounds making the atmospheres when needed look good, and very fitting for what it's delivering. Very good on all parts. I can already picture that certain scenes that I already know about are gonna look great when it comes to this style. Very well done here.This show is honestly one of my faves of the season. I'm keeping up with it and love it a ton, so check it out! the stand outs of the season honestly. You'll love it from start, to it's eventual finish.

The characters are desperate and what highlights the show, naive, naive and more naive and with 2 of iq. This is the only thing that keeps the anime going. Nobody suspects anything, especially of a girl who arrives as a new schoolmate and in which two people later disappear.The conversations are ridiculous, they try to sound logical, but everything goes overboard with the twists of the script or the forced feelings they instill in to keep the plot going.There is no memorable cast and...their personalities are even flatter than boku no hero's, they just randomly appear to die.

I\'m just hate watching it at this point because I am too far in to just drop it.Nana- a basic edgy bitch who really isn\'t smart, all her actions are so forced and her plans are very basic. They do the same things every episode with her and It\'s all so very predictable and repetitive.Other characters, You could replace them with rocks and the story would remain the same. No personality. Bland and boring. A poor excuse for characters.Kyouya- He is the only one who is calling Nana out on her...bullshit but is always second guessing himself for no other reason that plot armor.Art- It\'s nothing mind blowing, but it is decent. They try to make Nana look evil by making the screen red whenever she is doing evil planning but if anything it takes away from the seriousness. I would find it creepier if she always just planned her killing with a smile and a normal screen because then it would imply that that killing these students is not such a big deal to her.Animation- MediocreSound- Nothing memorableThe story is repetitive. ""A girl needs to kill the classmates because these kids are evil."" That\'s it. That\'s the show. People call it a BNHA and Among us love child but I find it an insult to both BNHA and Among us.

I can't speak to the details without spoiling things, but rest assured that the gears get turning very quickly and keep you hooked. The plot is rather breakneck in speed by most single season anime standards, and it's honestly a nice refresher from the all-too-common...slogs.The show also quite easily delivers on its promise of suspense. The stakes continually seem to rise and only sometimes read as contrived. Momentum too from episode to episode is preserved really well and it made binging the show in a couple of days a really enjoyable way to consume it.There is a lot more to praise Talentless Nana for, but I fear I'd be overselling what is ultimately an unfinished and unsatisfying experience.As I alluded to above, the show only sometimes reads as contrived; the problem is when that begins and how it persists. After a few mini arcs, the audience learns very quickly the kind of formula that's being utilized to make this show tick. It's not that it gets worse at executing that formula; I actually think the show hits its themes and goals better as it goes on. It's just that by the time it hits its stride, the magic is already gone. The structure of an episode will already have become formulaic enough to be predicted by a viewer early - sometimes even as early as during the cold open. By the time the climax of the show is coming to a head, every plot point seems to just happen because the story needs it to, not because the characters are behaving like rational, reacting beings.Everything just feels too convenient after a while.The characters themselves are mostly whatever. The two leads are easily the most compelling, with the majority of the others being mostly flat, static background noise with varying amounts of screen time.Talentless Nana's biggest weakness, and why these problems are ultimately unforgivable, though, is the way it ends:It doesn't.Like far too many shows that come each season, Talentless Nana is an incomplete adaptation of a manga that has long since moved on and has no indication of a season 2. Any promise the show made has been left undelivered and the show suffers in posterity for it. I'm so tired of anime that serve as little more than extended previews of a manga or light novel series that will never be adapted in its entirety.The show is fun and it's really easy to binge, but it amounts to nothing. If I ever want to see the conclusion to this story, I'm going to have to read the manga, and that's just exhausting. This is a series that had the potential to go out with a triumphant bang and is instead an unfinished, sputtering whimper. slogs.The show also quite easily delivers on its promise of suspense.

""Munou No Nana"" is, while not the *worst* anime this season, it certainly is nowhere near the best. Without getting into too many of the details regarding the story as a whole, I\'ll review this quickly.Story: The writers are hacks, nobody on the writing team knows what the term ""suspense"" means or even how to meaningfully build a world up. Talentless Nana is an awful excuse...for a superhero story if you go into this hoping for a ""My Hero Academia"" rip off that has some of the enjoyment of that series, you won\'t find it here. And if you stick around after the fact, you certainly won\'t find anything deeper or more fulfilling after the fact. Nana is a show filled with plot holes, shoddy explanations for the world the characters are in, and repetitive writing. Each episode the MC finds themselves in the *exact* same situation they were in last episode just this time ""Ohhh boy the stakes are higher, what shall they do to get out of this one I wonder?"" If you\'re into faux mysteries and shitty plot twists, I guess this is right up your alley then, but I wouldn\'t rec this to anyone whose a fan of anime that has a thing for twists and mysteries. Talentless Nana has one job, and it fails miserably at it, which is to be an enjoyable and engaging anime with a neat story. The only thing it really has going for it is episode 1. I was told to go into this blind, and I did, and I can genuinely say episode 1 was the only episode I felt like I was really ""into the show"" as it were. So all in all, Poor world-building plus shitty plot twists plus terrible mystery equals a very bad story for an anime.Art: It\'s nothing special, and I can\'t say I don\'t hate it, but I certainly am not loving it. I think it\'s cute, but some of the designs of the characters legitimately just remind me of other more interesting shows I could be watching instead, and yet here I am watching this.Sound: I...don\'t like the OP. I don\'t think it\'s neat, and I\'m not putting it in my playlist. The same goes for the ED. Both uninspired and not very listenable on their own. Or maybe it\'s just me not wanting to actually associate with this show for longer than I have to. It\'s generic Jrock if you like it you like it if you don\'t you don\'t, nothing more to really add to this fact.Character: Oh boy, where to start with this one? I\'ll tell you right now, the only character I really like is Nanao, that\'s about it. Other characters like Kyouya or Nana, however, are just unbearable to watch for me. Especially Kyouya. I just don\'t think he makes a good foil for the MC since he always seems to just be conveniently useless for the sake of the plot. Michiru would be cuter if she weren\'t dumb as a box of rocks, and not in the fun Nendou kind of way where she\'s a dumbass but she\'s funny and loves her friends, in the Keichi Maeda way where she just does the stupidest shit for no reason, and we the viewer just have to accept that she\'s apart of the main cast and here to stay for possibly the whole season. Nana has one gimmick for her entire character and it\'s played literally every 10 seconds she\'s on screen, so when she does it one time you\'re like ""Aw how cool"" but after she does it the 30th time in the SAME episode you kind of wish the story wouldn\'t focus on her as much. The other students are okay-ish, though some of them seem like really poor rip-offs of other characters from more popular series. Like the angry fire, boy gives me real ""Bakugou vibes"" with none of the intriguing character or personality. It\'s a shame though because we don\'t *focus* on any of these other classmates for very long, so we don\'t really get to know them as people. And thus, it\'s almost like they don\'t exist at all aside from background noise and to let the main cast shine more (or shine as bright as they can with their horribly written personalities)Enjoyment: All in all, I hate this show lol. This is kind of a first for me because I\'m not usually one to hate on a show. I give anime as many chances as possible to please me, but this one is just not at all a fun watch. The repetitiveness, the pure idiocy of some of the characters, the blandness of everyone in the background whose ""not important"", the glaring plot holes, and the lack of world-building makes for a really shitty watch.Overall: Go watch Assassination Classroom or My Hero Academia if you want a fun superhero/ Assassin type show with teenagers. And go watch literally anything else in the ""mystery"" category if you want a show with actual good plot twists and well-written character dynamics. Don\'t waste your time with this one. for a superhero story if you go into this hoping for a ""My Hero Academia"" rip off that has some of the enjoyment of that series, you won\'t find it here.

So all in all, Poor world-building plus shitty plot twists plus terrible mystery equals a very bad story for an anime.Art: It\'s nothing special, and I can\'t say I don\'t hate it, but I certainly am not loving it. I think it\'s cute, but some of the designs of the characters legitimately just remind me of other more interesting shows I could be watching instead, and yet here I am watching this.Sound: I...don\'t like the OP. I don\'t think it\'s neat, and I\'m not putting it in my playlist. The same goes for the ED. Both uninspired and not very listenable on their own. Or maybe it\'s just me not wanting to actually associate with this show for longer than I have to. It\'s generic Jrock if you like it you like it if you don\'t you don\'t, nothing more to really add to this fact.Character: Oh boy, where to start with this one? I\'ll tell you right now, the only character I really like is Nanao, that\'s about it. Other characters like Kyouya or Nana, however, are just unbearable to watch for me. Especially Kyouya. I just don\'t think he makes a good foil for the MC since he always seems to just be conveniently useless for the sake of the plot. Michiru would be cuter if she weren\'t dumb as a box of rocks, and not in the fun Nendou kind of way where she\'s a dumbass but she\'s funny and loves her friends, in the Keichi Maeda way where she just does the stupidest shit for no reason, and we the viewer just have to accept that she\'s apart of the main cast and here to stay for possibly the whole season. Nana has one gimmick for her entire character and it\'s played literally every 10 seconds she\'s on screen, so when she does it one time you\'re like ""Aw how cool"" but after she does it the 30th time in the SAME episode you kind of wish the story wouldn\'t focus on her as much. The other students are okay-ish, though some of them seem like really poor rip-offs of other characters from more popular series. Like the angry fire, boy gives me real ""Bakugou vibes"" with none of the intriguing character or personality. It\'s a shame though because we don\'t *focus* on any of these other classmates for very long, so we don\'t really get to know them as people. And thus, it\'s almost like they don\'t exist at all aside from background noise and to let the main cast shine more (or shine as bright as they can with their horribly written personalities)Enjoyment: All in all, I hate this show lol. This is kind of a first for me because I\'m not usually one to hate on a show. I give anime as many chances as possible to please me, but this one is just not at all a fun watch. The repetitiveness, the pure idiocy of some of the characters, the blandness of everyone in the background whose ""not important"", the glaring plot holes, and the lack of world-building makes for a really shitty watch.Overall: Go watch Assassination Classroom or My Hero Academia if you want a fun superhero/ Assassin type show with teenagers. And go watch literally anything else in the ""mystery"" category if you want a show with actual good plot twists and well-written character dynamics. Don\'t waste your time with this one.', 'Never before I have read the manga adaption nor the LN but I\'m guessing it has an unwanted ending.The story so far is really good, each episode intensifies than the last one.Rather than focusing on expectation on the character\'s outcome after each episode, I find it interesting how each character plays out and it\'s something that totally hypes me never knowing what\'s gonna happen in between those scenes.[A little spoiler]........It is exciting to see a ""talentless"" given the challenge how to expose the abilities of those ""talented\' using wits before finding a way how to eliminate them one by one at a time. .It is exciting to see a ""talentless"" given the challenge how to expose the abilities of those ""talented\' using wits before finding a way how to eliminate them one by one at a time.', 'This is one of those shows that gets you interested for the first few episodes, and gradually you get tired of it because the plot either becomes way too predictable, or the characters act so stupid you can\'t bare to watch anymore.Spoilers ahead:The show focuses on a non-talented assassin that works for the government to infiltrate and eliminate a group of young talented individuals. The problems start right after episode 1 when they introduce the main antagonist/assassin known as Nana, who is faking being a mind reader.They make her out to be a ""master of deduction"" of sorts, where her fake mind reading ability is...really just from her great intuition/meticulous focus on her surroundings. This fake power choice honestly ruins almost the entirety of the show for me. No matter how good they make her out to be at acting like a mind reader, if you can\'t legitimately read minds among a group of other people with real abilities, she should be exposed almost immediately.Even though it should be incredibly easy to expose her as a fake, the main rival who is also a detective of sorts, lets her off the hook nearly dozens of times within just the first few episodes where it should have been obvious that she was lying about her powers.This isn\'t anywhere near the level of some great battle of wits like Sherlock Holmes vs Professor Moriarty, or a Yagami Light vs. L, its honestly just embarrassing as you watch this girl get out of trouble over and over again by sheer luck.I\'ll leave my review at this since I don\'t want to go into deep spoilers.I will just say that if you truly want to enjoy it, try to turn your brain off and not think about the show, because you\'ll just hurt your brain trying to rationalize the events that come to pass. really just from her great intuition/meticulous focus on her surroundings.

I am not someone who tells ppl to watch more than 1 episode ""until it gets good"", but this is good from the first second, you just haven\'t learned the true plot yet and haven\'t realized it.So rare we get the chance to see a anime who makes you think like this one.Unlike detective shows in which you cannot see the entire picture and then the MC pulls out some proof that wasn\'t even on camera, in this anime you can deduce most things before they are explained by the detective.The art, the...colors, the op, the ed are amazing.

Vibrant colors and a sorrowful ed with a ""what if scenery"".A classic in the makings.', 'Talentless Nana is an ugly show about a class of braindead kids with superpowers; one by one, they get murdered by the titular psychopath. It\'s a reverse murder mystery, meaning you have to figure out how Nana will plan a murder without being caught—rather than identifying the killer.The premise is interesting, but the execution is disappointing. Nana\'s plans to murder each student rely on their stupidity to succeed. Unfortunately, the show also lacks the gore or humor to be mindless entertainment—and it\'s too dull to be worth watching. You barely get to see anything of the killings, except for a few dead bodies. Lame. At...first, I didn\'t like it because of the abundance of plot conveniences. Around the middle, I became used to it and enjoyed seeing dumb people get killed. By the end, I was tired of the same formula. It overused cliffhangers until I stopped caring about what would happen next week. In the end, it attempted a last-ditch effort to be profound and memorable. It was so forced and melodramatic—yet not even bad enough to be ironically funny. In a nutshell, this is a decent time-waster but ultimately disappointing.The story takes place in the far future. A small percentage of humans are born with superpowers known as the ""Talented,"" and without them are the ""Talentless."" For five years, a war was waged between the Talented and the Talentless. Cities were bombed to ashes in an attempt to genocide superpowered people. The Talented fought against the government because they didn\'t want to be the country\'s lab rats. They were stigmatized because some of them had dangerous and uncontrollable powers. Decades later, the Talented were accepted, but they\'re isolated from normal humans.You\'ve probably heard of this premise before in great stories like X-Men and Watchmen. In Talentless Nana, the superpowered high school students get sent to ""training academies"" on secluded islands. Once there, the government sends an assassin to the academy to murder every student. One of those assassins is Nana.The plot that ensues is a cat and mouse game between Nana, a pink-haired serial killer, and Kyouya, one of her superpowered classmates. In the same vein as Death Note, she is the villain-protagonist in a battle of wits against a cold and apathetic detective. They play mind games with each other like Light and L, but it\'s dumbed down for a teenage audience. Nana\'s thoughts are tinted blood-red hue, and Kyouya\'s are blue. So red is bad, blue is good—very simplistic symbolism, of course. We wouldn\'t want the children to get confused about who\'s the ruthless murder or the detective.Nana and Kyouya\'s inner monologues are meant to be taken very seriously, but they\'re so cheesy it\'s hard not to laugh. When Nana\'s red filter covers the screen, she switches to her Evil Voice, and we get a close-up of her crazed face, wearing a comically evil grin. Whenever a monologue happens, the pace grinds to a halt. Still, we need them. If you removed every monologue, all we\'d have is a poorly animated high school murder mystery with lots of awkward pauses and angsty teens. Studio Bridge struggled to adapt the inner monologues. The entire scene freezes in place, like a PowerPoint presentation. The director awkwardly framed all of these shots; you can see where the text box would be. It felt like I was watching actors read pages from the manga rather than an actual anime.While watching Talentless Nana, it\'s obvious the writer expects us to be idiots. He used heavy-handed monologues to describe things we could figure out through simple observations. We\'re not babbling babies. Don\'t spoon-feed us obvious information. Over explaining simple things doesn\'t make them intelligent. Nana\'s plans to murder her classmates are so logically flawed; it seems like the author assumed we wouldn\'t notice his lazy writing. There\'s no fear that Nana is in danger because the writer made sure everything would work in her favor. If she\'s attacked and pushed onto the ground, she\'ll find a weapon on the floor. Her plans rely entirely on her classmates\' mental deficiencies. Everything could fall apart if just one of them had a brain cell rattling around in their empty heads.I want to be clear, don\'t expect this to be anything like Death Note. That would be like hoping for a beef sirloin only to get a stick of bubble gum. Although this anime has some exciting twists, the plot is directionless, and it\'s ridiculously unbelievable how Nana gets away with murder. It happens time after time—a new student gets introduced, Nana plots to kill them, then she attempts her murder. Her victims range from smooth brained kids one through ten. They\'re bullies, creeps, idiots, and unlucky schmucks who had it coming anyway. It\'s hard to tell if the show wants us to feel bad for the victims because all of them are unlikeable. Inevitably their superpowers become their entire personality. Many of them were just blank-faced nobodies, wandering around the school looking like ghosts.None of the students deserve to die. They\'re just stupid kids, not terrorists like Nana seems to think they are. Nana is far more dangerous than any superpowered student because she hides behind her false identity as a mind reader. After the first kill, you begin to wonder, ""Huh, how has no one realized that everyone who gets close to Nana dies?"" They\'re that dumb. I lost my mind when a student discovered a photo of Nana murdering someone, then proceeded not to tell a single person.I can\'t stand ""thrillers"" where all kinds of horrible things happen because all the characters are either too stupid to catch on or too cowardly to do anything about it. The whole ""manipulative sociopath"" premise only works when the surrounding characters are of believable intelligence. There\'s not one brain cell between the entire student body. Check out Kyouya in particular. This moron plays the detective role in the show. He has overwhelming evidence that she\'s evil, but he doesn\'t stop her. At this point, a reasonable person would take matters into their own hands, yet he chooses not to. His excuse is, ""No one will believe me because she\'s more popular."" For some reason, he never realizes he could simply use his superpower to stop her with force.The anime\'s saving grace is Nana, who balances charm, mischievousness, and psychotic undercurrents. Her sociopathic ""All these kids are devils"" persona is cringe-inducing, but it\'s fun to laugh at her. Towards the end, her black heart softens, making the only emotional scenes in the show. It\'s fun to see her maniacally outsmart Kyouya, but there\'s not much to her. I wish she had some development before the final minute of episode 13. Her backstory is super predictable, but at least it explains her motivations. Still, Nana\'s decision are unbelievably convoluted. She was sent to the island by an anonymous government bureau to kill students who have done nothing wrong.We\'ve made it this far, but I still want to know one thing. What exactly does Talentless Nana wish to be? A satire of superhero shounen anime? A black comedy? A cheesy slasher? Death Note for babies? It seems like all of these ideas inspired the writer, yet he couldn\'t settle on one. As a result, it can\'t choose which target to aim for, so it hits none.The commentary on superheroes boils down to a straightforward question, as Nana said, ""Anyone who attains superpowers without any efforts will always become arrogant… If we let immature humans with immature psyches have superpowers, would the world survive?"" It\'s a thought-provoking idea, but not in this anime.Talentless Nana doesn\'t have the campy slasher thrills I was hoping for, mostly because it\'d rather waste time pretending to be profound. In attempting to tell a complex, morally gray story of an ice-cold spy and her ethical compromises, the anime became an awfully complicated story about forgiving a killer who doesn\'t deserve anyone\'s sympathy. The people who will say this is well-written have cut the writer a LOT of slack, or simply don\'t care about its flaws. The cringe levels here are unlimited, and the art quality is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this, do so as a drinking game. Every time you cringe, take a shot.

There\'s isn\'t particularly much animating as a lot of the show is carried by dialogue rather than action. But the overall aesthetic is nice and clean and fits the theme. The scenery looks good....Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 8/10------------------------------------------I\'d say pretty good quality across the board.Story - 7/10-------------There are people with superpowers in the world, and there also so called ""enemies of humanity"". A group of teenagers with superpowers are sent to a private island for training to one day fight said enemies. But before long, mysterious deaths start occurring, and it\'s up to the kids to figure out what\'s going on.The story isn\'t particularly complex, and is mostly focused on a cat and mouse dynamic between killers and those trying to figure them out. One can talk about mystery, but in truth the mystery aspect is shelved fairly early and the show quickly evolves into a detective/killer show-off. A sort of Sherlock Holmes vs Moriarty dynamic which has been explored in the past with other shows such as Death Note. Though it is arguably a lot more simplistic. Plot armour is used perhaps a tad much to resolve some situations, and there are behaviour plot holes if you start paying too much attention.The show does takes a somewhat interesting dive into human morality and manipulation, and explores the psyche of what it means to kill, to lie, to deceive. What is justified in the name of the greater good, and so on.Characters - 7/10---------------------The show features many characters, though only a handful get any real focus. The MC is the heavy focal point, while the ""villain"" acts as a solid counterweight, while a few additional secondary characters muddy the waters with both their actions and their overall morality.The MC starts out very one dimensional, but as the story progresses we understand more and more of their psyche and how their actions start to affect them over time. While their counterpoint starts off as a more mysterious individual, who eventually becomes an obsessive deterrent to their actions, while also developing a friend and ally relation, which is a rather unique dynamic.One can say that a lot of the characters, especially secondary ones are rather ""dumb"" and clueless of what is going on. But in all honesty, it fits the premise of the show. Teenagers are best portrayed dumb, because they are. There ain\'t a single adult that thinks they were smart as a teen.On the other hand, stupidity and cluelessness aside, there is a lack of reaction and proper engagement in many situations.One can assume that giving every single character the appropriate behaviour and reactions would lead to the entire runtime taken up by the event of the first few episodes alone. So I\'ll give the show leeway to sweep some stuff under the rug, in order to play out more of the story.---Total - 8/10---Talentless Nana is quite a fun show for anyone into the supernatural, psychological thrillers, detective shows, and teenage interactions. As long as you don\'t expect too much. Death Note level of depth there is not.Also, fair warning - the show is not complete. The show doesn\'t end exactly on a cliff-hanger, but it\'s safe to say it ends in the middle of whatever story is being told. Unless there\'s a sequel in the works, you must be prepared to search out the source material to know how everything resolves.

One can talk about mystery, but in truth the mystery aspect is shelved fairly early and the show quickly evolves into a detective/killer show-off. A sort of Sherlock Holmes vs Moriarty dynamic which has been explored in the past with other shows such as Death Note. Though it is arguably a lot more simplistic. Plot armour is used perhaps a tad much to resolve some situations, and there are behaviour plot holes if you start paying too much attention.The show does takes a somewhat interesting dive into human morality and manipulation, and explores the psyche of what it means to kill, to lie, to deceive. What is justified in the name of the greater good, and so on.Characters - 7/10---------------------The show features many characters, though only a handful get any real focus. The MC is the heavy focal point, while the ""villain"" acts as a solid counterweight, while a few additional secondary characters muddy the waters with both their actions and their overall morality.The MC starts out very one dimensional, but as the story progresses we understand more and more of their psyche and how their actions start to affect them over time. While their counterpoint starts off as a more mysterious individual, who eventually becomes an obsessive deterrent to their actions, while also developing a friend and ally relation, which is a rather unique dynamic.One can say that a lot of the characters, especially secondary ones are rather ""dumb"" and clueless of what is going on. But in all honesty, it fits the premise of the show. Teenagers are best portrayed dumb, because they are. There ain\'t a single adult that thinks they were smart as a teen.On the other hand, stupidity and cluelessness aside, there is a lack of reaction and proper engagement in many situations.One can assume that giving every single character the appropriate behaviour and reactions would lead to the entire runtime taken up by the event of the first few episodes alone. So I\'ll give the show leeway to sweep some stuff under the rug, in order to play out more of the story.---Total - 8/10---Talentless Nana is quite a fun show for anyone into the supernatural, psychological thrillers, detective shows, and teenage interactions. As long as you don\'t expect too much. Death Note level of depth there is not.Also, fair warning - the show is not complete. The show doesn\'t end exactly on a cliff-hanger, but it\'s safe to say it ends in the middle of whatever story is being told. Unless there\'s a sequel in the works, you must be prepared to search out the source material to know how everything resolves.', ""Munou na Nana tells the story of Nana Hiiragi, a murderer disguised as a student at a school where students have peculiar skills, and where she has a mission to kill one by one of the students.I find it very interesting how some information from the first episode does not seem to have a very important or important value in a way, the anime just started, and it subverts the meaning of this information during the anime. In the first episode, the anime appears to be the same generic school work as always. The character design, the initial “protagonist”, the way they express themselves, the...scenarios etc. We are guided in this logic of a more common and less innovative anime until the end of the episode when the anime reverses this logic. The character of Nana Hiiragi kills the first of her victims (Nanao Nakajima), who until then was the protagonist who would guide the story, and from that moment on, the character takes on this role.It's a twist that may sound a little forced in a way, there are few animes that manage to do this type of thing and sound natural, but the anime (in its form) makes it clear that something is not correct during the course of the first episode itself, and this will be the Artistic System that will define the way everything will be staged in a large part of the work.The anime makes use of general plans where normally, there is some element closer to the viewer and another element further away. Usually, what stays away from the viewer on the plane has some very strong value to the plot, whether that is some contained personality, feeling, information etc. This works very well for me, it seems that we are never close to information, anime always seems to keep some details away from the viewer, or, what is far is more important than what we see close by.The anime also makes good use of some Dutch Angle that feel unsteady, as if something is not right. The more distorted this angle is, the more instability it goes through the scene. There are some moments when he moves from an unstable angle to this Dutch Angle, which reinforces the moments even more.I think that in most of the anime, director Shinji Ishihira managed to balance the sense of the plot very well in the way he stages everything. At least, most of the time I was able to feel inside this idea of \u200b\u200bnever being able to know what is really going on.One thing that bothered me a little during my experience, was how at times the anime exaggerates with a voice-over in the nude to keep connected with the more sadistic side of Nana's character. When the character enters the “Mind Game” mode and goes on formulating strategies and providing information there is no problem, but the anime exaggerates in wanting to expose this side of the character too much, which in my view could have been more contained. If we didn't remember so much that the character is actually a murderer, we would be more connected to that idea, because everything would seem more natural if they didn't have these constant breaks.I also didn't enjoy the more melodramatic side of the ending so much. I don't think it came so forcefully, even because the anime tries to develop this more human side of the main character a few episodes before finishing the work, but still it is not developed in such a surgical way. The anime even manages to create a great relationship between the characters of Nana and Michiru Inukai, and unlike the director's more enigmatic look at hiding information and feelings, here he is more sober, he balances very well what is on the scene. As if in those moments he had nothing to really hide from the public.The objective was to try to confront this idea of \u200b\u200bthe character in relation to those individuals who have powers with a more human side. Perhaps the Inukai character was really created for this purpose. But, the big reason why I feel that this dramatization was not so perfect, is that our eyes are never interested in wanting to dramatize anything. As I said during a good part of this review, the director's choices guide our senses to other feelings, feelings that are more ardent, ambiguous and even tense. I don't think it was a horrible ending, but he was unable to perfectly assimilate these two systems.Concluding. I loved Munou na Nana. I have to admit that, like in other anime, I already stepped foot behind the design, the story and everything, but the well-articulated twists both in the story and even more because of the way it was very well directed and staged by Shinji Ishihira helped to make sense of all those choices. scenarios etc. We are guided in this logic of a more common and less innovative anime until the end of the episode when the anime reverses this logic.

The story follows Nana who is talentless in a world where they are a bunch of talented people who are regarded as the enemy of humanity or sum. They were all sent to an island to ""train"" their abilities but in reality, they were being separated from the world because they are dangerous IIRC; as an ""ordinary"" human, Nana\'s mission is to kill all the talented on the island.As I said in the beginning, the concept of this series is something that would rival the concept of Death Note,...but the execution is terrible; this is Death Note but if L, Near, and Mello were portrayed to be intelligent but lacked common sense. The main problem with this series is the contrast to what, IMO, made Death Note so good, the lies Light was capable of making up alongside his brilliant acting made it extremely hard for L to say he was 100% Kira, in this series Nana is similar to Light in terms of acting but when comparing their deception, she is sub-par and her arguments as to why she can\'t be the killer are portrayed to be far more solid than they actually are.I\'ll give the story a score of 6 due to being above average with a good concept but the characters are what really sells it short, what makes it worse is that I recently came around to watching Death Note and I can\'t help but compare them, but even without doing so if you are someone of average problem-solving skills you will likely find yourself pausing the anime and thinking about what just happened and asking yourself ""Huh? Why aren\'t they asking x?""Art - 6The art isn\'t anything special but it is pretty appealing when compared to the average anime, it is something that doesn\'t really stand out but you can look at it and go ""This is nice."" Besides that, there isn\'t really anything else I really wanna say about it.Sound - 4Similarly to the art, there isn\'t really anything I can say about the sound other than it is ok, nothing revolutionary that hypes you up, but also not bad that it makes you focus on it. I can\'t really remember anything about the sound which is both good and bad since it implies it isn\'t memorable in being bad or annoying nor is it memorable for being good. The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 6 is that I like the opening and the ending, it is not something I would normally consider part of the ""sound"" but eh.Character - 2These characters are abysmal which for some reason that word sounds like a good thing. The characters are the main problem with this show, they are extremely dumb, and even when they catch Nana red-handed with their ability, she escapes by killing them since the character\'s character/personality allows her to find a way to exploit it and kill them without anyone finding out, I am posting this as of episode 6 and I can guarantee she is going to strangle that yellow hair girl that is a necromancer, how do I know that? Well, it is implied with the emphasis on an iron chain under her bed and we are 6 episodes in unless there is some kind of war where the talented rebel against the one holding them on that island with Nana leading the charge and somehow redeems herself to the point everyone accepts her, it is unlikely that girl is going to survive. While that explanation of how she kills sounds good on paper, it is awful in practice as she has always somehow lied her way out of the situation while logic dictates otherwise.let me show you an example as to why these characters don\'t have common sense. In episode one, Nana kills one of the characters, it is later deduced by the antagonist (If you consider Nana the protagonist) and the time traveler that Nana was the last one with the dude that was killed in the location he was killed around the same time yet she is still alive, according to Occam\'s razor, if there are two explanations to an assertion, the one that makes more sense and has the least amount of assumptions is more likely to be correct, therefore should be considered correct until there is something proving otherwise. The assertion/question is who killed the dude/how did he die, was he killed by Nana, or was he killed by an enemy of humanity and Nana somehow survived, logic would dictate that it is more likely that Nana is the killer rather than the former, but let\'s move on.As a side note, the antagonist may not have known if not just the time traveler but I don\'t remember what happened exactly and I am not about to rewatch and find out.The second instance of someone dying was the time traveler, the time traveler was mostly with Nana in attempts to find out who killed/what happened to the other dude. The time traveler later dies, it is quite suspicious that the two people who were with Nana the most were killed, but let\'s continue. The third instance of someone almost dying was the antagonist or the yellow hair girl, I don\'t remember which came first but I think it was the antagonist so imma go with him. After becoming friends with Nana, an entire shed exploded and she was the first one to appear on the scene at a moments notice which would imply she was extremely close to the explosion while also holding the cat which was supposed to be in the shed where the antagonist was inside when it exploded and the only reason he was in there was because of the cat. The antagonist survived because he is immortal seemingly having some kind of regeneration. This would make anyone believe Nana was trying to kill you, seeing as she was the last person who was around you and the only person who could\'ve known that you have no sense of smell, this is even more evident with all the previous suspicion.I was going to continue over every instance but this review is too long so I\'ll just attack the recent killing. After the dude who can take photographs of the future died, they held a funeral where the antagonist was going to do an autopsy but was stopped by the Necromancer who said they can find out how the dude died and who killed him. After hearing this, Nana was gung ho on not doing it because they should let him rest in peace and later putting on an extremely weak act in an attempt to argue that this dude\'s soul was in pain and only stated this after finding out the necromancer doesn\'t know anything about his soul. She could\'ve made a variety of arguments as to why not to do the autopsy such as it being morally wrong and he isn\'t a doctor or something of that nature in attempts to discredit his verdict or discourage anyone from agreeing to go through with the autopsy.The antagonist could have easily exposed her as to why she is so against it and refuted each of her arguments while his verdict would\'ve been supported by the necromancer, but he doesn\'t even challenge her arguments and just lets it slide and there wasn\'t even a reason for them not to do the autopsy, the weak argument given as to why they should not use necromancy is because the dude\'s soul was hurting. All the antagonist had to ask is ""What is more important? Finding out how the enemies of humanity are killing our friends which would, in turn, save our lives at the cost of a dead person\'s soul hurting or leaving it be without any knowledge on how our friend died which leaves all of us at risk of dying since we have no way on countering it.""I would like to continue explaining other things like how her ability is easily refutable by asking bizarre questions or just asking ""What am I thinking"" then thinking about something that no one could guess unless they had the ability to read minds, such as ""The souls of water is black"" that makes no sense but if you could read minds you would be capable of guessing it. But I digress.Enjoyment - 4I am tempted to drop this anime because it annoys me at times and the characters make no sense, I believe in those paragraphs I made it very apparent why I dislike the series.Overall - 5Because 6+6+4+4+4 = 24/5 = 4.8This series can be summarized as Death Note but the Death Note is replaced by abilities, L lacks common sense, and Light is terrible at lying while everyone else is mentally challenged and also slightly f\'ed up or just lack skepticism. but the execution is terrible; this is Death Note but if L, Near, and Mello were portrayed to be intelligent but lacked common sense.

If you don't like it, you don't like it, but if it does click for you, you'll love it like I did and want to jump right into the source material.People may call Talentless Nana a blend of My Hero Academia, Death Note, Promised Neverland and Among Us, but in reality it's its own unique story that differentiates itself from the others.  Yes, its setting is a school for kids with super powers, yes...it involves a showdown of 2 intellectuals as one of its sub-plots and yes there is a deeper truth hidden below the surface, but this season was really just a prologue.

I expect the story to differentiate itself from the others quite a bit in future seasons if we are lucky enough to get them.My one complaint about Nana is that its first 8 episodes got a little repetitive.

And for this to be done, the anime must be competent, both in offering something that brings interest to the public, and in not deceiving it in the future, creating a story that totally breaks with what the show created from the beginning. Munou na Nana is another one of the countless examples of anime that gets lost in the middle of the road, because it stumbled on so many flaws, that...currently I can\'t even define what this season really was.First of all, it is extremely important to say that Munou na Nana MUST NOT be defined as ""A combo of Death Note and My Hero Academia"", as that would be an extreme offense to two of the most famous anime franchises.Munou na Nana brought elements that really resemble the two aforementioned shows, but it should not be confused that his role as an anime is neither to focus on a school of heroes, nor to be totally intellectual. The anime has more predominant and own elements, which worked in a different way from what is expected in anime and manga in general, however Munou na Nana already faces a problem in this topic. The show tries to be different, working much more on the situations that Nana faces, than really developing a good group of characters. With the exception of Michiru, Kyouya and Tachibana, the rest of the group is either irrelevant or not well presented. This also points to another problem with anime. But before talking about them, it is necessary to introduce each one of them, to introduce the show better.The first is Kyouya, the smart guy. He is responsible for unraveling Nana\'s strategies, although Nana is not fully punished or accused for actions, as she always does something that deceives Kyouya\'s brilliant mind. Michiru is probably the most wronged character in the anime, as she has a need for friendship with a Naná. Let\'s say she is a dog embedded in a human being. I don\'t see it as a problem, it just bothers me to see how such a sweet and friendly character has a sad future waiting for her. The third is Tachibana. It may seem strange, but Tachibana can become a key piece to show in a likely sequence. This is due to the ability to copy powers of other ""Talented"", in addition to having relationships with the island\'s past, which can change Nana\'s thoughts about her future actions. All of them, together, create a unique relationship with Nana and the show clearly shows this, almost assuming that they will be the most important for the whole show. The age of nana with them always being cautious and never acting unconsciously. As much as she has some difficulties, she knows that the 3 characters will also be the most important to her.Nana managed to kill 7 (or something similar) characters, which already shows that, although she is a ""Talentless"", she has an incredible ability to persuade students in order to always save themselves from situations. However, when we see an immense number of deaths being presented, it is expected that some emotion will be returned to the public, which does not happen. The show tries to add drama or forced scenes to convince us that Nana is a badass and that the rest of the class is totally inferior (except for the 3 characters developed), but the anime was not even able to convey the dangers and situations wisely. where Nana was spotted. From the moment Tsunekichi dies, I have given up on believing that Nana would be caught in any way, as the show had numerous loopholes and makes all characters limited in convincing when it comes to accusing the your own leader.And it\'s not just that ... Munou na Nana also fails in the construction of the scenes, so that it is embarrassing to see them. The fit of scenes in which Nana presents a duality between mind and natural state is misplaced, strange and increasingly winding up the anime. This does not mean that this type of technique does not work in anime. Death Note, for example, knows how to hold the audience for longer than this show, which pretends to be something, but does not mean anything.Furthermore, Munou na Nana\'s own world has a ridiculous, or poorly explained, construction. It is understood that the threat to humanity is ""Talented"" themselves, but what about parents? How do powers work? Is it just these kids who have these powers or is it something that has spread wildly around the world? And perhaps most importantly: do you need to kill these children? Honestly, none of these questions convinced me that the show would be productive. It is not really functional when it comes to exploring the outside and focuses entirely on an island, where what happens there seems to define the destiny of humanity. I understand the anime\'s ability to put that aside and focus on that in the future (the end of the anime shows that this could be the future of the show), but seeing a season full of death and uninteresting attacks is much more tiring than knowing a little most of all. You don\'t need to use the protagonist to convey this, just showing the government organization explaining the actions would be enough.I don\'t say that the show is a complete waste of time, he has really cool moments and I like Nana as a character. Mind games take on the role that the rest of the anime has sinned, making the show remembered for that. Nobody will say that he liked Munou na Nana because of the powers or the strategy of the government, but he will certainly have the conflict of Kyouya x Nana as the main factor that makes the work special. Still, the show is not completely saved. Again, the single deaths and the cringing scenes destroyed much of what the anime could be. It was nothing less than an anime with an incredible proposal, but it fell into a limbo of errors and became another famous show that will be forgotten in the following seasons. I\'m not surprised, since after seeing Gleipnir, any other edgylord anime or being an adult doesn\'t give me any hope. Really, the second half of 2010 was a golden age for anime ... I wanted more anime at the level of Code Geass and Death Note today. For now, we have to appreciate this ""masterpiece"" of modernity.Finally, Munou na Nana was one of the most difficult shows to end that I found recently. I confess that I liked the work of Bridge studio and I think the show can improve. After the situation that the show ended, it looks like it will now have a promising sequence (if we have that sequence). It\'s not a totally horrible anime, but I can\'t seem to point out so many good aspects, which keep the show as a whole. The characters definitely need to improve, in addition to the show\'s need to better explain everything that is going on, so that we don\'t just follow an intriguing emotional battle without emotion. I really wanted to look at this show and give it a better evaluation, but the disappointment was great, the construction of almost everything was ridiculous and even the songs hindered the fluidity of the show. When I reviewed Gleipnir, I assumed that this show would be the one that has an inexplicably high fame for what the anime is. Munou na Nana went further, gained a surreal popularity and managed to be worse, displeasing the majority. I\'m sorry to those who liked this, but I see no reason not to think the show was bad. Furthermore, anime needs to be more expressive and less indifferent, as this becomes a huge problem in shows known for not having enough time to sympathize with the characters and the story itself. currently I can\'t even define what this season really was.First of all, it is extremely important to say that Munou na Nana MUST NOT be defined as ""A combo of Death Note and My Hero Academia"", as that would be an extreme offense to two of the most famous anime franchises.Munou na Nana brought elements that really resemble the two aforementioned shows, but it should not be confused that his role as an anime is neither to focus on a school of heroes, nor to be totally intellectual. The anime has more predominant and own elements, which worked in a different way from what is expected in anime and manga in general, however Munou na Nana already faces a problem in this topic. The show tries to be different, working much more on the situations that Nana faces, than really developing a good group of characters. With the exception of Michiru, Kyouya and Tachibana, the rest of the group is either irrelevant or not well presented. This also points to another problem with anime. But before talking about them, it is necessary to introduce each one of them, to introduce the show better.The first is Kyouya, the smart guy. He is responsible for unraveling Nana\'s strategies, although Nana is not fully punished or accused for actions, as she always does something that deceives Kyouya\'s brilliant mind. Michiru is probably the most wronged character in the anime, as she has a need for friendship with a Naná. Let\'s say she is a dog embedded in a human being. I don\'t see it as a problem, it just bothers me to see how such a sweet and friendly character has a sad future waiting for her. The third is Tachibana. It may seem strange, but Tachibana can become a key piece to show in a likely sequence. This is due to the ability to copy powers of other ""Talented"", in addition to having relationships with the island\'s past, which can change Nana\'s thoughts about her future actions. All of them, together, create a unique relationship with Nana and the show clearly shows this, almost assuming that they will be the most important for the whole show. The age of nana with them always being cautious and never acting unconsciously. As much as she has some difficulties, she knows that the 3 characters will also be the most important to her.Nana managed to kill 7 (or something similar) characters, which already shows that, although she is a ""Talentless"", she has an incredible ability to persuade students in order to always save themselves from situations. However, when we see an immense number of deaths being presented, it is expected that some emotion will be returned to the public, which does not happen. The show tries to add drama or forced scenes to convince us that Nana is a badass and that the rest of the class is totally inferior (except for the 3 characters developed), but the anime was not even able to convey the dangers and situations wisely. where Nana was spotted. From the moment Tsunekichi dies, I have given up on believing that Nana would be caught in any way, as the show had numerous loopholes and makes all characters limited in convincing when it comes to accusing the your own leader.And it\'s not just that ... Munou na Nana also fails in the construction of the scenes, so that it is embarrassing to see them. The fit of scenes in which Nana presents a duality between mind and natural state is misplaced, strange and increasingly winding up the anime. This does not mean that this type of technique does not work in anime. Death Note, for example, knows how to hold the audience for longer than this show, which pretends to be something, but does not mean anything.Furthermore, Munou na Nana\'s own world has a ridiculous, or poorly explained, construction. It is understood that the threat to humanity is ""Talented"" themselves, but what about parents? How do powers work? Is it just these kids who have these powers or is it something that has spread wildly around the world? And perhaps most importantly: do you need to kill these children? Honestly, none of these questions convinced me that the show would be productive. It is not really functional when it comes to exploring the outside and focuses entirely on an island, where what happens there seems to define the destiny of humanity. I understand the anime\'s ability to put that aside and focus on that in the future (the end of the anime shows that this could be the future of the show), but seeing a season full of death and uninteresting attacks is much more tiring than knowing a little most of all. You don\'t need to use the protagonist to convey this, just showing the government organization explaining the actions would be enough.I don\'t say that the show is a complete waste of time, he has really cool moments and I like Nana as a character. Mind games take on the role that the rest of the anime has sinned, making the show remembered for that. Nobody will say that he liked Munou na Nana because of the powers or the strategy of the government, but he will certainly have the conflict of Kyouya x Nana as the main factor that makes the work special. Still, the show is not completely saved. Again, the single deaths and the cringing scenes destroyed much of what the anime could be. It was nothing less than an anime with an incredible proposal, but it fell into a limbo of errors and became another famous show that will be forgotten in the following seasons. I\'m not surprised, since after seeing Gleipnir, any other edgylord anime or being an adult doesn\'t give me any hope. Really, the second half of 2010 was a golden age for anime ...

God spare me from another so called ""Diamond in the rough"".The story is supposed to be a suspense murder mystery seen from the eyes of the killer. Where one false step would lead to their demise at the hands of the ""Talented"" heroes. Instead we have a farce of a main character that resorts to crying wolf whenever her paper thin façade is tested by the singular individual that has more than a distant acquaintance...with his mental faculties. Doubtlessly the only reason she\'s so smart is that in comparison everyone else is as witty as a box of wax fruit. It wouldn\'t have taken much to catch this ""Zodiac Killer"".Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, thrice is enemy movement... if someone is at the scene of every crime they\'re either the killer or the cop. It really doesn\'t take much deductive reasoning to come to that conclusion. But then again that might be expecting too much from characters that don\'t seem to have developed object permanence. Maybe they\'re ""Talented"" because they were dropped on their collective heads one too many times as children and now Nana is there to administer euthanasia.After all it doesn\'t take a genius to kill a vegetable.

However, by the time the season wraps up, you start to understand that the ""plot holes"" are created by the subjective/limited viewpoint of the characters, and what we are really seeing is just their understanding/perspective, and not legitimate plot holes at all. It all starts to add up and give little bites and pieces of something deeper going on behind the scenes.In the end, I actually binged all 13 EPs in a single night.

A dull boring simple-minded show about a young boy’s school life. And then.... it hit you. Murdered in cold blood.Talentless Nana tells a story of a young girl who second guesses herself. Nana lost her relatives at a relatively young age and was raised by a ‘government body’ to do their bidding,In this case, her job was to kill students that contain ‘special powers’ as the government body deemed them...as humanity’s future threats - causing the lives of hundreds of thousands to perish. She was given a device to estimate the future kill counts each individual would achieve in the near future.If I were to describe Talentless Nana in a sentence, it would be something along the lines of “ An Among Us and My Hero Academia crossbred anime”Art - 8/10There is no reason to complain about the art for the anime. The anime did justice for the manga by sticking to the original designs for each and every character in the manga. If anything, it’d come down to personal preferences and if I do say so myself, the manga  had a good pallete when it came to choosing character designs.Sound - 8/10When push comes to shove, the anime brings in music that fits perfectly with scenes. However, there are times where the anime just feels ‘boring’ as though stagnant when progressing through certain scenes. I’m sure that with enough touching up, the scenes would perform better with the addition of more sounds.The voice acting was great. You could hear the fear during the deaths of each character, the shock when finding a body, the dreadfullness of not being able to find the killer. These little things make the anime much less ‘empty’ with a good set of emotions.Character - 10/10Everything Nana was told to do was all a lie. The death counters for everyone were faked so that the government could give Nana a reason to “kill off kids” with special powers. So everyone in reality, was actually innocent. They were wrongly killed and by the time she realised this, she had already killed of many students.“What have I done.... Was there really a need to kill them?”She constantly ponders whether Michiru would have caused multiple deaths. Whether a kind guy like Nanao could end up killing a million. Although some are good, there are also slightly bad characters like the photo foresight dood and the necromancer lady. So with these “bad apples” she stopped doubting each time she killed another. Michiru...... changed her completelyEveryone has a sweet spot for someone, and for Nana it was Michiru. Michiru opened up to Nana wholeheartedly, never doubting her in any situation, truly a Friend you would treasure most definitely.Through each episode, we see character development in Nana. A journey of self-realisation.Not just Nana, but every other character had their own unique traits and personality.Enjoyment 8/10Sure the anime is good to binge watch. But after a while, it doesn’t stick to your head making you think ‘Ah, I just want more of this’. It doesn’t give you the drive of emotion to continue to push for a season 2, but it does give you the push to recommend it to your friends to watch.Overall 9/10A genuine hidden gem from this season. It neeeds a bit of touching up to score a 10 but it’s a worthwhile experience for anyone who wants to begin/ watch anime. as humanity’s future threats - causing the lives of hundreds of thousands to perish.

It not only exceeded my expectations,but made me thoroughly impressed. Starting with EP 1, I surmised from entering and finishing EP 1, that it would be some sort of story, where the strong wited kills the weak minded. However, this evaluation was proven erroneous slightly. After EP 1 and 2, the atmosphere changed rapidly, where emotions such as doubt roamed the area and I experienced some death note vibes. This is due to two highly intellectual minds clashing against each other and this is the foundation of...satisfaction I gained from this anime. I simply loved the deduction process where Kyouya would try to piece together evidence and information he gained to disclose the guilty killers. Each step he took, just results in a tense environment, which is maintained throughout the anime. This kept me engaged in his thought process, making it seem as if I were apart of his contemplation.The characters introduced where interesting but many aren't really unraveled and given much time on screen, but some characters involved in the climax are present throughout and gives time for me to digest them, resulting in me understanding them bit by bit. For example, a character named Michiru, is what startled me the most at the end of the series. When firstly introduced, I didn't anticipate much from her except her undying kindness to everyone she meets, however by having her appear more and more, I realized as the audience that she isn't some sort of friend where she would just run away from a dire situation and stay innocent as a flower. The determination, ambition and resolve she mustered up is truly stunning and the decition she made at the ending is heart wrenching, but understandable. Thus making me realize that Michiru is someone I underestimated and that she had a much bigger role to play in the story than I imagined. Aside from her, only a few more characters were pleasurable.The art design and animation were definetly on the better side and the voice actors are sufficiently good enough. The whole plot is average I guess, but what made the anime stand out is how it was put together and displayed to us really well. Each EP , questions that needed answering were flouting around, which peeked my interest and kept me occupied and not die of boredom.Hopefully you've reached the ending of this subjective review, and thought carefully. As the reviewer I think I should added more details regarding this show, but then you'll be here reading forever. Pls, give this a go and remove any negative thoughts from your head.

In a school full of talented people, with their abilities being able to kill thousands and even millions of people, Nana is tasked to stop these people by killing them. Yet, the story twist as Nana's unable to understand why someone like Michiru is trying their earnest to help and save Nana. Nana thought that the Talented are all murderers, or have the potential to kill. Only in the last episode, that Nana felt that that wasn't true and her entire world view was changed by what happened with Michiru. I think...this anime truly is a very imaginative drama that makes you feel that Nana will get caught and the Talented will kill her. Yet, there are still so many layers of story building going on as she tries to kill the Talented. Nana is caught in a quagmire, as she tries to figure out her own feelings. Even though she is once suspected as a killer in the class, there is another imposter among us. Munou na Nana is indeed an interesting watch and it certainly piques my interest as I read the synopsis. I recommend it to those who the thrill of Nana getting caught yet not get it. Masochistic I guess? This is an 8/10 for me. Quite an interesting watch this season. It does truly get your heart racing and blood pumping. this anime truly is a very imaginative drama that makes you feel that Nana will get caught and the Talented will kill her.

Writing this mainly because it deserves to be defended, as I think there are really good aspects about this show that entirely redeem its weaker spots. I've finished it a couple hours ago. I should probably watch it a second time as it has replay value, given the multiple clues you can find in every episode.Okay I think there's no debate as to what is wrong with Munou na Nana : the goddamn low IQ canon fodder of a character ensemble. They flat out suck, their development is terrible, we are not given time to...really know them (they have very simplistic personalities anyway). There are a few lovers who can even die without us giving a sorry shit about it. It's near being unforgivable how weak character building is.The crime mystery aspect of it, though being quite comprehensible and overall pretty solid technically, really suffers from the stupidity of the victims. They kinda ruin the smart stuff in this show and the author really tries hard to entertain us with some great chess-like mindgames (these get really A-grade in the manga btw). It would have been so great to have more insight in regard of all these characters who fall victim before the MC. Maybe the first episode format needed to be repeated more that once, meaning we would have been closer to every characters and their wits, before they finally checkmated by Nana-chan's. Anyway there is a major issue with the story-telling. We are emotionally tethered to people only but too late in the show. Even the first episode not being subtle enough and seeming really off from the get-go, because of the gimmicky false MC and Nana's really pushy behavior, fails to make us care about anybody. Nana's tragic past should have been introduced much sooner, maybe from the second episode, maybe only partially, bit by bit. She is the greater part of this show.After the 13th episode, I think Nana has been successfully fleshed out, thanks to the insights we get on her flaws and her relationship with Michiru. Even with all the weak spots aforementioned Nana grows out to be a really likeable character. Following her thinking has been really interesting and the VA is doing an awesome job. Her schizogirl personality and her facial expressions helps a lot with us giving her attention and investing our emotions. Yes she starts off as being kinda deranged, but that being said, we understand quite quickly that she is maybe the sanest person on-board ; the main flaw of the story is once again the fact that the author fails quite miserably to depict the Talented as being essentially monstrous rather than retarded, Mirichu-chan being herself the exception who makes Nana's iron-will and certitudes crumble violently.Technically you know there's not much money nor time invested in the show. It's by no mean ugly, it's simple and efficient, with details on critical scenes. Clearly the supporting characters lack a little bit of something, they have no charisma whatsoever. I think the visuals needed to be maybe darker, more mature. Concerning the sound, I feel like the music has been very discreet. Scenes with strong emotional value are accompanied with rather generic violin, so pretty forgettable. Now the ED, I've found it to be really cool and efficient, always coming in  after a systematic cliffhanger. The strong aspect of the show is the voice acting, I've never felt anything was uncanny about it ; the actors did a great job in a show that is kind of an emotional roller-coaster at times, especially the MC's VA.In the end the path from manga to anime should have been a stronger, more free adaptation, with more depth and a different storytelling. In a nutshell, more work, more characterization and whatnot's, but then I guess this would have needed a lot more episodes. I went in by curiosity, I stayed for the MC. Being a reader of the source material, I do believe there's some potential in it, things become really interesting at around chapter 50, but it's a really long way to go, as the story from the end on this first season up to there, gets kinda weird and awkward ; stuff that has low probabilities of making the cut in anime format, without an overhaul of the story-line.

Munou Na Nana is an exception.I will start by saying about the conscience of history, first I must say that this anime simply has its weaknesses, for example few talented people have a cognitive ability to understand what is in front of them, just some characters who manage to do the basics.The story itself develops over Hiragi Nana, the anime develops its story, and her...emotional changes.Over the course of the anime we see that, the anime is correct in passing the viewer the emotion that the anime develops over the main characters, the anime fails in some unnecessary arcs.The sound work of the anime leaves nothing to be desired, but it could be better. I see many scenes where the sound work could be perfect in relation to the scene, the trace of the anime is completely unique, it has a personality that at times can make you disturbed and at others comfortable.What is essential to me in an anime is how much the anime keeps the viewer entertained with what is going on.Simply amazing, the anime in no time becomes massive, that was above my expectations, every end of episode you get instigated to see what will happen later on.Overall, it's worth seeing, trust me.Interesting fact: Kyouya Onodera has the same last name as me lol10/10 emotional changes.Over the course of the anime we see that, the anime is correct in passing the viewer the emotion that the anime develops over the main characters, the anime fails in some unnecessary arcs.The sound work of the anime leaves nothing to be desired, but it could be better.

This review will contain spoilers!first we have the story. I watched about 2 minutes in, completely bored with the generic setting and the moment the transfer student, Nana enters the classroom I just stop watching.Then my friend told me that the show was actually pretty good, so I continued watching. And let me tell you, the first episode was really good so I had really high hopes. Basically the anime portrayed an ordinary guy with seemingly no powers as the main character and then made a plot twist at the end...to continue the perspective from the murderer Nana or Hiragi as her classmates call her.But then whenever someone died she got away with it for the stupidest of reasons. An example of this is in ep 7 where the crazy girl could have killed Hiragi and lived her life in peace with her dead boyfriend, instead of being threatened by Hiragi. Then Hiragi is close to every person that go missing or die and they can’t even make a weak connection.And guess what, the dude who is supposed to be the detective gets information out of nowhere (reminds me of death note) but still can’t figure out whether she killed them or notIn conclusion the story has yet to be finished but so far it’s just decent since they might give some explanation later in the anime.The talk about story got a bit long so I will wrap up real quick now.Art 5/10Nothing memorableCharacters 2/10No good characters and none of their brains are larger than peasEnjoyment 3/10I enjoyed the first episode but it all went downhill from thereOverall 3/10It’s basically shit with some budget and very poor logic, you could say it’s the child of classroom of the elite, among us and death note! to continue the perspective from the murderer Nana or Hiragi as her classmates call her.But then whenever someone died she got away with it for the stupidest of reasons.

Now, what you often see in these mostly negative reviews is that there are dumb characters and coincidences. I won\'t deny that, but I ask you this: Is that bad? Let me all remind you that Death Note, one of the most beloved anime, opens its main story by a super dumb decision from Light where he kills Lind L. Taylor without any reason other than he...made him angry. Not to mention that a lot of coincidences drive the plot like Lights family not finding his small TV in the chips or the rain starting to cover Lights face by an umbrella or Ryuk developing an apple addiction which makes him tell Light where all the cameras are even though he doesn\'t want to interact (as he said before). Not to mention that the series introduces one of the dumbest characters with Misa, but she is kept around because she has a special ability. I could sit here all day picking out coincidences or even dumb decisions by these geniuses (like Light revealing himself to the FBI agent before he dies), but I think you get the point that this already not reduce the quality of the story. But now, imagine that you don\'t have geniuses but average teens who are too confident in themselvea because they are seen as special due to their powers? Please tell me again how this is a flaw in the narrative?Now, I won\'t go into too much spoilers in the actual review (a bit more of that below). The anime is not perfect, but it is definitely worth a watch. The story revolves around a school with students that have supernatural abilities. But fear not, this is not a budget MHA. Because the enemies are not villains but monsters called ""Enemies of humanity"" that are said to have various powers like being invisible or even able to transform into humans. A lot of students therefore suspect that these monsters might be among them (pun intended) which leads people to distrust others and also hide their abilities (which in return makes them even more suspicious). As you already guessed this leads to a mystery where no student knows who to really trust but again, these are just average students otherwise so dumb decisions are not out of the realm of possibility. Before I go into the spoiler part, let me say that the voice acting is on point, the same with the music. The animation is as you would suspect from a mystery nothing to write home about, but that is not a problem since the anime knows how to frame the scenes to still make it interesting. Now, I can\'t really go into more without spoiling, so either go watch the anime or read further if you are not convinced yet.As you might have guessed, the whole plot around monsters seems to be a bit artificial which is because it is the case. There are no monsters. In fact, there was a war between ""normal"" humans and those with abilities. After the humans won, over time they changed their strategy and made up a system that openly accepts talented but sends them to an island where they are trained, but actually are killed by a murderer. This murderer is Nana, who has no talent, but in order to not be suspicious, she claims to be able to read minds. Nana now has to not only make sure that no one figures this secret out by being observant and using clues to appear as to read minds but she also has to kill the students while not knowing their abilities at first.The comparison to Death Note comes in here, because we follow Nana, hear her thoughts, see her plans, but we also see her ""opponent"", a guy who is suspect of her, but has not enough clues to be sure or openly accuse her. The dynamic is close to the beginnings between Light and L where Nana often tries to create evidence that she is nothing but an innocent girl. But there is where the similarities end. Because where Death Note is about Lights descend into developing a God complex, Nanas character development is the opposite. At first, she is not hesistant to kill these people, not just because it is her job, but because of her backstory as well. However, she still is a girl, so even unconsciously she is starting to warm up to the people she is supposed to kill just by being around them. This brings inner conflict where she has to ask herself if she might have been killed innocent people. And it leads to an actual emotional ending of the season even though I thought I would hate the character at the core of this part.Besides that, there is always some mystery that keeps you interested and makes you thinking. With all the hints spread throughout the episodes this will always lead to twists that come never out of nowhere and it keeps you thinking what the next development will look like. made him angry.

In the beginning, I didn’t get why the genres were so dark but after watching the anime, it was pretty self-explanatory. Also, this has NOTHING to do with Boku no Hero Academia!There are SO many different plot-twists in this anime I couldn’t stop...watching the whole thing in one-go at the spot!!!This is my second review and I HAD to write it because this anime was THAT interesting.ALSO the OP and ED is good as well!Will there be a season 2? There MUST BE!!!!! The story finished with so many questions unanswered so there must be! watching the whole thing in one-go at the spot!!!This is my second review and I HAD to write it because this anime was THAT interesting.ALSO the OP and ED is good as well!Will there be a season 2? There MUST BE!!!!! The story finished with so many questions unanswered so there must be!', 'A surprisingly good anime that\'s a must-watch if you like Battle Royale-inspired stories. In Talentless Nana, there\'s a twist: the main character is actually the murderer, and has to perform the kills tricking everyone into not suspecting her. Also, everyone has powers, except her.The plot revolves around the fact that, in this world, there are people that have ""Talents"" (My Hero Academia-like powers), but the world is ruled by the Talentless, which want to implicitly get rid of them. That\'s why they ""trick"" a bunch of Talented students to study on an isolated island, where Talentless Nana mixes-in with the mission to sneakily murder them...all, faking being a Talented student as well.It has interesting characters, specially Nana herself. Since she has no Talent, she must use her intellect and manipulate people to reach her objectives. She\'s really cunning, in an obviously unrealistic way, but never to the point of breaking the suspension of disbelief. In shows that have overly-intelligent characters, it\'s easy to lose control of them, making them reach Deus Ex-Machina levels and ruining all the enjoyment. Two examples of what I\'m talking about are Death Note and Great Pretender. Talentless Nana, on the other hand, manages well this type of character, keeping you the tension of not knowing if things will work out correctly or not.Two other surprisingly great aspects of this anime include its great pace, with engaging events in every episode and, specially, good and consistent plot-twists; and a great character development on its latter half. The anime ending is not closed, as it adapts only the 28 first manga chapters (as of 2021, there\'s already 60+ chapters and no anime sequel announced).Overall, Talentless Nana was really enjoyable to watch. It\'s the type of anime that you could easily overlook, since it appears to be another uninspired run-of-the-mill anime, but it, surprisingly, holds itself really well. all, faking being a Talented student as well.It has interesting characters, specially Nana herself.

It\'s immediately obvious as to why people will choose to like or dislike it, because it\'s very direct in telling its audience what kind of anime it wants to be. Please keep in mind that one of the biggest ""downsides"" of this anime is that it ends a bit abruptly and without a second season you\'re gonna be left hanging, so if that\'s a pet peeve of yours, wait for a second season or read the source material.Let\'s get one thing out of the way. I\'m biased toward stories that feature morally ambiguous protagonists. I think there\'s...a real lack of this kind of thing in anime, and the fact that Munou na Nana aims to fill that kind of role is both extremely refreshing and also commendable. There\'s a reason why people tend to write ""good guy"" stories. They\'re easy to sell, people like good people. It takes a more refined palate to enjoy stories about cold-blooded murder.And that\'s exactly what Munou na Nana is. It\'s a story about a serial-killer that outwits their opponents. Now, granted, the opponents in question are all fairly dim-witted and quite likable characters, but nevertheless it\'s always a pleasure to see the inner workings of someone intelligent. If there\'s any other popular anime I would list to compare this to, it\'d be Death Note. The two share a lot of similarities, and, while Death Note is no doubt more fleshed out in a lot of its aspects, the core identity is very similar. They feature protagonists that have a goal in mind and do not care to do what\'s needed in order to achieve it.Before you continue reading, be advised that I\'m going to spoil the first episode of the anime, something that\'s maybe not a big deal but nevertheless is a big selling point in my opinion.-----------------------------------------------------------The anime starts off strong by lulling the viewer into a false sense of security. It introduces Nanao as the show\'s protagonist by loudly proclaiming him to be talentless and even having characters refer to him as ""Munou-kun"". They then introduce another character into the fold called Nana, clearly referring to her as talented. Now, this is a short-lived gambit, as they quickly reveal Nana\'s true nature and her actual lack of talent, but nevertheless it sets the benchmark for what you can expect in the anime.The series features a reoccurring theme of setting up situations that are then afterwards revealed to have been a red herring all along. Are all of these plot twists good? No, some are a bit weak, but nevertheless I appreciate a story\'s desire to mess with the reader. There\'s nothing more boring than watching something when you already know the outcome. And the show is quite good at that for the most part, there\'s a scene at the ending which, unfortunately, is something that most people will see coming from a mile away, but it\'s necessary for character growth and I won\'t spoil it.Kyouya is also an incredibly well-written character. He serves as the series main antagonist and to stress the relevance to Death Note, if Nana is Raito, then Kyouya is L. He\'s just as intelligent as her, if not far more apt in the way he can put together a string of events to form an educated guess on what actually happened. And much like Raito and L, Kyouya and Nana have a public ""friendship"" while deep down they both distrust each other, but neither has the proper means to take the other one down. The series does take a turn though in the latter half and humanizes a lot of aspects about Nana (unfortunately with a fairly mundane backstory), and whether or not Kyoya and Nana remain enemies remains to be seen in a second season.All in all, I can highly recommend Munou na Nana. Its strength do not lie in its story, aesthetics or sound design, but rather in its attempts to tell an unorthodox story with some fairly well-written characters. It goes without saying that the show is not for the faint of heart, and if you have an issue with a character dying right after they\'ve been established as likable, you\'ll probably not enjoy it. But for those people that are looking to watch an anime that emulates the feeling you first felt when watching animes such as Death Note or Code Geass, I think you\'ll feel right at home. a real lack of this kind of thing in anime, and the fact that Munou na Nana aims to fill that kind of role is both extremely refreshing and also commendable.

If said dude had told everyone what she did and showed them the pictures of her killing her other victims that way the picture of him dying would never have been a thing because she would have been caught but no the guy just sits on his ass waiting for his turn to die amazing.The heal girl is one of the dumbest characters in existence she knew that the dead guy had the power to take a picture of the future she sees Nana right beside the body she sees the picture that shows Nana killing the dude and she just believes whatever bullshit Nana says why? Because the plot does not want Nana to be caught.I am certain theres more absurd cases like this but I have dropped this already and honestly this is more than enough for anyone to see it is trash. some high expectations (it is clear that the dude is not dead and he is going to comeback)  but then it just goes downhill.Everyone that spends time with her dies and no one bats an eye except the immortal dude who also gets infected with stupidity as time goes by.Nana was hiding important information from the time travel guy he does not give a fuck about that and trusts her right away after she tells him what she was ""hiding"" (of course it was all lies).Theres a dude that takes pictures of the future and appparently that future cant be changed ok fine but you know what could have changed?

Yes, the series is basically among us meets mha and I was thrilled. The first episode was shocking and I looked forward to each new episode...until it started repeating the plot.Apparently(strictly fan theory) in this world you become stupid after getting powers I think, like sometimes I wonder, are they like in the wrong type of special school .I don't know, it went from a good thriller to become one of the most annoying anime I've ever seen. Each new episode drops, and I'm not excited...for how nana's gonna kill her next victim, I get myself ready to accept how stupid the side characters are.Apart from the repeatitive plot and the stupid antagonists, much of the shows downfall is due to how unlikeable the characters are. Take nana for example, she's like the bad kind of villain ,like that one villain who does his job just because and without any kind of emotion or charisma. I don't even want to get into the side characters cause at this time I don't even care if any one dies, we know they have it coming.The series could still become better though,with backstories to nana, and having actual thrilling sequences and the students finding out who nana really is but at the time, the story's really stretching it thin. for how nana's gonna kill her next victim, I get myself ready to accept how stupid the side characters are.Apart from the repeatitive plot and the stupid antagonists, much of the shows downfall is due to how unlikeable the characters are.

It's also gonna be incredibly difficult to talk about it without going into spoilers since the entire story is based around plot twists but I'm gonna try. Nonetheless, I'm marking this as spoilers since the premise itself cannot be explained without going into them. Just know that this anime is a very exciting experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end and it also has one of the most mindblowing first episodes I've ever seen, containing one...of the best subversions of expectation ever made. I cannot recommend it enough.I love a good murder mystery and a good thriller and I've experienced plenty of those of varying degrees of quality. I have to say, subjectively at least, Talentless Nana is becoming one of my favourites for many reasons. First of all, from a purely writing perspective, it's quite difficult to keep tensions consistently high throughout an entire story's runtime without resorting to cheap tricks or making it feel forced. However, Nana really succeeds at that and every episode had me glued to the screen in anticipation. I binged the whole thing in a day without even realizing. As I said before, the story is very reliant on plot twists and these work really well here, you never know what will happen next and unexpected elements keep revealing themselves. It's dramatic, but not melodramatic, and it keeps everything moving at a steady pace.However, the most unique thing about Nana's story is the perspective. You see, when you have a murder mystery, almost always we experience the story from the perspective of the victims, as they and various assorted detectives, investigators, agents and the like try to uncover the truth and find who, how and why committed the killings. However, there are very few stories that are told from the perspective of the killer! Nana is one of them. We the viewers already know the who, how and why, but watching her try and cover her tracks, fulfill her goals and escape repercussions is exceptionally exciting. The way the victims are portrayed also makes them feel like monsters and makes it easy to root for her and want her to succeed. But, this can change. for as you remember, twists are around every corner. What happens when Nana's conviction begins to wane, when she finds a friend for the first time in her life amongst the enemy, when we discover that the world isn't as black and white as we initially thought, what happens when the clear divider between good and evil starts to blur out of focus, who is the real monster here?!? There you go - an amazing thriller! And that's just a small taste of what this story has on offer.From a purely technical standpoint, the anime is awesome. Animation is great, the artstyle is nice and colourful, the cuteness contrasting fantastically with the darkness and violence of the story, the music and sound effects are great and the voice acting is phenomenal, particularly for Nana herself. There are also some amazing visuals to showcase the contrasting identities and thoughts of the characters and these greatly elevate the suspense. There are some valid criticisms though. Firstly, I see a lot of people complaining that the plot twists are too contrived and the characters are morons. I strongly disagree. Not to be rude, but that just sounds like some weebs thinking they are galaxy brained geniuses again. Honestly, if you believe that people in real life are not that naïve, then you have not been paying attention. For this kind of story, you have to kind of go with the flow and let it guide you. Not that if the plot twists are poorly made it won't harm the experience, but I think Nana's story flows masterfully and is thoroughly engaging from beginning to end.And speaking of which, that's the only real criticism I can offer - the end, or lack thereof rather. A lot of loose ends are tied up by the conclusion of the season, but even with one extra episode, it ends abruptly and leaves many burning questions unanswered. Now, it's painfully obvious what happened here. The anime ended, but the manga did not and the manga simply addresses these plot threads at a later point. It's annoying when it happens but there really isn't a way to avoid it. All I can say is that a second season is desperately needed for this series and I'm hoping that somehow in the future we get it. For now, if you want all your questions answered, you will need to turn to the manga, which is still ongoing. That's what I'm gonna do.In short, if you love a good mystery thriller murder mystery and have that childlike wonder to let it guide you, Talentless Nana is a must watch. It's an amazing anime that stands out in many ways and is very impressive with what it achieves in a single season. Just don't be disappointed by the abrupt ending. I was truly emotionally moved from this entire experience in a way that few stories manage to achieve. I think you will be too. of the best subversions of expectation ever made. I cannot recommend it enough.I love a good murder mystery and a good thriller and I've experienced plenty of those of varying degrees of quality. I have to say, subjectively at least, Talentless Nana is becoming one of my favourites for many reasons. First of all, from a purely writing perspective, it's quite difficult to keep tensions consistently high throughout an entire story's runtime without resorting to cheap tricks or making it feel forced. However, Nana really succeeds at that and every episode had me glued to the screen in anticipation. I binged the whole thing in a day without even realizing. As I said before, the story is very reliant on plot twists and these work really well here, you never know what will happen next and unexpected elements keep revealing themselves. It's dramatic, but not melodramatic, and it keeps everything moving at a steady pace.However, the most unique thing about Nana's story is the perspective. You see, when you have a murder mystery, almost always we experience the story from the perspective of the victims, as they and various assorted detectives, investigators, agents and the like try to uncover the truth and find who, how and why committed the killings. However, there are very few stories that are told from the perspective of the killer! Nana is one of them. We the viewers already know the who, how and why, but watching her try and cover her tracks, fulfill her goals and escape repercussions is exceptionally exciting. The way the victims are portrayed also makes them feel like monsters and makes it easy to root for her and want her to succeed. But, this can change. for as you remember, twists are around every corner. What happens when Nana's conviction begins to wane, when she finds a friend for the first time in her life amongst the enemy, when we discover that the world isn't as black and white as we initially thought, what happens when the clear divider between good and evil starts to blur out of focus, who is the real monster here?!? There you go - an amazing thriller! And that's just a small taste of what this story has on offer.From a purely technical standpoint, the anime is awesome. Animation is great, the artstyle is nice and colourful, the cuteness contrasting fantastically with the darkness and violence of the story, the music and sound effects are great and the voice acting is phenomenal, particularly for Nana herself. There are also some amazing visuals to showcase the contrasting identities and thoughts of the characters and these greatly elevate the suspense. There are some valid criticisms though. Firstly, I see a lot of people complaining that the plot twists are too contrived and the characters are morons. I strongly disagree. Not to be rude, but that just sounds like some weebs thinking they are galaxy brained geniuses again. Honestly, if you believe that people in real life are not that naïve, then you have not been paying attention. For this kind of story, you have to kind of go with the flow and let it guide you.

Then this anime is for you! Honestly, it doesn't get the attention it deserves, but I mean it's not finished yet. But the first season is really full of surprises!So basically Munou Na Nana tells the story of a serial killer called Nana Hiiragi. At first, it may seem like a regular story between heroes and villains, but it gets very interesting over time! Nana is a very clever killer and you can't predict her movements. There are lots of different kinds of characters and we get the chance to know every character - their personality, their past,...etc.What's thrilling is the fact that the anime is basically a fight between the main character and the student called Kyoya, who knows Nana's true form. Nana is trying to complete her task of killing the students one by one, while Kyoya is trying to prove to everyone that Nana isn't a perfect class leader who's trying to keep everyone safe.Munou Na Nana teaches us that the world isn't as black and white as we tend to think. Everyone is evil from someone's point of view! For example in the end Nana Hiiragi isn't just an amoral serial killer with no heart...I won't spoil it anymore, but it really is full of surprises and definitely worth watching! The art style is also very pleasing.10/10 etc.What's thrilling is the fact that the anime is basically a fight between the main character and the student called Kyoya, who knows Nana's true form.

First, I love the cat-and-mouse conflict between Nana and Kyouya, and while there was a lot of blatant ignorance in the show, the characters are all very young and also very arrogant with their abilities. Typically, it sort of makes sense for people to believe that the new hot girl who can apparently read minds wouldn\'t be the killer in their minds, especially with the constant pieces of info that she made that made her more inconspicuous.The next part, is Nana\'s mind...reading, which honestly I love how the lie slowly deteriorated as time went on. She kept slipping up as she never has had a talent like that and doesn\'t have specific rules for it, but no one really pulls her up on it besides Kyouya, which is very cool.Another really cool thing, is the characters. Most of them are very simple and very basic, but one of my favourite parts are the Talents, which each have their own weaknesses that make a lot of sense. Necromancy requires the body and a keepsake. Time travel is fatiguing. Healing someone shortens your own life. They all made enough sense to where I could say ""yeah, that is good"". Additionally, I loved how Nana found out these weaknesses using small bits of information and putting it altogether while also continuing to narrowly avoid being killed on the spot.Also, and probably one of the best parts of the show, was Michiru. They definitely did a good job at making Michiru very likeable, firstly you just expect her to die like all the other Talented that Nana latches onto, but then she starts to develop more of a personality. Mainly, her character is so cut and dry, that you can understand it so easily. However, her caring nature for the protagonist who we know is a killer is so interesting. We know that Nana is beyond redemption, and Michiru still helps herThey did a great job at making a very likable character and also a great job at killing her in the right moment. It was a great character moment for Nana and I hope that there is a 2nd season, if there isn\'t I might go and read the manga for once.However, the ignorance was definitely a little overdone. A lot of Nana\'s ploys were very good, but most people kinda just turned a blind eye on her most of the time, even though there was a bunch of evidence against her. She definitely dealt with the most dangerous characters early, but I almost feel that some of the other characters at least being a little suspicious of Nana would\'ve been a cool touch. reading, which honestly I love how the lie slowly deteriorated as time went on.

This basically amounts to a relatively intelligent person joining a public Among Us lobby full of elementary schoolers. A lot of their actions are irrational and... immature (go figure), and while this doesn't lend itself to galaxy brain intrigue, it...is in line with the basic premise of the narrative. People coming to this show expecting L vs Kira level battles will be a little disappointed, but it's fun as a casual watch and a commentary/sanitization of the super-hero school trope. is in line with the basic premise of the narrative.

She was found out at the very beginning, and many times later, but still survives because of the stupidity of her enemies. Anyone who finds her guilty are just too dumb to do anything about it. They aren't even scared at the idea that they could die in their sleep. For that reason I believe this anime's characters suck and ruin the experience, but most anime watchers will enjoy it so give it a try. This is because it relates to popular media around today, like Among us and my Hero Academia. Also, the artwork is great in both...the anime and in the manga. the anime and in the manga."", 'I am really surprised to say that this series was actually quite decent and this is despite what people think of it saying it\'s boring, etc which I totally disagree from my personal point of view. Yes it\'s not a masterpiece or original but it was far from boring for me, it was in fact, interesting enough! Anyways, the story goes that a secret serial killer/spy called Nana basically kills anyone who is the enemy of ""humanity"". Of course she meets unique students who have different personalities such as Michiru and Kyouya. Michiru is a little darling like she cares about Nana so much and...yet Nana is a bad egg who\'s suppose to kill her lol.

However like Deca-Dence, this series deceives its audience by revealing that the main character of focus is actually Nana Hiiragi, a girl who claims to have mind-reading abilities yet is actually a Talentless contracted by the government to kill all the Talented on the island school they are at.One of the effective elements of Talentless Nana is its titular...character\'s planning and deceptive capabilities to try having things swing her way against the Talented. Knowing she can\'t confront them directly due to lacking any special abilities, Nana instead has to fall back on strategy, deception, and manipulation to attempt creating openings that will allow her any opportunity to exploit a vulnerability with whomever she targets. The Talented, in spite of their abilities, still have conditions that restrict and limit the extent to which they can utilize them which Nana attempts to learn through attempting to own said Talented\'s trust or observing their actions and physical condition. Nana\'s skills also come into play when attempting to deflect any suspicion that others may have of her being responsible for the murders she commits as another student, Kyoya Onodera, is suspicious of her connections to each of the cases and rivals her in reasoning capabilities thus requiring Nana to have to set up situations to secure an alibi.Another effective direction to Nana\'s situation is the gradual development she undergoes as she spends more time with the Talented. While starting off hardened in her resolve to kill the Talented, Nana\'s commitment to her mission shows signs of wavering as she develops genuine attachment to some of the Talented, notably her bond with Michiru. More of Nana\'s backstory is also fleshed out in later episodes to explore what led her to be motivated in wanting to kill off the Talented, having its tragic elements and also exploring more about the government forces at hand driving Nana to complete her mission. However, further details on said forces in question are not fully explored due to the anime\'s manga source material still being ongoing as of this review I am writing.As far as the Talented in question are concerned, focus on them is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the major characters like Kyouya and Michiru get a reasonable amount of depth shown from their actions and/or having their personalities and backstories fleshed out. Others are largely relegated to simple character types with barely any focus and/or serve as irredeemable villains as a source of conflict for Nana to overcome. A case could be made that for the latter, as stated by one Talented character, that having no parents around to keep their impulses in check allowed for the Talented as teens to foolishly abuse their powers for personal gain. But for a premise that is seemingly pushing for a morally gray narrative with Nana\'s complicated thoughts and actions on her mission, having the villainous Talented without any irredeemable traits does take away a fair bit from this dimension to Nana\'s mission against the Talented.In short, Talentless Nana is largely engaging through exploring Nana\'s character with the planning and manipulation she undergoes in her efforts to kill the Talented, as well as her character gradually being fleshed out and developed to explore what led to her developing the motivation to kill the Talented and start gradually having reservations about her mission. Other elements of the series are hit and miss with fleshing them out as many of the Talented felt underdeveloped compared to others and the story ends inconclusively during a major point in its development.

If there is one thing I can say for sure it\'s that this is like ""Among us"" -The Anime Adaptation, and it\'s pretty lit at doing that.The artist pretty good and it definitely has a nice going at showing Nana\'s two faces.Concerning the sound, I haven\'t noticed anything exceptional. The ending song is pretty goodYou might read several reviews debunking how ""Most of the characters are just brainless"" and that\'s how the main character just happens to succeed. But I...think that\'s very realistic and you can easily notice that through the very simple action of playing among us- the Majority is pretty much brainless~. So yes, I won\'t disagree that many of the characters are \'Brainless\', but that\'s only natural.Overall, if you want a show, where there is murder, superpowers and the constant suspense of ""How would they pull through?"" you will definitely enjoy it. think that\'s very realistic and you can easily notice that through the very simple action of playing among us- the Majority is pretty much brainless~.

Because what I really want to applaud this series for is presenting a consistent psychological thriller with deductions and mind games to spare and rather than letting the superpowers of the cast be a shonen-esque distraction, the writer incorporates them in such a way that bolsters the mystery element. Another thing I've been appreciating is the realistic variance in character interaction. Some may criticize plot contrivance based on members of the supporting cast being naive, easily duped, or outright stupid, but I think the reality of this situation is...that we're dealing with young teenagers and my personal opinion is that it's more odd for them to have a master detective in their ranks rather than any number of them falling for easy cons, especially when they're not particularly on guard.Talentless Nana borrows many aspects of tried-and-true formulas while interjecting enough innovation and pure suspense to always make me want to know how characters will deduce situations and what they'll plan next. To use the common trope of mashing existing concepts together, take the best elements of Mirai Nikki and the tactical beats of Death Note and water both down just a bit to decrease contrivance and increase accessibility. It's likely not as deep or tight a narrative as a hardcore mystery thriller fan may want, but it's a perfectly engaging piece for the casual viewer.

I was watching it in 4x speed and I still couldn\'t bear to keep on watching.This is exactly the type of show I would think would be constructed when a 14 year old that just watched Death Note was the head director.

The characters were extremely stereotypical and annoying. The music was nothing special. The art didn't draw me in.  For every one step this anime made, it made 20 steps backward.

And, it’s a genre replete with dramatic irony, which is always a good way of building suspense. Unfortunately, the dramatic irony of Talentless Nana is overshadowed by the more apparent irony in its title – that the only talentless individual was the pillock who made it.First of all, the premise, why are these people here? Well, a group of high schoolers with superpowers are sent to an island for ‘training’ to fight ‘the enemies of humanity’. The first issue...is that not everyone actually has a power, there are plenty of people who, as far as everyone else is concerned, doesn’t have a power at all. So how did they get in? And our main character, Nana, her ability is to read minds (not really, I’ll get to that later), and when she introduces herself to the class, the teacher just nonchalantly says “well don’t use it on any tests”, which is a very good point, if these people have all these different powers, wouldn’t you have to reformat the academic system to accommodate? Too much work.The next issue is they were officially sent here, by the government, to train their powers so they can fight ‘the enemies of humanity’, but there is no supervision on the island in the slightest. As far as I’m aware, their teacher is the only adult of any sort on the island, and I get it, it’s anime, adults are stupid and don’t know what’s going on, but there’s a limit to that, you’re sending these extremely important people to an island, and just leaving them there, alone? They had MPs on every street corner in Okinawa back in the 60s, and in boot camp, when they send ordinary people to train to fight the government’s enemies, they supervise them as they do it, but not when it’s their Lidl X-Men? However, it is stated that Nana is actually an ordinary person, and sent to the school by some mysterious committee (also ‘the government’), consisting of people who are never seen and have distorted voices, whose motivations would probably be perhaps somewhat interesting if you saw them more than once. So, since we’re not in the interwar Showa period, the Japanese government is a largely uniform entity, not split apart by factionalism and coups and all that shit. So, it doesn’t make much sense for them to pull a Half-Life: Opposing Force and have a shadow government to conspire against the normal one to do something like this. At least, probably, usually if there is one of those secret committees, there’s probably something like that going on, but I can’t make that claim, the only thing we know about this committee is they belong to the government, and they want the people with superpowers dead. So, precisely why is the facade there? If they want them dead, why not just send them to the island, bring in some Einsatzgruppen, and finish it the day it starts? There’s nobody to keep these pretences for, there’s no police on the island, I’ve been lead to believe the entire school consists of one teacher, so there’s no reason not to, the whole story is contrived.The main character, I probably should talk about her, her given superpower is being able to read minds, which is probably one of the worst superpowers to lie about having, seeing as all it takes is one person to grow even mildly suspicious of you for it to become immediately obvious that it’s a lie, would be better to just not tell anyone what the power is, as multiple people did. But, she’s got the power of being observational, and I’d probably be a lot more intrigued by the story if they weren’t extremely basic observations, she’s presented like some Sherlock Holmes mastermind who can figure out how to perfectly craft a murder, but it’s basic at best, fortunately for her everyone else refuses to think about anything, ever. How many times do you have to see one person at the scene of a murder, to maybe entertain the possibility that they were involved with it? And, her not too impressive thoughts are conveyed through inner dialogue, and when this happens, the screen goes into this rather unpleasant looking dark red, which would be less intrusive if it didn’t happen every five minutes, it just ended up looking like the Virtual Boy. And that’s not a very good visual connotation.Haven’t got much else to say, every other character is instantly forgettable, I, for one, will never understand the appeal of anime where they make sure to kill off someone every single episode, the end result being that the writer never bothers to give anyone any characterisation in the slightest, because you have no reason to get invested. And this is just one of those, the characters are as empty as they could be, the main character has nothing remarkable about her, maybe if I lived in the Jacobean era I’d be shocked by the notion of a young girl being a serial killer, but it’s just par for the course these days, the story itself is pointless, there is nothing of interest in here. They really put the pot in potboiler, because you’d have to be stoned to have any chance of enjoying this. is that not everyone actually has a power, there are plenty of people who, as far as everyone else is concerned, doesn’t have a power at all. So how did they get in? And our main character, Nana, her ability is to read minds (not really, I’ll get to that later), and when she introduces herself to the class, the teacher just nonchalantly says “well don’t use it on any tests”, which is a very good point, if these people have all these different powers, wouldn’t you have to reformat the academic system to accommodate? Too much work.The next issue is they were officially sent here, by the government, to train their powers so they can fight ‘the enemies of humanity’, but there is no supervision on the island in the slightest. As far as I’m aware, their teacher is the only adult of any sort on the island, and I get it, it’s anime, adults are stupid and don’t know what’s going on, but there’s a limit to that, you’re sending these extremely important people to an island, and just leaving them there, alone? They had MPs on every street corner in Okinawa back in the 60s, and in boot camp, when they send ordinary people to train to fight the government’s enemies, they supervise them as they do it, but not when it’s their Lidl X-Men? However, it is stated that Nana is actually an ordinary person, and sent to the school by some mysterious committee (also ‘the government’), consisting of people who are never seen and have distorted voices, whose motivations would probably be perhaps somewhat interesting if you saw them more than once. So, since we’re not in the interwar Showa period, the Japanese government is a largely uniform entity, not split apart by factionalism and coups and all that shit. So, it doesn’t make much sense for them to pull a Half-Life: Opposing Force and have a shadow government to conspire against the normal one to do something like this. At least, probably, usually if there is one of those secret committees, there’s probably something like that going on, but I can’t make that claim, the only thing we know about this committee is they belong to the government, and they want the people with superpowers dead. So, precisely why is the facade there? If they want them dead, why not just send them to the island, bring in some Einsatzgruppen, and finish it the day it starts?

Maybe it's because of taste. However, as a psychological anime, this show is quite entertaining. It keeps on getting you thinking and hyped up for the next episode. The balance between the seriousness of the show and the comedy part of the anime is well portrayed. Meaning, there's just no way you will be bored. Plot wise, it builds up quite well. The pacing is incredibly spectacular. One of my favourite anime this season.A bit of SPOILER. but it's not that big of a spoiler. Of course the early stage of the...anime was irritating. I can't wrap my head around the fact that Nana was killing her classmates. Nana was very irritating. Eventhough I enjoyed watching her plan her traps and all, and watching as Kyoya tries to uncover the truth, the fact that Nana kills without a second thought is irritating for me.HOWEVER, towards the middle and final part of the anime is where our dear MC shines!!!JUST GIVE IT A TRY! I RECOMMEND YOU GUYS TO BINGE WATCH THIS! anime was irritating. I can't wrap my head around the fact that Nana was killing her classmates. Nana was very irritating.

I RECOMMEND YOU GUYS TO BINGE WATCH THIS!"", 'Talentless Nana was an unexpected gift of last anime season.Honestly going into Talentless Nana I was immedietly interested by the premise of the MC being the essential villain of the series. Watching Nana go around murdering all these kids was entertainig as hell lol. Nana is just that kind of character that is too cool to hate. (At least for me anyway) By far Nana is the most interesting character Ive seen in anime for a long time and her development in this series especially towards the end is AMAZING!!! I love Nana so much, she\'s so interesting. I love seeing Nana\'s evil expressions as...she screws everyone over or when she\'s surprised.Another character I really like is the detective of the show, Kyouya, who acts as the rival to Nana as the murderer. So we\'ve got this duel conflict between the MCs and it makes such an interesting dynamic of them playing mind games with each other. Its really interesting cause they\'re both of equal wit and intelligence and they work really well together. To the point where I was like ""These two would make great friends if they werent enemies"" lol.Ive definitely got to say this anime is plotwist, the anime. Expect a million plotwists in this show as the series is constantly flipping the dynamic of the scenes in favour of different people. I absolutely love everytime something changes and seeing Nana\'s reactions of either shock or her signiture evil grin with a red background.By far Nana carried this series for me alongside the other main character Kyouya.My only conflicted feeling about this series is its ending. Dont get me wrong, its a great ending that holds a lot of power. Its just you\'ll probably have the feeling of craving more, badly. Thats all I\'ll say in terms of the ending to not spoil anything. (Its good though) However despite saying that I could definitely see myself re-watching this anime in the future cause its just too entertaining.I highly recommend this series if you want something a bit different to the norm especially in terms of MCs. Even if you\'re just slightly interested in the premise you should definitely pick it up.9/10 an amazing anime. she screws everyone over or when she\'s surprised.Another character I really like is the detective of the show, Kyouya, who acts as the rival to Nana as the murderer.

I never really wished to write reviews here bc I usually don\'t have anything else to add to shows I watched than what other people have already said, but this show... This show is bad, guys. I see people giving it 9s, 8s, hell even a 7 is too high for it imo. So I\'ll try my best to put into words why I dislike this show. Spoilers, obviously.Story: 3/10.The story\'s premise is pretty simple. People with super powers are bad, the government wants to get rid of them so they round them...all up in a remote island to be killed one by one. Nothing amazing, but I can work with this, as long as the execution is well done. Well, it\'s not.The story structure basically goes: Arc about Hana killing a newly introduced character that has never been seen before, then an episode about a confrontation with Kyouya, then another arc focused on a random student, rinse and repeat forever. It took them 9 episodes to introduce any sort of variety, but it was far too late. It\'s boring and repetitive and it\'s just not fun.At one point a student whose power is to produce poison from her body fluids is killed by.... being poisoned. It makes no sense.Art: 6/10.Really nothing special to be said. It looks passable, but there really isn\'t any moment where I was like ""hey this looks pretty good"". At least it doesn\'t look bad, for most of the time.Sound: 5/10.Sound effects are perfectly serviceable. Both the OP and the ED are super forgettable. Background music doesn\'t really do anything either.Characters: 1/10.The show REALLY wants you to think that Hana and Kyouya are geniuses playing an intricate mind game with each other, not unlike Kaguya and Shirogane, or maybe (if the writer is really full of themselves) even Sherlock and Moriarty. Well, they\'re not. They\'re both actually pretty stupid, all things considered. Characters are either bumbling idiots or, in the case of Hana, an asspull goddess with incredibly thick plot armor.Several scenes are dedicated to Kyouya making ""logical deductions"", where he seems to be on the right track, before suddenly he disregards everything he just said for no other reason than ""plot"". Side characters are simply stupid. The perfect example is Shibusawa, the second victim, who by time-travelling, follows Hana directly to the scene of the first murder, sees her right there with the victim, knowing full well she was the last person he saw before going missing, standing next to a cliff... And shrugs it off? Then later she convinces him to accidentally kill himself by time-travelling into a pond while being unable to swim. Amazing writing.Once the show starts introducing students who are openly antagonistic towards Hana, like a blackmailing rapist and a psychotic student who managed to avoid death and uncover her true goals, Hana starts to constantly one-up her assailants with contrived bullshit and mental gymnastics and we\'re expected to accept that she deduced not only the exact way their powers work, but also how to counter it and kill them in a way that won\'t arise suspicion from Kyouya, of course helped by the fact that said assailants are also dumb as rocks and keep doing things so unbelievably stupid that it\'s almost laughable. In the necromancer arc she deduces the student\'s entire life story from a drink being spilled on them in a movie theater once.As of writing this review, episode 9, the show just introduced the first character that seems to have an actual functioning brain, but as I said before, too little too late.tl;dr: Every character in this show is braindead and it hurts the enjoyment a lot.Enjoyment: 6/10The show is bad, but I consider myself someone who can enjoy bad media. I like trashy slasher movies, and this is basically one of those, except instead of Jason chasing horny teens through the woods there\'s an anime girl trying to prove to you how awesome and smart she is, while only being able to kill anyone because everyone else is stupid.Also I would be lying if I said that the show didn\'t have it\'s few moments, for as bad as it is overall. Some of the students are somewhat likeable, if you ignore, again, how they\'re stupid as hell, and there are a few interactions that could really work, if they were in a better show.Overall: 5/10This show is bad. But it\'s not unwatchable bad. It\'s the kind of bad show you pop in once, watch it in amazement at how bad the story and characters are, and then immediately forget about it once it ends. If you like that sort of trashy show then by all means, give this a watch, you\'ll probably have some fun out of it, but if you\'re looking for an actually well written series, skip. all up in a remote island to be killed one by one.

Why did I rate this anime so high?The answer\'s not as simple as ""I liked it.""If you look at the anime from a very superficial ""I watch for story"" perspective, you might hate it. Because I did. The show\'s mysteries and the ways the cast solved these mysteries felt somewhat contrived. A lot of what Nana, the main character, did felt unnaturally easy for her. There was always a thoughtful explanation to her actions; there was always a way out for her in sticky situations. Everything just fell into place like a handmade puzzle you\'ve just made out of...cardboard. Because within this school of talent-ridden kids, almost everyone else was either stupid or stupidly stubborn. And that stupidity was what made me hate it.But that\'s when I decided to change my perspective.Instead of watching the anime purely for enjoyment, I started to see things from a more distanced point of view. I stopped questioning why some of these characters were so stupid and started watching how these characters worked in the narrative of the story. And through this, one aspect of the show started to shine more brightly than anything else - Nana. And for her to shine so bright, there also had to be a catalyst. In this case, that was Inukai. And although I have my personal gripes when it comes to Inukai, she was absolutely necessary for the show to function. Because without her, everything simply falls apart.In the end, the anime can be summed up as one thing: Nana\'s character development. Because that\'s what this was - a slow build up to the eventual evolution of Nana. And boy, do I LOVE watching characters evolve. With episode after episode of similar plot points occurring in repetition almost like clockwork, Nana\'s character started to unravel and change ever so slightly. It was initially a slow, almost halting start, but once the ball got rolling, all that was left was an intense rollercoaster of emotions. And the pay-off for watching all those episodes was entirely worth it because of her.So why do I recommend this? Even with all the exposition dumping, mediocre story, and bland side characters? Even when I hated how annoying some of these characters were? Why did I rate this so high? It was all because of Nana. She gave this show the charm necessary for everything to work - a character I was initially rooting against their success. And with all that said, if this wasn\'t enough reason for such a high rating, I also happen to have one more reason.I happen to like this. Like a lot. cardboard.

Then when I ran out of anime for me to watch, I tried this anime and my initial impression was that the anime about killing kills would definitely be caught or not. Over time this anime was boring but when I wanted to end I started guessing the ending and an unexpected ending appeared, and the ending, in my opinion, was very Epic and...this also made me change my mind to write this anime review. But according to me, the story is still hanging, because I don't know the fate of the othersThe graphics and visuals of this anime are pretty good. The art is not the one who likes it either, but it's not bad for the Character, according to my usual, it's often in anime like this.

Terus pas gua kehabisan anime buat gua tonton gua coba-coba anime ini dan kesan awal gua yah pasti anime tentang bunuh bunuhan nanti  pasti ketauan atau gak gimana gitu. Lama-lama anime ini ngebosenin tapi pas mau akhir gua mulai menebak nebak endingnya dan ending yang tak terduga malah muncul, dan endingnya itu menurut gua sangat Epic dan ini juga yang membuat gua berubah pikiran untuk menulis review anime ini. Tapi menurut gua ini ceritanya masih ngegantung ya karena gua gk tau sama nasib yang lainnyaGrafis dan isual anime ini itu lumayan bagus. Art nya sih bukan yang suka juga sih tapi lumayan buat Character itu menurut gua biasa sih sering ada di anime kayak gini. Dan untuk menikmait ini harus nonton anime ini sampai habis karena kalo liat awalnya aja ngebosenin.Kalo lanjutannya gua mau nonton  sih gua pengen tau aja itu nasib yang lainnya gimana.Terima kasih sudah membaca review saya!!! this also made me change my mind to write this anime review.

Lama-lama anime ini ngebosenin tapi pas mau akhir gua mulai menebak nebak endingnya dan ending yang tak terduga malah muncul, dan endingnya itu menurut gua sangat Epic dan ini juga yang membuat gua berubah pikiran untuk menulis review anime ini. Tapi menurut gua ini ceritanya masih ngegantung ya karena gua gk tau sama nasib yang lainnyaGrafis dan isual anime ini itu lumayan bagus. Art nya sih bukan yang suka juga sih tapi lumayan buat Character itu menurut gua biasa sih sering ada di anime kayak gini. Dan untuk menikmait ini harus nonton anime ini sampai habis karena kalo liat awalnya aja ngebosenin.Kalo lanjutannya gua mau nonton  sih gua pengen tau aja itu nasib yang lainnya gimana.Terima kasih sudah membaca review saya!!!"", '* REVIEW CONTAINS LITTLE SPOILERS, BUT WITH THEM YOU WON\'T HAVE TO WATCH THIS **I couldn\'t give a lower rating because nice art, music, good opening and ending *One big festival of stupidity and absurdity.People with superpowers appear in the world. Some are bad and do bad things, some are good and fight the bad. Suddenly, we lock the good guys on the island and hire a pink-haired girl to kill them all, because in fact they are bad and want to destroy the world (not true, it\'s a fake of bad organization / government).People are starting to disappear from the school on the island....Teachers, adults, will they do anything about it? No. Why? Because no. Something happens? We can\'t see anything. Classmates disappear? But are we to notice it?We are only the chosen ones of mankind (they don\'t know about us) who are to save the world with their superpowers that are developed in this school. But basically half the people don\'t talk about their superpower because ""It\'s not interesting or useful,"" the other half thinks it can do anything, because they can create a fireball that they cannot control.Oddly enough, the main character is always the last person who accompanies mankind someone who then dies, but does anyone suspect her? No. Why? Suffice it to say, they are the \'\'enemies of humanity\'\'.The concentration of absurdity and idiocy in each episode exceeds the scale. Meeting on the cliff? It is not dangerous at all. Fight to be class leader? Great. Maybe some vote? Anyway, no one will miss it later.Using your healing power (which shortens the life of the user) to heal scrapes? Fantastic! Can I predict the future and capture it in photos? Thanks to this, I have evidence of who makes people disappear (die). Will I use it somehow? Shall I show it to someone?WTF, HOW DID YOU COME TO THAT?The logic games in this anime aspire to the level of Sora from No Game No Life, but they are on the level of the average person vs the handicapped herd.Hey, only half of this guy\'s body is wet. It\'s the same with that girl, that is, you were walking together under an umbrella, you are couple.OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU CAN READS MINDSI\'m annoyed because you follow me and you disturb me, and you can spot it?MIND READING.Connecting simple facts?MIND READING.Someone is dying?ENEMIES OF HUMANITY!Everything can be fucking explained by the enemies of humanity.Anyone ever seen them?NO, BUT WE WILL BELIEVE THE MAIN CUTE GIRL BECAUSE SHE IS CUTE.Sometimes there are really powerful clashes of minds, decent intrigues and interesting motives. But then all the pluses are netted by yet again murdered logic.When the heroes become curious, they die or lose their last gray cells. Sometimes there are really powerful clashes of minds, decent intrigues and interesting motives. But then all the pluses are netted by yet again murdered logic.When heroes become interesting, they either die or lose their last gray cells.Damn frustrating.This is how I summarize the anime:Nice, with an interesting theme but wasted potential. Watching it is annoying, because whatever it does, it cannot be honestly praised because of the plot holes, countless logic errors, stupidity, idiots and IQ of some heroes = -150.

I love the animation and the music. I think it's one of the better psychological thriller animes I've seen. I loved watching the twists and turns. The pacing is also good, I thought adequate time was given to every character. I also thought the action was super fun to watch. Lastly, the voice acting is top-notch, I thought the performances really made the show.In just 13 episodes, I am super intrigued by the world and how we see it through Nana's eyes.

The plot seemed like the typical shounen series but took a sharp turn very quickly. The animation was good, I enjoy the diverse talents of students. They seem quite well thought through but all have a clear weakness. The series was quite entertaining. If you enjoy seeing intelligent characters fooling their dumber peers this will be a great watch.  I would say it combines the quirks of my hero and but also some great mystery anime aspects as to how the mc would accomplish their goal.  A solid anime from this season imo.

This anime will hook you from start to finish and lemme explain whyFirst episodes are really crucial in any anime specially short ones like talentless nana. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but the first episode will exceed your expectations and it just keeps getting better.The inner monologues of the two main leads is most likely the best part of the anime. I also like how everyone confronts each other. And the mystery is so simple yet so complex. The only thing that kind of disappointed me was the background characters....We could have seen more of them but considering the show covers a long story in a fast pace that's kind of understandable.Nana is by far the best character in the series followed by kyoya. Her intelligence probably exceeds other overrated characters' like... I'll leave that up for you.This show is a hidden gem. Had an ending which was not really an ending BUT the rest of the show is a 10/10. Who knows why it's got such a low rating, it deserves more recognition. I feel like if this anime was animated by a famous studio it would've got the recognition it deserves.Sorry I couldn't tell you about the anime as it's difficult to talk about it without spoiling since the twist starts from the first episode.

The important bits are rock-solid: clever, unpredictable scheming by the genius main characters, loads of unique and detailed superpowers, and a big, mysterious conspiracy looming over everything. But all of the secondary details fall painfully short. Fortunately, these aren't crucial to the enjoyment of the series, but they do make it difficult to take seriously sometimes.Munou Na Nana is easily compared to Death Note: you have  two genius characters, one who is trying to enact their murderous plot to save humanity while pretending to try to uncover their own identity, while the other plays detective and tries...to confirm their suspicions of the former.And in terms of sheer cleverness of the plots thought up by each character, they're on par with DN's Light and L. However, the same cannot be said for basically any other element of the story. Aside from looking like a generic shonen anime from 2005, Munou Na Nana's biggest weakness is its direction, particularly in the way that it portrays the clever feats of its characters.Each time Nana or Kyoya do something really clever, we don't actually see them do it. Instead, we skip ahead in time until moments before disaster, only for Nana/Kyoya to be saved by their genius plan which they already set up off-screen. Then explain it to the camera through boring monologue. Having your setup take place *after* the payoff feels pretty unsatisfying after the third or fifth time it happens.There are numerous plot contrivances that might drive you crazy, but personally I think they're superfluous if you treat the series as a dumb, fun mystery. Yes, all of the students seem impossibly stupid to fall for Nana's lame-ass pep talks and phony personality. Yes, Kyoya ought to have made way more progress at this point if he wasn't so conveniently blind to some obvious details. And yes, the entire premise makes absolutely no sense if you think about it for ten seconds (how are parents not freaking out when their children all go missing at these camps?)But if you treat Munou Na Nana like the pulpy mystery-drama it is, it's seriously a blast. Just turn off your pedant brain and enjoy the clever schemes, the goofy characters, the unique super powers and their mechanics, and the ever-deepening hole Nana seems to be digging herself into. My biggest hope is that it does well enough that future seasons can get the budgets they deserve. to confirm their suspicions of the former.And in terms of sheer cleverness of the plots thought up by each character, they're on par with DN's Light and L.

The characters are so dumb that even blind people can figure out who the culprit is.I don\'t know if this show is making me hate it but It certainly does. Not to mention the MC is just horrendous straight out from an edgy anime a psychopath. I just hate her but I can let it slide...with a good or decent plot but in this anime it\'s not.I don\'t know why people are comparing this to ""among us"" but this has supernatural powers that has a GREAT ADVANTAGE that can possibly solve the mystery of the murders and the characters has the power to expose the culprit and the anime has shown it many times but the author chose a different route and by making the characters act dumb and look dumb. You might say that if they exposed the culprit early on, then the story might be over but just like I said the author chose this route instead of other better routes that can unfold resulting to a better plot and enjoyment.Honesty this has potential to become a very good anime.Animation: 7/10Sound : decent/averagePlot : 2/10Characters : 2/10Enjoyment: Pathetic with a good or decent plot but in this anime it\'s not.I don\'t know why people are comparing this to ""among us"" but this has supernatural powers that has a GREAT ADVANTAGE that can possibly solve the mystery of the murders and the characters has the power to expose the culprit and the anime has shown it many times but the author chose a different route and by making the characters act dumb and look dumb.

The first few episodes with Nanao Nakajima were strong for the show. After that point the show got so lazy it became my most unenjoyable show of the year. How can everyone be so stupid, so mindless and so up themselves that they just don't see what is plain to see.The story itself should have been excellent, but the way with Nana being so ridiculously on a higher level to everyone else makes it pointless. People with egos essentially is the biggest killer of the show. Episode 4 is the biggest one to this,...someone has proof but gets so big-headed about this they just waste it, I guess it would have literally ended the show as such and take it to a full-blown war. That would have been better.The art itself looks nice and is the best thing about the show. It is mostly pretty crisp and much like the style of My Hero Academia just much newer and grown-up.The OP is fine and the ED is very standard.The characters start off with interest but in the end, everyone is so dumb and full of themselves that they ruin the show. Also what would have been the biggest thing to happen, Nakajima, is disappointing. Even Nana, she starts off with this interesting situation and gets duller and duller and away from what her character is.I think the person who wrote the series tries to drag it out too much and if this is what they wanted it to be like adapted then great for them. The story is so dragged out and becomes about people just talking about things but in the dullest way possible that I struggled to watch the show. For me, I'd be shocked if this came back for a second season but well the industry often surprises me.It is a 1 for me despite good art and okay sound because the show just failed to make it worth watching so it pushes the good points too far away.1/10. someone has proof but gets so big-headed about this they just waste it, I guess it would have literally ended the show as such and take it to a full-blown war.

Munou na Nana is an example of a show that relies too much on this factor, serving only as mindless entertainment. With an overall premise that could have made for a cleverly constructed mystery anime, Munou na Nana falls flat and is held back by itself.We follow Nana, a mysterious assassin sent to a school where a bunch of kids, each possessing a different “Talent” train to fight the enemies of humanity. The story...is a game of cat and mouse between the innocent classmates, being killed off one by one, and Nana, the mastermind serial killer that manages to put up a “cute, nice girl” act all while hiding her murderous and immoral intent of killing kids under the orders of the government.In a character driven story, having them act for the sake of the plot, not having a personality whatsoever, letting obvious clues fly over their heads is one of the many things Munou na Nana does awfully. Each character is given a Talent, something that makes them special, however, that is as far as their individuality goes. All of the students have one trope that they follow for the whole story; Moguo, the rage-filled, condescending to anyone weaker than him, Kyoya, the edgy detective and the only one with a functioning brain in the whole series. Every character is shallow and does not offer a feeling of complexity that the characters, especially in this type of character driven narration, should have.The story is the weakest part of the series. Even with a boring, stale and just bad cast, the story manages to outdo it and goes even beyond the cast’s level of stupidity. Nana kills a classmate, Kyoya gets enough evidence and presents it to the class, no one believes it. Repeat this process 5 times and you get the plot of Munou na Nana. There is nothing to add to the cases, each time it is the same things, but with a different method of killing. While the last arc offered a bit of diversity with a different killer being introduced, it added nothing to the story and served only as a filler to progress Nana and Inukai’s relationship, the show's only strong point. The downright simplicity of the cases and the characters’ inability to solve them even while being presented with clear clues indicating that Nana is the killer, is simply baffling and unbelievably hilarious to watch unfold. It looks like a group of kindergarteners trying to solve who stole their favorite toy. And while Nana gets repeatedly accused, she is never found guilty because of plot armor. As soon as enough evidence is presented, everyone starts doubting each other, leaving Nana to kill another one. This process repeats.The one area Munou na Nana excels at is character relations and dynamic. Nana offers a split personality feeling, exposing her true side only to Jin, the unexpected X factor of the series, and it's only captivating character. Nana and Inukai are direct opposites, but are inherently the same. Each one has a goal the other is unaware of for most of the series, however, they manage to find a deeper connection. Inukai is the only person who can accept Nana’s dark side and is the only one in the show to do so. Nana is, contrary to her relationship with others, able to act a bit more like her true self, often opening up about personal problems. The relations are shallow, but serve their role and are its only redeemable quality. Overall they manage to bring some value to the series from a writing, critical standpoint.Inukai is a very intriguing character. Not in a sense that her character makes you ask questions about her, trying to decipher her underlying themes and messages. It is much more shallow than that. She is intriguing because of her stupidity. Seeing a picture of her best friend kill someone, not acting on it, but accepting it as if it was completely normal and continuing to follow an ideal version of Nana is one of the, if not the, dumbest things an anime character has ever done. She idealizes Nana and does everything in her power to keep that ideal of her. This can often be done right, leading to captivating and question-provoking characters such as Shaiapouf from Hunter x Hunter(2011). Inukai, unfortunately, just comes off as entirely hypocritical; wanting to save everyone, but turning a blind eye to Nana that has killed the same people she wants to save. Nana exploits that naivety of hers and treats her like a dog repeatedly, as said by her multiple times. That sort of loyalty even while being clearly exploited could make sense in a tragic way, as with Rolo from Code Geass R2, Inukai, once again, does not fit the description of such a character as she has had a fairly normal childhood.The animation and production quality are all alright, they are nothing more. Studio Bridge did a decent job and left the animation feeling nice, crisp and acceptable. The Opening and Ending fall under the same category. Fitting of the show, but they are just that. Overall, an average visual and audio representation of an average show.Munou na Nana is the definition of mindless entertainment. It was a nice time passing activity and I do not feel like a Season 2 would improve on its predecessor. Miracles do happen, and I will still be eagerly waiting for the announcement that is sure to come given the amount of popularity and spotlight Munou na Nana has been getting in the anime community.

The first side of the sword will absolutely get new anime watchers into it, not just new but people who don't analyze it and think about every detail in anime. If you are new to anime or just like to watch it and you won't think about every mistake the MC does then the anime will be enjoyable and fun to watch. But if you are somewhat of a veteran in anime this show is not for you, because you will get triggered at every mistake they do and how the MC just doesn't get caught...when having a fake talent which is so easy to debunk. For me the anime was hella hyped I would wait for every single episode, but just because I didn't think anything about the actions the MC took. I would only recommend the show to new people that got into anime, not the ones who already watched 100+ anime series. 8/10 when having a fake talent which is so easy to debunk.

I would only recommend the show to new people that got into anime, not the ones who already watched 100+ anime series. 8/10"", 'I just binged this anime, so my review may be a bit biased, but here we go! As always, TL;DR at the end! *EPISODE 1 EXPLICIT SPOILERS, AND VERY VAGUE SPOILERS FOR THE REST*Story 10/10: I went into the show almost blind, so the first episode twist completely blind-sided me. The only thing I knew was that Nana was a “psychopath”. I had assumed I got the whole show spoiled, since I thought Nana was the twist antagonist who would be revealed at the end. Boy was I wrong, and I’m so glad I was.The plot line itself is extremely intriguing. I love me some...psychological warfare. People who complain about the other characters being dumb tend to not realized that they’ve got too much faith in their own deductive ability. It’s not perfect, but the murders make sense, and always leave me impressed. I like that Nana doesn’t get away with everything and has to improvise. It makes her still seem like the underdog despite her success.Of course there’s a lot more to this show than just murder after murder! I don’t want to get into it too much, but the fast pacing and plot development was tight, and I would love to read the manga because I was hooked.Art 8/10: Nothing special style-wise, but the use of colour and light was top-tier. The atmosphere in the show was great, and the character design was also amazing! I appreciate that there was lots of diversity in the cast, and same-face-syndrome wasn’t an issue at all!Despite this not being an action anime, the scenes when there was a lot of action were beautifully animated, with lots of smooth dramatic shots and camera angles. The only reason I can’t rate it higher is the style inconsistency. Not a huge issue, but if I can notice it in a scene I shouldn’t be able to notice it in, that’s a point off.Sound 9/10: I’m not picky about sound at all, but the opening and endings are great. The opening reminds me of Danganronpa 3: Future Arc. They actually may be by the same person when I think about it....I appreciate the use of sound effects and music. The thriller parts really popped out and it created suspense. No complaints here.Character 10/10: At the heart of the show lies 4 characters, carrying the plot like marble pillars: Nana, Michiru, Kyouya, and Jin. Nana blew me away. Her development, believable trauma, motives, regrets, and desires all wrap up into a beautiful package of a character, layered with complexity. I can’t stress how bad I feel for her, despite knowing what she did was wrong.Michiru came off as a token goody two-shoes, but turns out she’s just really gay for Nana (not actually… probably), and I love that for her. I like that we got reasons for her being so selfless other than “she grew up sad so she wants to help others uwu”Kyouya and Jin we didn’t get to see much of at all, but they are almost as smart as Nana, and unique in their own ways, so I hope to see more of their inside character.Not only the 4 pillars are good though. We may barely get to see the other students on a less-than-superficial level, but we get to see how their talents have warped them into who they are. Other than Nanao, I can’t say anyone Nana has murdered was a good person. Each of their motives were believable, and some just borders on just-as-messed-up-as-Nana. The background characters aren’t particularly stupid, just not everyone instantly jumps to murder from disappearance. You can’t expect them to all be smart, and I like that that’s the case here.Enjoyment: Yes. I enjoyed it a lot. Yes. I want another season very badly. After the last episode I just had to sit and think. And rethink my life and choices. and Think about the show’s ending. Now that I have thought, I’m writing this review.TL;DR I adored this anime. It’s not perfect, but it’s interesting and a fun watch that shows how people can be good and bad at the same time, and how power warps people. It handles characters well, and I wish for another season right away!But for now, I’m off to read the manga psychological warfare.

There's a lot of ambition and potential for greatness, but because the target demographic is shounen (aka young boys), ham-handed storytelling and dumbed-down concepts prevent the show from properly filling its own shoes.Let's start with the story. You might see comparisons to Death Note, for the cat-and-mouse game between a murderer and a detective (the frequent monologues amidst red Bad Guy and blue Good Guy filters also applies to both shows). But contrary to its critically renowned cousin, Munou na Nana's plot twists miss their mark just as...much as they hit them. Some of Nana's schemes are brilliant; others rely on a laughable amount of plot armor. Characters whack viewers over the heads with bloated summaries of what has happened, what might happen, and what will happen. The show's a prisoner to its target demographic; it thinks everything needs to be simple and over-explained for its younger audiences, and shoots its own feet in the process.The world-building (or lack thereof) is also worth noting. When the manga was first coming out, many people dropped it because the setting seemed stupid and inconsistent—I suspect the same thing happened for the anime. Eventually the audience realizes these inconsistencies occur because the narrators are unreliable, misinformed children... but it takes a long time to get there, and they only touch on it by the season finale. If this gets a second season, I suspect people will like the plot and world-building more, as the pieces fall into place. But the anime hasn't gotten to those points, so it's not worth noting here.The characters suffer the same as the plot: they're filled with potential but are held prisoner to the shounen label. Nana is deliciously twisted, but also a lost and horribly manipulated kid. While her character development is slightly rushed, it's ultimately done justice. Everyone else is a mixed bag, mostly because of the sheer stupidity they display while Nana gets away with her schemes. Usually, the kids' stupidity is thanks to naivety mixed with some sort of psychological complex, so it's not completely impossible to buy... but you have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit at times.Art and sound are where I think Munou na Nana suffers most, but more so in direction than actual quality. The art and animation aren't stellar, but perfectly fine and definitely not bad-looking. Similarly, the score, voice-acting, and OP/ED are perfectly fine: great in some parts and unmemorable in others (Though, I will say I am extremely partial to the ED. I think it's the best ED of the season with Jujutsu Kaisen's). However, I think the visual and voice-acting directions for Nana are far too heavy-handed. Whenever Nana is plotting something, her eyes go blank, she puts on her super-crazed evil face, and her voice drops at least half an octave. Sometimes it seems like the characters notice her making weird faces (as they should); most times they don't, which makes you wonder if it's happening at all in their reality, or if it's just a stylistic choice to help confused watchers along. Whatever the case, I think it's completely unnecessary, and hurts the show more than it helps.Ultimately, Munou na Nana is just as flawed as Nana herself. There are some brilliant moments, and some surprisingly emotional ones as well. But, you have to wade through a lot of ham-handed storytelling to get there. I was able to turn off my brain and simply enjoy it as whacky popcorn entertainment. But if you prefer tasteful storytelling and figuring out things on your own, I'm afraid Munou na Nana isn't for you. much as they hit them.

I will give this a solid 8/10 and recommend it to those who need some fresh new story.Recommended. Waiting...for 2nd season. for 2nd season."", 'This is my first actual real review thank you for reading!SPOILEEERRRRR ALEEERT!Now for a better understanding of the show and comparisons to other shows:Because this is a psychological thriller, supernatural and suspense show, even tho I would add other tags like drama and mystery, even tho personally I enjoyed the show trough the fact that it playing with my frustration so much, it does a poor job at copying: Death Note, Moriarty the Patriot which I consider masterpieces and even decent animes that I enjoyed like Another or Danganronpa. I am not saying it\'s a copy paste anime, no It\'s not, but It feels like...the author tried to make the same kind of relationship and feeling between Nana and Kyouya like L and Yagami Light, or Sherlock and Moriarty, but they failed doing so because Kyouya while being a very smart detective always messes up weird little things that make no sense and It makes it look like Nana has TOO MUCH PLOT ARMOR. Now another problem that I see with the show and that I agree with everybody else who commented, ALMOST ALL CHARACTERS WHO WERE KILLED BY NANA WERE ABSOLUTELY BRAIN DEAD, now excuse me but why was every single one of them other than Nakajima SUCH MORONS, like some of them had so many opportunities to tell others while knowing that she was a killer, but NOPE PLOT ARMOR the character is brainless dumb duck who is also mentally dumb.Some complaints that I saw (skip this part if you\'re not interested):Anyways starting with some things: It says that Nanao Nakajima was an MC, but he was only at the start till he presumably died, I personally think he will come back in season 2, but anyways that\'s not the point, the thing is people are critiquing the anime based on the fact that Nanao was MC and how th did he die ugh the show is sooooo badddd, but no, as the title of the anime says ""Talentless Nana"" the show is about Nana mostly, she is the main MC, ofc there is Kyouya Onodera who is also considered an MC, but I think the fact that they did a dirty cliffhanger on us and made it so an ""considered MC"" died at the start of the show, makes it so that Nanao Nakajima will come back later in the second or third season.Final thoughts:While this show was definitely frustrating, in a way it was also pretty enjoyable to watch, IDK maybe I am a masochist who wants to be frustrated, actually now that I think about it yes I absolutely am. Would I recommend this anime: YES TO PEOPLE LIKE ME and those who don\'t CARE WHO THE HELL IS MC. AND NO TO PEOPLE WHO don\'t like the weird frustration that I talked about and the dumb characters and the weird part-mc dying at start of the show. Anyways I am out I need to chill, cuz this is the second anime that made me write a review, but like this time I wrote a legit review. Oh also you might be asking why I put such a high score for the anime, I don\'t score animes based on weird formulas and mathematics, NO IF I ENJOY ANIME=GOOD, IF DON\'T THEN =BAD, IF I FIND SOME COMPLAINTS THEN =DECENT or =DECENT-GOOD, anyways you got it! the author tried to make the same kind of relationship and feeling between Nana and Kyouya like L and Yagami Light, or Sherlock and Moriarty, but they failed doing so because Kyouya while being a very smart detective always messes up weird little things that make no sense and It makes it look like Nana has TOO MUCH PLOT ARMOR.

The anime itself is not bad, the plot is like among us but I would have liked not to know who the murderer is here at all times, you know who he is. After the detective I feel I could do more to prevent death and destruction. The animation is very good, then the soundtrack accompanies. The character development that he does is fine but it doesn't get to any of the plot because the anime is so short. The character design seems very good to me, it's fun and it works,...but since the plot doesn't finish exploding. Chapters were missing from the anime to be able to reach its maximum. It is also a very entertaining anime, if you want to see something dangaromppa type I recommend it or else don't spend it.En español:Primero que nada el anime tiene un final abierto sin un final como es debido. El anime en si no esta mal la trama es como among us pero me hubiera gustado no saber quien es el asesesino aca en todo momento abes quien es. Despues el detective siento que podria hacer mas cosas para impedir la muerte y destruccion. La animacion esta muy bien, despues la banda sonora acompaña. El desarrollo de personajes que hace esta bien pero no llega a nada de la trama porque el anime es muy corto. El diseño de personjes me parece muy bueno es divertido y funciona pero como la trama no llega a terminar de explotar. Le fataron capitulos al anime para poder llegar a su maximo.

Frankly speaking there are point in the anime where it is really obvious that who the killer is and seems as if Onodera has figured it out, But for...some reason he keeps doubting himself even after doing all this research and shit I mean I get it they have to make the show interesting but it seems like teasing as some points, and at times you can pretty much guess what\'s gonna happen cuz the anime tries the same concept over and over again for some reasons. They do not do anything or pull a unexpected thing on us pretty generic stuff basically.The only character that I really liked is *Cough* the White haired Todoroki uhm I mean Onodera.

Overall it\'s not bad defo give it a watch.', ""This going to be a short review.Talent less Nana is about a girl name Nana (duh) who is sent to an island full of people with powers (they have similar powers to people from MHA). The talented are sent their to prepare to have a fight with the 'enemies of humanity'(it turns out that the government made a excuse to keep them at bay and deemed them the actual enemies). She is sent there for one reason, to kill everyone there. On the surface it sounds amazing and great. How will she hide the bodies and how will she kill them all. The whole anime...can be summarized into one word; plot-armor. That's right folks, the only reason she doesn't  get caught is because of plot-armor.1st issue: On the first episode she  becomes friends with a boy named Nanao who is said to have no power at all. She decides that he is her first target. She spends the whole day with him and tries to get to know him using her 'power' (she said that she can read peoples inner thoughts but she is just a well trained psychic). She takes him to a cliff facing over water. Nanao (boy) tells her that his power is that he can negate any power. They luckily shot on target because Nanano said he doesn't know if his power works on psychics. He asks if they can hold hands to see if Nana can still read his mind, in that moment she  cry's saying 'finally i don't hear someones voice' and pushes him off while saying 'your probably thinking why is this happening? Am I gonna die because of her?' and she lets go and he dies. Later she befriends a person who can travel back in time and see what happened for a short amount of time. After figuring out that he cant swim she lays dirt on a river frozen by another talented and lures him to stand there and time travel. He does that and she breaks the ice and lets him drown. That doesn't add up if he can move around while time travel then why didn't he move when he returned.2nd issue: Nana gets appointed leader and no one suspects her for the deaths even though she was with both of them the whole time. When she gets questioned by the only seasonable character (Kyouya)she says she heard the voices of the enemies of humanity and thought nothing of it at the time but now suspects that they were both killed by them.3rd issue: Kyouya had given really reasonable proof as to why he thought Nana was the killer yet people ignore him because Nana always has a pure act on. And the most retarded person of all time into play; Tsunekichi, he has the power to see the future while he sleeps and can take pictures of them if hes holding a camera. He has solid evidence  that Nana was a killer yet didn't show it to anyone. Instead he used it to black mail her into becoming her girlfriend. While with Tsuenekichi she sees hows he makes photos and steals one of the five photos(she replaces one with a fake). Becuase Tsunekichi thinks he has the upper hand he submits to Nana and meets up with her at nighttime in a shed.Using his stupidity she grabs her poison needles  and kills him. She tells everyone and they all think shes innocent (apart from Kyouya). One of her friends finds a photo of her killing some and she says 'oh he probably got it wrong that time, can i have the photo now?' LIKE WHAT? The dude proved he was never wrong and she believed her.In conclusion the anime is full of brain dead and retarded characters who just believe Nana because shes cute and innocent. The only good thing about this anime is how she kills people and some how EsCapeS WiTH fUlL iNNocEnce.

I was debating about dropping it or keep watching it, but I decided, I might as well give it a watch because for how stupid some of the character choices were, I was like well I guess this is basically like Among Us and it works because people do pick the dumb decisions.So yes it's easy to hate on this show for how stupid some characters are but again with so much power,...it make sense too. I honestly thought as predictable as the final few episodes were, I actually still enjoyed it regardless of the predictable plotline. I am pretty bias when it comes to redemption arc, so I always enjoy those personally and friendship. So yes it was good enough to save the show for me from completely hating it.Could it have been better? YES! But for what it is and what it presented, it wasn't bad enough that you should completely skip over it. It ain't no gem and it ain't like something I would say a must watch. It is one of those shows if you're sitting there with nothing else to watch, I say give it a watch.It's good enough for me to not drop it even though I was tempted too. Though I do think the characters are dumb except like a few exception. I enjoyed it more then I hate it we'll just say that because I do think the second half is good enough to redeem it. If you don't mind the predictable plot and just want to see a great friendship develop, it was bittersweet. it make sense too. I honestly thought as predictable as the final few episodes were, I actually still enjoyed it regardless of the predictable plotline. I am pretty bias when it comes to redemption arc, so I always enjoy those personally and friendship. So yes it was good enough to save the show for me from completely hating it.Could it have been better? YES!

I like this anime because the perspective focuses on the antagonist, even so the atmosphere of tension when we watch it is very pronounced and we are made nervous at certain times. rather predictable plots are made attractive by exceeding our expectations. for the school genre, this anime is very lacking, the atmosphere at school is very bad, they only use school uniforms and most of the settings are in the forest. I recommend this anime for the psychology genre....we were curious ""can the guise of MC be known?"" and we are also irritated and angry with the supporting characters. we were curious ""can the guise of MC be known?"" and we are also irritated and angry with the supporting characters.', ""Finally, a refreshing non-generic story here that quite surprises me, firstly I thought from the trailer that the anime will be a Slice of Life my hero academia quirk style, but wow, didn't expect it to be this intriguing.Story : 7Not that its a 'new' themed story, but it is very good and refreshing this season.Art : 6Art is okay, there's room for improvement....Sound : 7Not very appealing, but okayCharacter : 8for this recent episode, the character is still engaging and unique on its own and also very enjoyable imoEnjoyment : 8would recommend and also would watch show similliar to this again.Overall : 8as I said above, this anime really surprises me, its very refreshing to find this treasure among great anime this season.

Unfortunately, it doesn't come very close.Story (6/10): Most of the redeeming factors of this story involve the game of cat and mouse between its two main characters. The introduction of a third person into this dynamic in episode 9 makes things more complicated, but it's unclear as of the tenth episode whether or not this is a good thing. The premise of a powerless human secretly killing off powerful mutants one by one using only her cunning and wit is a very interesting...one, although some of the world's setup doesn't make much sense. Students with powers are sent to an island that is cut off from the outside world, an island from which no one has every returned, and they're not the least bit suspicious about why they're there? There is one character that harbors such suspicions, but only because he has a relative that disappeared on the island before. The rest remain ignorant. Couldn't they tell that the rest of the world hates them if that is truly the case? There are, however, enough twists to keep my attention, and there is entertainment value here.Characters (4/10): The motivations of the main character are kind of unclear, and the show relies heavily on the entire cast, with the exception of the main two or three, being both oblivious and extremely stupid. None of the rest are even remotely interesting, and so a 4 is the highest I could give.Art (4/10) and Sound (6/10): There isn't too much to say here, but as a matter of personal preference I'm not a huge fan of the show's art style. It at least tries to be different than the standard style you'd find from most animation studios, and so a 4 is entirely subjective and could be higher for others. The sound is okay, with the opening and ending being forgettable, though good performances from some of the VAs bump the score up to a 6.Enjoyment (6/10): I'll finish this season, since at this point I'm curious enough in the turnout to make the rest of the watch worth it, and it is indeed entertaining. This season wasn't overwhelmingly strong, having only two shows that have me invested, so if a continuation of this anime comes out in future seasons with better lineups it may not be worth my time.Overall: 6/10 one, although some of the world's setup doesn't make much sense.

Its a classic example of a mediocre cash-grabbing anime that instead of telling a compelling story tries to hold your interest for as long as possible only to leave you with more questions prompting the never to want a second season which might deliver but most possibly will only make it worse.I can not recommend this anime even if you only are interested in the concept, gore or psychological aspect of the anime as you would only end up disappointed...with the sheer mediocrity. with the sheer mediocrity.', ""The reason why I picked to watch this anime is because Nana looked cute in the posts about her online. The first time I watched it, I thought it was going to be an another anime like My Hero Academia where it’s going to showcase students with superpowers and fight bad guys etc. With this impression while watching episode 1, I was already feeling I’m not get take long before I drop this anime. I have finished watching episode 1 before deciding to drop it. Watching the show again starting with episode 2, it was more interesting than I ever thought.The characters, especially the...minor ones looked pretty average to me. But what interests me is their abilities. I thought they’re going to have like OP abilities, but the idea that they limitations made it a bit realistic in this show. Also they have unique powers; like Michiru, who can heal wounds, but it is limited to the parts her tongue can reach and her healing abilities is only limited to external wounds. I also like Shibusawa's ability where he can go back to the past, but it is only limited for a certain amount of days, and going back in the past drains his stamina.  I also liked Yuka's ability, I like how she can bring back dead to life using the things the dead touched back when they are alive. Besides her abilities, I also like how she has her own story for a minor character. I also liked characters like Kyoya and Michiru who accompanied Nana throughout the whole show, even though they have suspicions to Nana.The plot of the story was pretty great for me and it keep me entertained while watching the whole thing. The idea that Nana was put to a mission to kill all the ability users in their island was something I did not expect in this anime. I enjoyed watching all the episodes, since it had a lot of suspense and plot twists.Overall for a small anime title, this was a great watch. The characters didn’t give off much of a bigger presence unlike the bigger anime titles with the same genre. The anime is like a combination of Assassination Classroom and My Hero Academia.

I couldn\'t feel any connection to any of the characters.I can understand why sides characters had to get easily recognisable traits as they are mostly the focus during one episode only. But, it\'s a shame, the anime didn\'t manage to compensate the problems that came with it; as in, making the main charcaters the real deal, so that we can put our every focus on them.Even for Nana from whom...we get a lot of her thoughts and thus should feel more involved with, I couldn\'t care less.The animation is pretty good with  nice colors.

I really wanted to write this review because this show really gets shit on by people. I am going to try to break down each category: Animation, Story, Music (OST, OP, ED), Characters, Overall Enjoyment**WARNING, THERE MAY BO SPOILERS****ANIMATION** RATING: 5For a shounen superpower thrilller, the animation is mediocre. It is not the greatest, but it is not the worst.**STORY** RATING: 9It\'s kind of tough trying to word how well written the story is. During the first episode, I was literally dying of boredom because of how shit it was in the beginning, but the plot twist at the...end of the episode is what really got me hooked into the anime. It got me so hooked that it would make me really think at what Nana\'s next moves where and it would surprise me what she would do next. There are countless other twists and surprises throughout the anime that really make me scream ""HOLY FUCK"".**SOUND** RATING: 6The OST is mediocre at most, it really doesn\'t do much except be background music. The opening is a little bland. The ending is alright.**CHARACTER** Rating: 7Some characters you hate, some characters you love.The main characters are really something, Nana is someone you really want to punch, but in reality she will kill you lol. But in all seriousness, Nana is a character that really makes me want to think and make me play detective while watching the show. Just wanting to know how her kill plays out and how she will manage to kill countless superpowered teenagers just by herself, while BEING powerless. When she was introduced, she said that her superpower was \'mind-reading\'. But in reality, her only power is her brain, the way she can use mind-tricks to figure out what other people are thinking. The way she can manipulate people and get out of sticky situations really shows the \'gap\' between Nana\'s mind and everyone\'s mind. Kyouya is like the L of this series. He has his reasons for trying to play detective, while other students don\'t.Sometimes, the biggest turnoff of this show is when the students side with Nana, making you think that the students are really fucking retarded, but you have to understand the student\'s point of view. In their eyes, they view Nana as a charismatic leader. While on the other hand, they view Kyouya as some loner edgy guy. Just remember, the students aren\'t exposed to the same information compared to you, so really try to put yourself in the shoes of the students to understand.**OVERALL ENJOYMENT** Rating: 10This is like one of the very rare moments I actually enjoyed an anime 10/10.

If you are looking for some intellectuel show then go look somewhere else. Munou na Nana has completely different strengths.The premise of the show is very interesting, i personally picked it up just for the idea. But i have to say  that is not fully explored. Its biggest weakness is in the cat and mouse premise. I would love to see Nana struggle more with how to kill a overpowered person than trying to prove her innocence all the time. Thats why i think that the first 3 episodes are amazing but...from there it goes downhill. All the characters except Nana have absolutely no personality other than their little perk or messed up thinking. On the other hand Nana goes through a very interesting character development. To summarize it, Nana is seeking revenge but she slowly realizing that it was a mistake to blame it on the every superpowered person on the earth and not just on that one individual.The Art and sound are very mediocre, they dont stand out but their not terrible.So overall i really enjoyed watching it. I cant recommend it for everyone but if you looking for a edgy, dumb and simple story with a interesting promise than this show is for you. from there it goes downhill.

When we are young, death isn\'t something we consider at all and so is caution.In a world where they are being said to be the greatest, where their parents and then teachers hand everything...to them on a golden platter, can it really be impossible to think that these kids do not try to be proactive and paranoid and simply think that the adults will protect them anyways, so they can just trust them and proceed with their happy life?Maybe the people leaving bad reviews solely based on the fact that they think the characters dumb is because they want to believe they would not be this clueless if something ever happened but in reality they would?Nonetheless, Munou no Nana is bringing something new to the table of the superhero kids’ trope, what if the ""good guys"" were actually the ""bad guys""? And what if the supposed real ""good guys"" have to act like bad guys for the greater good?I\'m not going to lie, the art is just well enough. No funny terrible animated moment but not breathtaking either. Just all proper, good work and yes, average but nothing too hideous that makes you want to stop watching because of the art or animation.

I\'m just putting here that I\'ve been watching anime and reading manga for over 14 years now (please call me grandma) and I\'ve been hooked by what I thought -going by the art and trailer- would be a pretty average and boring show.Nana is special, but not how you think and I loved how she had to use her head to get things done, rather than having a hero that screams and think that smashing everything with his punch will magically solve everything. It was super refreshing and I definitely got a Death Note feeling, the show gives you the same information as the characters and they amaze you with how they solved puzzle or think fast to win.I\'m putting the masterpiece rate on this one.

On the other side of the table, we have every-so-often deployed serial killers that take out the talented in order to maintain order because as it seems, human mind has not developed any farther in the portrayed human civilization that proper education and help would probably be a better solution rather than using brute force.So, what could go...wrong if someone infiltrated the ranks of the Talented, right? Well, as you would expect, many things could go wrong. Despite Nana's holy protection of the PlotArmorPlus™ warranty, not even that saves her from suffering in one way or another.

Sounds quite interesting, doesn\'t it? A badass girl against all odds succeeding on her impossible mission? Lemme tell you something. It is NOT.Munou na Nana is probably the worst, most terrible, most ridiculous attempt at re-creating a Death Note setting. It had so much potential, but unfortunately that potential was COMPLETELY wasted. I did not feel a single drop of enjoyment watching this show, and now you\'ll know why.The main character, Nana, is absolutely horrible...at what she does. Let\'s compare this with an Among Us match, shall we? She\'s a terrible, terrible imposter, but she\'s playing against completely noob and clueless players. Nana is terrible at being an assassin, or whatever she is, so careless it hurts, but somehow, she always manages to escape. Why? Because literally EVERY character in this show, besides Mr. White Hair Guy and Necromancer (and to be fair, not even those two are actually that smart), are incredibly, overwhelmingly dumb. Against all odds, against all proof, against all suspicious behaviours she shows, all of the characters decide to trust her. You can tell me, oh, of course they do, they aren\'t watching the show, they\'re ""living it"" or whatever, but look, once you have SOLID proof against her SO MANY times, anyone that is sane would doubt her, at least a tiny bit. Not these guys though, since they have the PERSONALITY AND INTELECT OF A CINDER BLOCK.I pushed myself to watch until the end, and it was painful. Horribly painful. I had to lie down a bit, because it TIRED me. Watching so many times clueless people making dumb decisions. And guess what? That\'s the whole anime. All 13 eps. It\'s simply not worth it to waste your time with it. Actually, it is. Watch it with a friend that wheezes when he laughs, and try to make him laugh as much as you can.My conclusion is that. Don\'t watch it, unless you wanna mock the anime for being so, SO bad and with such STUPID characters. Protagonism saved Nana multiple times, and it\'ll continue to do so in future seasons, if it comes to that point.HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISKA little thingy I\'m writing for the only character that has an actually decent personality.

Before we get into the spoilers, on the strength of premise and opening alone, I don\'t totally hate the show, but the more I watch, the worse it becomes. Spoilers Ahead.The unexpected plot twist in episode 1 also functions as the main draw to keep watching. At first, I expected Nana to cleverly dispatch a few of the kids with ease, but then struggle and falter as the degree of difficulty of each subsequent kill surely increases as the class starts noticing...people are dropping like flies.In some ways, it actually does pan out like this, but written in what feels like the worst possible route to get there. Rather than multiple kids getting suspicious, there\'s literally just 10 brain cells spread out across all the students, and ""Kyoya"" the resident Sherlock has all of them. He apparently is the only one that gives any amount of shit about their literal classmates dying and disappearing. Every other character is written like an absolute moron who either acts against their own self interest and/or the overall group.Without getting into all the mindnumbing details, every person Nana kills after the initial kill has some reason to be suspicious, yet does nothing about it. A person who can literally see the future, and sees their apparent death, rather than notifying literally anybody, just ""accepts his fate"". He then proceeds to shounen rape Nana for some inane reason.It\'s essentially the shounen *wink wink nod nod* for sexual assault, where the guy asks ""Nana"" to be his girlfriend and stay in his room. They\'re not quite brave enough to come out and say he\'s trying to rape his murderer, so instead Nana becomes his totally not sex slave and cleans his room. It feels like a lazy half baked reason for why Nana gets off scot free for all her murders up far.Basically, Clairvoyant Camera Guy is a Scumbag DumDum (TM) and so obviously won\'t tell his classmates about the cute girl murderer going around whacking kids, just in case he gets that sweet sweet killer poon sometime in the future.None of the characters act with any sense of logic or reasoning behind their actions. Having some off-kilter characters isn\'t a problem, but the entire cast shouldn\'t be full of numbskulls, otherwise the idea of going to all this effort to kill them seems laughable.

I literally stumbled across this anime out of straight boredom. I had no expectations, AND I was extremely surprised. Not only was his ability to maintain its mystery and suspense to the very end impressive, but the development of the characters was unending. If you are looking for something to watch THIS ANIME IS A MUST!!! Personally, I think the game Among Us is kinda cool, but an anime version is amazing.The art for this anime was pretty good. In my opinion, the actual art wasn’t anything new or experimental....However, it was indeed well done and the characters were all very unique. For me personally, I say the most artistic point from this anime that stood out the most was the characters visual emotions. When an anime can make me truly feel a characters emotions, that’s how I know they’ve done a truly good job.The soundtrack for this enemy was nothing special. Nothing really stood out for me and it wasn’t very memorable. However, I will say that this anime’s ability to use sound was indeed good. I think you can feel the characters fears uncertainties a lot better because of their use of sound. Again, it was nothing special.OK so this is what I really wanted to talk about. This anime is thick AF. Their use of characters it’s awesome. Each character is so unique and so detailed, yet so mysterious. This is a suspenseful anime and I will say each character has so much suspense developed within them throughout the anime it’s crazy. I’m definitely in love with the characters. Even the ones I hate, that’s how you know it’s good.All right enjoy this anime, check it out for yourself! However, it was indeed well done and the characters were all very unique.

Not because the show is necessarily trash, but because people act butt hurt when they feel unheard. Neither group will make it easier for people to properly judge if a show is worth it or not. I would even argue it makes all reviews more worthless.So here is my review.Just frickin watch it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. It has an original enough premise to give it a try. Regardless, it's only (going to be) 13 episodes,...so it's not that much of an investment if you end up hating it. There are many good things, but certainly many debatable things about it too. I just think people sometimes wind themselves up too much about the good and the bad and forget to just enjoy their time.__Now, if you really care what I think other than 'just watch it'; I think the show is average, apart from the enjoyment factor, which is most of the time quite good. Characters seem to be purposefully extremely stereotyped, which is equally baffling at times as it makes me chuckle at others. It doesn't stand out as much to me as it sometimes did in shows like Danganronpa or Future Diary however. Their designs are in bright shounen/shoujo colors probably to make you think it's going to be something that it isn't. Sound and music design is not bad or even interrupting the scenes, but they are not something exceptional either.The main reason why it may be more enjoyable that it's quality might show, is the way the main character deducts other people's real thoughts, feelings and actions. Which can take you by surprise, regardless if you tried to speculate on the outcome of an episode or not. I see shows that manage to deviate expectations like that, usually as a plus. That doesn't make every other aspect it fails in less bad, but at least it my proof to be a fun thing to watch and speculate over with family or friends. Like a classic detective series.TL;DR it might be worth your time if you like a good mystery or something with a pretty original premise, deviating from expectations. But, if you usually prefer a more realistic settings and less cookie-cutter characters or a more traditional shounen, you might want to look elsewhere. so it's not that much of an investment if you end up hating it.

But to be honest, I didn\'t really think I would like this anime. A school of teens with superpowers? Yeah, it\'s fine, but I\'ve already seen it. There are murders? Fine, but again, I\'ve already seen it.However, the contrast between the way the protagonist thinks and the way she acts, and also the fact that she was the killer, were enough to make me continue the anime after the first episode. Were they also things I already saw in other shows? Yes, but they were well made enough to catch my attention.I watched this show thinking...""seem interesting, but I\'m not really attached to these characters, I don\'t feel strong emotions watching it, I just want to know what could happen to the protagonist, as soon I will have enough I will drop the series"". But even with this mindset, after each episode, I was thinking ""Well, I want to know how it continues, probably I will watch another episode before dropping the series"".But I never dropped it. As I said, it was entertaining. The scheming, the neverending mental fight between the character were great for me.So I watched the last episode. In my opinion... gold. The series was not great but good, the ending was everything I wanted to watch. It was wholesome, but sad and moving.Surely it isn\'t the right anime for all people, but it was the right one for me, I enjoyed it and I think it was worth to watch.

But, after talking about it with my brother who didn't want to watch it and asked me to spoil it all. He is incredibly intelligent and he pointed out some flaws in it like the world building and other stuff that I won't get...into it due to it being spoilers.And I realized that I only truly enjoy this anime, based on the fact that I am obsessed with detective stuff and murder mystery concepts. When I first watched danganronpa at 13, I was obsessed with that too.

The concept was awesome, I thought how characters died was creative but after looking back on it, maybe it didn't make that much sense? Then again I'm a bit stupid so I wouldn't be able to tell what made sense and what didn't.I also saw other reviews and so a lot of people hating on the show which made me feel a little silly for liking it so much initially, but I can't help it, everything about the show was my cup of tea.

Not amazing, not awful, it\'s fine.Story: So the first episode is what i believe many people would say is the best part of the show...I personally think...that the first episode was as best of a starting point as it could be.

There\'s a reason why ALMOST everyone is a cocky piece of shit, and if you didn\'t get this point of the show, then why are you even watching it at this point. I can agree that there only are a few likeable characters here, personally I love Nana, Kyoya, Jin, and their respective character developments.

Apart from one guy, the whole supporting cast are a bunch of idiots which makes Nana easily get out situations.This could’ve been a good, fun, mystery ride like MHA meets Among Us with the vibe of Light vs L but with a whole classroom of the other letters.

Light vs a room full Patrick’s from Spongebob.', 'Munou na Nana had an interesting idea for a plot, but it turned to shit after a few episodes. Still, it manages to be an entertaining and enjoyable show.AN INTERESTING STARTThe basic idea of the plot is pretty cool, and is more or less an anime version of the Werewolf card game.The main character, Nana, has to kill a whole lot of people on an island isolated from the rest of the world. The people she must kill are students with supernatural abilities called talents, ranging from overpowered abilities like time manipulation and immortality, to more standard stuff like healing other people’s wounds....But Nana doesn’t have a talent – she is “talentless”, hence the name. And so she has to isolate her targets and kill them one by one using her assassination skills, and then create herself an alibi after each murder. On top of that she also has to pretend that she is one of the talented.Enters Kyouya, the main antagonist of the first half of the series.Kyouya’s role in the first half of the series can be compared to L’s role in Death Note. He quickly identifies Nana as being the first suspect for the murders, but doesn’t have an actual proof to incriminate her and get the other students on his side. So for an important part of the series, he will observe each of her actions, hoping to catch her in the act.BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE DUMBIf the basic idea sounded cool, the show quickly becomes very stupid.Nana and Kyouya are presented as geniuses when they’re actually not that clever, it’s just that they’re the only ones with a somewhat working brain, while the rest of the cast is dumb as hell. The students see their peers getting killed one by one, but don’t react. They should be panicking or trying to find the murderer, but instead they swallow Nana’s obvious lies and go back to their lives like nothing happened.Kyouya becomes a useless secondary character after several episodes, and his character development is put to a halt. The nice Death Note vibes that the viewer was getting in the first half of the series being to disappear and the shows turns into some sort of anime Battle Royale with superpowers.Nana is portrayed as a manipulative genius who uses other student’s talents for her own benefit, but she makes stupid decisions very often. In the first episode she kills the student whose talent is being able to cancel other people’s talents, even though she already had him in her pocket and could have make good use of him.Then there’s also the fact that towards the end of the series, the show decides to add some dumb and unnecessary romance between Nana and another character, Michiru – we’ll talk about her later.THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY AVERAGEExcept from Nana and maybe Kyouya, the rest of the cast is forgettable and cliché.The students that Nana targets aren’t introduced until it’s their turn to be killed. Most of the time they will appear on screen and you will be like “who’s that guy, again?”. Nobody knows, because they were barely given any screen time before and you know that they’re going to die very soon.Then you have the too young, too simple, sometimes naive Michiru, an annoying secondary character with an irritating high-pitched voice who starts to play a more important role in the last episodes because Nana takes a liking to her.IT IS ENTERTAINING, THOUGHEven with a nonsensical plot and bad secondary characters, the show still manages to be entertaining if you don’t give too much thought to it. How? Well, it hides (or tries to hide) its flaws by being fast-paced, having a lot of twists and ending each and every episode on a cliffhanger. However, this also means that the series abruptly ends on a cliffhanger, which isn’t really satisfying.It is also enjoyable because for once, we have a main character who is pretty good: a two-faced serial killer who manipulates people with her fake personality and uses amoral tactics. She gets character development and character evolution during the series, but it is sad that this evolution is brought about by a crappy romance story. A likeable character overall, and some people will enjoy her “edgy” side.Production-wise, the animation is more than decent. The character designs, backgrounds, props and such were okay overall. Sound-wise the BGM had nothing noteworthy, but it didn’t hinder the show. The opening was very nice and the voice acting was somewhat good if you don’t count Michiru’s infuriating voice.CONCLUSIONTo conclude, Munou na Nana is neither a ground-breaking anime, nor an unforgettable one. It is, ultimately, yet another one of these shows that had an interesting idea for a plot, but turned out to be very disappointing. However, it also has some good elements and can be enjoyable if you don’t give too much thought about the plot. But Nana doesn’t have a talent – she is “talentless”, hence the name. And so she has to isolate her targets and kill them one by one using her assassination skills, and then create herself an alibi after each murder. On top of that she also has to pretend that she is one of the talented.Enters Kyouya, the main antagonist of the first half of the series.Kyouya’s role in the first half of the series can be compared to L’s role in Death Note. He quickly identifies Nana as being the first suspect for the murders, but doesn’t have an actual proof to incriminate her and get the other students on his side. So for an important part of the series, he will observe each of her actions, hoping to catch her in the act.BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE DUMBIf the basic idea sounded cool, the show quickly becomes very stupid.Nana and Kyouya are presented as geniuses when they’re actually not that clever, it’s just that they’re the only ones with a somewhat working brain, while the rest of the cast is dumb as hell. The students see their peers getting killed one by one, but don’t react. They should be panicking or trying to find the murderer, but instead they swallow Nana’s obvious lies and go back to their lives like nothing happened.Kyouya becomes a useless secondary character after several episodes, and his character development is put to a halt.

If a show is bad its bad and if its good its good.The story begins with a boy being bullied and intro of two transfer students. Also 1st episodes tells about the so called "" TALENTED "" people.The story was too sick to begin with.1) The character Nanao who I thought as the MC turned out to be a supporting character and his life was too much short lived.2) The Nana girl character was awesome but she was twisted.3) The healing girl was a drag.Above mentioned statements may contradict my rating,...but that\'s how I really feel about this show. but that\'s how I really feel about this show.', ""I think the primary thing that holds this story back is how elementary it is in its execution. Psychological thrillers of this nature are usually quite complex and sophisticated in their writing; and whilst this show manages to pull a Madoka on us by setting up the story using various tropes/aesthetics and turning the show on its head by subverting our expectations of how those tropes will play out (trying not to spoil the opening episodes so i'm intentionally being vague here), the actual show plays out fairly reductively.The show is fairly shallow, leaving a lot to the imagination/assumed and whilst there are some interesting...plays based on the character abilities, I feel like the show uses those interesting abilities as a crutch in lieu of better writing. In short, there are tons of holes in the plot that go largely unaddressed, as well as there just being a whacky hard to believe premise that zero effort is made to help us suspend our disbelief over. Whether or not that potential reduction in sophistication has happened as a result of condensing and converting the paper medium to animation (which I appreciate happens a lot) I cannot say as I did not read the novel/manga, but in the end I have to judge the show as-is, rather than the potential of the original story. Since that is what we're watching here.Because a lot is left to be assumed regarding why characters act in certain ways or do things that aren't exactly efficient or relatable, Nana specifically becomes a rather insufferable character as it feels like she's getting away with a lot more than she should, or made to appear way smarter than the story makes her, but also so are most of the other characters who behave in weird an unrelatable ways (although this may just be an issue with the genre as it's not exactly uncommon for people to question how dumb a certain character has to be to wind up dying in a certain way).Given that the main reason I didn't like this show was its dodgy foundations, ie its premise and bad characters/writing, there's not much else worth picking apart any further. The show isn't as clever as it makes itself out to be, but the actual animation is fine so the artists did well enough. plays based on the character abilities, I feel like the show uses those interesting abilities as a crutch in lieu of better writing.

Therefore i find that hard to enjoy.

Apparently no scenes were skipped though, so one can easily hop into the manga and continue where this leaves off.The negative reactions to this anime surprise me. I don\'t know how many times the show needs to spell out that the government (or whoever they are) used Nana\'s parents\' death to manipulate and brainwash her into killing innocent people. I\'ve seen no calls for the shady men brainwashing a child...to be brought to justice. And the other characters have been keep in the dark about many truths and could only act on info they\'d been given. We know way more than them at any given moment, so of course they seem dumb. And Nana has no more ""plot armor"" than any other protagonist, especially Light Yagami from Death Note (who she and this show share a lot of similarities to).Overall, I really enjoyed my time watching this. I was actually bored halfway through the first episode thinking it was gonna be a generic shounen power fantasy, but the ending woke me up and kept me hooked.

If I could describe Munou na Nana in short, it would be: ""Among Us but the Crewmate is a single person"" or it might be the reverse but I wouldn\'t know.

Theses people do the horror movie thing of yelling at the screen for the characters to realize they're in a horror movie already. But to be so 'meta' about how you view this anime requires you to ignore the way...the series works blatantly to establish the strangeness of this world compared to our own, and I think the way that strangeness is mostly outside of the precise setting we're in - a setting that looks completely normal to us - is the biggest reason why. Talentless Nana is a world where we, the audience, cannot trust that things are as they're said to be. The first 2 episodes establishes that explicitly with how it comes out the gate saying this is a story with lying textbooks, secret groups who want Talented people dead, and conflicting narratives on what exactly happened when Talented people appeared. To trust anything you don't see with your own eyes is to set yourself up for deceit & death, this story tells us.Nana isn't an unreachably OP genius; neither is the self-declared detective Kyouya. What they both *are* is hyper-focused observant people who notice little things about people, whether it be their appearance or their words, and who have such a rock-solid belief in what they know to be true that they can make the deduction that, say, a girl is lying about being on a date with a guy because she said it was a weekend date yet said he wore his weekday school uniform to it, which makes no sense. Most of us have a first instinct to ignore minor inconsistencies in life - Nana and Kyouya don't, and that makes them both so much more understandable as the main warring minds of the show for it, because *we the audience* could've noticed a so-called loner was never actually was animated flipping the pages of his loner book, or that the man-disguised-as-a-cat went missing from the scene alongside the poison bottle, or any of the other deductions the show silently leaves there to be noticed.To look at this show and say it's bad because the characters have personality flaws [Michiru's excessively trusting personality comes to mind, even though they literally have a whole sequence explaining that, beyond being innately nice, someone she cared about was revealed to her as being secretly self-sacrificing for Michiru's sake when they were treated as a no-good delinquent by the public which serves to enforce Michiru's belief that people are generally secretly kinder than they first appear, how the fuck did people not get that point of her as a character and how it's meant to challenge Nana's cynicism to help her arc SHE'S A FLUFFY DUMB LOVING GIRL AND SHE WERE A GUY YOU'D ALL CRY HIMBO AND LOVE HER FOR IT, IT GRINDS MY DAMN GEARS TO SEE MICHIRU HATE] and make assumptions about their world is to ignore that that's what people do. We assume we know things. We assume we know more things than other people. We like to believe people at first word, especially if they can bring up a decent explanation for whatever initial suspicion we may have, because to see the world as an insidious place where everything and everyone is constantly lying to you is a set-up for becoming a paranoid mess who can't function. Of course strange aliens have invaded and of course superpowers appeared to stop them - that's have of superhero stories ever. And of *course* the superhumans are the real villains who  laud over humanity with their incredible powers - again, it's countless how many equally varied stories of that exist, let alone real human history's examples in a military or political sense as opposed to superpowers. Take in account these kids are fucking teenagers and, again, I wonder why anyone thinks they understood this story and understood it when it's clearly about propaganda, personal deceit, and the idea that we all think we know how the world works. Kyouya is the only character who seems fairly content to confront he needs to doubt nearly everything and yet even he struggles to get proof that can solidify his claims - proof he correctly understands he needs in order to make the other potential victims believe his reality-disrupting story that the sweet class president is a serial killer.Talentless Nana is not a perfect show and a lot of that comes from the fact that it's blatantly unfinished. You'd need at minimum a 2nd season to wrap up what we've learned from S1, and even than I'd personally worry if they can make a post-Nana realizes something about her mission is off Era work as well as the pre-Era did. But it's a damn good suspense murder mystery series that doesn't make you the viewer feel stupid while watching it, the superpowers are fascinating and occasionally original [future sight dream camera??? I love that], and the murders are proven to be so much more fun when we get to watch them from a struggling-to-stay-under-the-radar assassin's POV. I love this show.

As a standalone anime, it’s likely it will hook anyone interested in the genre, though not particularly unique or groundbreaking and with some minor, illogical gaps in part of the characters. However, as an ongoing manga series, it also has yet more to prove for anyone to definitely say it’s coherently, consistently good. Despite that, I enjoyed it a whole lot. (P.S. Don’t read any wikia character pages, please.)Talentless Nana is often likened to the games Among Us...and Danganronpa, understandably so when its very premise is about killing others and not getting caught. Instead of the classic whodunnit, we have the reverse: we follow the one who did it in Talentless Nana through the lens and worldview of its protagonist, Nana Hiiragi.I’d like to use this review to mostly contest that likening a bit and shed light on what makes Talentless Nana unique and separate despite its sometime predictability both in story and characters. (Disclaimer: It may seem like an unfair comparison, but I hope it would more or less serve as a different point of view on whether or not it’s a good show for you.)---PremiseTalentless Nana primarily takes place within the island full of the Talented, who are isolated from the rest of the Talentless world in order to hone their respective powers and defeat the ‘Enemies of Humanity’. Unbeknownst to the other Talented, one of them is an imposter: a regular, Talentless person assigned to assassinate all of them. It is an active story.Danganronpa, in all of its 3 main installments, is primarily about 15-16 high school students that are the cream of the crop in their respective talents (nothing supernatural though) who are forcefully, suddenly isolated from the outside world, and the only way to escape is to kill someone and not get caught. As any of the game’s protagonists, you won’t do the killing. It’s why Danganronpa is kind of a passive story: you have to wait for someone to be motivated to kill. It’s only then that the chapter truly begins with the classic whodunnit. It’s understandable why it’s passive given that, but it’s already one thing that sets it apart.As for the other premise being the existence of talents, the non-shounen action reading/watching person in me is merely inclined to say it’s rather cohesively well done, though perhaps not as intricate as the likes of HxH or BNHA. Each talent and its accompanying weakness is interesting, especially in this setting. What advantage or handicap will the killer and the victim experience given such weaknesses?---WorldbuildingThe synopsis of the show alone may feel weird, cheap, typical, I dunno. What sells it to me, though, is how it has little hints of the larger sociopolitical scheme present in its overall world that eventually open up further into the story—more so in the manga—and it’s exactly what interestingly sets it apart to Danganronpa especially. It’s the main driving force of the antagonists’ motivations; it creates tension between the Talented and Talentless, and it very well should since the existence of the Talented with their practically supernatural, world-breaking powers forever changed their society, how it works, and its people. It’s a concept not usually delved upon in other stories dealing with people with powers, and I daresay Talentless Nana is on the right step in tackling it.Although the story is sometimes predictable and definitely not groundbreaking, it’s not in the same way as Danganronpa. In the latter, however (un)predictable each case becomes, you know for sure that the main character will survive and win against the big bad. It’s a game after all, so the point is to eventually win and not net a game over. You’ll only have to guess and hope who within the rest of the cast will also survive.In Talentless Nana, however, there’s a certain degree of tension and hype that will leave you wanting to know more. In fact, it’s set up in a way that makes you want to be invested in Nana and her interactions with other characters, as well as in how smoothly her killings will go. Will she finally be caught? Will she f up somehow, or will someone f it up for her? Will something happen for her to arouse suspicion? Will something change from her original plan as she interacts with the others? What kind of twists or conflicts can I expect? The way it riles up interest is nothing unique, but hey, it works.---CharactersI think anyone can admit Danganronpa’s characters are very stereotypical anime tropes. It’s nothing bad, and I love some of them for sure, but we can also admit that some of them are only ever fleshed out in the optional Free Time Events (read: social simulation aspects of the game).However, Talentless Nana is lacking in that regard. It has a rather big cast, though it can only focus on its more prominent characters; it has no time to delve too much into the others. It’s kind of why the lack of acknowledgement that the other characters exist feels off—from their reactions to the story to their involvement with the rest of the class, some just suddenly appear and get introduced when deemed convenient by the plot. This is very apparent in the manga as well, so I’d say this is a rather fatal flaw that the story just conveniently brushes that off as something unimportant (e.g. “too engrossed and prideful about their talents to care”) but kinda actually is.How about the prominent characters then? I’ll focus on three that I’m invested in.Being our main point of view in the story, Nana is rather okay. You’ll be invested in her as she actively drives the story, but it takes time for you to truly sympathize with her. It’s only then that you feel more for her, that there’s more to it to her than just her cunningness and logic. You can bet that I’m personally interested in how she further grows in the manga.Then we have Kyoya Onodera, who is essentially the detective, foil character to Nana that makes their relationship likened to Death Note’s L and Light (not that I remember that story anyway). His quirks humanize and make him interesting a lot beyond his role in the story, though unfortunately it feels like it’s either his characterization is already done or is still getting to whatever development level Nana has gotten. To be fair, it’s understandable since he’s not the main character, but it would personally be an interesting sight given his existence as a contrast to Nana.Last that I’ll mention is Michiru Inukai. She’s a very sweet, innocent cinnamon roll you want to protect. You know and have seen her trope multiple times, yet there’s something about the way her character is constructed that makes her lovable. It’s nothing unique, really; it’s a simple characterization that so happens to gel well with the chaos present in the story, making you invested in her despite not having so much of a central role as the other two.---Art/MusicI usually never delve upon this since I have no artistic senses, but I’d say Talentless Nana, both as an anime and manga, has pretty good, consistent art and music.---RatingAccounting for mere personal enjoyment, I’d give it a 9/10 for being able to hook me into its premise—like any good psychological thriller. However, for a more objective review, I’d give it a 7/10: some story gaps here and there, some illogical character reactions explained by convenient cop outs. As a standalone anime, I’d say it’s sufficiently enjoyable nonetheless, but the story has so much to go for that even the manga has yet to touch upon yet, so this rating may easily change as the years come by.It’s an easy recommendation to anyone wanting some excitement brought by a psychological thriller involving killing, and the worldbuilding it has made regarding the Talented is just icing on the cake. However, I don’t think I can recommend it to people who want a consistently paced, deeper story; an intricate lore or conspiracy; and/or a more *collectively* intelligent cast that brings something to the table, as Talentless Nana has yet to wholly prove that. and Danganronpa, understandably so when its very premise is about killing others and not getting caught. Instead of the classic whodunnit, we have the reverse: we follow the one who did it in Talentless Nana through the lens and worldview of its protagonist, Nana Hiiragi.I’d like to use this review to mostly contest that likening a bit and shed light on what makes Talentless Nana unique and separate despite its sometime predictability both in story and characters. (Disclaimer: It may seem like an unfair comparison, but I hope it would more or less serve as a different point of view on whether or not it’s a good show for you.)---PremiseTalentless Nana primarily takes place within the island full of the Talented, who are isolated from the rest of the Talentless world in order to hone their respective powers and defeat the ‘Enemies of Humanity’. Unbeknownst to the other Talented, one of them is an imposter: a regular, Talentless person assigned to assassinate all of them. It is an active story.Danganronpa, in all of its 3 main installments, is primarily about 15-16 high school students that are the cream of the crop in their respective talents (nothing supernatural though) who are forcefully, suddenly isolated from the outside world, and the only way to escape is to kill someone and not get caught. As any of the game’s protagonists, you won’t do the killing. It’s why Danganronpa is kind of a passive story: you have to wait for someone to be motivated to kill. It’s only then that the chapter truly begins with the classic whodunnit. It’s understandable why it’s passive given that, but it’s already one thing that sets it apart.As for the other premise being the existence of talents, the non-shounen action reading/watching person in me is merely inclined to say it’s rather cohesively well done, though perhaps not as intricate as the likes of HxH or BNHA. Each talent and its accompanying weakness is interesting, especially in this setting. What advantage or handicap will the killer and the victim experience given such weaknesses?---WorldbuildingThe synopsis of the show alone may feel weird, cheap, typical, I dunno.

If this raises your interest then maybe this show is for you; if it sounds insufferable you should probably move on to something else. However, I don't think the show really delivers on the promise of its high-concept premise.The basic motivation behind Nana's...murders is that the shadowy world government that sent her to murder said superpowered teenagers believes them and their superpowers to be a threat to humanity (or, at least, the established power structure they represent). And so, they invented a fake alien invasion, and set up fake boarding schools where superpowered teens can be brought over to 'train' to fight the 'enemies of humanity' – while in reality they are being corralled to be murdered by the agents of said shadowy world government.Nana is an emotionless, calculating murderer who is constantly lying to everyone around her, and the first half of the season is spent watching her meticulously plan out and execute contrived murders that require her to figure out the weaknesses of her superpowered classmates, whose abilities might theoretically make them extremely hard to kill. Nana herself has no superpowers of her own, putting her at an inherent disadvantage that she has to make up for with cunning and brutality. It's a great procedural set-up that the show more or less discards a few episodes in.Nana's classmates are, with one or two exceptions, relentlessly unlikable characters who seem to exist to justify the idea that teenagers with unchecked superpowers are terribly dangerous. The children in this murder island have been allowed to basically go feral, plotting murder on each other and engaging in no-holds-barred superhero fighting with the potential for fatal collateral damage.But like other similar emotionless assassins in fiction, Nana's character arc is about developing empathy for the people she's supposed to kill and coming to question her shadowy handlers. Unfortunately the show shoves her down this arc with ruthless narrative efficiency, making it seem like her character just isn't very solid –\xa0her years of conditioning and programming by the shadowy world government don't seem to stick very much for the duration of a 12 episode season. The show similarly flips around with her; suddenly we're expected to care and empathize with the superpowered teenagers who were dying for our amusement two episodes back. This series doesn't have a very clear idea of what its tone is supposed to be or how invested we're supposed to be in its characters.A murder procedural like this, by necessity, will make its characters extremely disposable. Nana ends up having to unsuccessfully flip the emotional charge of its premise halfway through.Meanwhile, plot developments are coming off left field at a rapid pace. The back third of the season generally feels very rushed. Nana overall covers too much ground in a short season; it's almost as if the show gets bored with its own premise after a few episodes. It rapidly slides towards a much more conventional shounen story in a way that makes the show's dark and cynical themes look like shallow teenager edginess.Visually this is also not a stunning show. The look of it intentionally resembles the very simplistic, straight-laced style of a  shounen battle show, which is presumably meant to contrast with this being a darker show. In reality the look of it just never comes together, and it ends up being a show where the visuals aren't really adding to or helping build the story.This is in the 'flawed' category for me.

It‘s not a high quality show by any means but I did enjoy it, in a casual, I–wonder–what–batshit–crazy–plottwist–will–happen–next kind of way.The story starts off strong with a pretty cool premise: An isolated island contains a school full of kids with superpowers who are supposedly being trained to defeat monsters, or as they like to call them „enemies of humanity“; meanwhile one of them is actually a trained killer, tasked with killing them all off while maintaining the image of a mindreader through psychological deduction.The concept is a struggle...between brains and superpowers, which will prevail in a fight between life and death?I was seriously excited to get into this series, but after the hype from the first two episodes or so died down it became...eh.The characters are all pretty cliche and will at times act completely OUC, the animation is a bit stiff at times, the score is just standard as well and the story is at its best a little contrived and at its worst full of plotholes, but still, there were a few scenes that I really liked, especially when it came to Nana‘s manipulation and schemes.I watched the first 6 episodes, got tired and decided to do something else but ended up coming back to it out of curiosity how it would end, so take that as you will.It‘s by far not the best of the season so far, but if you enjoy series where the mc is also the villain (kinda at least) and don’t mind if it get‘s a bit nonsensical at parts, then this might be a show you enjoy.TLDR; I enjoyed it, but it’s honestly not that good of a show. If you’re looking for something to switch your brain off to and just have fun with, I say go for it. between brains and superpowers, which will prevail in a fight between life and death?I was seriously excited to get into this series, but after the hype from the first two episodes or so died down it became...eh.The characters are all pretty cliche and will at times act completely OUC, the animation is a bit stiff at times, the score is just standard as well and the story is at its best a little contrived and at its worst full of plotholes, but still, there were a few scenes that I really liked, especially when it came to Nana‘s manipulation and schemes.I watched the first 6 episodes, got tired and decided to do something else but ended up coming back to it out of curiosity how it would end, so take that as you will.It‘s by far not the best of the season so far, but if you enjoy series where the mc is also the villain (kinda at least) and don’t mind if it get‘s a bit nonsensical at parts, then this might be a show you enjoy.TLDR; I enjoyed it, but it’s honestly not that good of a show.

Btw this mc with her name is Hiiragi Nana is similiar to Billy Butcher, who equally hates the superhuman or talented people and both have past trauma and revenge.Even though they both hate superhumans, they both have different ways of killing superhumans/talented people such as Hiiragi Nana who kills secretly using different methods or Billy Butcher who kills superhumans/talented people frontally.According to my review, the anime is good, suspenseful, not too sadistic, interesting visuals, unpredictable storyline, etc.If you are a fan of the...The Boys series, i recommend to watching this anime!

However, I highly encourage that you at least watch the first episode, as it definitely gets better!Now below has some mild spoilers past the first episode:So this anime is about our main character killing everyone on an island. I think this premise is fantastic. However, in about the first half of the season, it's execution goes from great to good to moderate. Nana has insane plot armor, which makes it hard to feel any emotion if she might get caught or not.(I'm not going to talk about the art or...sound because I am no expert on that, except the op is fantastic.)|:|Story|:|The story idea is great. The execution isn't all that great. Nana follows a murder of the week pattern for most of the season. Also, almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger. The story does gets better near the end, with some development.|:|Characters|:|None of them get character development except Nana. Like, some of her victims do get depth, but she is the only one who gets the development. Most of the characters are likeable, but mainly all the side or background characters are just there.I personally think Nana is an acceptable protagonist, although some people hate her due to her plot armor and her moral issues. She's cute, and pleasant to look at. She has a facade of being all cheery, when she's really ready to kill you off. Her character development is also acceptable. To be honest, she's just there to carry out her job.Next is Kyouya. If Munou na Nana was Death Note, Kyouya would be L. But a little more stupider. He seems to know Nana is the murderer, yet he iSn'T sUrE hOw sHe dOeS iT. He's not annoying, and is an acceptable character, but can't just have him think that she's the murderer yet not know the reason. He also suspects Nana of not having mind reading powers in, like, the second episode, but that's written off pretty quickly. He's just there to add tension I feel.Finally is Michiru. She's the one who helps Nana to question why she's murdering these people. Michiru, I believe, is a great character. Not only is she not annoying, and is cute like a dog, but she actually drives the story forward!! The series gets better as she and Nana become closer as friends.All the victims are okay, they don't get much development.

And while it is still fun, by god is it stupid.It should be noted that the anime cannot be effectively reviewed without spoilers, due to the nature of the show. Apologies.[Spoilers Ahead]Talentless Nana, in essence, is about a game of Hitman in which one super-smart sociopathic moeblob has to take down a number of superpowered highschoolers with nothing but her wits, her environment, and some poison - all while self-styled detective Kyoya is hot on her tail.Issue is, everyone - except for Kyoya, Nana, and one shapeshifting Tachibana - has the intelligence of Hitman NPCs,...too, making decisions that range from ""acceptable, but kind of dumb"" to ""what on earth is wrong with you."" And in a show about stealth, deception, and wits, everybody being stupid is a massive flaw.Another issue is the fact that while Kyoya\'s smarts are actually decent, Nana\'s are actually just baffling. What makes a smart character both intriguing and believable is seeing their thought process - how they logically got from point A to B. However, often when we get a look into Nana\'s thought process, it involves herculean leaps of logic.

And in a show about stealth, deception, and wits, everybody being stupid is a massive flaw.Another issue is the fact that while Kyoya\'s smarts are actually decent, Nana\'s are actually just baffling. What makes a smart character both intriguing and believable is seeing their thought process - how they logically got from point A to B.

Think it starts off rather intriguing, kind of teeters when you think it’s not going to be much else but these elaborate killing schemes from this assassin and the one guy she can’t kill giving her the third degree, but I think by the second half properly starting it becomes a bit more...than that when Nana is able to progress more as a character and another rival is added.Setting isn’t too great and I think the character design is kind of meh but it’s by no means subpar animation.VA work is also decent but not too notable.I think the thing I will be most hung up on is that I very much do think I want to see this story play out and conclude. Just as soon as we feel like everything is changing and this story is going in another direction, it just kind of ends. Hope me and other fans can get more of this anime. If not guess I must check the manga. than that when Nana is able to progress more as a character and another rival is added.Setting isn’t too great and I think the character design is kind of meh but it’s by no means subpar animation.VA work is also decent but not too notable.I think the thing I will be most hung up on is that I very much do think I want to see this story play out and conclude.

(I think this question is even more relevant since there are a lot of people actually disliking the show? But that might just be my impression)For me the great thing about Munou no Nana is not only that it uses popular tropes to then divert...your expectations but also that it applies real life logic in the process. If something seems kinda nonesensical to you in the story it´s pretty much canon to the story that there will be some darker explanation. Why are children with superpowers kept all cooped up together on a far away island? Why has noone ever seen the so called ""Enemies of Humanity""? Why don´t these supposed future superheros receive any kind of military training? - It´s pretty much guaranteed that none of these ""plot holes"" will be glossed over.Apart from this it´s just really fun to solve the mysteries along with Nana-chan. (All the mysteries are very much solveable because all the necessary clues are given to the viewer and the world has a power system that is easy to get behind.)

You don\'t feel anything for the characters they are so stupid!You can even understand their stupidity, the worst problem is when half of the anime the character is a nerd and out of nowhere becomes the deduction king and create the stupidest possible solutions, I saw that and laughed so I thought it was fun!They push her cleverness, since she is not all that.

It’s really fun! You should go check it out!” - Literally everyone.Alright, I’ll be the first to admit that I took this recommendation and rolled with it. I mean, come on! Those are two things I genuinely enjoy!And let me say, the first episode got me hooked. The first episode starts off with a pretty typical plotline resembling My Hero Academia (as the short description suggests). We are introduced to the world assaulted by the monsters called the “Enemies of Humanity” and students from all around Japan with supernatural powers...called “The Talented” are gathered on a deserted island to train in order to fight these “Enemies of Humanity.”Here we are introduced to our protagonist, Nanao Nakajima, who seems to be a powerless misfit on the island. He has no friends and is pretty much ignored by everyone until a beautiful young pink-haired girl named Hiiragi Nana (I see, the love interest of our protagonist) uses her own power to read his mind to realize that Nanao’s really lonely, then reaches out to him and becomes his “first friend”, and maybe one day even potentially being his girlfriend!Now we gotta get into quirk, I mean, power training where everyone shows off their flashy powers to everyone until suddenly, oh no! Somebody accidentally unleashed a super duper power move and is going straight for Nana! Who can possibly save the day now?! But suddenly Deku, I mean, Nanao shows off his great quirk, I mean power, that he has the ability to cancel any power! (Wait, so we’re in the Toaru series now?!)Suddenly, Nanao is super popular with everyone because of his heroic act, and Nana blushingly asks him if she can walk with him alone! Ooooo… maybe some spicy romance will come of this?!The two of them reach the cliff. The wind picks up and scenery perfectly draws out Nana’s beauty in the sunset. Her eyes sparkle, thanking him for everything he’s done for her. The two get close together, wait, are we getting the kiss already? That’s pretty quick for a shounen series!When they get closer, suddenly, Nana grabs Nanao’s back and flips him off the cliff with the only thing that leaves him from falling off the cliff is a rope dangling from the cliff fence. And thus her final words before dropping Nanao off the cliff, “it is not me who is the enemy of humanity, it is you people who are the enemy of mankind.”The chills intensify. This is where the realization sets in that everything is flipped on its head. This is not Nanao’s story, this is the story of Hiiragi Nana on her quest to eliminate everyone off the island, the true “Enemies of Humanity.” And her power? Not a real power. She actually has no power, and all her predictions shown in the first episode were good deductive skills from small details in Nanao’s words, belongings, and expression, and therefore is called Talentless Nana.But even though this first episode was incredible by introducing its premise and its twist flawlessly, this twist is also the start of its downfall because it begs to question, “Now what?” Nana even says to herself in the next episode that she can’t hide Nanao’s disappearance for much longer.So what would any smart assassin do in this scenario? Learn everyone’s powerset before attacking anyone in particular? Wait for time to pass after everyone’s calmed down to make her next move? Maybe make a large and elaborate plan to kill everyone at the same time without anyone noticing until the final climax?No, instead, she goes on a careless killing spree. For someone as “clever” as Nana shown in the first episode, she acts VERY irrationally from here on out. Nana goes on to eliminate as many people as she can one by one by picking her targets based on the “Kill Estimate Potential Amount” on her smartphone and how deadly they are according to the numbers. She doesn’t think of the consequences of her actions, leaving large tracks behind her during these murders, and making large contradictions in her testimonies when people like Kyouya Onodera, are interrogating her. Nana doesn’t even follow up with her brilliant deductive skills to fake her mind-reading ability where she straight up asks “what are you trying to say?” and “what are you thinking?” to other people on the island. Why would someone with mind reading powers ask “what are you thinking” to someone? Shouldn’t they already know?So now that many people are gone, Nana is suspiciously away during these murders, and her alias and testimonies are contradicting each other, what do the survivors have to say? And this is where the second part of “MHA X Among Us” comes in. And just like public lobbies in Among Us, everyone is too dense and stupid to put the pieces together to realize that Nana is the real “Enemy of Humanity” and continue to remain oblivious and stick their heads in the hole. All Nana has to say is “oh the Enemy of Humanity is actually lurking this island and killing that person behind ours backs” and everyone just believes her. Even Kyouya, who’s pretty much deduced everything perfectly on his own, tosses up all his evidence and says to himself, “pft, there’s not enough evidence to accuse Nana because ‘she has no reason to murder.’”This cycle continues on and on for a couple of episodes. Nana finds someone to kill, she kills that person with an “elaborate plan” with a major hole that NANA WAS WITH THEM BEFORE THEY DIED. Why do the characters still believe that the Enemy of Humanity only appears in front of Nana and not any other students. How does this make any sense?The following few episodes continue to follow this formula and later becomes painfully obvious that this is just the new norm. This is probably the point where everyone just closes this series for good and labels it as “the worst anime this season” because of how everyone acts and that the story progression from here on out is illogical because of everyone’s stupidity.But I beg to differ.The series takes a break from its episodic target-of-the-week formula when Nana turns her attention to the cute, small girl Michiru Inukai who has the power to heal any physical wound with her tongue, followed by the introduction of Jin Tachibana, a previous island-dweller who has the ability to shapeshift into anything he wants and also copies its abilities.At this point in Nana’s killing spree, Jin already knows that she is the murderer. But instead of reporting Nana, he insteads tries to investigate Nana’s origins and motivations because as a previous island dweller, he knows something fishy is going on because something similar to this has already happened. Everyone living on the island was eliminated, and the only reason Jin got out was because he was able to shapeshift into a bird to fly back home. But when he tried going back home to his grandma, she freaked out because she didn’t remember Jin. Something was clearly not right, and he realized that reporting the murderer would do almost nothing without figuring out who was behind the murderer herself.While Jin is out figuring out more about the island situation with the help of Nana’s confiscated smartphone, Nana continues to go out and try to eliminate Michiru. But Michiru is constantly nice to Nana, healing her wounds after her multiple accidents trying to eliminate targets and also getting away from dangerous attacks even if it costs some of her life. Nana, because of her past of her dead parents and learning to trust no one, begins to question Michiru’s motivations and doubts herself on whether or not Michiru actually knows that Nana is the murderer.But even with multiple opportunities to kill Michiru, Nana refuses to kill her because “she might be a great alias.” Even with that excuse, Nana learns to care for Michiru and even stays by her bedside when she is unconscious for two straight days and wasting potentially valuable time that could have gone to eliminating more Talented.When Michiru finally wakes up, Nana reluctantly stays longer with Michiru to learn why Michiru was unconscious in the first place. And all Michiru said was that she did this to herself while saving some injured cats.”But why?”, asked Michiru, “why do you give yourself up for others?”Michiru goes into her backstory, talking about how she was constantly bullied at school for being a Talented until someone who showed up in Michiru’s life that gave her power meaning to start using it for good in the world. We later learn that the girl who “saved” Michiru and became a close friend to her was actually dying from cancer, a terminal illness that Michiru can’t heal with her ability. But the message in the back of Michiru’s mind that the girl reminds her is that “it’s like knowing that eating sweets will cut your life a little shorter. You just got to live a little and accept it!” And although the girl passed away, Michiru continues to use that as her life motto that no matter what, she would use her ability to save other people’s lives.This moment indicates the true climax of the series. Nana now knows that Michiru means no harem to Nana or anyone, matter of fact, and that her true loyalty lies with saving people around her, even at the cost of her life. As Nana begins to have an internal struggle over her ideals and mission, she begins to question the authority of the people who she is fighting for and what those kill estimate numbers really mean on the smartphone they gave her.And that, my friends, is solid storywritingAlthough most of this journey’s been a painful ride because of its base on stupid characters that leads to a relatively poor storyline, Talentless Nana manages to solidify itself with an interesting continuing premise that has potential to continue going in this direction and end up becoming a truly brilliant series. People may come and say that this series is truly garbage because of these major flaws, and I cannot overlook them. However, I will continue defending this anime for bringing up a great ending to the series and bringing up more questions about the mystery behind the government and their true agenda for the Talented.So yeah, I guess I’ll go read the manga now (or wait for the second season that will probably definitely not come.) called “The Talented” are gathered on a deserted island to train in order to fight these “Enemies of Humanity.”Here we are introduced to our protagonist, Nanao Nakajima, who seems to be a powerless misfit on the island.

She actually has no power, and all her predictions shown in the first episode were good deductive skills from small details in Nanao’s words, belongings, and expression, and therefore is called Talentless Nana.But even though this first episode was incredible by introducing its premise and its twist flawlessly, this twist is also the start of its downfall because it begs to question, “Now what?” Nana even says to herself in the next episode that she can’t hide Nanao’s disappearance for much longer.So what would any smart assassin do in this scenario? Learn everyone’s powerset before attacking anyone in particular? Wait for time to pass after everyone’s calmed down to make her next move? Maybe make a large and elaborate plan to kill everyone at the same time without anyone noticing until the final climax?No, instead, she goes on a careless killing spree. For someone as “clever” as Nana shown in the first episode, she acts VERY irrationally from here on out. Nana goes on to eliminate as many people as she can one by one by picking her targets based on the “Kill Estimate Potential Amount” on her smartphone and how deadly they are according to the numbers. She doesn’t think of the consequences of her actions, leaving large tracks behind her during these murders, and making large contradictions in her testimonies when people like Kyouya Onodera, are interrogating her. Nana doesn’t even follow up with her brilliant deductive skills to fake her mind-reading ability where she straight up asks “what are you trying to say?” and “what are you thinking?” to other people on the island. Why would someone with mind reading powers ask “what are you thinking” to someone? Shouldn’t they already know?So now that many people are gone, Nana is suspiciously away during these murders, and her alias and testimonies are contradicting each other, what do the survivors have to say? And this is where the second part of “MHA X Among Us” comes in. And just like public lobbies in Among Us, everyone is too dense and stupid to put the pieces together to realize that Nana is the real “Enemy of Humanity” and continue to remain oblivious and stick their heads in the hole. All Nana has to say is “oh the Enemy of Humanity is actually lurking this island and killing that person behind ours backs” and everyone just believes her. Even Kyouya, who’s pretty much deduced everything perfectly on his own, tosses up all his evidence and says to himself, “pft, there’s not enough evidence to accuse Nana because ‘she has no reason to murder.’”This cycle continues on and on for a couple of episodes. Nana finds someone to kill, she kills that person with an “elaborate plan” with a major hole that NANA WAS WITH THEM BEFORE THEY DIED. Why do the characters still believe that the Enemy of Humanity only appears in front of Nana and not any other students. How does this make any sense?The following few episodes continue to follow this formula and later becomes painfully obvious that this is just the new norm. This is probably the point where everyone just closes this series for good and labels it as “the worst anime this season” because of how everyone acts and that the story progression from here on out is illogical because of everyone’s stupidity.But I beg to differ.The series takes a break from its episodic target-of-the-week formula when Nana turns her attention to the cute, small girl Michiru Inukai who has the power to heal any physical wound with her tongue, followed by the introduction of Jin Tachibana, a previous island-dweller who has the ability to shapeshift into anything he wants and also copies its abilities.At this point in Nana’s killing spree, Jin already knows that she is the murderer. But instead of reporting Nana, he insteads tries to investigate Nana’s origins and motivations because as a previous island dweller, he knows something fishy is going on because something similar to this has already happened. Everyone living on the island was eliminated, and the only reason Jin got out was because he was able to shapeshift into a bird to fly back home. But when he tried going back home to his grandma, she freaked out because she didn’t remember Jin. Something was clearly not right, and he realized that reporting the murderer would do almost nothing without figuring out who was behind the murderer herself.While Jin is out figuring out more about the island situation with the help of Nana’s confiscated smartphone, Nana continues to go out and try to eliminate Michiru. But Michiru is constantly nice to Nana, healing her wounds after her multiple accidents trying to eliminate targets and also getting away from dangerous attacks even if it costs some of her life. Nana, because of her past of her dead parents and learning to trust no one, begins to question Michiru’s motivations and doubts herself on whether or not Michiru actually knows that Nana is the murderer.But even with multiple opportunities to kill Michiru, Nana refuses to kill her because “she might be a great alias.” Even with that excuse, Nana learns to care for Michiru and even stays by her bedside when she is unconscious for two straight days and wasting potentially valuable time that could have gone to eliminating more Talented.When Michiru finally wakes up, Nana reluctantly stays longer with Michiru to learn why Michiru was unconscious in the first place. And all Michiru said was that she did this to herself while saving some injured cats.”But why?”, asked Michiru, “why do you give yourself up for others?”Michiru goes into her backstory, talking about how she was constantly bullied at school for being a Talented until someone who showed up in Michiru’s life that gave her power meaning to start using it for good in the world. We later learn that the girl who “saved” Michiru and became a close friend to her was actually dying from cancer, a terminal illness that Michiru can’t heal with her ability. But the message in the back of Michiru’s mind that the girl reminds her is that “it’s like knowing that eating sweets will cut your life a little shorter. You just got to live a little and accept it!” And although the girl passed away, Michiru continues to use that as her life motto that no matter what, she would use her ability to save other people’s lives.This moment indicates the true climax of the series. Nana now knows that Michiru means no harem to Nana or anyone, matter of fact, and that her true loyalty lies with saving people around her, even at the cost of her life. As Nana begins to have an internal struggle over her ideals and mission, she begins to question the authority of the people who she is fighting for and what those kill estimate numbers really mean on the smartphone they gave her.And that, my friends, is solid storywritingAlthough most of this journey’s been a painful ride because of its base on stupid characters that leads to a relatively poor storyline, Talentless Nana manages to solidify itself with an interesting continuing premise that has potential to continue going in this direction and end up becoming a truly brilliant series. People may come and say that this series is truly garbage because of these major flaws, and I cannot overlook them. However, I will continue defending this anime for bringing up a great ending to the series and bringing up more questions about the mystery behind the government and their true agenda for the Talented.So yeah, I guess I’ll go read the manga now (or wait for the second season that will probably definitely not come.)', ""I don't know if the writer of this show is purposely trying to make me hate this anime, and if it is their goal then they're doing a pretty good job at it, or is it just me who hates this show.[WARNING: SPOILERS OF THE PLOT AHEAD]I will try to summarise the plot of this anime in a metaphor.Imagine this is an Among Us lobby, where the MC is the one and only impostor out of the group, but it is the lowest ranked elo lobby in history, where all the players are just dumb as fuck, and there's only one guy who's actually...trying to uncover who the impostor really is, by trying to get information and compose theories and arguments on how each kill happened. And throughout the anime, he tries to convince the others of why the MC is the killer, yet no one seems to believe him, because the killer always acts innocent and such. Also, every time a kill happens, somehow the MC has this OP 500 IQ reasoning or excuse, as if it was already planned ahead, yet it is always explained afterwards. There were also two times where she was actually caught red handed by other players, yet they simply let her go away and yielded to her because of shitty arguments and useless logic. It just doesn't make sense on how OP this MC is, and it makes me hate her (even tho I probably shouldn't) because she can get away with these kills so easily.I guess I'm just really triggered on how the plot of this anime is forming. I'm still on the 8th episode, so probably more twists and turns are going to come up, and it will determine my final thoughts on how I view this anime overall.

I enjoy the genre quite a bit and Munou na Nana does a lot of things differently.The world is too simple, but still interesting sometimes, the characters and the setting are too cliche honestly, but still enjoyable. The plot twists are very good though, so is character development.But it has some flaws. Character behavior is pretty flawed from time to time, with some characters having quite insane ideals they will cling to even in the face of life and death situations.One of the arcs also feels very out of place, accomplishing almost nothing in the grand scheme of things. While the...last arc destroys too much of the arc structure imo, as it is way longer and has a very different tone.So... the show is interesting and exciting. It has some good moments and also has some meh moments. Nothing is really bad though and the plot is absorbing and the characters are cool. I like it.On a second thought, I think this show might have gotten carried by its great pacing. The plot is predictable (besides the plot twists) and doesn't do much that hasn't been done already, and the show also challenges too much of the viewers' sense of disbelief with a few characters' actions and most of its worldbuilding, but the pacing is so great that all of that doesn't impose much of a problem. last arc destroys too much of the arc structure imo, as it is way longer and has a very different tone.So... the show is interesting and exciting.

It was so egregious that I started making a list of them as I watched. As such, I will be discussing spoilers for why this anime isn’t good down below.Spoilers ahead !!!!!!!!!!!!!The first pitch I heard when I found out about Talentless Nana was Among us: the anime. Essentially, the main character (nana) wants to kill other more powerful characters using only her superior wit and cunning because she like the show title suggests, she doesn’t have any powers (talentless). This appealed to me because it made the show...sound like a psychological thriller/strategy anime. Some of my favorite anime of all time (death note, code geass, one outs, etc.) all focus on a main character accomplishing their goals using their superior smarts, wit, and cunning. When this type of show is done well, it ends up being really good. When it isn’t, it falls shorter than most mediocre shows. Talentless nana falls short, and does it hard.For one, Nana isn’t that smart. She only is able to kill her targets because the other characters are stupid, with the main exception being kyoya. Nana doesn’t have any real skill except for manipulating the other idiot characters through decent guesses and carefully crafted lies. The characters are so dumb that nana is able to make them believe she can read minds just because she made a few decent guesses. Even when characters like Kyoya suspect her and try to test her abilities, she gets out of any real criticism by saying her powers work/don’t work randomly. She also gets the other characters to buy that she can hear the inner thoughts of the dead, which she didn’t say was her power initially. They also buy that claim wholesale while most of their classmates die shortly after interacting with her.The show does no work to make nana seem particularly clever or crafty. Instead, events just seem to happen in the show to move the plot forward. During the second episode,  a character is killed in such a half-baked and poorly thought out manner that I had to look at online discussions to see if I what I wasn’t getting. Truth was that it didn’t need to make sense. The show just needed a character to die so they crafted a scenario for them to die. After episode 3, the show doesn’t even try to make characters die in any unique ways. After nana uses one method to kill someone, she is just able to kill them the same way time after time. The show makes no extra effort to make its premise work in any fashion. There are also several moments where Nana gets easily found out by other characters, but she gets out of it because those characters drag out trying to kill her like movie villains who have to reveal their whole plan before the hero escapes and defeats them.Unlike far better psychological shows like death note or code geass, the show doesn’t do anything to make you like or admire Nana. As I mentioned earlier, Nana isn’t that smart, she is just a decent liar and manipulator. She also doesn’t have a decent overarching goal like a light yagami or lelouch. A few episodes into the show, it becomes clear that Nana is just a government lapdog. She has some past trauma regarding the supposed “enemies of humanity”, but you can’t really relate to her because the details about it are kept quite vague. Even if you could relate to her, that would get undercut by the fact that Nana is a unrepentant, psychopathic serial killer who kills innocent people just because Nana thinks all characters with powers are bad. The show seems to sense that people can’t fully get on Nana’s side with her killing innocents and all so they throw in a few cliché villain characters to make it seem like some of the killings are justified.One character that the show tries and fails to make you care about is Michiru. However, she is just so stupid that it offends me on a deep personal level. She literally sees a picture of nana killing one of her classmates and just gets gaslit into accepting that the picture is false and nana didn’t do anything. Also, she gets this annoying attachment to nana and covers for her whenever possible, despite considerable evidence brought against her by kyoya, just because Nana pretends to care about her.Michiru only exists as a plot device. They make her unnaturally good and give her a poorly thrown together sad backstory to get nana to consider not killing her. The show then shoehorns michiru in some more to make it seem like nana is changing her mind on killing people and forces them into becoming friends. Nana already killed innocent people who weren’t bad in any respect, so there is no reason for the viewer to care about her deciding not to kill someone because they are unnaturally good.Kyoya is the only saving grace in this anime. He is nana’s adversary in the show because he isn’t a complete moron, asks decent questions, his logically consistent, has great powers, and has interesting ticks and mannerisms. However, the obstacles against him are less nana’s actions and more the idiotic side characters that side with nana whenever possible and never questions anything. The one good episode was episode 9 when Kyoya comes super close to revealing nana as a serial killer. However, the show gets out of having to do decent writing by crafting a half-baked escape scenario for nana to get out of it. To add fuel to the fire, the show even shames kyoya for not being a complete idiot. As a side note, none of the character powers are interesting. Most of them seem to be ripped straight from my hero academia.The art style makes this anime look like it was made more than a decade ago. If you can’t give me a decent story or characters, a new anime should at least look modern. This show even fails on that. The only credit I can give this show is that I watched it all the way through. One of the most disappointing shows I have seen in a while. sound like a psychological thriller/strategy anime.

My advice, read some of the low-star reviews and that\'ll give you the idea of this anime. I have no idea what the people rating this anime highly are smoking, because this is not it. It\'s close to being decent and there are ways to make this anime work. Instead of an anime that is very deep or an effective commentary, the viewer is left watching something that does not earn what it is trying to do, nor does it do anything effectively. This anime seems to exist to insult everyone\'s intelligence and fry brain cells. You\'ve been...warned.The first episode starts from the viewpoint of someone who is not the main character and proceeds to give a pretty deep dive into this character\'s psyche. He\'s a talentless person at a school for gifted teenagers on a secluded island somewhere in the ocean. They\'re at this school because there are these supposed ""enemies of humanity"" and these teenagers are being trained to fight them. Except, nobody in the class knows anything about these enemies of humanity, nor have they ever seen any--including the teacher. Yet, some have supposedly infiltrated this training school. How very convenient.The children seem to be average high school students--albeit with a special superpower (talent). They seem to be pretty decent people, but it\'s clear that the teacher (who doesn\'t seem to be talented) is pretty inept and a terrible leader. Why there\'d be such an inept teacher at a school that\'s supposed to be training heroes to save humanity is beyond me. There\'s never a sufficient explanation, but there are moments where even the characters point out this is weird. How is anybody supposed to learn to fight something when nobody knows what they\'re supposed to be fighting?The actual main character of the show is introduced as a transfer student who can read minds but is socially awkward. This seems to be a fairly standard trope among mind-reading characters. She\'s assigned a seat next to the seemingly talentless boy who has been positioned as the opening episode\'s protagonist. She quickly strikes up a conversation and she\'s positioned as this likeable, if not a bit quirky, character. She asks to get taken on a tour of the island and the two of them eventually make their way to a cliff overlooking the ocean. They\'re protected by a rope fence that is apparently pretty old. Somewhere along the line, Nana stumbles and falls against the rope fence. Luckily, the talentless boy is able to save her, despite the rope breaking.They head back to class, where a duel is underway to determine the class president. It ends with the obnoxious pyromancer character being defeated by an ice mage-type character. However, the pyromancer gets mad and unleashes a really big fireball that Nana is unable to escape from. In the nick of time, the talentless boy intervenes and it\'s revealed that he has the power to nullify the talents of others. This action results in the seemingly talentless boy becoming the class president. He\'s no longer bullied and he may be starting to live up to the expectations of his father.Nana and the boy then go (stupidly) back to the cliff where the rope fence is still damaged. They have a cute moment and then Nana pushes the boy off the cliff. The boy is hanging by the broken rope and Nana reveals that she is there to kill these high school children. Yes, it turns out Nana has been sent by this shadow government who says the talented people are the real enemies of humanity, that teenagers can\'t be trusted with superpowers, and blah blah blah. Basically, a bunch of evil, prejudiced, and just plain dumb stuff by clearly evil people who are only seen in shadow. The boy falls into the sea (again, still pretty close to shore), and the episode ends. Maybe he\'s still alive? It didn\'t look like he fell that far and he didn\'t crash onto the rocks first. It was never established that he couldn\'t swim. But apparently, he\'s dead. And it just gets worse from here.The second episode opens with the boy, who was just elected class president and who just saved Nana\'s life, missing. And Nana doesn\'t seem very concerned. She doesn\'t recommend the class goes looking for him or anything. Yet, nobody is too concerned he\'s missing. And this is where I\'m going to stop my synopsis.I stopped watching this show after 3 episodes because it just keeps getting dumber and dumber. It would be so easy to disprove mind reading, yet nobody ever really makes an attempt. Nana looks guilty as fuck yet she isn\'t suspected. Her powers of perception aren\'t really all that astute.She\'s a horribly unlikeable character. She shows no remorse for killing any of these teenagers, especially one that had saved her life. TWICE. The show goes through no effort to make it seems like Nana\'s been brainwashed or has any doubts about what she\'s doing. She\'s also basically some incredibly skilled assassin, despite never showing any training. Everything about this show is dumb. 0/10. Do not recommend. Unless you\'re yeeting it into a trash heap.There are ways to make this good. Maybe show the talented teenagers as being even a little bit actually evil? Maybe give Nana ANY redeemable qualities whatsoever, instead of making her into a sociopath and master manipulator with no training. Maybe don\'t make everyone on the island utterly braindead. It\'s a decent premise and the ideas can definitely work. If the people who made this didn\'t seem to be more focused on putting something out than actually making it into a believable story. The changes are minor and wouldn\'t take very long to do.Instead, it\'s a fucking mess. It\'s awful. By the time the show bothers to give Nana any kind of humanity, she\'s already murdered like 5 innocent teenagers in pretty brutal ways. It\'s way too late to try to redeem her. I\'ve never hated a main character more than this one. I don\'t think I\'ve even hated an anime more than this one. warned.The first episode starts from the viewpoint of someone who is not the main character and proceeds to give a pretty deep dive into this character\'s psyche.

On the mobile phone, she has a note with children\'s names and potential murder counts.Not only that the plot is disgusting, but the execution was also terrible. Every segment follows the same path. Nana will befriend or interact in some way with the target, and after a while, the target will disappear.  For some of the killings, she will even be caught at the scene of the murder, but somehow she will manage to blame it on some invisible enemy....The next parts will contain spoilers.There was a guy who had pictures of her in the act of the killing, and who also had information that in the future she will kill him too. Why didn\'t he report that? He wanted to blackmail her to get her to act as his girlfriend, at least until she kills him. She then proceeds to kill him and is caught standing over his dead body. This being 3rd time that the person that spent time with her dies, you\'d expect that everyone would at least be a bit suspicious, even more so because she is caught just a few seconds after she killed him. This does not happen, and to make matters worse we are forced to watch other students consoling her. Then the time for autopsy comes, which would reveal the killing sting, and her story would fall apart. How will she get out of this? She starts screaming how they shouldn\'t disturb the dead because autopsy is such a terrible thing. Then the necromancer comes into play. He revives the dead and proclaims that it would be easier to ask him directly. How does she get out of this? More screaming. The whole thing is afterward dropped.To make matters worse, when she is introduced, she leads everyone to believe that she has the power to read minds. With her observation skills, she manages to convince everyone. Why is it a problem? On several occasions, she acts in a way that someone with that ability simply wouldn\'t, and this was also pointed out in the show. The problem here is that the ability to read minds is a skill that is super easy to check. Only once is she confronted about it, and she, in a similar insulting way as her explanation for the killings, makes her escape.The worst part of the show is that it tries to make us sympathize with Nana. How is it possible to sympathize with the ruthless killer is beyond me? At some point, she makes a ""friend"", an annoying but decent girl with the power of healing others at the cost of shortening her life. Nana is here thrown into a moral dilemma. Should she kill her? Her note on the phone shows that she\'ll kill a lot of people. Of course, she should, the girl sacrificing her life to heal others deserves to be murdered in the most gruesome way. Of course not. There is no dilemma here, and watching Nana\'s inner monologue is pure torture.The only reason for watching is the hope that at some point in the anime, Nana will get what she deserves. This does not happen. Not even in the manga.Rarely there is an anime where nothing positive can be said about it. Munou na Nana is one of those. If the main protagonist was focused on killing just evil children, then the anime might not be so appalling.If you want to watch a protagonist who plans the murder of other people and where killings and everything else makes sense, Yuukoku no Moriarty is the way to go.For an anime with a darker tone where children are the main protagonists, watch Yakusoku no Neverland.This anime is an abomination. The next parts will contain spoilers.There was a guy who had pictures of her in the act of the killing, and who also had information that in the future she will kill him too. Why didn\'t he report that? He wanted to blackmail her to get her to act as his girlfriend, at least until she kills him. She then proceeds to kill him and is caught standing over his dead body.

After finishing the series however, I take back what I initially believed.Talentless Nana is a complete waste of time.If the show was a satire or a parody of the tropes it used, then maybe it would've been at least funny or insane. However, Talentless Nana seems to take itself seriously only for its poor writing and directing to unintentionally dumb down the elements of what makes the certain tropes great. The story's...tone tends to be all over the place and it fails to convey the dramatic stakes a story like this should have. Furthermore, the show seems to believe that it's doing something unconventional from how they framed the first episode to the way the cast was portrayed. Unfortunately, not only was the anime poorly executed but they actually ended up becoming more cliché after episode 1. In fact, I rather have the plot of episode 1 as the main story instead of what it became after.The cast wasn't enough to save this show. Nana lacked charisma as the main lead, so I could care less about her endeavors. She was portrayed as intelligent, but since episode 1 all her plans succeeded not because she's intelligent but because she's lucky that everyone else can be described as both underdeveloped and idiotic. I won't spoil but I can't help but wonder why no one figured it out. The only character who I thought had some charm was Nanao because compared to everyone else he seemed to have some level of depth.Production-wise, it's not bad or great. The animation can be stiff at times and it's not the best directed. The artwork is pretty cute, but they fail to match the show's themes and like I said earlier if the show were a parody then maybe it would've worked. The OST was forgettable, but the OP is nice.I wouldn't recommend Talentless Nana. It's a waste a time that thinks its being thought provoking, only to be a dumbed down version of the type of story it wants to be. tone tends to be all over the place and it fails to convey the dramatic stakes a story like this should have.

Basically all the characters except her and that one dude are like Gonta from Danganronpa V3, aka Stupid Characters, and that one dude in the anime is like Shuichi. Even tho it's obvious that it's her, the characters have 0 suspicion in her besides one. It's like Danganronpa with only 1 murderer each time, and they brought the Ultimate Detective back, but they made everybody else Gonta and the killer Dumb, but the Dumb Killer is still smarter than the Dumb People. Can't be compared to Death Note. Sound, nothing catchy. And the story is pretty decent,...but the characters are dumb and terrible, didn't enjoy the show because of the characters. but the characters are dumb and terrible, didn't enjoy the show because of the characters."", 'Talentless Nana is kind of like Light Yagami from Death Note getting put into a Danganronpa and My Hero Academia world. But it’s just not nearly as strong as Death Note.Story - 7The story is unique, and the episodes are very exciting. There are lots of cliff hangers done well. There were tons of times were I genuinely didn’t know how Nana was going to accomplish her next task (being a little vague as to not spoil anything). However, the story slows down and looses suspense in the second half. There is more focus on the backstories of characters which frankly, I didn’t care...about and weren’t interesting. I wasn’t finding myself needing to watch the next episode like I was with the rest of the anime. Also, I hate watching any anime that I can’t fully complete - be warned that this anime does NOT have a satisfying ending. I believe the manga must have gone further and the rest was never made into an anime. But yeah, definitely not a ending to the story so steer clear of this if you want a complete story.Characters - 4The characters were so bleh. Nana and the main guy from the first episode were the only characters I actually liked, so when the anime took for a turn and started focusing on the backstories of the most annoying characters, the anime went downhill. I have no idea why they would choose to give snore screen time to the characters that seem to be there for the purpose of being slightly annoying. Also, Talentless Nana doesn’t succeed at the Death Note kinda battle between Light and L. The whole time I was just on Nana’s side, because I didn’t really care about any of the other characters.Sound - 5Nothing special, but not terrible. Not really noticeable at all.Art - 4The art style is kind of clunky and makes you take it less seriously. It’s nice because it gives a cutesy vibe to a psychological, dark anime, but sometimes it’s just very unfitting in a bad way.Overall - 5The concept is very good, I’ll give it that. The first episode is also a great first episode, kind of like The Promised Neverland first episode. However, the execution was poor and it wasn’t very satisfying.

However it is full of inconsistencies and i find myself saying ""These characters are so dumb!"" a lot more than ""The MC is so smart."". Every episode leaves me raging but i can\'t stop because i want to see if this girl has the most excruciable death in the series.I\'ll give this a 10 if the last episode is just everyone torturing the MC for the whole episode and kill her right at the end. ', 'It’s crazy to think that two shows that reminded me of Danganronpa came out in the same season, one was Akudama Drive, which was brainded but kinda fun, and the other was Munou na Nana, which was braindead and not really fun.To its credit, it’s a really easy watch and there are enough things happening in each episode to maintain the average viewer hooked if they don’t think much about what is happening and honestly, if more comes out, I’ll definitely watch it because I want to see what happens next.Visually is serviceable, the artwork is ok, the character designs are akin to those in...My Hero Academia although not as creative or unique, the backgrounds are simple but well made. The effects aren’t bad at all but the show abuses a lot of using a certain filter with a certain color for when a character is having internal thoughts, depending on the person, pink for the protagonist, blue for Kyoya and such, and gets tiresome rather quickly. It also does the same as Moriarty the Patriot and about every anime with dark overtones that comes out today, it splashes red all over the screen for when a murder happen or it’s about to happen and it also gets tiresome because it looses impact the more it’s used, overuse work against intention.As always, I have nothing to say about the sound, both music and effects are serviceable and have enough impact but are not exactly memorable, both the opening and ending are fine, voice acting is also serviceable but nothing special.Now that all that filler is over, we can talk about what really matters here and say that Munou no Nana relies heavily on having similarities with other works and subverting expectations, to the point of being able to fool unexperienced viewers into thinking it’s original, without adding much (or nothing) on its own.The premise, the first episode and the first promotional material (both videos and first poster) makes you think that it will be a literal clone of My Hero Academia, with his own version of Deku, that has a very similar design, the same personality, and is equally bullied. He is also presented as someone with seemingly no powers and has a very similar name to the actual protagonist of the show, further making you think that it will be about him. And then the episode is about to finish and the series changes completely.Basically, all of the above was brilliant marketing, making you expect something derivative that cashes in on a popular series, and then proceeding to give you something completely different, which is basically like Danganronpa by having a school student trying to kill all of their classmates. It was also lucky to come out close to the very similar flavor of the month (despite being two years old) videogame Among Us, thus being seen as the anime version of it.Anyways, so we have this girl going around, gathering information about the powers each student has and then killing them off. The good thing is how each ability has actual weaknesses that the protagonist can, and does reasonably take advantage of, making her seem smart, the bad part is that every other character is so dumb and fall on her traps and schemes so easily that it kills the illusion that you are watching a well thought out series about murders and how the culprit is gonna do it and how is she going to get away with it.My first real issue with the show, aside from the dumb characters, is how lucky the protagonist is that no student here is strong, I mean seriously they all have very specific powers that makes her act in a certain way in each episode, and lets her plan something specific in each episode (something pretty convenient) but they are otherwise very weak and are taken off easily. They are supposed to be the saviours of humanity that fight against dangerous enemies but they otherwise die the same way every normal person would do, and don’t receive any training in the school that is supposed to prepare them for doing that in the future.And I just have to point out how convenient it is that everyone buys her lies about her fake talent, it has an in story excuse, since every power has its strenghts and weaknesses, but when the protagonist comes with a different excuse of how it worked or didn’t just when it was needed, and everyone eats that crap everytime, it becomes unexcusable and a clear sign of bad writing. It also abuses it a lot, doing it once or twice would be convenient but acceptable, but when is overused like this, it becomes unacceptable. In JoJo, Joseph can guess what his enemies think and that conveniently throws his opponent off a little, enough to give him time to come out with another plan, but it’s not abused as much and is presented as dumb in a series with an over the top tone, here it’s presented in a serious manner and that only makes it lame.Anyways, having a character going around killing other characters in each episode in somewhat convenient ways with very convenient outcomes would get formulaic and boring very fast, which it does, and thus the series introduces a main antagonist who looks like a combination of Bakugo and Todoroki and sounds just like Gray Fullbuster from Fairy Tail. What I’m trying to say is, this character was planned to be the one to confront the protagonist from the get go.From there, they play a Kira and L cat and mouse game where they know exactly what the other does and are constantly trying to make the other look like the culprit (in case of Kyoya) or themselves innocent (in case of Nana). But just like with everything thus far, everyone around them is so dumb they don’t believe what Kyoya says, even if it makes sense to the most part and is often supported with actual evidence.On top of that, these people are acting all friendly when they live in a world where something is supposed to be out there ready to kill them on the spot. Heck, even when they are getting killed off each day, they still don’t suspect their classmates (especially the students who just transfered) and still act all friendly, just like in Danganronpa. Bad shows copy even the worst aspects of other bad shows it seems.I’ve seen people defending the show saying that is understandable for the characters to be this stupid because they lack the information the viewer has, which is true. I’ll expand on that later but now I’m gonna say that, just like it happens with Moriarty, having a Mary Sue protagonist in a series about murders and cat and mouse game kills all the tension and makes the show very dull to watch.And Nana is not even consistent in that regard, for example, Moriarty is a Gary Stu but at least is presented as such in his own series, he is more consistent than Nana, who constantly messes up yet still gets away with it simply because the script says so and everyone else is seriously dumb, instead of doing that with actual wit.Even if someone still manages to defend the show in this regard, there are instances where someone else than Kyoya finds out about Nana but doesn’t expose her for stupid reasons. It makes sense for the necrophile girl to remain silent but what valid excuse does the guy able to seen the future has for not doing so? Why he wanted to fuck Nana, that’s why, Such stupid reasoning and it made him look like a one dimensional ugly bastard rapist you would find in a doujinshi instead of a shounen series. No, there are no valid excuses for this episodes, the show is just lazily and badly written.And I also have to point out how having an inmortal antagonist who is also mentally unbreakable ruins all the tension and fun even further.A common criticism about the series, which I agree with, is how Nana kills the only guy with the capability of nullifying others’ powers, who would be helpful later on, and constantly keeps doing something similar, killing off characters that could be helpful if used against others. I mean, the first guy was already kinda exploitable if you think about it, try to put him against his bullies and convince him that those fuckers are the enemies and done. But oh well, if he’s exactly like Deku then he would consider his bullies as his potential boyfriends, I mean best Friends, so it would be pointless.Still, for an agent that is supposed to have been trained her whole life in stealth and assassination, as well as someone that is constantly acting like someone she’s not, Nana sure rushes to kill off everyone instead of trying to manipulate them against the others, which would make the series less formulaic and tiresome and actually somewhat smart, and not leave her exposed every single time.Another issue with the show is the mood whiplash, as it’s constantly throwing random silly comedy in the middle of serious moments that are supposed to be suspenful and intense, doing it once or twice would be forgiveable but when it happens all the time it becomes a serious problem. And it’s not because the series is a shounen, Moriarty is a shounen series as well and it never trashes its tone like that by throwing stupid comedy just because.Even Kyoya, who’s supposed to be the serious and smart character and counterforce of the protagonist, has silly quirks such as wanting friends, crack jokes in inappropriate moments and even wanting to play with Nana’s hair, what a way to kill the characterization of even the only actually interesting character of the show.The theme present in the show basically comes to down to discrimination based on previous events, just like in Moriarty, the other muder mystery show of the season, and just like that series, it fucks it up in its presentation for the same reason, it presents the conflict in a simplified good vs. bad way. Only one side of the conflict is explained and it gets really hard to accept their ways of reasoning and acting when they have innocent high schoolers being killed off for doing absoultely nothing, it’s completely one sided, victimizing and unjustified that it ruins the whole theme exploration.And finally there is the issue of the nonsensical setting, it’s almost impossible to accept that no one finds it strange that there’s only one school to train the future protectors of mankind, and it’s located on an isolated island in the middle of nowhere, even My Hero Academia is better in that regard. The show tries to excuse that by basically turning the setting into a Battle Royale clone midway, but that only makes things worse. Are you telling me that all of humanity agreed to send kids on an isolated island in hope of everyone killing each other? Talk about a one sided conflict. And you are also telling me that this has already happened before? And no one found it strange how all the future saviours of humanity died together on the same island? Many times? Hello? And it also turned the show from something with pretences of intelligence to a generic death game you can find everywhere these days in both anime and western entertainment since the success of Fate/Zero in 2011 and The Hunger Games in 2012.Heck, now that I think about it, another strange thing is how no one finds it weird that the stories about the enemies of mankind are basically legends for there has not been a case since forever and are you telling me that only the talentless people know about the incident in the past? How is that possible? Are these kids taught different history depending if they have abilities or not or what? Even when they go to the same school before the latter are sent to an isolated island?I don’t even understand how do these kids even have families back in their home, if this school has been doing that since who knows when, their parents should all be dead as well…or that would be the case if it was genetic as in My Hero Academia, but it’s not. And that only raises the question on how do these people even get their powers from, it also makes me think that perhaps their parents themselves sent their kids in order to get killed on that island and that only makes it worse.Finally, aside from the characters being dumb, only two of them have background stories, one is Nana herself and is just a generic revenge plot past, and the other is Michiru or whatever that dog girl is called, and is a generic I helped someone once and began doing it ever since type of past, boring. I can give the show credit for developing Nana a little by becoming genuinely attached to her, and not only because of her healing powers, but it comes to down to being reluctant at first and then attached to someone just because they are kind, with yuri overtones included.No, her actual development is slowly wanting to know the truth behind all things and even that is nothing much.In conclusion, Munou na Nana is a show that you can easily watch if you just accept everything it throws at you at face value but the moment you start thinking about it, it falls apart completely, the setting makes absolutely no sense, the themes are rarely explored and when they are, the presentation of them is pathetic, the plot is full of conveniences to the point it becomes unacceptable, the tone is a mess and the characters are absolute garbage. And I will still torture myself to watch more of it if it gets more seasons because I want to see how the plot unfolds, even when it takes all of my stamina to not fall asleep while doing so. My Hero Academia although not as creative or unique, the backgrounds are simple but well made. The effects aren’t bad at all but the show abuses a lot of using a certain filter with a certain color for when a character is having internal thoughts, depending on the person, pink for the protagonist, blue for Kyoya and such, and gets tiresome rather quickly.

Are you telling me that all of humanity agreed to send kids on an isolated island in hope of everyone killing each other? Talk about a one sided conflict. And you are also telling me that this has already happened before? And no one found it strange how all the future saviours of humanity died together on the same island? Many times? Hello? And it also turned the show from something with pretences of intelligence to a generic death game you can find everywhere these days in both anime and western entertainment since the success of Fate/Zero in 2011 and The Hunger Games in 2012.Heck, now that I think about it, another strange thing is how no one finds it weird that the stories about the enemies of mankind are basically legends for there has not been a case since forever and are you telling me that only the talentless people know about the incident in the past? How is that possible? Are these kids taught different history depending if they have abilities or not or what? Even when they go to the same school before the latter are sent to an isolated island?I don’t even understand how do these kids even have families back in their home, if this school has been doing that since who knows when, their parents should all be dead as well…or that would be the case if it was genetic as in My Hero Academia, but it’s not. And that only raises the question on how do these people even get their powers from, it also makes me think that perhaps their parents themselves sent their kids in order to get killed on that island and that only makes it worse.Finally, aside from the characters being dumb, only two of them have background stories, one is Nana herself and is just a generic revenge plot past, and the other is Michiru or whatever that dog girl is called, and is a generic I helped someone once and began doing it ever since type of past, boring. I can give the show credit for developing Nana a little by becoming genuinely attached to her, and not only because of her healing powers, but it comes to down to being reluctant at first and then attached to someone just because they are kind, with yuri overtones included.No, her actual development is slowly wanting to know the truth behind all things and even that is nothing much.In conclusion, Munou na Nana is a show that you can easily watch if you just accept everything it throws at you at face value but the moment you start thinking about it, it falls apart completely, the setting makes absolutely no sense, the themes are rarely explored and when they are, the presentation of them is pathetic, the plot is full of conveniences to the point it becomes unacceptable, the tone is a mess and the characters are absolute garbage. And I will still torture myself to watch more of it if it gets more seasons because I want to see how the plot unfolds, even when it takes all of my stamina to not fall asleep while doing so.', ""I have years of anime and hundreds of series under my belt.

Outbreak Company,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company,"['This whole anime can be summed up by the lyrics of one of the songs that comes from Outbreak Company.  ""DA. DA DA DA DIN DIN DA DA DA""Story: 7This anime is a clash of modern day Japan with a fantasy land that has knights, dragons, a loli ruler, elves, dwarfs and dragons.  Just imagine a brighter version of LOTR.  We follow Shinchi as he has to spread otaku culture (Anime and Manga) throughout the lands of Eldant.  That is pretty much the show....The pacing of Outbreak Company was fine up until the final two episodes, which the pacing felt too...fast as they tried cramming in a lot of seriousness that the other ten episodes lacked.  The ten episodes lacking seriousness wasn\'t a bad thing, the show was doing a great job with those episodes, but the last two rushed into drama and seriousness.Art: 9Art was great! Something I found enjoyable were all the references to other shows through background art such as a parody poster of Hataraku Maou-sama.Scenery was amazing as well they made medieval times look happy and splendid.  Castle, fields, mountains, the whole thing was pretty to look at.Character designs weren\'t outstanding, but unique enough to separate characters and make them memorable.Sound: 10In my opinion, Univer Page, the OP of Outbreak Company is my favorite song to come out of this fall season of anime.  It is so cheery and the way the song starts, eargasm.  Watashi no Houseibako, the ED of Outbreak Company is a very soothing song and very good to listen to while running.  Both songs give off the vibe that the whole anime is trying to do, make the person watching this very happy.The background music does a great job at carrying the mood, with a very unique song that is used during comical parts, I already quoted the lyrics of it in the beginning of this review.Character: 8Characters are given enough depth to make the memorable, and distinguishable.  This is good since my first impression after looking at the OP was that characters would be easy to mix up.  Character development was great, everyone had development outside of being interested in manga or anime.The only problem I had was the random characters added halfway through, the dwarf and the elf.  These two were added to the story and I was assuming for them to have a pretty big role for upcoming events, but nothing really happened involving them.Enjoyment: 8This anime was enjoyable because of the otaku humor.  I found humor based around references and other things anime and manga hilarious.  Multiple scenes I have laughed, and the soundtrack makes it even funnier.  I also really enjoyed the one part of seriousness they did in the last episode, the only time this series did the serious business right, which makes the last two episodes worth it.Overall: 8Great anime for the fall season with an amazing soundtrack.  I will be listening to Univer Page for a long time to come, especially when I need a pick me up. fast as they tried cramming in a lot of seriousness that the other ten episodes lacked.

For Shinchi Kano, his responsibilities just skyrocketed after being set up and sent to a fantasy world. Sounds fun right? Wrong. It seems that some higher powers wants this young boy to spread the otaku culture and expands the Japanese culture in their world like never ever before. Being otaku is often considered a negative influence due to its pure nature. But in Outbreak Company, it plays on different trope. In fact, it’s being an otaku that allowed Shinichi to gain stardom in this new world where his life changes forever.Outbreak Company is...an animated series based off the light novel of the same name written by Ichiro Sakaki. The full title of the series is actually Outbreak Company: The Moe Invader that emphasizes the spread of Japanese culture as an allusion to “invasion”. Shinichi plays the role of the main character and otaku life becomes a pivotal role in shaping such a fantasy world. It almost feels like a dream for Shinichi but that might not seem to be as easy as he thinks. Shinchi quickly realizes that he gets more than what he bargained. It’s an otaku’s wet dream coming true.The story of Outbreak Company is quite simple. Shinichi is your average high school boy whom has a crush on a girl. After rejection, he tries to find a way to replace that deep hole in his life. Becoming an otaku isn’t exactly the best way to get over a rejection but he chooses anyways. After he does manage to get a job, it’s here where we find out his in-depth knowledge about various anime, manga, and Japanese culture. In many ways, the show takes this idea and twists it around in a way that is fun and entertaining. The fact that Shinichi plays the role of an otaku can be stereotyped as a boy who spent a lot of time in front of the TV. And in fact, he does but not only in front of a television but also on the web with his knowledge of various anime/manga and even eroge.As this series plays fun with the otaku culture, there should be unsuspectingly a lot of references to various anime and manga. Almost every episode has posters or merchandise from other popular animated series with modified artwork. It also makes fun of the otaku culture by having the main male protagonist become a type of instructor to his students. His way of teaching can seem absurd but he has fun with it. His students also seems to enjoy his teaching methods despite its obscenity on several occasions as the product he tries to present tends to be any otaku’s wet dream.Part of that dreams comes with a package including an adorable maid named Myucel Foaran. She plays the role of a typical maid with an addition of elf ears and overly politeness. As one of the most innocent characters in the series, she always puts others above herself. This is proven later on when her friends’ lives are in danger. Her action speaks louder than words as she faces on danger straight ahead rather than looking back. But besides her gentleness, Myucel is able to make friends and her relationship with Shinichi is one of the more dynamic pairs of this show. For starters, Shinichi originally sees her as a fantasy fulfillment come true. After all, Myucel refers Shinichi as her master. Surprisingly enough, Shinichi doesn’t abuse or treat her indiscriminately but instead befriends her as if she is a human being. He even goes as far as to teach her about the otaku culture as well as Japanese language. It’s an odd relationship as Myucel is constantly trying to please him and apologizes for any behavior she interprets as misdeed. Surprisingly she is a girl not to be underestimated. Mycuel has astonishing skills in magic and fighting capabilities that can accomplish superhuman feats. Like an old saying goes, “dynamites comes in little packages”.Throughout his time there, Shinichi also gets involved with other affairs. This includes his encounter with the monarch of the Eldant Empire, Petralka Anne Eldant III. Unlike Mycuel, she represents more of a brat that is initially seen as selfish, stubborn, and only wants things to go her way. She is the perfect example of how an immature child would behave like despite her similar age to Shinichi. But because Shinichi seems to the first person to stand up against her status, she takes an interest him. This lands a “rivalry” with Mycuel as she sees her as competition. This competition often comes as a backlash and jealousy against Mycuel because Petralka sees her getting in the way. At first, it might seems harmless but there are various times when the tension gets heated and Shinichi has to step in to settle the bounds. Later on though, she learns a bit more from her mistakes and starts treating Mycuel with more respect due to certain reasons.The trio of these characters makes up the main course of the series but to other characters do come into play with their parts. Most of these characters are direct parodies to the culture of anime such as Minori, a woman with a fujoshi fetish. She is also an otaku and often formulates absurd fantasies in her head with BL tones. Bulk, a lizard man, is designed to fit the role of a fantasy beast but with surprisingly gentle nature. Then, there are also the half-elves, wolf girl species, and even dwarves who doesn't match their age.I wouldn’t say this series fits within the drama category but there is certainly a lot of tension going on throughout various parts of the show. Among some of the tensions includes a rivalry between the races of elves and dwarves. They have contrasting views on Japanese culture that often results in insults thrown back and forth with nitpickery debates, This is even presented in a more extreme case when both sides decides to settle it in a sports competition to see which side is more dominate. More importantly is the fact that humans are treated as seemingly superior beings. Fortunately, Shinichi often plays the role of a normal human boy and doesn’t take advantage of certain situations.Despite the fun that Outbreak Company throughout each episode, there are various problems with the show that can turn viewers away. The initial premise itself might cause some heads to turn. After all, the theme of a human being sent to another fantasy world to help others isn’t exactly a new idea. Series such as Dog Days, Problem Children, Familiar of Zero, and Ixion DT also plays on these tropes. Shinichi’s initial introduction can be viewed as a clichéd and stereotypical character as comparable to harem leads. Although he doesn’t technically have a harem, Shinichi is oblivious to the female characters around him. Shinichi does have the behavior of a typical harem lead though with the typical nosebleed upon witnessing any beautiful character of the opposite sex and getting excited about a loli (Petralka) during their first initial meeting. Speaking of Petralka, her tsundere personality can also be hard to endure on various occasions with her constant bickering. The way she treats others (especially Mycuel) is based on greed and jealousy like a spoiled child that can be frustrating to watch. Some of the other characters’ races also makes little sense with dwarves’ ages, the werewolf girl that hardly resembles what she looks like, or the repetitive BL gags. Unlike Genshiken, there’s hardly any realism to it but rather just played out as a ridiculous and senseless fantasy. Finally, the story itself jumps around a bit. Shinichi might be the main focus of the show but some episodes’ ideas becomes larger than himself. There’s no any ongoing plot or arcs but mainly focuses on its main theme of otaku culture spreading. If you get bored of this type of theme then this show will likely not be for you.Artistic wise, Outbreak Company brings out the fantasy to its greatness with its character designs. Shinichi is probably the only main character designed with human characteristics. Almost every other recurring character has bits of a fantasy touch added to them like Myucel’s elf years, Petralka’s overly made dress, Galious’ knight armor, or Elvia’s wolf-like ears/tail. The castle that Shinichi is bought upon also gives a feeling of fantasy with its internal design. The landscape outside is absent of technology but instead is replaced with fantastical architecture and nature. Feel (Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, Nagasarete Airantou) are known for their production in series involving fantasy/supernatural elements. For Outbreak Company, they definitely delivered a handy dandy job.Sound production might seem off balance a bit. The comedic scenes has an odd theme played most times when there are awkward moments. Because this show isn’t about magical sword fighting, there’s a minimal amount of intense OST. Instead, they are replace with lighthearted soundtrack that tends to bring out a more fun side of Outbreak Company; namely the tone of the ‘Da, da, da’. The OP song “Univer Page” by Suzuko Mimori matches its style quite well with its fantasy elements. The same applies for the ED song that brings out fantasy to a level of credibility. Shinichi’s voice also is performed well that ranges from his otaku craziness to his occasionally maturity during appropriate moments. Regrettably, I find Petralka’s voice to be a sting to my ears that symbolizes the tsundere that she is. As a girl with a bratty voice, I find it not just annoying but also the fact that she herself seems to not even notice it.So, how do you plan to watch Outbreak Company? If you’re in for some fun, then definitely watch it that way because this show is floured with silliness. But if engaging story is a factor you’re more interested, then this show could be quite a disappointment. Instead of a deep story with complex elements, Outbreak Company likes to make more fun of the typical otaku culture and community. With an outbreak of references to anime and manga, expect many ideas to be wheeled in from your favorite series. The main character Shinichi can also take quite a bit of time to get used to and some people might not like him even until the very end.

The synopsis for this anime wasn’t anything exciting nor was it intriguing. However, I decided to watch it anyway, for it was on Crunchyroll and there weren’t too many other anime I was hyped for this fall. After this show finished airing and I finished watching, I, unfortunately felt like I had wasted my time, tuning into this show every Sunday.For the most part, the plot of Outbreak Company is nothing special. Our protagonist, Kanou Shinichi, is a reject who hides in his house all day. The reason for...this is silly, but we can’t blame Outbreak Company for it because it was clearly meant to be a parody anime and you can tell right from the beginning.  The show then immediately tosses Shinichi into a fantasy realm (the Eldant Empire) in which he unintentionally starts developing a harem. The harem part was a strange inclusion, as the beginning of this show led me to believe this would be a romantic comedy. Outbreak Co. is, indeed, a comedy, but it occasionally attempts to be serious and it fails miserably. It has plenty of ecchi elements and fits the definition of harem very well, which prevents it from blending well with “plot.” This could direct the focus of the anime towards comedy, but it may bother you when the show tries to be serious.Thankfully, Outbreak Co. does try to be funny for the majority of the time and that is what you should expect when jumping into this anime. Much to the chagrin of many, however, the jokes in this show heavily rely on references and parody. This is awful for new viewers of anime and non-hardcore viewers because it’s hard to understand the jokes without prior knowledge or thorough research. Either that or the show throws around cultural-specific Japaneses terms so it can create a gag that might last until the end of the current episode. Comedy is really all this show has going for it, yet the entirety of Outbreak Co. involves Shinichi trying to teach the residents of the Eldant Empire about “Otaku Culture,” which creates comedy that, again, alienates new viewers. Don’t watch this anime for the plot, and only for the comedy if you’re a hardcore anime lover, or for some reason, striving to be one.The animation is fine. Though, like many anime today, the art style makes everything shiny (hair, vehicles, skin, etc.). If you watch for a long time, your head may start to hurt. Don’t marathon this anime; not that I would recommend it otherwise. I do like how fantasy elements, such as dragons and magic are drawn, however. There’s also some ecchi so that might also be a reason to avoid Outbreak Co. By the way, every character tends to have this lower case u-shaped smile as their “default expression.” That annoyed me and may annoy you.I have no complaints with the audio for the anime. The music was fine. The opening and ending may be sort of catchy, but nothing exceptional. I do have a problem with a lot of the dialogue from the characters Shinichi and Myucel, but that is more of an issue with the story, or characters. The voice actors could annoy you since their character roles are all generic archetypes, but they’re bearable, at least to me.The characters are what really and truly mitigate my enjoyment for this anime. Outbreak Co. does what many anime do and builds characters directly from unadulterated tropes. I can summarize my problems with the characters in one sentence: Everyone is unoriginal and possibly so annoying that it’s lethal. The unoriginal characters may not be an issue especially if you anticipate the harem aspect. Plenty of harems are not plot-driven, or very much creative, but they can back-up their quality with comedy, or even quirkiness. Outbreak Co. does not have this leisure and it worsens because of Shinichi and his gang. All the people (and even other creatures) are absolutely obsessed with anime and manga. This could actually be funny if: 1. the show could allow people not familiar with Otaku culture to get its references, 2. not make it seem perfectly reasonable that their obsession does not hinder their work. Shinichi takes every single chance he gets to boost his ego by acting like mister smarty-pants when it comes to “Otaku Culture,” Myucel misunderstand every statement that may be misunderstood, and Petralka acts like a more serious person than she actually is (considering she looks like a little girl). These traits could allow these characters to be hilarious, but the awful dialogue and unfortunate combination of mediocre setting and bad character interactions prevents this. An example being: the show doesn’t alert us when it changes its tone effectively, so we don’t know if dialogue is supposed to be serious or comedic.To be as frank as possible, the only reason this show is bad is because of the references that are 90% of this show. It actually isn’t so much that they’re hard to get, but more that they’re omnipresent. Without that problem, high points of Outbreak Co. are salvageable. Though, since it’s included, this anime becomes incredibly hard to enjoy. It’s quite possible for you to enjoy it if you are a hardcore anime viewer. I wouldn’t personally call myself that. The show is obviously made in Japan and therefore targeted toward Japanese viewers, but some of the issues I brought up may prevent you from enjoying it even if you live in Japan.You should definitely avoid Outbreak Company entirely. Unless you are an anime enthusiast, it is distracting that every joke in this anime tends to rely on references to other media, or certain cultural elements. It also seems to want to parody, but never goes full force with it. Even if you get all the references, they’re more amusing than funny, and the bad character design and lack of proper storytelling doesn’t give Outbreak Co. much merit. Don’t expect depth from anything in this show and expect a lot of annoying characters as well as the lack of common sense that would be funny if done properly. I wouldn’t say Outbreak Company is a terrible show, but it limits its audience and it tries a little too hard to be what it is not.4/10 this is silly, but we can’t blame Outbreak Company for it because it was clearly meant to be a parody anime and you can tell right from the beginning.  The show then immediately tosses Shinichi into a fantasy realm (the Eldant Empire) in which he unintentionally starts developing a harem. The harem part was a strange inclusion, as the beginning of this show led me to believe this would be a romantic comedy. Outbreak Co. is, indeed, a comedy, but it occasionally attempts to be serious and it fails miserably. It has plenty of ecchi elements and fits the definition of harem very well, which prevents it from blending well with “plot.” This could direct the focus of the anime towards comedy, but it may bother you when the show tries to be serious.Thankfully, Outbreak Co. does try to be funny for the majority of the time and that is what you should expect when jumping into this anime. Much to the chagrin of many, however, the jokes in this show heavily rely on references and parody. This is awful for new viewers of anime and non-hardcore viewers because it’s hard to understand the jokes without prior knowledge or thorough research. Either that or the show throws around cultural-specific Japaneses terms so it can create a gag that might last until the end of the current episode. Comedy is really all this show has going for it, yet the entirety of Outbreak Co. involves Shinichi trying to teach the residents of the Eldant Empire about “Otaku Culture,” which creates comedy that, again, alienates new viewers. Don’t watch this anime for the plot, and only for the comedy if you’re a hardcore anime lover, or for some reason, striving to be one.The animation is fine. Though, like many anime today, the art style makes everything shiny (hair, vehicles, skin, etc.). If you watch for a long time, your head may start to hurt. Don’t marathon this anime; not that I would recommend it otherwise. I do like how fantasy elements, such as dragons and magic are drawn, however. There’s also some ecchi so that might also be a reason to avoid Outbreak Co. By the way, every character tends to have this lower case u-shaped smile as their “default expression.” That annoyed me and may annoy you.I have no complaints with the audio for the anime. The music was fine. The opening and ending may be sort of catchy, but nothing exceptional. I do have a problem with a lot of the dialogue from the characters Shinichi and Myucel, but that is more of an issue with the story, or characters.

I'm just going to start this review by saying that I have a thing for anime that has a message that I can take away from it. Right off the bat, we have Shinichi, a bro that honestly reminds me of a couple of my friends who just sit and watch anime and read manga all day. In the beginning, we see Sinichi's bad luck set in when he gets kidnapped and brought to some foreign world that has magic and loves Japanese otaku culture. Shinichi is brought in to educate this new world of his otaku...culture and to ensure that relations between said world and Japan are good. He starts a school where they teach anime and manga that right away challenges racism and class diversity between the elves and the dwarves. His school does more for these students than teach them to be otakus - it teaches them to live beyond their differences and be friends with each other despite their origins and differences. Soon they begin to have arguments about lolis and eroge games rather than fighting because they are dwarves or elves. I thought that this was absolutely beautiful and it reminded me a great deal of Maouyuu, which is another one of my favorite shows with similar themes.The next character that we meet is Miusel, who is my favorite character in the entire show. Miusel presents herself to Shinichi and tells him that she will be the maid taking care of him while he stays in the Eldant empire. As soon as Shinichi sees Miusel, he freaks out at the fact that she is a legitimate maid. This is the thing that I love about Shinichi: Miusel freaks out the moment that he discovers that she is a half-elf, which is something that the citizens in Eldant discriminate against her for, and instead thinks the fact that she is an elf is awesome. This is one of the things that I love Shinichi for: he doesn't discriminate against race, gender, or background because he remembers being outcast because he was an otaku. Miusel at this point I believe begins to fall in love with Shinichi, which wasn't something that the plot synopsis and the genres really talk about.The next character you meet is Petralka, the supreme ruler of Eldant that nearly kills Shinichi when he calls her a little girl. Right off the bat, she takes a liking for Shinichi and develops a sort of tsundere personality that really compliments Miusel's personality. As the show progresses, Shinichi helps change her personality for the better with his otaku ways and even helps her become a better leader. I love the idea that a normal person with the right beliefs and intentions can help change those who have a different social class or background than them.Alright, so for those of you who don't want something as deep or psychologically stimulating as this, this show is very lighthearted and is quite hilarious. I don't have many friends who enjoy anime with deep meaning because most of them don't think about stuff like this like I do. That is perfectly fine and I still think you will love this show if you give it a chance. I would even go as far as saying that this anime is deserving a spot on my top ten anime of the year. So stop reading this and go watch it now! culture and to ensure that relations between said world and Japan are good.

So stop reading this and go watch it now!"", ""Outbreak Company is a very enjoyable anime to watch. It's one of those series that can have a positive effect on your mood when you're tired and frustrated.Story: 7The story is a bit original, for me at least. Never before have I seen an anime where the main character actually exports the whole otaku culture. It's pretty fun how they implemented this general idea and having such a short amount of time to provide the viewers with enough details/explanations as to why and how this is happening they did a pretty good job.In no case you should expect an anime with no holes or arbitrary...stories but rest assured assured that the end result is quite enjoyable.Art : 9The art was extremely good, especially when you take into account that it's only 12 episodes. The artist team really did their best to create a very appealing world and beautiful characters. Of course they did not have to wander off into unknown territory and that made their work a bit easier. The races and tribes that reside in this parallel universe are the usual suspects (elfs, dwarfs, humans etc.).That being said the outcome was exceptional.Sound : 6The soundtrack could have been better. It seemed that not enough thought was given to the music for this anime. I can not say that it was bad but it was nothing memorable either. In some cases the soundtrack did not complement the scenes and in others it seemed to be perfect. Overall a decent result in regards to music but it had ample room to improve.Character : 8Most characters were very good although there was a great inequality of available information for some of them (mostly supporting characters). The main protagonist is a hardcore otaku and a hikikomori. Fortunately enough the story explains as to how this came to be. The supporting characters as I stated earlier suffer inequalities between one another since there are some where the viewer knows their background story and others where the flow information is limited at best. As a huge fan of anime I was able to extrapolate certain things from the characters based on their behavior since the maintained a classic character pattern. There is your loli, your BL Pervert, your timid maid and other usual characters. in essence all of them quite good for this type of series.Enjoyment & Overall : 7This anime series was quite enjoyable, easy and fun to watch with no complex story lines or difficult character plots. It is what you would expect from a 12 episode series. I would recommend it to everyone who want to relax watching something fun and easy. stories but rest assured assured that the end result is quite enjoyable.Art : 9The art was extremely good, especially when you take into account that it's only 12 episodes.

Filled with sexualized women, crazy plots, and enough cute little girls to open up a daycare, the culture it has created is definitely unique. It is with this in mind that Outbreak Company aims to look at with a more satirical view in mind.STORYOur story begins with Shinichi, a young guy who, upon scoring a perfect on the ""otaku test"", has been accepted as the new GM of AmuTec. This company\'s main directive? Apply otaku culture to the newly discovered kingdom of Eldant.Sounds pretty crazy, right? To be...honest, it is. Most shows and society look down upon otaku culture (mostly meaning obsession with anime/manga/games). But Outbreak Company takes a positive twist on this idea. The majority of the show actually focuses and explains the different lifestyles, phrases, and mannerisms of otaku. Do you want to know how to be an hikikomori? It has you covered. Don\'t know certain BL terms? Done. Need definitions for what it means to be ""moe"" and ""tsundere""? Easy as pie. The show is rife with the culture it intends to parody, and for all intents and purposes (read here as ""as far as I know""), it does this quite nicely.The show\'s main focus is depicting a world that has never been exposed to something of this magnitude before. Essentially, the people of Eldant are like us before we were ever introduced to anime. They learn about popular shows, what to look out for in manga, and which games are rare to find. But this show is a comedy, and more specifically a parody. It doesn\'t take itself too seriously (most of the time). I found the comedy itself to be good. By playing off the idea that otaku culture is actually something to strive for, it gives us these situations that wouldn\'t normally be possible. And because of that, you are laughing a lot at what these people are doing.More comedy also stems from the characters. They themselves are also pretty generic, but that\'s the point. By representing a role from anime, you understand what that character is attempting to portray or at the very least poke fun at.Because the comedy works so well, when the show does get into more dramatic territory, it feels rather shallow. In other words, weak. OC is at its best when it is making fun of the otaku culture and the comedy in general. A lot of the dire moments only last for an episode (or even half of one), so they don\'t feel particularly influential in the long run.Another problem with the show is the kingdom of Eldant. I felt a distinct lack of development on its world-building. I never really felt as if I was experiencing this new world. Instead, it felt like any other countryside. I feel as if the show should have done some more exploration into its people and original culture before attempting to instantiate a new one. Perhaps this is due to the pacing of the show, which seems a tad bit too quick for its own good.ANIMATIONOutbreak Company\'s art style is actually rather pretty, if not a little bit strange. All of the characters have this ""shine"" to them that makes it look as if they took a bath in some oil beforehand. It isn\'t really a turn-off, just that they seemed to always be glowing.The animation itself is a slight problem. To be honest, it was never too stellar, and when it had the chance to be, such as during the soccer match or during certain dire moments, they usually opted for off-screen happenings or repeated use of the same animated sequence.As for the character designs, I actually quite liked them. In particular, Myucel\'s and Petralka\'s designs were quite nice. The same can be said for Romilda. I would have liked to have seen more racial variety besides just the dwarves and the elves, but perhaps that is just wishful thinking.CHARACTERSIt is best to keep in mind that the characters for OC are meant to parody the common tropes of otaku culture. That being said, I still liked the majority of them.My favorite by far was Myucel. She has a small bit of back-story to her, but she personifies cuteness, and her actions are without a doubt too adorable to not put a smile on your face constantly. Seriously, she is so ""moe"" that it is impossible not to like her.Petralka somewhat represents the ""tsundere"" type. She acts authoritatively and loudly around Shinichi, but it becomes clear early on that her affection towards him is more than just royalty and ambassador. One of her funniest moments is definitely at attempting to be the character arch-type she is parodying, but she always provided good laughs because she could read Shinichi oh so well.Speaking of the MC, Shinichi himself is the final character of note. Unlike other main protagonists, he is not dense. He understands the situations he gets put in, how the people around him act, and what the outcome of certain situations would be. He is smart, kind, and honest. He isn\'t afraid to speak his mind, and because of his otaku nature, he also provided some of the best laughs in the series.Besides these three, I found the other characters to be rather boring or at least under-utilized. Specifically in regards to Elbia and Brooke. These characters are introduced and slightly looked at, but are then for the most part forgotten. I wish we would have seen more connections between them and the world, since this would tie into the world-building itself, but this never happened.SOUNDThe OP at first wasn\'t too good, but became at least slightly enjoyable the more I heard it. It has a fantastical feel to it that fits nicely with the fantasy landscaping of the show. Plus, the twinkling part with Elbia and her eyes I particularly liked because it coincided so well together. The ED features Petralka alone in many different areas around Eldant, and the song itself gives us a feeling of wonderment, the same that she feels as she walks along the barren world.When it comes to a soundtrack, it is sometimes hard to leave a memorable mark. However, it is quite easy to do if you have a piece that is quirky and has simpe lyrics. This piece, probably known by everyone who has seen the show, is the ""DA DA DA"" song that gets played a handful of times. You owe it to yourself to check it out, since it is strangely weird yet extremely fun to listen to.The voice acting was fine throughout the show. There are no standout performances to be had, but I enjoyed Myucel\'s, Petralka\'s, and Shinichi\'s voice acting.ENJOYMENTOutbreak Company is a pretty funny show. And its also very sweet. I love to ship couples if they show any signs that they want to be together. So whenever Shinichi and Myucel were alone together, I always had a doofy grin on my face. Romance wasn\'t really the focus of the show, but I did like the subtle hints and inclusion of it, for it provided tender moments and nice comedy.Even though the show is rated PG-13, there is actually a heavy amount of fan-service, both of the tame and sexual variety. But this should be expected; after all, the show is attempting to demonstrate the different sides to otaku culture, and you can\'t talk about that without some naked women. I personally don\'t mind fan-service, so its inclusion was merely a bonus.One of my favorite moments in OC is the ""Swimsuit Council."" Taking the show into context, it is a masterfully crafted joke and one that I will probably remember for a long time.The series ends on a touching moment, leaving us with wanting to have a fulfilling conclusion. Will we get that? I\'m not sure. But if the time comes, I will be more than happy to return to the land of Eldant to get my fix of Myucel, Petralka, and Shinichi.SUMMARYStory: Fine, interesting premise but lacking developmentAnimation: Good, shiny and modern with average actual animationCharacters: Fine, main cast is good but supporting is badSound: Fine, okay OP, lacking ED, but good ""DA DA DA""Enjoyment: Good, funny, cute, and fan-service to bootFinal Score: 6/10 honest, it is.

Now I wan\'t to be an otaku.This anime is really good.This story introduces a slight feel to it like Spice and Wolf where it teaches you a knowledge of something you may or may not have known about Japanese politics and the Otaku culuture. A boy devoted to being an otaku takes on a new fantasy world, presenting the extravagant anime/manga culture to the Holy Eldant Empire.The Art is great.

It falls into many of the fanservice traps that most harem/comedy anime fall into. Despite this, it has an interesting concept and lovable characters (for the most part.)Our story starts out in modern Japan, where we learn that a NEET (shut-in) named Kanou Shinichi is looking for a job, and finally finds one that seems too good to be true! He takes an online test about Moe and Otaku culture, and passes it with flying colours. At this point he attends an interview for the anime company that he...has finished applying to and, lucky Shinichi, he gets the job! This is where things get crazy. His new boss has drugged him, and he passes out. When Shinichi reawakens, he’s in a lavish bed and room with the only other person in the room being a maid named Miusel Foaran (or Myusel, depending on the sub group) who we soon learn is a half-elf.As it turns out, Shinichi’s new job wasn’t a regular anime company employee, but rather an ambassador to a newly discovered world (or universe, I’m not too picky) and the kingdom of The Holy Eldant Empire, and to improve bonds with it’s citizens and Japan by teaching and promoting Moe and Otaku culture. Hilarity soon ensues with the introduction of a, albeit small, harem, consisting of Petraraca En Eldant III, Miusel, Koganuma Minori, and Erubia Hanaiman. Will our hero be able to successfully spread his culture to the kingdom, or will he be cast out as “The Cultural Invader?” You’ll have to tune in to find out!For those of you well versed in romantic comedy, you’ll see that Outbreak Company has many of its archetypes covered. Petraraca being a Tsundere loli character, Miusel being our shy, innocent character (as well as a maid!), Erubia as our happy-go-lucky large-breasted dogirl, and Minori is our yaoi shipper/soldier/tsundere.As previously mentioned, I truly enjoyed Outbreak Company, despite the numerous fanservice scenes and “Why on earth would you do/say that, MC?” moments.Nothing in the soundtrack particularly stuck out to me, besides a single track that played during some emotional scenes.The ending, however, was less than satisfying. It seems that the writers decided to introduce a problem in the last few episodes just so that they could have a resolution built upon a climax structure. While the show leaves the possibility of a second season open, I highly doubt it happening due to the lack of anything truly different about it, separating Outbreak Company from other fantasy/harem anime.All in all, I’d give Outbreak Company a 7.5/10 because of its lack of “oomph” Despite this low critical score; I’d recommend it to any harem/fanservice junkie.If you enjoyed this review, please check out my anime review blog at trips-anime-review.tumblr.com/ has finished applying to and, lucky Shinichi, he gets the job!

Since there are several different styles of comedy, and several different opinions on exactly which style is the most humorous. Comedy in anime, from what I’ve experienced, usually falls into one of three styles: The slapstick style of comedy, where the humor comes from the clumsy and or stupid decisions and actions made by the characters, the more sarcastic and witty style of comedy, where the humor comes from the characters wit and sharp tongues, and will probably feature a decent amount sarcasm, and, finally, the parody style of comedy, which derives its humor...from the many references it makes. Usually, those references refer to other anime. Outbreak Company uses the parody style of comedy, a style of comedy that I can’t say I’ve ever been the biggest fan of. Was Outbreak Company’s comedy spot on, or did it just miss the mark?Story:The story revolves around the Shinichi Kanou, a hikkikomori (or shut in) and otaku who, after a period of deep reclusion, has decided to get a get job. After acing an online test, and performing well in his follow up interview, Shinichi was offered a job. Right after accepting the job offer, he is drugged and wakes in an unfamiliar room. He discovers that he’s been transported to an alternate dimension, to new world, by the Japanese government. He has been hired as an ambassador to the Holy Eldant Empire, a kingdom in this new world. His mission is to bring otaku culture, anime, manga, etc., to the Holy Eldant Empire in order to strengthen its relationship with Japan.As mentioned earlier, this story is a parody comedy series, and it makes several references to other anime, manga, and other things in otaku culture. The series also pokes fun of, and pays homage to, several anime tropes. These references are not only funny, but they manage to always keep the series interesting. I not only enjoyed the references that Outbreak Company made in its dialogue, but I also liked the more subtle references, such as posters and figures of some of my favorite characters in the background.While this is a comedy series, it actually does have a pretty interesting narrative that touches on several different themes. The story addresses issues like racism, classism, and politics, which makes it that much more entertaining to watch.Unfortunately, the story doesn’t come to a very satisfying conclusion. While there is an “ending” it still leaves some things unsaid, and some questions unanswered. And the last couple of episodes did feel a little rushed, as they tried to kick the story into high gear.Animation:Outbreak Company’s animation was really well done, with well-defined characters and good-looking background scenery. There are some scenes, specifically some action scenes, that I would’ve liked to actually see the actions taking place, but they decided to just use a shaky background image instead of actually animating it. While the animation isn’t great, it’s definitely good, quality animation.Characters:While Shinichi Kanou is the star of Outbreak Company, the series does feature two other main characters, Myucel Foaran, Shinichi’s maid, Petralka Anne Eldante III, the empress of the Holy Eldant Empire, as well as several other supporting characters. Most of the characters in this series suffer from a lack of a proper background story and development, including our main characters. The amount of information we get about each of the characters varies. While some characters will have a fairly detailed backstory, others’ backstories will be only briefly mentioned and explored, if they are ever mentioned at all. Also, while there are some characters that do develop over the course of the series, others tend to either stay the same, or change very little.With all of that being said, all of the characters are very likeable and enjoyable to watch. The character’s interactions with one another are also entertaining. The relationships between the characters do have a decent amount of development, and it was entertaining to see how each of the character’s relationships changed over the course of the series.Sound:Outbreak Company’s soundtrack (OST) is large and varied. It features several orchestral sounding songs, some that are more epic and grand, and others that are more peaceful. The OST also features songs from other genres, from folk sounding pieces to march. It has a good balance of fast and slower paced songs, as well as a good balance between songs that are more grand and complex, and other songs that were incredibly simple. There are also some songs in the OST that are just, for lack of a better word, quirky, but very catchy at the same time. While watching this series the OST can get buried, and you might not even notice how many songs the OST actually has. This isn’t helped by the fact that there are plenty of songs in the OST that sound very similar to one another. But, all in all, Outbreak Company has a very good OST.Enjoyment:I had a really fun time watching Outbreak Company. Everything from the funny and interesting references, to poking fun at anime tropes, to the very likeable characters made this series entertaining to watch.Verdict & Breakdown:Story: 4/5Animation: 3.9/5Characters: 3.7/5Sound: 4.2/5Enjoyment: 4.1/5Verdict: 4/5Outbreak Company is a very entreating series, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of anime and or otaku culture. from the many references it makes.

Part 1 With no spoilers. Part 2 With short and deeper look at the story - spoilers  - reader discretion is advised.Part 1.I wish more anime series would be like this. This is one of the balanced ones. I mean, not too much sexistic scenes (Ecchi), not too much weird scenes, its showing how it really was in times of king, knights, princesses etc. (Offcourse things like dragons, birds used to be horses werent in medieval times, but that is minor (i think)). One aspect I like about this anime is showing a real otaku culture (half of...it), a lot of references to games and other animes. And when i say: a lot of, I really mean a huge amount of refenences (at least two in every episode). One aspect i didnt like about it is, the main point of this anime is revealed like nearly at the end, but I have to say in some ways its original (never saw something like that). Would I recommend it? Yes! Some viewers will like it some viewers will just watch it, say something about characters that are kawaii and go watch another anime. So yeah, watch it if you want...Part 2. As I mentioned earlier this will take a short look at the story.So, main character is taken, throught an magical portal, to the magical medieval world where he is tasked to popularize otaku culture, as it looks from outside. But from inside, Japan goverment have something other in their minds, but i dont want to spoil that, only thing I convinced myself to say, as I said in Part 1, is it will be revealed at the end. So our character Shinichi was met with circumstances, in other words, what he have to do. By his side is an maid Myucel (aaah so cute.... i meant KAWAII) what will do everything he want, but she started to be addicted on him, something like she felt in love with him buuuut there will not be any kiss (yes gents, there is no kiss... goddamn!!!). Some scenes are funny, some scenes are something between funny and normal (not too bad actually) and there is not much action sequences. There are a lots of good ideas, like: build a school where Chinichi and others will teach that enthusiastic elves, dwarfs, ware wolfs and humans  of Otaku culture. Soccer between elves and dwarfs etc... There is so much thing that makes this anime so good.                If you made it throught my english to this point... Thanks. But.... there is two goddamn things that wont let Chinichi get laid with girls: 1. That barely teen Majesty Petralka, and, 2. Circumstances... it), a lot of references to games and other animes.

Without given away to much, you will see what i refer to once you start watching.The anime contains a lot of supporting members but at best they just fill a specific role and aren't given much of a story.Where the Anime lacks in character development (Outside of Shinichi and the main cast) the anime makes up for it with its countless references to Anime, Manga and Games such as 'Da Capo 2' brings it a lot of light heartedness and blends well with the comedy.I recommend this Anime to anyone who enjoys a fantasy setting with very little combat or detailed story, and instead wants something filled with joy, laughter and light-heartedness.I personally enjoyed this Anime a lot however can see the further potential that could of been pursued with it. example being 'Erbia' whom i found an interesting character at first and then is almost never used story-wise but instead mainly for fan service.

The OP, ED, and OST are all very good and fit the mood well. The voice actors/actresses (Japanese dub) help make the characters enjoyable and match their looks and personalities.

Myucel is another main character and well she is the maid to Shinichi and his really loyal to him being she is her maid she is easily a likeable character other than that she is a very nice and sweet through the anime.

I read one today and it was pretty good as well.Peace "", ""This anime was great, not what I'd typically watch, but I'm glad I gave it a shot! Here's what I thought:Story:I think the story was okay, not the best, but still not horrible. It got a little confusing at times, especially about midway through the anime, but it was fine, I was still into it.Art:The art in this anime was amazing! I think that the characters were adorable, and the personality type matched the artstyle of each character as well.Sound:I think the voice actors portrayed the characters quite well, and the opening/closing to the anime were great as well. I actually...added both of them to a playlist that I listen to from time to time.Character:I found the main character in this anime to be completely relatable, as he is a huge otaku, and basically a shut in. As for the other characters, there wasn't one that I disliked in the main cast of characters at least.I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, it was hilarious at times, but also serious when it needed to be. I would more than likely rewatch this one at a later date. added both of them to a playlist that I listen to from time to time.Character:I found the main character in this anime to be completely relatable, as he is a huge otaku, and basically a shut in.

The character design is pretty stellar with pretty line art and great shading, and some of the scenes were quite beautiful as well.The soundtrack really complemented the scenes, and some tracks will be absolutely legendary, such as the duh's of the laugh track being a specific highlight. The opening and ending were pretty standard however.The characters were pretty...one dimensional, with them based on tropes, but did actually show some growth over the episodes. The princess girl had her episode of growth, the maid girl shows progression through the whole series, but the rest of the cast, aside from the MC, was pretty stagnant aside from their initial quirk.The story wasn't amazing, but it wasnt Dog Day's level though. They had alot of good threads introduced, but the show tried to do too much with too little time, and left a lot of threads open. Considering that the later episodes were complete filler, with 11 & 12 having some semblance of a final plot, but you know, it could have been better.Overall, this isn't the type of show that will rock your socks off, but it is a good view to just hang out and enjoy some good old anime. The references are also a fun addition that makes it feel more realistic.Pretty decent stuff, tbh. one dimensional, with them based on tropes, but did actually show some growth over the episodes.

I was just there for the premise, but there were many things that it actually did pretty well.Story: 7/10The story in the beginning seemed very generic at first with the usual premise of being trapped in another world, but I really liked the beach scene and the overarching story.  The beach episode felt a bit more representative of the way an otaku would react showing us that he is still the awkward type of person.  It was also cool to see...the mc bring his whole collection of anime and manga and introduce it to everyone, which from my experience is original.  I also really liked the plot twist at the end, which was like the exact opposite of Gate in terms of how the government is viewed.Art: 6/10The art style looks pretty nice in this show with very differentiable characters.  It is very bright and colorful but don’t expect to see good fighting animation.  There were times when it did average but when it came to certain scenes, all you saw were stills, panning on the screen.  Like for the dragon fight all you saw were soldiers aiming at a dragon with nothing moving.  Other than the fights, all the other scenes were consistent.Sound: 6/10Not really any of the soundtracks were memorable other than that ‘da da da’ one which sounded very strange to me.  But they did match well with the scenes.  Kanou’s tone of voice changed well when going between the comedy and serious moods.  However, I don’t think that there was enough music to fit the serious tones.Character: 7/10The characters were the generic archetypes but they did develop a bit as you continue to watch.  I wish they had more of a backstory on how Myucel became Kanou’s maid though.  The main character showed a slightly more realistic approach to how an otaku would react compared to other shows.  He isn’t perfect but still tries his best to help others.  The harem isn’t actually blindly in love with him either which annoys me so much when that’s done in other shows that I watch.Enjoyment: 8/10I really enjoyed how this show shared about otaku culture, presenting its pro and cons.  There were tons of references that were put into this series as well like Fate, The Devil is a Part Timer and Madoka Magica.Overall: 7/10Overall I would recommend this anime to people who like Gate or The Devil is a Part Timer and vice versa. the mc bring his whole collection of anime and manga and introduce it to everyone, which from my experience is original.

It could have a second season though since 12 episodes is a bit too short. It is sort of similar to zero no tsukaima and the plot is really great. if they make a second season of this thus expand the story where the main character get to travel to other new countries that will be awesome.  i believe this anime deserves a better score since its a pretty good solid one. unlike some anime where they have very uninteresting plot at all. they could spice up the...things with the romance though, that would make it even more awesome. in my opinion the only thing that this anime lacks is the romance bit but thats just merecommeneded for those who don't mind about harem and a fan of otaku.-not recommended for girls and those who disliked harem. things with the romance though, that would make it even more awesome. in my opinion the only thing that this anime lacks is the romance bit but thats just merecommeneded for those who don't mind about harem and a fan of otaku.-not recommended for girls and those who disliked harem."", 'At first i wasnt all that interested in this anime.Neither i am now.The story was well written i give you that.This anime is set into a futuristic(not really..maybe a bit..idk) world where in Japan a dimensional rift(or crack..however u want).The gouvernment classified it as a TOP-Secret area thingy and sent teams in there.What they discovered was an anime world.IM NOT EVEN KIDDING.Also this anime points out that being an ""otaku"" is actually good.Our MC here is a hardcore otaku who got a chance to see the ""other side"" with the sole purpose of teaching the inhibitants of the other world the...joy of otaku.Do we get fanservice?Yes yes we do.At least a little bit.We also get romance between the master and the maid,and a harem.The social discrimination and country matters come in play too.So there\'s mixed feeling in here,diversity FTW.The voices and sounds were good.I enjoyed hearing an invented language.+1 for a new language.I enjoyed the anime nonetheless.And i do recomend you to watch it.Give it a go and you might be surprised. joy of otaku.Do we get fanservice?Yes yes we do.At least a little bit.We also get romance between the master and the maid,and a harem.The social discrimination and country matters come in play too.So there\'s mixed feeling in here,diversity FTW.The voices and sounds were good.I enjoyed hearing an invented language.+1 for a new language.I enjoyed the anime nonetheless.And i do recomend you to watch it.Give it a go and you might be surprised.', 'This review may contain spoilers. Read at your own risk.Imagine we somehow make contact with another world. Imagine you\'d like to show the natives of this world a part of our own world\'s culture, to show that we\'re friendly. I\'m pretty sure ""Otaku Culture"" wouldn\'t be that high on anyone\'s list, but it was on this anime! Somehow! This anime\'s plot is incredibly meta in such a way that it\'s so bad it loops back around to be somewhat good. The first few episodes will make anyone critically analyzing the anime pull their hairs out from the unbelievably brain-dead lines delivered and plot points. Some...of them don\'t even make that much sense at all. Why would the government want a complete Otaku shut-in to be the ambassador of a whole new alternate world? It even differs completely in that trope: the Main Character doesn\'t die and get sent to a new fantasy world, or get any magical powers or mystical relics, they aren\'t anyone of consequence at all, they\'re literally just a nobody that got brought by the government in order to... spread Otaku Culture to a world that\'s still on the very beginnings of Medieval Europe with added Magic and fantasy races, such as Elves and Dwarves. There IS a semi-logical reason for this, but it\'s kept to the very end of the season. Which in of itself is where the main plot actually gets interesting. The beginning of the season was rather dull, overusing Isekai tropes and mixing in a sort of fabricated value to Otaku Culture. It\'s only in the last 4-5 episodes of the season where things actually take a very interesting and deep turn. Of course, being the finale, there\'s really not much to go on, but those last episodes really did feel like they were starting to build a truly unique world for the story. Should there ever be a 2nd season, if they somehow manage to expand on that initial world building, it could turn into a somehow decent isekai to watch. But right now, the only message this anime gets across is ""Otaku Culture! Yay! These are references to Otaku Culture things! Enjoy Verbaloid, Destiny/Remain Evening, Blade Art Online, among others! Go Otaku and you too can meet busty Elf Girls in another world! All sponsored by your government!"". It really doesn\'t go any higher than a brittle base of it\'s cast, story and setting and that really hampers whatever potential this anime could even begin to have.

The comedy of this series is one of the few good points about it, if not the only one.The iffy start wasn't only because that the show is generic, but also the fact that it executes drama extremely poorly, or at least something that was meant to be drama.The first time that we see this is in episode 3, where some drama happened and the results were the following. Character A was stabbed defending character B,...leading to character B changing the way that she perceived character A. This was all done with the light-hearted theme presented at the beginning of the series and some comedy scenes here and there. Yes, someone got injured but all while having comedy. Which I honestly couldn't care less about either the drama or comedy since it isn’t funny when someone is getting stabbed and isn’t sad when you have a character pushing his face against a woman breasts while being kidnapped and on a life of death situation, all while the woman is moaning. Which is really bad since the comedy is the strong point of this series.The second time and last one that we see this is on the last 2 episodes of the series, where after multiples episodes of extremely absurd comedy we get a drama arc. But again, all while being light-hearted and trying to be funny. I won’t go into details about what happened but it was the same exact thing that happened in the beginning drama arc of the series. Drama and comedy altogether. Why wouldn’t work?Think about this. You are with some people in a life or death situation and from nowhere someone goes and tells a joke. Would you find it funny? I at least wouldn’t. But that’s me, when it exists actual consequences I can’t find it funny. And this series goes and tell us that it indeed it exists consequences, but continues with the comedy and give us absurd situations while something is at stake and that’s why in my opinion it doesn’t work.While I do think that the drama of Outbreak Company is horrible, on the other hand, I do think that the comedy is great. I mean, a 10 years old dwarf with beard attending school and learning hardcore Otaku terms like “Haitenai” is something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. (Which btw is when a female character might not be wearing anything underneath her skirt, but keep in mind that whether she’s actually wearing any or not doesn’t matter).The show also makes a lot of references to another anime, which in my opinion is quite funny if you know what they are making references to.That’s the type of comedy that this series uses most of the time. Absurd situations, that are only available because of the medieval/magic world that they are. And I do think that it made good use of that for the comedy.And that’s it. It actually had more good episodes than bad ones, but the bad ones were awful. Making this a series that I would never recommend and one when I look back at it will only think of how good it could have been. That said, overall I did enjoy the anime and that’s why I gave it a 6 out of 10 (Fine).With that, I conclude my review. If you are looking for an anime that it never takes itself seriously, even when it does, I recommend this series since the comedy is pretty good and despite the plot being complete nonsense, it is an enjoyable anime. leading to character B changing the way that she perceived character A.

I would say Outbreak Company is in the higher tiers of unique isekai anime, it just has one big problem, and that is the last 2 episodes ruining the logic of the story.The problem:-Japan finds another world through a small portal-So they decide to peacefully export their \'otaku culture\' of anime and games to this other world\'s empire-Main Character helps to get this country addicted to all things otaku-MC finds out that Japan wants to use the culture trade to be able to get natural resources-MC freaks out, because apparently getting...people hooked on entertainment and selling it is evil?Like seriously, the last 2 episodes are about the MC fighting to ruin Japan\'s plan to trade culture for resources. Apparently he expected that they were doing this for 0 gain, but no one in the empire is ever upset that this is the case even when he tells them. They only come to his defense when the government understandably tries to take him out for sabotaging their plans.He gets upset that Japan is limiting imports to drive up demand for the products (which BTW they have not gotten anything out of importing after many months), but in the SAME EPISODE he is obsessed over this super LIMITED edition item that is worth a lot of money, and says ""I love Japan\'s anime and games, so I couldn\'t forgive the way the government was using them"", what way? The same way otaku culture and companies that you love uses them in Japan??Obviously it really spoiled the story line right at the end to have this character suddenly realize the obvious and logical purpose of Japan being there, but hate it. people hooked on entertainment and selling it is evil?Like seriously, the last 2 episodes are about the MC fighting to ruin Japan\'s plan to trade culture for resources.

However the characters that surround the story are all pretty typical for shounen anime. The hikikomori character and the typical harem situation, if you're into that typa anime, then this is the anime for you. Of course, if you're also into that situation combined with fantasy, then yeah, this is the one.The harem concept doesn't entirely apply here, but it implies it through the characters and their actions.The story-line however is what really caught my attention to make this...review. Usually the ending for all shounen anime would be so predictable and cliche. However, this anime, though is still somewhat cliche and predictable, I did not expect the story to go the way it did. It's a new type of story for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed, and do not regret watching it at all. review. Usually the ending for all shounen anime would be so predictable and cliche.

How about a job to talk about and share what you love? To spread your cherished otaku culture to said fantasy world while appearing to be some high and mighty delegate from a culturally advanced world? Sounds fun, and Outbreak Company is exactly that. Episodic, light and comedic in nature, this anime follows our protagonist, a hikimori/shut-in, Shinichi Kanou, who is thoroughly enjoying his time spent in a magical other dimension, watching anime and reading manga, while being waited upon by his very...own busty maid. Once just another nerd in our world, he became the director of Amutec and the man entrusted with the foreign relations between the Eldant Empire and Japan.I’m sorry, but if you intend to take this series seriously -- do not. The premise itself should scream at you that it is typically light-hearted, silly and fun, if you are looking for an engaging tale with moral complications, deep characters and philosophies... shoo, begone, ye do not belong here. The series does teeter between seriousness and light-hearted, but it is better to treat it as the latter. I will not elaborate more on the story here as you can read it on the MAL page, I’ll reveal as little of it as I can in this review as it is much more fun to discover things by yourself just as Shinichi does coming into this whole new unfamiliar world. In fact, Outbreak Company starts off humorously going into Shinichi’s surprise and reactions to the new developments. If I didn’t imply it heavily or clearly enough in the first paragraph, this is a largely wish-fulfilment anime as I’m sure it would be a dream come true for anyone, especially otakus like Shinichi, to be able to visit another world with all sorts of things you can only dream about while staying at your very own mansion, complete with a servant and a hot but innocent maid.At any rate, Shinichi gathers his surroundings and learns about the world before setting his grand plans in motion to bring moe culture to the Eldant Empire. Things do get serious when complications arise, we are faced with the social issues and values of this medieval society, including racism and equality, and Shinichi must also at one point question himself and his place in this foreign world. After the first few episodes, however, the series ditches all “seriousness” and just becomes “the daily life of Shinichi Kanou”. There are no new developments actually shown in his quest to spread moe culture, I actually thought for half the series he was doing almost nothing while apparently in the background, manga and anime caught and became very widespread. We do not see this, instead, we play soccer, we go to the beach, we make movies and etc., before one of the issues brought up in the first episodes is very hastily wrapped up in the very last.That is why I say to not treat this show seriously. For most of the show, we simply are met with pure, simple entertainment with the antics of the characters, the fun that they are having engaging various otaku activities and the many, many pop culture references that pop up throughout. Any problems that come up are not particularly meaningful or severe and do not have any lasting consequences, a lot of the time, the “tension” just comes from very heated debates over which anime or character is better. Outbreak Company can be basically considered an episodic comedy set in a fantasy world rather than your traditional high school setting. It did make me laugh, which cannot be said for many other shows, and the references to other anime really did amuse me, however there was nothing that they did that really stood out or set this show apart.The characters are not deep in the loosest sense of the word, they are meant to fit snugly into their tropes and roles and let you rejoice in the anime-ness of this anime. There were no characters I particularly liked, none of them were actually all that interesting, but there were none that I particularly disliked either or found too bland. Shinichi is your typical perverted otaku whose meant to reflect the audience, he gets overexcited about his animu and what he does can be cringeworthy to say the least. Nevertheless, he’s actually decently intelligent and was the one who thought up the solutions to many of the problems that came up. Like 99% of anime protagonists, he is a good guy who will risk his life for his friends... and his super rare anime collectables. Moving on, Miusel Foaran is an innocent maid... with a very, very nice rack and elf ears as well as a maid uniform to top it off. She’s the pure maiden who falls in love with the main character, though the series doesn’t actually delve into romance, the perfect wife who can cater to your every need who even shares your love of anime. She is earnest, hardworking and strong, willing to sacrifice herself to save her friends if need be. Serving as the polar opposite to the well-endowed half-elf maid and catering to the other crowd is Petralka, the almighty ruler of the Eldant Empire, apparently sixteen, she looks twelve. Some might find her annoying as she is a bratty, arrogant and spoilt tsundere, but it makes sense since she has nearly no problems in her life.

The castle architecture and the fantasy clothing designs are very nice, though one might have to get used to the way they drew eyes, with their slightly strange, noticeable and solid eyelashes. It isn’t bad, simply slightly different from the norm. The opening isn’t anything impressive, but it suits the anime well and the ending is a good way to conclude each episode. The voice actors suited the characters, bringing out their happy moments and embarrassing ones as well.

Once just another nerd in our world, he became the director of Amutec and the man entrusted with the foreign relations between the Eldant Empire and Japan.I’m sorry, but if you intend to take this series seriously -- do not. The premise itself should scream at you that it is typically light-hearted, silly and fun, if you are looking for an engaging tale with moral complications, deep characters and philosophies... shoo, begone, ye do not belong here. The series does teeter between seriousness and light-hearted, but it is better to treat it as the latter. I will not elaborate more on the story here as you can read it on the MAL page, I’ll reveal as little of it as I can in this review as it is much more fun to discover things by yourself just as Shinichi does coming into this whole new unfamiliar world. In fact, Outbreak Company starts off humorously going into Shinichi’s surprise and reactions to the new developments. If I didn’t imply it heavily or clearly enough in the first paragraph, this is a largely wish-fulfilment anime as I’m sure it would be a dream come true for anyone, especially otakus like Shinichi, to be able to visit another world with all sorts of things you can only dream about while staying at your very own mansion, complete with a servant and a hot but innocent maid.At any rate, Shinichi gathers his surroundings and learns about the world before setting his grand plans in motion to bring moe culture to the Eldant Empire. Things do get serious when complications arise, we are faced with the social issues and values of this medieval society, including racism and equality, and Shinichi must also at one point question himself and his place in this foreign world. After the first few episodes, however, the series ditches all “seriousness” and just becomes “the daily life of Shinichi Kanou”. There are no new developments actually shown in his quest to spread moe culture, I actually thought for half the series he was doing almost nothing while apparently in the background, manga and anime caught and became very widespread. We do not see this, instead, we play soccer, we go to the beach, we make movies and etc., before one of the issues brought up in the first episodes is very hastily wrapped up in the very last.That is why I say to not treat this show seriously. For most of the show, we simply are met with pure, simple entertainment with the antics of the characters, the fun that they are having engaging various otaku activities and the many, many pop culture references that pop up throughout. Any problems that come up are not particularly meaningful or severe and do not have any lasting consequences, a lot of the time, the “tension” just comes from very heated debates over which anime or character is better. Outbreak Company can be basically considered an episodic comedy set in a fantasy world rather than your traditional high school setting. It did make me laugh, which cannot be said for many other shows, and the references to other anime really did amuse me, however there was nothing that they did that really stood out or set this show apart.The characters are not deep in the loosest sense of the word, they are meant to fit snugly into their tropes and roles and let you rejoice in the anime-ness of this anime.

He applies for a job then he gets drugged and sent to another world. His job is to work with the Japanese military and government to spread otaku anime/manga culture to this new world.  My favorite part about this anime is how it touches very deep topics, such as  separation by class/race and government corruption. In the world he is sent to everyone is separated this way. Low class and high class and all the...races. Such as people who belong to the empire in that world/humans are at the top and people in the towns that are non human such as elves, werewolves, dwarfs, lizardmen etc. are at the bottom. Shinichi wants to unite them. Another thing to mention is the massive parodies this anime has. You\'ll be able to recognize all the anime it parodies.

Harem? Romance? Uh.. Action? What was this anime again? Highschool maybe? Kinda.Outbreak Company. Basically it\'s an Isekai anime, where our MC is a total shut in, but was recruited for some kind of a mission to spread the Otaku culture in a new world that was revealed.There, he meets tons of girls and yep, you guessed right- It becomes your generic Isekai harem anime.Story: 4/10The story was really bad, Let\'s start and say it didn\'t have any linear plot line, nothing that led to another thing, no twists. Nothing. When the series was about to get a bit serious, it ends in a minute,...somehow. It fails to be serious, and therefore I thought ""Well it doesn\'t matter, at least the comedy should be good"".Well I was right, for the first few episodes. The jokes were pretty funny at first, but afterwards it just became the ""embarrassing situations with a Harem MC"". Walking into a girl stripping/dressing up, touching a pair of boobs, etc. etc.So, I thought maybe I\'ll see some amazing romantic development. Uhhh I can\'t say there wasn\'t. But it was definitely not more than your usual Harems. Well maybe a bit more. Still not satisfying, even a bit frustrating. I won\'t spoil, though.Art: 8/10The art was pretty good, nothing more, nothing less. Pleasing to the eye.Sound: 4/10Okay, that was a bit annoying. The OP and the ED songs are forgettable and skippable. I skipped both of them every episode since hearing them once.Now to the soundtrack- When there\'s a climax brewing, you should have some intense track right? Well not here. The ""intense"" soundtrack is a person saying ""da dadadada, da, dadada"" with some kind of rhythm.Character: 6/10Harem show, what can I say. You have the kind person in love with MC, you have the tsundere, you have the girl with the big boobs who slaps MC and the girl with big boobs who doesn\'t care about MC touching her boobs and such.I\'ve liked Miyucel(the maid), and she was the only reason I\'ve kept watching this anime. The rest of the cast (Including Shinichi the MC) weren\'t likable.Enjoyment/Overall: 6/10.Outbreak company tried many things, it failed in most of them (if not all).

It's just that when you occasionally genre hop into somewhat seriousness the expectations grow higher. But then when it drops a silly joke in the midst of it as an actual plot element, just as a reminder not to take it too seriously, you're just not sure what to think anymore, and how you should manage your expectations. So that part about it was a bit weird but not too bad, though overall it was really fun to watch and has a great character cast.Most of the time it's...just a clever self aware comedy with a pretty unique setting, and that's what it does best. Sometimes it even splurges into exploring actual meaningful themes, and shows signs of quality writing here and there, just to then drop the act and spend a considerable amount of time just having SoL fun and being enjoyable comedy. So it has a bit of everything, and it's balanced quite nicely, but it's not equally skilled at everything which occasionally makes a particular plot point feel cheap and out of place.But it's tons of fun, and even more so to someone knowledgeable about anime tropes and otaku culture, as it's what it's essentially about, though it approaches it in very elegant way, meaning it's much easier to figure out and appreciate than Nyaruko for example. And that might be one of its biggest strengths. Compared to Zero no Tsukaima, it feels more serious and solid while having no blatant fanservice.Compared to Dog Days 2 it has slightly lower quality production, but that's not to say it's suffers from it. It might be a little less fun, but also feels more serious and concrete than it. It's biggest downfall is that it isn't very compelling (think not as good as HenNeko, but not too far overall), but the fair point can be made that it isn't its point due to it mostly being self aware comedy. The problem only presents itself in a sense that Outbreak Company has a bit of everything, and those few parts that should be compelling, aren't really.

It feels like there isn\'t much progress happening towards something, albeit the characters do grow and change (which is great). Well yes, there is progress, but it isn\'t very gripping for me (until last 2 episodes). If this show was purely comedy, this would be rated around a 7.5 or so out of 10. The lack of enjoyment brings it down to about a...5.5 out of 10 experience. To give some understanding of what I mean by a 5.5 feeling I mean that I am not excited to finish the show (and don\'t really care too much about watching it in the first 10 episodes).

In my opinion the bizarre plot about spreading otaku culture to a medieval fantasy world is well thought-out.The story has a quick pace as there are only twelve episodes. Because of the show's short length the individual characters have very little screen time.

I feel most of the story was quite good. The comedy was very entertaining, the characters were refreshing, and the art wasn't bad. But just as all good things must come to an end, the end for this show was a little earlier than I was hoping for. Up until episode ten I was very entertained and the story wasn't super generic. However, the last two episodes were terrible. The ending was rushed, and was so cringey. Most of the show was very funny, but the ending had...no comedy and it almost felt as though the writers changed. I would honestly recommend this show, but not for the story.

It sounds a little weird, and most people looking for a serious plot may be put off. But It does develop into something deeper as Shinichi starts to...learn about the world he's been transported into.Character (8/10): The character development is a big aspect of this anime, and Shinichi pretty much affects the entire Eldant empire, in a good way. I loved each character, even Darwin (lizard guy) who sadly doesn't get much screen time.

The Japanese government finds a new realm in an abyss, and decides to kidnap an Otaku to sell them their own merchandise. Ignoring finding a new world, I'm not really sold on this plot at all. While it explores major topics today such as social class, and racial discrimination, the show expresses them, but doesn't address or build anything on it afterwards. it focuses more on selling anime and manga, and the lack of hero qualities by the MC is underwhelming in this fantasy series. It's more...of a lighthearted comedy then an engaging series.Art 8/10 -- The Art was really good, one thing for certain is the high amount of anime/manga references hidden on the walls in the background. I found that to be pretty cool by Studio feel, along with the vibrant color and scenery they put effort into. The majestic castle was pretty nice as well.Sound 8/10 -- Overall the op/ed songs were pretty good, and the background music was better then most series during this season.Character 7/10 --  The character art is average to good, and so are the personalities. Myucel is every man's dream when it comes to maids, she learns everything Shinichi teaches her quickly, and her personality is very cute and enjoyable. Petralka is a demanding majestic loli, 3 words together that can give any anime watcher multiple different reactions, while Shinichi is a rather plain MC, dense and somewhat gullible/follows blindly when being spoken too.Enjoyment 7/10 -- The story isn't anything special, but this anime is enjoyable to SOL/Fantasy fans, as it doesn't care too much on story, but rather the daily, fun events with doing the job Shinichi does. He's bringing everything he loves into a new world that's deprived, and he's thankful for meeting all these people I'm sure he could never have dreamed of. He becomes more outgoing as the series progresses, and I think this blends well with the atmosphere of the series.Overall 6/10 -- This anime is a solid 6-7 series, but the art and sound were the best subjects from my review. The characters aren't as special as others I've seen compared to other similar fantasy animes. The story doesn't dig deeper, and that's a disconnect for me.

This flick shows people a crude reality... on how Otaku culture can easily invade and hypnotize people and make slaves into it if not controlled.

However there is a kind of warfare that can be even deadlier when used over a period of time but yet doesn\'t take a single life. Cultural warfare.The story of Outbreak Company is japan introducing the culture of the ""otaku"" to a new world they found the portal to one day. Their many efforts had failed as the many managers lacked an immerse knowledge of the ""otaku"" way. So the hired a shut in with a life completely dedicated to manga and anime in hopes to reap...a large profit from spawning a Japanese entertainment industry to this new, under developed world they\'ve stumbled across. A very straight forward story with the occasional twist that keeps things interesting and never lacking in entertainment.Styles for scenery and background are astounding with detail that really capture the environment of a medieval style timeline. However for characters and other minor animated objects, the lack of detail with facial expressions when put at any distance, is very disappointing. even the use of cell shading is limited on things.Sounds for the use of magic are something to be credited for as they are well used and each spell has a very different sound to it. as for background music, its mostly either very faint or blends in to the scene so well you hardly notice it except for lewd/fan service scenes where the music is in your face to the point where the beat of it can ruin the humor value.Characters are played out and portrayed decent for the most part but as for back stories, not much at all is explained for anyone other than the single main character. Light topics of explanation are occasionally told but only in scattered spots throughout the 13 episodes and nothing really gives you a clear idea of how from there did they get to where they are today. Other than back stories, the play out of each character bar a few, was well thought out as everyone had their deeper purpose and some didn\'t find theirs until after other sinister ones were revealed.Enjoyment factor was, on a personal note, quite high for myself as the references to countless other anime and Japanese idols are so high I would almost think it impossible to count them all. It was played out perhaps too quickly in some parts but its the lesser parts are skimmed over as needed. Many times the main character see\'s himself as an anime\'s main protagonist due to all his years of being an otaku shut in, and tends to relate a lot of his experiences with moments from his excessive manga database. a large profit from spawning a Japanese entertainment industry to this new, under developed world they\'ve stumbled across.

Lots of different personalities, conflicts between the different races. This isn\'t your typical harem/ecchi anime, which will be just like the other 100,000 of them.To be honest, I enjoyed watching this anime, but in the end, I feel like something was missing. I would\'ve loved to see a romance between Shinichi and Myucel. The potential was there! Instead I got some awkward moments and Shinichi\'s thought process when seeing Myucel and kind of a rushed ending...If they would\'ve made something between Shinichi and Myucel, I feel like this anime would\'ve gotten another season, or multiple.

I would highly suggest watching this if you like fantasy or comedy or isekai in general. Its not a perfect show, but there is surprisingly strong writing. I feel like if the show was longer, they could've fit a bit more serious things, but as it...is those things are more hinted at and pushed to the background. That's not a bad thing, it just would've been nice to see more of that. As it is, I really enjoyed this. is those things are more hinted at and pushed to the background.

It just went unnoticed, as they were quite crafty about it.""This quote comes from the TV Tropes page for the Tetris franchise, and is shockingly relevant to this anime. Outbreak Company is an isekai anime from 2013 where a complete shut-in named Shinichi gets picked for a little experiment involving a parallel world the Japanese government just found a little bit beforehand. He gets dropped there as a missionary to spread the Gospel of otaku culture, and then starts a harem with a maid, a foxgirl, and...a loli...(had to dock a point for that), so basically, he\'s living out all of our dreams.And then things take a dark turn.It\'s evidenced early on that the culture of Erdant is quickly eroding through Shinichi\'s presence. It starts off great, with the children finally learning to read and write (in Japanese, of course) instead of immediately getting thrown into the military. However, early on, said children have already started having heated debates about which 2D girl is the sexiest at an age where they shouldn\'t even know why we like boobs. Later, Petralta, the 16-year old ""supreme leader"" of Erdant (and the loli I mentioned earlier), ends up replicating the lifestyle of a NEET out of adoration of Shinichi and otaku culture. In the penultimate episode, anime has effectively become Erdrant\'s version of crack, with the people clamoring for more and more as time goes on, and the government handing out less and less.Aaaaaaand I\'m gonna stop right there. If this sounds interesting at all, then stop reading and go watch the show. I\'m about to get into major spoiler territory, and I might get a bit philosophical in the process, so if you\'re cool with that, then by all means, stay with me.The big reveal at the end is that the whole operation was a ploy by the JSDF to assimilate Erdant into, effectively, another Japan. The plan was to take this entire world with hardly any form of culture of its own, and give it the culture of Japan. It\'s a story of colonialism (there, I said the word, could someone give me an N-word pass?), and also one that parallels the outbreak of the American weeaboo.I\'m an American, born and raised, and I\'d imagine most people reading this review are either also Americans, or at least come from other English-speaking countries (shoutout to the one guy from Ireland reading this garbage). And I\'ve been pretty much surrounded by Japanese stuff my whole life. My oldest memories include watching my dad play Kingdom Hearts 2 and Zelda Twilight Princess, and watching Sonic X and Yugioh on CW4K!DS. Everything I did since the age of two was a step towards otakufication, finally culminating into full weebdom at the age of fifteen. I never stood a chance at a normal life.You look at me, and then you look at those kids. Anime is straight up a school subject. An entire generation is being raised by the culture and customs of foreigners. If you think the generational divide is bad in real life, imagine GenAlpha being raised by...I don\'t know, Austrians. Imagine dealing with that kind of culture shock during every Thanksgiving (or similar holiday). You\'d go insane.And it\'s already kind-of happened.I recently went on my senior trip. I went to Canada with just my grandma. Eight days of me barely talking, because I didn\'t want to disturb my grandma with Japanese nonsense. The only experience she\'s had with anime was trying not to fall asleep watching one of the Pokémon movies with my cousins. Trying to explain even something as simple as Demon Slayer, I was worried, would both exhaust my mouth and her brain. I\'m not saying she\'s dumb, far from it, but we have two completely different minds, separated by two generations and over half a century. Weeb culture wasn\'t even a thought until Nintendo singlehandedly saved the Western video game industry in 1985 with Super Mario Bros.On that note, Super Mario Bros. was the first real game shown in the anime, before even Japan\'s favorite series, Dragon Warrior. It\'s almost like it\'s supposed to mean something. The thing that caused the weeaboo epidemic here also played a role in it over there. It filled a void that desperately need to be filled - good video games here in America, and literally any form of fun activity in Erdant. And by the time we were able to finally fill that void ourselves, we became too dependent on the Land of the Rising Sun to try.That\'s where the final two episodes come in. The most controversial episodes out of the whole show due to their far darker tone, which is also one of the main reasons why they\'re two of my favorite episodes out of the entire isekai genre. That\'s where the bombshell conspiracy was finally laid out, and Shinichi began to fight against it. A few episodes beforehand, it\'s revealed that the kid who has been translating light novels decided to write his own book. A stroke of inspiration, creativity, and most of all, ability, allowed this child to create something new, proving that a thriving culture could, in fact, exist without further intervention from Japan. Shinichi presented this in front of Supreme Leader Petralta, and recommended that the people of Erdant create their own works instead of leeching off of the Islands for everything, which led to the government trying to ""erase"" Shinichi.Of course, say it with me now, ""HIS NEW FWENS CAME AWONG AND SAVED HIM FROM DA EVIW PEEPUW!!1""Even still, after being saved, he still had his contact with Japan cut off, meaning he couldn\'t get or give out any more anime, manga, light novels, or video games. He still, however, continues to spread the good news of otaku culture, just with more emphasis on creating new things.This show feels like it was more directed at us, the international weeaboos, than it was to the Japanese. We have all this entertainment made by our own hands, and yet we choose to consume the creations of the Far East. At times, it almost feels lile it\'s mocking us, with the words ""ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"" being plastered in numerous spots. Not only is it a fairly ominous message on its own, but it was once the biggest meme on the English-speaking internet, and one that only exists due to the difficulty of translating Japanese to English. When was the last time you watched Rick and Morty? Read Batman? Played GTA? Been a while, hasn\'t it? Now, what about this season\'s isekai? Or the latest chapter of My Hero Academia? Or Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Probably far more recently.During this year\'s 4th of July, I spent much of the day playing Final Fantasy 1, a Japanese video game, and on top of that, I imported it from Hong Kong.

And by the time we were able to finally fill that void ourselves, we became too dependent on the Land of the Rising Sun to try.That\'s where the final two episodes come in. The most controversial episodes out of the whole show due to their far darker tone, which is also one of the main reasons why they\'re two of my favorite episodes out of the entire isekai genre. That\'s where the bombshell conspiracy was finally laid out, and Shinichi began to fight against it. A few episodes beforehand, it\'s revealed that the kid who has been translating light novels decided to write his own book. A stroke of inspiration, creativity, and most of all, ability, allowed this child to create something new, proving that a thriving culture could, in fact, exist without further intervention from Japan. Shinichi presented this in front of Supreme Leader Petralta, and recommended that the people of Erdant create their own works instead of leeching off of the Islands for everything, which led to the government trying to ""erase"" Shinichi.Of course, say it with me now, ""HIS NEW FWENS CAME AWONG AND SAVED HIM FROM DA EVIW PEEPUW!!1""Even still, after being saved, he still had his contact with Japan cut off, meaning he couldn\'t get or give out any more anime, manga, light novels, or video games. He still, however, continues to spread the good news of otaku culture, just with more emphasis on creating new things.This show feels like it was more directed at us, the international weeaboos, than it was to the Japanese. We have all this entertainment made by our own hands, and yet we choose to consume the creations of the Far East. At times, it almost feels lile it\'s mocking us, with the words ""ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"" being plastered in numerous spots. Not only is it a fairly ominous message on its own, but it was once the biggest meme on the English-speaking internet, and one that only exists due to the difficulty of translating Japanese to English. When was the last time you watched Rick and Morty? Read Batman? Played GTA? Been a while, hasn\'t it? Now, what about this season\'s isekai? Or the latest chapter of My Hero Academia? Or Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Probably far more recently.During this year\'s 4th of July, I spent much of the day playing Final Fantasy 1, a Japanese video game, and on top of that, I imported it from Hong Kong. I call myself a patriot, and yet even on my country\'s birthday, I can\'t resist the urge to enjoy foreign media.Who am I?Who are you?Where do we belong?Do we belong anywhere?Story - 10/10Art - 8/10Characters - 9/10Sound - 8/10Enjoyment - 9/10Total - 9/10', ""I'll be real, the story really isn't that good, but it's good enough for a comedic anime.

What I mean by this is that this anime has a clear goal of what it wants to be. This anime is not only pretty much a parody of common anime and its tropes and is self-aware, but also acts as a callout. The entirety of this anime is pretty much a callout post on anime, manga, games, and its fanbase and communities. Of course, it's all in pure fun and games.From the very beginning, you can already tell what anime this wants to be. There isn't much story in this, as it is mostly just all fun,...but the story that is there is pretty dull. The idea of an otaku shut-in, or hikikomori, being sent to another world in order to spread otaku culture is something so strange and bizarre that only Japan would think of it. This results in entertaining situations within the anime, while simultaneously pointing it all out to the viewer. The little story there isn't bad per se, but I feel like there could have been more done with it.Characters are all entertaining and are this anime's strong point. The characters are all lovable, and you are bound to find one or two that you really like (my personal favorites are Shinichi and Elba). They all contrast each other but work perfectly with one another. You can really see growth within each one, which is hard to portray in these types of anime.The animation is what you'd expect. Nothing phenomenal, but nothing horrible. Sometimes the faces look a bit weird, but that's because of its style so it's something I have to get used to.Overall, a fun and entertaining anime. The number of parodies, references, and call-outs is insane. There are even some scenes where there are some recognizable anime characters such as Hatsune Miku and Doraemon that are just recolored, which I find to be hilarious. An entertaining anime to watch to pass the time. but the story that is there is pretty dull.

And I think that\'s it\'s mostly because people either don\'t know or they forget that it\'s more of a isekai parody anime and an actual isekai. Even MAL has the Parody tag attached to it. It\'s definitely not a great anime by any standard but at the same time it isn\'t awful, if you have a decent sense of humor and are open minded when it comes to anime then I\'m sure you will find some enjoyment in this anime.Story - 7/10...- the story isn\'t your standard isekai seeing how it\'s possible for the MC to travel between worlds pretty much anytime he wants so in my opinion that makes it not quite an isekai. The story is about Shinichi who basically lives at home doing nothing and one day he fills out an online questionnaire and is the only person to score a perfect 100% which qualified him for a new job. At the interview he gets drugged and wakes up in a fantasy world that the government of Japan had made contact with when they discovered a ""portal"" in the Sea of Trees at the base of Mt.Fuji. The Japanese government is trying to improve relations by introducing ""Otaku Culture"" to the residents of the country they made contact with in the new fantasy world and because Shinichi was basically a NEET and knows a lot about Otaku Culture, they made him the Foreign Minister. Spoiler, the Japanese government was up to some sketchy stuff but I won\'t go into the details. Honestly it has a semi decent plot and story, the writing is acceptable and it has some very funny moments especially if you understand the cultural references.Art - 6/10 - if I had written this review before watching other anime like AOT and Demon Slayer, I might have given this category a slightly higher rating but because I have opened my range of anime categories that I watch and seen more stylized animation or just plain good animation that either doesn\'t use the help of CG of if they do use it, they actually know how to integrate it into the hand drawn animation seamlessly. Unfortunately Outbreak Company isn\'t the type of anime that has over the top fight scenes or scenes that pull the emotional rip cords and really didn\'t need any crazy animation. But it would have benefited from a few little changes, like the the characters facial expressions and the colors of the scenery could have used some pop.Sound - 5/10 - the sound for this anime is probably it\'s weakest point, the intro and outro are fairly generic and sounded like a lot of other anime. In my opinion the sound in an anime should always sound somewhat original, especially the OC and EC. The SFX were not much better but overall didn\'t take anything away from the final product.Characters - 6/10 - honestly I don\'t really have much to say about the characters other than the fact that they\'re designs were pretty generic and bland. But I partially think that it was done on purpose seeing how it\'s an actual parody or other isekai anime so it makes sense somewhat. Although the fact that it\'s a parody doesn\'t mean there can\'t be any originality involved. The voice acting was decent in my opinion, lately I\'ve been watching anime in both original Japanese and English Dubs mostly for going back and watching anime I have seen before to get a different impression on the anime. I enjoyed the English dub for this anime more, and a lot of anime fans probably hate me for this too but I prefer English Dubs rather than the original Japanese for most anime. Especially the more action orientated anime because in my case I sometimes find myself missing a lot of stuff when my eyes have to jump back and forth between the subtitles and the action because a lot of anime action scenes have quite abit of dialogue, which I enjoy.Enjoyment - 7/10 - I actually enjoyed this anime, I may receive some hate for that but I don\'t really care. Sometimes I like to sit back and ingest a little indica and turn off my brain for awhile and enjoy something that doesn\'t require a lot of brain power or doesn\'t effect my emotions to the point I feel like railing my remote through my t.v. screen. I don\'t know if it\'s because I\'m empathetic or because I care about anime but sometimes when I watch something crazier along the lines of AOT or Death Note, if I\'m not in the proper frame of mind before I start watching then by time I\'m done I feel drained not only physically but also mentally. When this happens to me, I find it really hard to finish watching that particular anime then I end up having to take a break from it and when I eventually make my way back I have to start it from the beginning and go through it all again because I\'m the type of person that when I start watching an anime I have to watch it from start to end with no other anime in between because I feel it throws me off. That\'s possibly why I haven\'t started watching any anime that is longer than 50 episodes or so, also everytime a new season comes out I have to watch from the start again also and that\'s why I\'ve started watching anime that\'s done or on its final season.Overall - 6.5/10 - I wish MAL went back to the old way of rating anime that was where each category of an anime can be rated and explained in detail. That\'s why I still do my reviews in this format. Also Overall is the only category I give point ratings too. For Outbreak Company I just couldn\'t give it a ""Good"" rating and it was slightly better than just being ""Fine"" so I gave it a 6.5. It has a decent amount of character building and not a lot of world building, we only hear of one other country other than the one where the MC is but that might have changed if a 2nd season was approved. For now if you enjoyed the anime and want more plot then I suggest checking out the Light Novel which has plenty of content. If the read my entire review than I applaud you and thank you also, I know that a few sections turned a little ""Rant Like"" but if you\'ve read any of my other reviews they tend to lean that way. But I\'m trying to improve and I hope you enjoy them seeing that\'s basically the reason I\'m writing these, well also to review an anime I\'ve watched but that\'s kind of secondary lolz. - the story isn\'t your standard isekai seeing how it\'s possible for the MC to travel between worlds pretty much anytime he wants so in my opinion that makes it not quite an isekai.

Part of the fun of Penguindrum is the slow descent into the story and detailed build-up followed by the satisfying pay-off, but these movies go at an absolutely breakneck speed the entire way through.

Belonging... Love... these are all things Mawaru Penguindrum addresses, and it does so expertly, albeit in not the most easily digestible manner. Penguindrum is an incredibly deep and complex series. It makes heavy use of symbolism and metaphors that are not easily noticeable nor understood. If one makes an effort to try and understand it, Mawaru Penguindrum is an exceptionally impactful series. This effort to try and understand Mawaru Penguindrum will likely require more than one watch of the series-- and this is where Re:cycle of the Penguindrum comes into play.

With this in mind, I recommend Re:cycle of the Penguindrum to people who fall into one the following categories:- Watched the original Mawaru Penguindrum but did not understand it, and want to try again without dedicating time to a full 24 episode series- Have already watched Mawaru Penguindrum a long time ago and want a (comparatively) quick refresher of the series- Loved the original series and want to see new scenes (mostly featuring a character by the name of Momoka) and/or listen to the new insert songsRe:cycle of Penguindrum features the same marvelous yet perplexing story as the original that is very much worth experiencing; with the characters tying it all together.

Rewrite 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34126/Rewrite_2nd_Season,"['I honestly can’t believe how few people enjoyed this anime. Well, I enjoyed it so let me tell you why:This series starts where the first one left off and continues to follow Kotarou after the events at the end of the first season. The second season is, by far, much better than the first, but you need to watch the first to get the context of the second. The first slightly gave off a “harem” vibe to it, but it actually wasn’t one. I can totally see why people wouldn’t like it. However, the second focuses more on the relationship between Kotarou, Kagari, and an...entirely new set of mains other than those two. I won’t spoil any of the new details, but the series follows a much older kotarou and also gets pretty realistic and dark. Also, I laughed pretty damn hard when it suddenly became “James Bond” the anime. The ending was pretty touching, but it felt super rushed.(Summary at the end)Story: 8/10Rewrite S2 is an anime that takes you on a journey with Kotarou. The story follows Kotarou as he makes some hard “main protagonist” decisions, grows closer to Kagari, and lives a new life after the world ends in season one. Some of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the season were his relationship with Kagari in an world with only the two of them, the philosophical discussion of existence, and his compassion towards various children with sad circumstances. The story actually draws you in if you can empathize with his back story. In this season, he\'s loner and outcast who has the power to control his blood and he slays random small monsters as a kid while calling himself a ""hero"" or something similar. He eventually makes the hard decision to leave home and set out on a journey to become stronger and faces many tragedies in various war zones, which causes him to mature into James Bond triple solo agent of sorts (watch the anime to see what I mean by that).The story itself was actually great, but a different studio probably could have presented it better. I think the pacing was kind of weird and some things could have been examined further. It occasionally felt like they were rushing through some scenes.Additionally, I’m often told that the visual novel is much better, and I believe the people who told me that. However, having not played the game, I feel that this series is definitely not a “bad” anime. It’s been awhile since an anime has taken me on a journey with a main protagonist as he makes decisions that could have an impact on the entire world’s future. The story itself was great and well thought out, but the presentation could have been much better.Art:6/10The art is both good AND bad at the same time. The background art and effects are pretty high quality, but the 3DCG monsters did not blend at all.  The action was “meh”. Sometimes the animation felt really awkward, but there were also certain scenes that felt magical and eye-catching to me. Other times it felt like a low budget studio’s anime. Mixed feelings about the art. Same as season one.Sound:8.5/10The OST in this series is great and there are quite a few that I could listen to outside of this anime. The opening theme fit, but it wasn’t anything too special. However, the ending theme was actually relatively stunning. It reminded me of a music video that tells a story.I also enjoyed Kotarou’s voice because it sounded pleasing to the ears and almost poetic. The characters were all voiced pretty well in general, and all of the background noises/sounds fit as well.Character:7/10The characters weren\'t particularly unique. The characters all seemed pretty archetypal, except for Kagari, who was my favorite from this series. I would actually say that the characters in the series received a really large amount of development. From season one to season two, you could really get a sense of the personalities of the characters as they slowly introduced the new characters.While the characters themselves were\'t especially unique, the amount of development that they received helped create a truly unique experience in this anime. I think the character development was spectacular and is one of this series\' more defining traits; especially the development of Kotarou. The amount of development in this series allowed me to bump the character section from a six to a seven.Enjoyment: 8/10I thought this series was actually really enjoyable, so I was pretty shocked to see that so many people didn\'t enjoy the series as much as I had. There really aren\'t any other stories out there like this and if the 3DCG blended better, this could\'ve been something even more interesting.Overall:7.5/10This series was definitely something worth watching. I don’t regret watching it at all. We see Kotarou in a new setting, in a different age group, growing closer to Kagari, and becoming James Bond. He’s mainly a lone wolf in this season and the story is unlike any anime that I\'ve watched before.Would I recommend this to you:Well, it’s really not for everybody but if you saw season one, you might as well see it through to the end. Otherwise, I think this appeals mostly to sci-fi, harem, romance, shounen lovers. It also has a small amount of philosophical concepts in it, if that\'s your kinky turn on. entirely new set of mains other than those two.

I...found Season 1 t o be quite boring with a cliche story and i still do . I only watched season 1 so i could watch season 2.The first thing you have to understand about season 1 is that this is not a harem , the first impression i got from episode 1 was that this was a harem and since i don\'t like them (same bullshit every time the MC never realizes that the girls like him even if they are naked in from of him and screaming ""fu** me"") this is not the case , the only reason their are so many girls its because this is base on a game where you can end with different girls but this anime does not focus on romance so much so i don\'t this consider this a harem more like a guy is friend with 5 girls .With that said  i can confirm that season 1 deserves to get a 6 but hardly unwatchable if you want something to watch this might just do it.Now lets talk about season 2! This was a clear improvement in the story line , without showing any spoilers is hard to explain why season 2 was better since the first 3 episodes are pretty slow but you get a greater understanding of the story and it hard to explain them without spoilers .i think you should give rewrite a try. Even doe as i said season 1 was not the best but its hardly unwatchable , boring and predictable but its worth watch so you can understand season 2.Personally season 2 is great and i never tough i would say this but i\'m dying to know what happens on episode 6 and they didn\'t even ended on a cliff hanger!What is rare , most animes / series always end with a cliff hanger to make you want more,  this one manage to make me want to know more without a cliff hanger for that reason alone i believe this anime deserves an 7.6 almost an 8. found Season 1 t o be quite boring with a cliche story and i still do .

A rewrite.  (Yes, I know that joke has been done to death already, but it's still fun to use.)  Rewrite is a much anticipated adaptation of one of Key's most well-known visual novels that had mixed results.  Its poor and attempts to compact the source material while trying to finish off its story with an anime original ending created polarizing feedback from those who watched it.  So, for its second season, 8bit took another shot at the series and well...had about as much success as 8bit would have for these kinds of things.Story:...To summarize, Rewrite follows the story of Tennouji Koutarou and his quest to save the earth by aiding the Key, named Kagari, in her quest to understand humanity and save the world from its attempt at restarting itself.  While doing this, Koutarou must fight the two factions known as Guardian and Gaia from 'saving humanity', which their methods entail destroying the Key and destroying the world respectively.Rewrite is a very dense visual novel.  Featuring 9 different routes, each of which hold a fraction of the overall story, it's no wonder where the problems of the series lie when trying to adapt roughly 100 hours of gameplay and textboxes in a grand total of 24 episodes over the course of two seasons.  Focusing exclusively on the last two routes of the game, Moon and Terra, this season of Rewrite fixes a large portion of the problems the first season had, but also has similar pitfalls and wavers in quality in different ways.As far as content goes, Key's doing what Key does best, and that's romantic visual novels that have a story pertaining to one individual learning about the world/themselves, usually with magic involved, while providing an overarching lesson to the player for them to think about once they're done with the game.  Contrary to the first season, Moon/Terra feel a lot more concise and focused because it didn't have to do the background work that its predecessor had to fulfill.  The entire runtime focuses solely on Koutarou and his growth on what he's trying to do in order to save the world, and while it does get a little messy at times, is something that's much better written than anything it was before.  The plot gets a lot more serious, a lot of the pieces start falling into place better, and it's just overall a better story.  That however doesn't say very much because being better in context to its previous season isn't a very high mark to surpass.The biggest problem that stands out to me for Moon and Terra at the beginning is context and continuity.  The anime thrusts the viewer in an unfamiliar scene and setting that, when continuing on from season 1, doesn't really click right away.  Indeed, the series is beginning a new route, and thus a new story, but from the perspective of someone who hasn't played the visual novel and is going into the new season blind, this break in continuity hurts more than helps.Another thing that doesn't help is pacing.  Dense content, small time frame, pacing issues ensue.  A lot of what this season is about is both personal and public conflict from either Koutarou or the rivaling factions.  But due to how much conflict they need to show in order to get to the end properly, a lot of it feels meaningless.  A character you learn/get to know about may be introduced in one episode then offed the next.  There may be a dramatic showdown between two characters that have history with one another that ends in a flash before moving onto the next scene.  The lack of proper pacing doesn't give the viewer time to let a person's death or a tragic event sink in, and that creates a lot less value in whatever trials may ensue.  This problem plagues the whole show, and is even more so shown in the end of the series once again where it's clear that they were trying to show end by making scene after scene go by at a snap's notice.Overall, Rewrite's story is another case of an adaptation that bit off more than it could chew.  The sheer amount of content that needed to be told in such a small time frame muddled the story's philosophies about humanity and our place in this world and cut away a large majority of the story without much return.  I really saw the potential for redemption in this second season, but there honestly isn't much I can say when it's clear that what was shown was only a fraction of the whole story.Overview:+ Interesting story/philosophies-  Hard break from the end of S1-  Some of the worst pacing I've seen (even by 8bit standards)-  Still difficult to understand for those who haven't played the visual novelCharacters:  Characters take a dramatic shift in Moon/Terra.  They take such a dramatic shift that it makes my job a lot easier since because everyone but the MC is a side character.Tennouji Koutarou.  The player character.  The MC.  The arbiter of the world who has lived through 9 different routes.  Koutarou's character is the defining trait of Moon/Terra.  Rather than focusing on the individual girls and largely the conflict between Guardian and Gaia, Koutarou takes up almost all of the series's runtime due to the sole fact that the entire series is told through internal monologue.  We understand a lot more about Koutarou's thoughts and understand his actions a little more by hearing how he thinks, and this dramatic change in how the series writes itself in turn makes his struggle and his motivation a lot more personal and in-depth.  However, he still suffers the same pitfalls as the story.  Due to his character being so dense, the pacing made him feel incomplete, as a large portion of his decisions at the end of the series could come up to question.  He's better, but there's still something missing.  And the explanation as to why his powers work they way they do still aren't explained.  Koutarou has definitely improved, but he's still far from being the complete character that he should be.The rest of the cast, yes, the literal rest of the characters are all side characters that serve as wrenches to Koutarou's plans, characters who help influence Koutarou, or those who've watched the previous season will become familiar with.  As far as they're concerned, they only help to move the story along.  They're no longer a part of the main cast and have no real weight in the situation aside from being the puppeteers who help dictate what Koutarou will do in any given situation.  They help shape the story, and that's a role they do very well.  Beyond that however leaves a lot to be desired.Overview:+/- Koutarou is a lot better of a character (though not as good as he probably should be.)+/- Side cast isn't impactful character-wise, but impactful story-wiseArt: 8bit comes again and mimics the Key style very well.  Using the same style that they did in the first season, Rewrite comes back with a mix of Key's normal style with a touch of CGI in order to make those monsters feel like they seriously don't belong in this series.Art looks like Key's, CGI is still kinda jarring to look at, animation for the fight scenes are semi-fluid, and the quality is standard fare.  Nothing really spectacular, but nothing that looks terrible either.Overview:+/- Decent art-  Stop using CGI.  It looks awful.Sound:  While Key works usually have great, memorable OSTs to coincide with their works, Rewrite doesn't really have the same feel.  Admittedly the tracks aren't pushovers, and Terra's OP in particular has the sense of urgency that coincides with Koutarou's journey to try and fulfill his duty.  They're just not anything that I would regard as a memorable track that I could listen to on repeat.Personal Enjoyment: I'm a firm believer that you don't need to read or know about the source material before watching an adaptation.  An adaptation should be able to stand on its own merits, and should instead be another medium that you can watch the story through.  As someone who went into Rewrite's adaptation blind, I can safely say that I have no idea what the fuck is going on.  I had to do my own research of the story in order to get any handle as to what in god's name I was watching, and doing that entails that the adaptation didn't adapt the source material correctly, and in my eyes, is considered as a failed adaptation.Did I like this anime?I didn't like it.  While I admit the content was good and Key's adaptations are things that I'm a fan of, its piss poor pacing ruined any form of enjoyment that I may have had from this anime.What didn't I like about it?Pacing.  Damn you pacing!  Aside from that, I'm not really a big fan of Gaia's ultimate plan because it really doesn't make any sense.  Saving the world by offing humanity, and there are many, MANY people who are ok with that concept/idea.  That doesn't really make sense to me.Would I recommend this anime?Honestly, I can't see myself recommending this to people, even if they've played the visual novel.  The pacing screws up a lot of its content that I honestly feel like the show could use more than a few passes on how the story should be executed.

It may be a joke that Rewrite needs a rewrite, but there are so many problems with it that it honestly could really use one."", ""The second season of rewrite is definitely more coherent and flows better than the first season.  I don't think it deserves a better score overall though.The story revolves around Kotarou as he learns how to utilize his rewrite power more effectively while also working with the Key, Kagari, to try and prevent the world from being destroyed.  He does this while being  apart of both Guardian and Gaia throughout the episodes.  I should mention that the battles at the end were kind of a let down.  The ending (spoiler) still has the world being destroyed like season 1, but the...final battles are not as good; almost all of the action is cut out and all but one or two fights don't even show Kotarou dealing the final blow.The art is about the same as the first season, maybe a little better.  I like the backgrounds and I didn't find any major design flaws besides the fact that most of the monsters still seem to be animated using 3d cgi.The sound is still good within the show as well, but it's not really memorable.The only characters that get more development here are Kotarou, Kagari, and Kotori.  Every other character from the main crowd in season 1 is only shown like 2-3 times at max for minor things.  They are first shown through flashbacks and later just as young kids.I  enjoyed this season though, despite the flaws.  I think the ending fight wasn't as good/well done, the sound and art didn't improve much, but every other aspect seemed better.  I don't think the show averages out to be more than a 7/10 still, even though a few of the areas improved.  There's still some things that could've been added and if they were it would've been an 8/10 for me, like actually showing the final blow being dealt in one of the final fights in episode 11 (you'll know what fight I mean if you watch the episode), since there was enough build up for it and it just fell flat.  I'd say give it a shot despite its shortcoming, but don't expect it be any more than just good. final battles are not as good; almost all of the action is cut out and all but one or two fights don't even show Kotarou dealing the final blow.The art is about the same as the first season, maybe a little better.

I think the ending fight wasn't as good/well done, the sound and art didn't improve much, but every other aspect seemed better.  I don't think the show averages out to be more than a 7/10 still, even though a few of the areas improved.  There's still some things that could've been added and if they were it would've been an 8/10 for me, like actually showing the final blow being dealt in one of the final fights in episode 11 (you'll know what fight I mean if you watch the episode), since there was enough build up for it and it just fell flat.  I'd say give it a shot despite its shortcoming, but don't expect it be any more than just good."", ""This is a massive improvement from first season. I didn't expect this to improve that much to be honest, and, while still has many flaws, shows how an anime studio can learn, even if it's just a bit, from its mistakes.Disclaimer: I didn't played the VN so i'll review this, as i did with the first season, as an anime-only viewer.The story adapts the Moon and Terra routes from the VN and because of that this season is clearly split in two parts: Moon route (3 episodes) and Terra route (8 episodes)The Moon route is rather confusing at first showing as memories a lot of...scenes from previous rutes that i didn't know because the first season adaptation was total bullshit. Because of that, i didn't care about the main heroines and anything related to them because they are barely developed in the first season, but still act as we know things about them. Fortunately, the entire show focus around the relationship of Kotarou and Kagari which were the only characters worth something in S1, both in Moon and Terra routes, despite being very different each other, while still related.Moon was very short and its last episode felt again extremely rushed again forbiding the arc to have a pleasant ending after the first 2 good episodes. However, in Terra finally Rewrite fixes its incredible problem with the pacing. The pacing is smooth and enjoyable, being the entire arc pretty solid with an interesting development by Kotarou, who was a pretty lame and childish character in S1. Plus, the fact the main heroines not being present in the plot avoids major plot holes to the arc, that has a just fine ending which is appreciated in a series with such a complex thematic like Rewrite.However, Terra is not flawless. Some secondary characters felt like they have a major character arc but they left it absolutely incomplete. Also, some pacing problems to explain some things are present too. These flaws are present during all the series but they are not as blatant as in S1, thankfully.The character focus in this S2 is Kotarou in almost its entirety. He was a pretty beta VN main character in S1 but the pathos presented in the Terra arc made him an at least bidimensional character who makes appropiate decisions (and i'm not talking about his power). His behavior is believable too, being a grown and mature character which is rare in an anime of this kind and even in anime nowadays. Not perfect, but hey.The animation is average to good. The CGI is very bad and action scenes can feel anti-climatic because of that but 2D animations is just fine, like first season, maybe a bit better. The sound is good, with the soundtrack and seiyuu's perfomance being quite nice. Nothing wrong with that.Overall, Rewrite 2nd Season learnt from its predecessor. Maybe it's because they are straightforward  routes, maybe because they are just better routes, or maybe they are just better adapted. No incredibly well adapted, but the pacing is WAY better. And this alone can make this show potable by its own. scenes from previous rutes that i didn't know because the first season adaptation was total bullshit.

Honestly I should say that the first season is not that good lol or should I say it's one of the worst anime series Ive ever seen. The story, the sound, the character, almost all of them umm... nothing good? I think the only thing that actually good in that first seasone is um, art?? lol Well I dont want to talk about the first season that much in here since...this review is about the second season, not the first one.So about the second season, I must admit it that this second season they really made some improvement with the story lol. For the first 1-3 episodes it will be like meh but for the next 4-8 episodes the story got a little bit tense and I think it's not that bad. This second season was actually way better than the first ( well at least the first 8 episodes was good. I dont know if they will mess up with the ending or not lol) and for now I think this first 8 episodes deserves at least 7-8 scores. But seriously I think the only thing that they should change is about the music. There is actually no difference between the music in the first and this second season. I mean the ost or the bgm might be fit for some situation but its not that memorable.  Its just like putting some random ost that fit with the situation and then thats it. Seriously everytime I watch this series, I skipped all the OP and the ED except for the first episode, just to hear it for the first time and then I skipped it in the next episode lol. For me  is not that good enough that will makes everyone remember it in their mind or even looking for it on youtube lol. but out of it, this anime deserve a second chance for the story itself. this review is about the second season, not the first one.So about the second season, I must admit it that this second season they really made some improvement with the story lol.

I'll be blunt: it is probably the WORST ADAPTATION I've ever seen, all media accounted.When I discovered Rewrite, I didn't want to read the VN (way too long), so I tried the anime. From the very first episode, I could see something was wrong. Even without knowing the source material.That's how bad it is.STORY...Before I talk about the anime, I have to explain the VN.- Rewrite has no less than SEVEN parallel stories.- These stories are all completely different from one another.- The VN is one of the longest even today (it's as long as Fate/Stay Night). You can count more than 100 hours worth reading.What about the anime? Well, it has 2 seasons of 13 episodes. Do I really need to explain what went wrong? They tried to blend ALL THOSE STORIES into a SINGLE SHORT SERIES.Cherry on the cake: the writers, as if they didn't have enough material to adapt, decided they should make the first season as an EIGHTH storyline, including new content.The result is a total, utter failure. The entire series is rushed, so none of the scenes have the impact it had in the VN, none of the characters have the depth they had in the VN, and the storyline barely makes any sense because it lacks a lot of explanations from the VN!ARTMeh. Some things they did right, some things they did wrong.I like the chara-design. It's way too simple compared to the VN, but I can forgive that.I like the openings and endings, the editing is cool.Some visual effects are nice.For the rest...Everything is way too bright. Rewrite is one of those anime where the lighting is totally screwed up. It's always all white, like they're in heaven or something.Because of that, the colors always look too pale, not vibrant enough.The animation is average. Not terrible, not terrific. Some fights are cool.There's a lot of bad CGI, especially the monsters.SOUNDSame OST as the VN, and it's terrific! The anime even has some new tracks, which are great.Sadly, because all the scenes are rushed, the OST loses the impact it had in the VN.A music can be memorable because of the scene it's used in, but the opposite is also true: if the scenes are poorly handled, the music can lose its charm.That's exactly what happened here. The OST loses its impact and its charm. Just like everything else in this anime...For the rest, the seiyuus are great (the same as the VN).CHARACTERThe characters are always the center of a Key Studio story. Rewrite is no exception. While the original characters are deep and complex, their anime versions lose all that.Most of the characters stories are thrown away, and even the parts they used in the anime lose their depth.As a result, the crew can seem stereotypical, one-dimensional, empty, useless, uninteresting.ENJOYMENTAVOID THIS ANIME AT ALL COST!!!If you're interested in Rewrite, you should read the Visual Novel, even if you don't like this medium.

Even trash anime has some appeal to it but this was straight up unbearable. Here's why I didn't like this anime at all......The protagonist was pathetic. I liked the first season because of the way the protagonist acted. But this season he was completely different. I hated his screaming and crying. I hated his edgy behavior.The story sucked big times. The writer definitely could have done a better job of explaining things. I got the gist of it but the...way it was presented was horrible.

This is especially important as it allowed the viewers to empathize with him, which in turn affect how we feel about his choices and personality.- The storyline is definitely unique and gives a time-travel/alternative dimension feel. The ""what-if"" situation is quite a special treat for me as I can\'t help wondering how the next event would unfold.

There is a complete difference between letting the answer unfold than leaving it unanswered. Too many countless time I was left wondering WTF did they just talk about and how it actually works.

I dont have much comment about the story it tells about, i just say it just typical KEY works, like angel beats, clanad, charlotte and stuff. just like what my friends told me ""HAPPY IN THE BEGINNING,CRY IN THE END"". and unfortunately i dont even cry. (i just regret to watch this).About the 2nd Season, in the very beginning (around episode 1 and 2) it was just like the summary about all of other ending route on the game itself. the rest story is about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro) doing some rewrite the story by play role as histrueself to not being coma for 10 years after get stabbed by KEY, and his jorney to rewrite the whole rewrite story has begun.the art 6, i dont know why this anime it just like 8bit doesnt give their best on rewrite, because on the past, 8bit give their best in grisaria series that was adaptation from VN (Visual Novel) too. it just like HELL, is this really 8bit works?sound 7, the opening music was good i never skip the first opening, but i almost skipped the 2nd and 3rd opening about the ending theme, i dont remember how it sounded.SPOILER ALERTin 1st opening theme, there a scene that tell us everything about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro)6 point for character....for the main protagonist, everything that i watch in the very beginning it was not his true self but it will be revealed in the 2nd season, so i dont give more spoiller more than this.for Chizuru, she is pretty cute little girl that u want to protect her, but she doesnt need your protection, because she can cure herself from any psyhical wound and not just that, she can do more than you can imagine.for Kotori, she is typical childhood friend (even she wasnt childhood friend for the main hero at all). you will see how the progress of her role as childhood friend in the story.for Lucia, a class rep that had a lot of issue about her past and her power. (uhh, i cant describe more than this, if i goes on it just give you spoiler).for Akane, she is the president of the school\'s occult research society and she is 1 year older than the other heroine.(i dont know much about akane).for Chihaya, a mysterious transfer student that Akane acquaintance.

(she had really strong power, so dont mess up with her).the last Kagari, how does it call? a goddess? a mother of earth? no.The right phrase is KEY. the creator of the game itself!! hahaahhahashit, she look like a ordinary kids but despite of that, she has the power to destroy all intelligent life on Earth. But i dont really understand what her job in this story at all. if her job is just destroy all intelligent life on Earth, then fuck it.. just kill it already, even at the end, earth will be destroyed after allEnjoyment 5.. i really enjoy about the story, but it was changed in the middle of show, and the ending ruin it, and the 2nd season ending doesnt cure my stresses about the story, i just give it 5 because i just like the beginning of story, the rest of story give me more stresses.Overall 7, the whole story in first season quite enoyable, the comedy. the romance, the school activity, the action, the drama, everything was good, but the last episode stab me right in the back bone. the second season..... i dont know why anime from visual novel adaptation need a second season? to give a better ending? to giving more explanation for some unsolved problem? but at least i enjoy the show (evenl the story give me a headche)i wish  i can rewrite my memories about rewrite 1st season by wacthing 2 season of rewrite. but it doesnt rewrite anything just writting more stresses on my head....but i will rewrite my memories i fast as possible by rewatching another anime, or hearing a ton of music.maybe my review is unacceptable and to many point that make you guys ever ask WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT IS ALL ABOUT? or even you guys doesnt get my point, that because i\'ve never write any review before. so this is all that i can do for my first review.REMEMBER this review is about both season of the series. secret agent (are they government secret agents?) and it was about that. I dont have much comment about the story it tells about, i just say it just typical KEY works, like angel beats, clanad, charlotte and stuff. just like what my friends told me ""HAPPY IN THE BEGINNING,CRY IN THE END"". and unfortunately i dont even cry. (i just regret to watch this).About the 2nd Season, in the very beginning (around episode 1 and 2) it was just like the summary about all of other ending route on the game itself. the rest story is about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro) doing some rewrite the story by play role as histrueself to not being coma for 10 years after get stabbed by KEY, and his jorney to rewrite the whole rewrite story has begun.the art 6, i dont know why this anime it just like 8bit doesnt give their best on rewrite, because on the past, 8bit give their best in grisaria series that was adaptation from VN (Visual Novel) too. it just like HELL, is this really 8bit works?sound 7, the opening music was good i never skip the first opening, but i almost skipped the 2nd and 3rd opening about the ending theme, i dont remember how it sounded.SPOILER ALERTin 1st opening theme, there a scene that tell us everything about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro)6 point for character....for the main protagonist, everything that i watch in the very beginning it was not his true self but it will be revealed in the 2nd season, so i dont give more spoiller more than this.for Chizuru, she is pretty cute little girl that u want to protect her, but she doesnt need your protection, because she can cure herself from any psyhical wound and not just that, she can do more than you can imagine.for Kotori, she is typical childhood friend (even she wasnt childhood friend for the main hero at all). you will see how the progress of her role as childhood friend in the story.for Lucia, a class rep that had a lot of issue about her past and her power. (uhh, i cant describe more than this, if i goes on it just give you spoiler).for Akane, she is the president of the school\'s occult research society and she is 1 year older than the other heroine.(i dont know much about akane).for Chihaya, a mysterious transfer student that Akane acquaintance. She is a clumsy girl who has trouble honestly showing her feelings and has led a sheltered life causing her to know little about the world.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SEASON 1 AND 2! beautiful manner. and then we see probably one of the best ending along with one of the most plain endings ive ever seen. if it wasnt for my inner fanboy and inner need for love the ending would of been bad and corny. im glade it ended the way it did but it could of ended so much better. however it could of ended soooo much worse due to the great story and good ending that didnt leave me wanting more or pissed off the way it ended it ranks very high im my book.

Anyway, i just can't stay in my place when looking this fail.that's what i really want to say here:Story 5/10:The story is very complicated to be understand or let's say, i can't understand it at all. The VN is better than the animation. I have to agree with that. Looks like they are rushing the story very very very very very much.

Like the hair shadow... . The world detail was just fine.Sound 9/10:This is what i love about the anime. The soundtrack is very well made. The music giving the nice image for the anime. The opening is what i like the most.Character 7/10:Well... I'm not sure about the character. They all are cute in the novel. But in the anime version... I don't know... it's just looks different.Enjoyment 8/10:As far as I'm watching this anime, i don't caught any problem. It's very fun, the jokes and the others.Overall 7/10:It can be more better. They just have to actually rewrite the story, not following the Novel a hundred percent. The creator too didn't realize it very much i see. It's trying to get every route but then end up with terra route... and that's confusing... simply good. Although there are some parts that need to be fixed. Like the hair shadow... .

The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2 was already waiting for me. Of course that didn\'t lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of...comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1.Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn\'t) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn\'t ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn\'t really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn\'t continue.In short I describe this anime as ""Having a Beautiful Story and Character design."" I\'m guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn\'t reach the mainstream flatform but that\'s okay because this anime is really special comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem.

That's no doubt.In terms of adaptability - quite good. Maybe because both Moon and Terra route are straightforward route and not too long. But honestly speaking, if any VN readers wanted to jump into the anime just to see the animation, just go straight to S2 because s1 had nothing similar that we can talk about. Even I think one should stop and read the VN before getting into S2 because they actually starts with some VN-only content of the first half where you might be confused on. And if you feel shocked with the story progress, don't be. I...have said in S1 that the story is misleading.But anyway, all my complains are either the same or only with S1, so nothing special more on S2 here. But at least this story is more fathomable this season. have said in S1 that the story is misleading.But anyway, all my complains are either the same or only with S1, so nothing special more on S2 here.

I had to look at summary on Wikipedia to fully understand it. Third one is slightly better at first but got worse. Fourth onwards the series gets better until last two. Last two episodes were understandable but it throws character development and logic out in the water. The ending is worse. Kagari dies at the end as kotarou was late to save the world destruction, Again. It completely destroys the need for Kotarou to kill Esaka. He could have killed Kagari at...the beginning as he had to kill her at the end. He betrays everyone, kills his mentor and gamble humanity just to touch Kagari boobs. He becomes a monster at the end. He becomes completely unlikable at the end as he betrays everyone but nothing happens at the end. The art is nice and no problems for me. Sound is good for most of the part. I only enjoyed episodes 4-9 and they are fine. Many are angry as the first and second season were not a harem anime but I didn't mind it. the beginning as he had to kill her at the end.

This is one of those anime's , that you need to watch twice to understand it. In my opnion, this anime however IS NOT worth watching twice. It wasn't interesting enough.The music in the anime was disapointing. Yes, it was...ok. I was rather bothered however to the fact that the same music was in the season 1.The...song in the OP was ok too.

It\'s almost like Kagari is just up there on the moon playing the visual novel and we\'re just seeing the default route before brute forcing all the choices so we move on to the true ending. If you\'ve ever tried to brute force a true ending on a visual novel with lots of choices that don\'t have clear...outcomes you\'ll realize quickly how frustrating it can feel. I think that\'s pretty much what the characters are going through for the first part of this season.Then we get the ""good"" or ""true"" ending route where whenever a choice comes up our protagonist uses all his past iterations memories to pick the right choice, represented in those little flame intersection graphic thingies I don\'t know what to call them. It\'s always fascinating to me how they sometimes manage to work in the VN mechanics of choices and routes into the narrative itself. Anyway the story that plays out when he makes all the correct choices isn\'t necessarily a happy one for most of it. I think what validates the first season and makes that story important is that without it this world he has to live through to get to the good ending would be incredibly bleak. That happy ending wouldn\'t have mattered nearly as much if we didn\'t know all of these characters already and have a good idea of what kind of life he could have if they were all together and the world wasn\'t ending anymore.It\'s a unique story and again the cast of characters are all great and that ending is just so satisfying when it finally comes. 9/10 outcomes you\'ll realize quickly how frustrating it can feel.

Under his works, all the series are dedicated to entertain and educate the children in a very well balanced way,  with good story line and funny or interesting characters. It was made a at a time producers wished the children to have a good time but also to make them think and learn in the...framework of an anime with good artistic value. Very nice combination...this was a success : Millions of children have seen it in the 1980s and 1990s.This one which is the third installment is about the human biology. Main human body functions are addressed all in good mix of science, suspense, comical situations, and original design.All biological entities are anthropomorphized and all the characters of the previous series (about history and space) reprised their role but as neurons, lymphocytes, virus and so on...! Even the wise Maestro is here (guess where?)! The heroes are often the protectors of the body, they even kept their science fiction clothes from the previous series.Story of each episode is really enjoyable and can raise interest among children and adult viewers alike with a good amount of suspense.Regarding the biological aspect, as a medical doctor myself, I confirm that they explain in a very clear and entertaining way all the essential mechanisms from immunity, to organs functions, brain role, reproduction and even genetics. Everything is scientifically sounds and relevant.Drawing involved artists from Japan and France. Animation done by the Eiken studios (Testujin 28)  is definitely dated but still satisfactory and fluid enough for viewing in the 21th century.

In 2016, all the series benefit from a complete remastered version (color palette improvement, drawing error correction, sounds remaster) to fit the 1080p enhanced edition.Music is classical and its very agreeable and rich melodies fits perfectly the action and are very well composed by Michel Legrand, a famous multi Oscars winner composer.

The travel to the microscopic world begins!', '“Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol” is a Japanese and French co-produced educational 26-episode OVA that covers different aspects of bodily processes, from how various organs function to what happens if you don’t brush your teeth, using kid-friendly characters in easy-to-understand situations. Apparently, this series was quite popular in various parts of the world when it came out, and it seems that there is a lot of nostalgia for it. Watching it as an adult and for the first time, however, I have to say that at least the English dubbed version was a real slog to get through.Each episode is self-contained and focuses on a...different body part or function, but the episodes are arranged in a logical order corresponding to the subject matter, so it’s best to watch them in that order.The characters are confusing. You have a central cast of “kid” characters, “bully” characters and “adult” characters, and some of these have their own forms as white blood cells, viruses, etc. in the body. The “kid” characters will look like they’re around 8 years old in some episodes, and in others they’re closer to 15.The in-body characters appear to be the same for everyone — basically, everyone’s bodies are run by old white guys who sleep on the job half the time, and they have 2 kids that patrol the body in little hover ships, making sure there isn’t any trouble from bacteria or viruses lurking about. And the three main red blood cells, Hemo, Globin and the Professor, seem to be ubiquitous as well. Regarding the Professor, he dies 3 times during the course of the series, only to be shown alive and well like nothing happened in the following episode. So don’t expect any consistency from this anime.The depictions of various bodily processes are interesting, informative and memorable, particularly due to the unique character designs each part of the body has. I especially liked the frog-like macrophages. This anime also does a good job from a public health standpoint, showing what could happen to you if you don’t wash your hands, brush your teeth, get vaccinated, etc. Some of the facts they espouse on the show are outdated, however. For instance, they say that the appendix isn’t important, and they make it seem like it’s easy to fully recover from leukemia.What really makes this show difficult to watch is the dialogue, but this may only be an issue with the English dub. Interactions between characters are stiff and awkward, and often don’t sound like natural conversations. Some of the voices don’t fit the characters well, and voices often don’t match lip movements. Here’s an example quote from the series that shows how bad the writing can be at times: “I love to eat when I’m hungry; don’t you?”Characters also react unrealistically to events they experience. For instance, when a couple of characters break their legs in a fall, they just sit there and laugh, like it’s no big deal.Animation-wise, there’s a lot of recycled animation and a few animation errors, but at least the art is unique. It definitely doesn’t look like a typical anime. There are a few odd sequences, particularly the opening sequence, which shows a naked man and woman hugging each other, and then combining to form a blob as they rise into the sky. A baby then comes down, grows and repeats the process with another naked person.The horn-heavy background music gets grating after a while. It sounds like something that would be more at home in a ‘70s variety show than an ‘80s anime.The ending takes a sharp turn away from all of the educational content delivered up to that point and delves into strictly sci-fi material. Some of the “future history” covered is controversial, such as human experimentation and genetic engineering; they even say that animal-human hybrids were created to “perform menial tasks.”There is, surprisingly, a fair amount of potentially objectionable content in this, although it’s supposed to be a show for kids. Besides the male and female nudity which appears in the opening sequence and in one other episode, we get to see two different kids urinating on a tree, a rather gross depiction of a mosquito bite, and some more injuries and even deaths (both the injuries and deaths are oddly uneventful and anticlimactic, though).Overall, while I wouldn’t say watching ""Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol” was a waste of time, and I feel like I learned something, I can’t say that I enjoyed it. The inconsistencies, awkward dialogue and reactions from the characters, as well as the background music made it difficult to sit through all 26 episodes. And the ending was just odd. Perhaps other versions are better, but I don’t recommend watching the English dub of this. different body part or function, but the episodes are arranged in a logical order corresponding to the subject matter, so it’s best to watch them in that order.The characters are confusing. You have a central cast of “kid” characters, “bully” characters and “adult” characters, and some of these have their own forms as white blood cells, viruses, etc. in the body. The “kid” characters will look like they’re around 8 years old in some episodes, and in others they’re closer to 15.The in-body characters appear to be the same for everyone — basically, everyone’s bodies are run by old white guys who sleep on the job half the time, and they have 2 kids that patrol the body in little hover ships, making sure there isn’t any trouble from bacteria or viruses lurking about. And the three main red blood cells, Hemo, Globin and the Professor, seem to be ubiquitous as well. Regarding the Professor, he dies 3 times during the course of the series, only to be shown alive and well like nothing happened in the following episode. So don’t expect any consistency from this anime.The depictions of various bodily processes are interesting, informative and memorable, particularly due to the unique character designs each part of the body has. I especially liked the frog-like macrophages. This anime also does a good job from a public health standpoint, showing what could happen to you if you don’t wash your hands, brush your teeth, get vaccinated, etc. Some of the facts they espouse on the show are outdated, however. For instance, they say that the appendix isn’t important, and they make it seem like it’s easy to fully recover from leukemia.What really makes this show difficult to watch is the dialogue, but this may only be an issue with the English dub.

Shikabane Hime: Aka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4581/Shikabane_Hime__Aka,"[""Story - 8/10Ok. This series started on the &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; formula, so it may be very misleading. Even the sypnosis that a Shikabane Hime must kill 108 corpses to go to Heaven is misleading. The real plot and story has really nothing to do with it. The truth is, this series does provide a reasonable and interesting plot development in the SECOND half of the season only. And the last four episodes or so does have enough plot to build up decent cliffhangers that forced me to watch the raws and chinese subs (instead of waiting for the english subs because of my impatience). But keep...in mind that there is a second season that follows up directly, so this whole first season gave me the feeling of PREQUEL to the actual story (which turned out decent)Art - 7/10Sometimes, the actions are animated in a pretty sloppy way. The characters' design are sometimes too simplistic.But you may argue that it was done intentionally as a more &quot;stylish&quot; way of animation. The colors are all in the range of grey, dark red, black and deep blue, blending into a nice gloomy atmosphere befit of a horror action series.Sound - 9/10Nice fighting music and nice insert songs, opening songs and ending song by angela. The music is very catchy and the voice acting is not bad. Ouri (main protagonist)'s voice sound pretty unique and has a good touch of innocence and tonelessness, befitting his strange attitude towards death (a key element in the plot)Characters - 8/10I would say the characters are decently developped for an anime series. Ouri's evolution is clearly portrayed throughout the series. Makina's realtionship with Keisei is revealed bits by bits in a very good rythmn. At the same time, Makina and Ouri's relationship also evolves with each episode in the SECOND half of this series.Enjoyment and Overall - 8/10The first half was pretty random and generically boring. The second half really redeemed itself. This is series is underrated because the first 6-7 episodes didn't have enough to keep the audience from labelling this as &quot;another generic action series&quot;. Although it is far from being a breakthrough, the second half really made good progress in terms of plot and character development. It does deserve the slightly above average rating of 7.5 to 8 out of 10. in mind that there is a second season that follows up directly, so this whole first season gave me the feeling of PREQUEL to the actual story (which turned out decent)Art - 7/10Sometimes, the actions are animated in a pretty sloppy way.

Spiritually sensitive kid lives in a temple, and sees spirits. He has three friends that have anime stereotype personalities (Rukia is the only good female main character in Bleach, god dammit!).

Shikabane are corpses that have enough will to keep moving after death, and its Makina&rsquo;s job to hunt them. I&rsquo;m guessing that Keisei loves Makina or something, because they make it pretty damn obvious when you compare his attitude towards her to the other members of the society. Well, nothing really happens for most of the first episode, then at the end, Makina kicks ass with sub-machine guns and takes out the shikabane for the episode.We can all guess that soon, Yagami will delve into all of this business, as he has met Makina. He saves her from being permanently dead (which had a trippy mind-fuck sequence) and then she slaps him and books it. I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed in the first episode.

Shikabane Hime: Aka is still catching the feeling of weakness where the protagonist is still fragile though she is almost immortal.Art: isn't very catchy. Very simple scenes like bullets dropping wasn't new but felt satisfying. Hair styles where done cheaply (a first for Gainax). backgrounds and such weren't a letdown. some scenes depicted chibi or other comical relieving art which in my opinion made lite of the story or progression of it. and fight scenes were shortened in a disappointing  way.Sound: The music, sound effects, voice actors are all decent.though none of them are renown voice actors they still play their parts well catch people into the story. the music wasn't bad in-fact it caught my attention and made me check out the song artist.Character: Cliche, slow development that builds its way up. not much to say.Enjoyment: i for some reason found the anime very catching after i watched it. motion of helplessness where the hunter was alone and had to fight alone the majority of the time.

It centers around undead girls who are given a chance to enter heaven if they fight and kill other undead. Equal parts exhilarating and disturbing, Shikabane Hime feels like a shounen with heavy horror undertones. This combination is what makes the show worth watching, especially in its later stages, despite its numerous shortcomings. Just for the record, this review covers both seasons: Aka and Kuro.Shikabane are monsters born of strong regrets a person might have when they die. Ageless, powerful, and bearing an animosity towards the living, shikabane are a threat to mankind. The only line...of defense against them is the Kougun Sect, who employ the use of undead girls, called shikabane hime, to eliminate shikabane under the supervision of a contracted monk. If a shikabane hime is able to kill 108 shikabane, then they can enter into heaven. Makina Hoshimura is a shikabane hime with a vendetta and a strong bond with her contracted monk, Keisei Kagami. However, things begin to unhinge when Keisei\'s adopted younger brother, Ouri, becomes involved in the secret battle between shikabane and the Kougun Sect; a battle neither Keisei nor Makina want him to be involved with.The show starts off with an episodic ""monster of the week"" type deal. These opening episodes are in the same vein as Vampire Princess Miyu (the TV anime, not OVA), with our heroin hunting down and destroying shikabane; just done much better than Vampire Princess Miyu, namely because of the more exciting fights. At the same time, the show follows Ouri as he slowly finds out about shikabane and the Kougun Sect. These episodes are the show\'s weakest because while the fights are all good, the scenarios are hit-or-miss, and time with Ouri is usually dull. Luckily, the show starts getting better mid-way through the first season, when Ouri gets deeply involved with one shikabane hime, having tragic consequences. Characters get some god character development: Ouri struggles with the fact that shikabane hime are dead, Keisei laments Ouri\'s increasing involvement with shikabane, and Makina\'s reasons for being a shikabane hime and past with Keisie are relieved. All the while, the viewer is treated to more grotesque scenes of horror and gleefully violent action sequences. Near the end of the first season the main antagonists, a group of shikabane called the Seven Stars (because there are seven of them), appear and aline with the previously introduced Traitor Monk Akasha. In retrospect, I wonder why they didn\'t do this earlier in the series, as it would have made the show more evenly paced.The second season, Kuro, moves at a break-neck speed compared to the first. It is so overstuffed with twists and plot revelations, there is no doubt the show as a whole could have been paced better. Still, it can\'t be accused of being boring. There is a certain shounen-esque excitement to having a villain league like the Seven Stars in the fray.It is fun to watch Makina take them on one at a time. There is also a lot more drama in this season, mainly concerning Makina and Ouri, which is pretty good; but also some drama involving minor characters which really doesn\'t go anywhere, just adding more fluff to the already cramped running time.One thing the show definitely could have handled better was its themes. The show deals a lot with death and regret, but scarcely actually explores them. There are a few occasions where it does, like at the end of both seasons, but for the most part the concepts of death and regret are thrown around like ""friendship"" and ""courage"" are in a typical shounen. There is also the issue of the relationship between shikabane hime and their contracted monks, which is somewhat like the Fratello in Gunslinger Girl (except including complications of having more matured bodies...), but handled far less maturely. Their relationships range from being as complex as the one between Makina and Keisei (and Ouri), to as simplistic and one dimensional as the one between Saki and Rika. One particularly nasty one is Minai and Itsaki, which is the equivalence of Jean and Rico from Gunslinger Girl, unfortunately does not get enough development (even though an extra episode was dedicated to them).As I mentioned at the beginning of the review, this is from Gainax, which means it is going to at least look decent. The show goes for a dark look, even with the vivid color pallet found in most Gainax series, with shading  which borders on unnatural but still suits the show well. Backgrounds are fairly well designed and characters have that certain cartoon-ish expressiveness you will usually find in a Gainax work; the shikabane are a bizarre looking bunch. There is also the copious amount of fan service we\'ve come to expect from Gainax as of late. The animation is for the most part solid, a bit of spottiness here and there but nothing to complain about; the action scenes are treated well. The music does its job of controlling the atmosphere, especially during the tense moments, but honestly you are just not going to remember it. Not the best of Gainax\'s projects, but certainly not bad at all.Taken as an action horror, Shikabane Hime is a decent show. It doess have some major problems with its themes and pacing, which are honestly kind of a mess. However, if you are in the mood for violence, disturbing imagery, and maybe even some solid drama, then you might want to give Shikabane Hime a try. of defense against them is the Kougun Sect, who employ the use of undead girls, called shikabane hime, to eliminate shikabane under the supervision of a contracted monk.

The music does its job of controlling the atmosphere, especially during the tense moments, but honestly you are just not going to remember it. Not the best of Gainax\'s projects, but certainly not bad at all.Taken as an action horror, Shikabane Hime is a decent show. It doess have some major problems with its themes and pacing, which are honestly kind of a mess. However, if you are in the mood for violence, disturbing imagery, and maybe even some solid drama, then you might want to give Shikabane Hime a try.', ""Shikabane HIme or Corpse Princess was a horror,action and martial art anime,with his and her whole family been killed by a group of shikabanes which is Shichisei,Makina seek a revenge against Shichisei with the help of Keisei Tagami as her contracted Monk and a long with Ouri kagami as the younger brother of Keisei Tagami.At the beginning of the whole episode it only tells what is Shikabane are and how shikabane exist and what the contractor monk use for.At the beginning the story was a bit slow,only a few importance information about the Shikabane been told,even the plot development was a bit slow at the...beginning,but at the middle of it the plot development is getting interesting with the pace are getting faster with the introduction of new Shikabane and their Contractor monk and some of action and corpse,However,until the last episode of Shikabane hime:Aka the story was left a big cliffhanger and this's when the second season Shikabane Hime;kuro take places for the cliffhanger....The Art for this series was to be par for good and bad,some of the animation was sloppy even the action scene was a bit sloppy but still good,the character design was simple and each character had their own distinguishable look,the environment and background was too simple and the colours are a bit dark just to blending into the gloomy atmosphere for most horror genre.The Sound,the OP/ED was very catchy and it was easy to listen and the BMG was some of it was fit to some scene like the action scene the BMG was a bit disappointing and it was sloppy a bit and some part of the BMG was didn't fit at all for that scene.As for the voice actor sound most of the char are fit with it,and a bit disappointed for Makina voices it just that voices are didn't fit for it at all....the seiyuu has a unique voice but for Makina personality it didn't fit for it.....Character,the story are mainly focus only for Makina and Ouri character develop with a bit by bit the develop between them are evolved,with supported character helped the character development like the other Shikabane and the contracted monk,and that make some of the supported character didn't develop too much,but some of the supported character and the contractor monk got it flash back for how they meet and and become Shikabane...Overall,truly this anime was enjoyable to watch,it wasn't that bad at all it was a decent anime but t still worth to watch for those who like horror,action and martial art genres.......however the enjoyment still continued at second season for it... beginning,but at the middle of it the plot development is getting interesting with the pace are getting faster with the introduction of new Shikabane and their Contractor monk and some of action and corpse,However,until the last episode of Shikabane hime:Aka the story was left a big cliffhanger and this's when the second season Shikabane Hime;kuro take places for the cliffhanger....The Art for this series was to be par for good and bad,some of the animation was sloppy even the action scene was a bit sloppy but still good,the character design was simple and each character had their own distinguishable look,the environment and background was too simple and the colours are a bit dark just to blending into the gloomy atmosphere for most horror genre.The Sound,the OP/ED was very catchy and it was easy to listen and the BMG was some of it was fit to some scene like the action scene the BMG was a bit disappointing and it was sloppy a bit and some part of the BMG was didn't fit at all for that scene.As for the voice actor sound most of the char are fit with it,and a bit disappointed for Makina voices it just that voices are didn't fit for it at all....the seiyuu has a unique voice but for Makina personality it didn't fit for it.....Character,the story are mainly focus only for Makina and Ouri character develop with a bit by bit the develop between them are evolved,with supported character helped the character development like the other Shikabane and the contracted monk,and that make some of the supported character didn't develop too much,but some of the supported character and the contractor monk got it flash back for how they meet and and become Shikabane...Overall,truly this anime was enjoyable to watch,it wasn't that bad at all it was a decent anime but t still worth to watch for those who like horror,action and martial art genres.......however the enjoyment still continued at second season for it..."", 'Shikabane Hime is a barely decent anime that was released in 2 parts: AKA & KURO. For the purposes of convenience, my review is about both parts because its all really the same story and if you watch one part, you\'ll likely watch the other part as well. From the outset I had a problem with this series. starting with the title ""SHIKABANE HlME"" If it were just the anime title l\'d be ok with it but it is a somewhat silly name for a zombie slayer. Why HIME? Is there a king, a queen, a prince? No there isn\'t it\'s just once again no...one used their imagination or creativity. They know anime viewers all around the world have cottoned on to the Japanese word ""Hime"" by now so hey, why not use the word HIME in the title....it worked so well for Mai-HIME, right? Names aside, like I said, its a barely decent shonen fighting anime about monks & monsters. Of course the monks don\'t go into battle alone, no, they mostly fight by proxy via supposedly dead little girls dressed in all manner of skimpy or tight-fitting outfits catering to the various otaku fetishes.I really did not pay attention to the music of this series. I did watch the anime in English audio and I must give credit to the actors, they were pretty good even if the script was just proper shit. Lucy Christian is pretty much good at everything and I especially appreciated Aaron Dismuke\'s voice, maybe because you just don\'t hear too many authentic teenage male voices in anime.Nothing earth-shattering about the art here at least not for me. Maybe for teenage boys and horny otaku. I can\'t remember anything about the places in the anime... Probably because they were just flat and boring or maybe because the art is more focused on the characters, monsters and fighting scenes.  And even something about that annoyed me... like they plagiarized the fighting scenes from Naruto. Didn\'t that water fight scene between Makina and Hokuto seem eerily similar to the water fight between Naruto and Sasuke? It\'s the things like that through out the series that got on my nerves. Not just being simply unoriginal but almost seeming to copy bits of successful anime.The story is a very basic one, demons exist and there are those that must kill these demons. Nothing supremely new here. Once again I\'m a bit underwhelmed. It doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to see that somewhere, some dude (erm company) said ""Hmmm, I need to make a story about hot chicks fighting in skimpy clothes...let\'s build around that idea!"" I say this again because the obvious questions arise ""Why HIME?"" Why only girls do battle against the shikabane? Clearly there are male Shikabane, surely the same arrangement can be made. There was some flimsy answer provided, one that they (the creators) easily punched holes thru and contradicted themselves with because there is no genuine interest in cultivating a genuine answer much less perpetuate story integrity. The only real focus is about having big-breasted school girls fight in skimpy clothing and watch it get ripped up. Let\'s keep it real. Let\'s keep it 100. I\'m actually surprised no one busted out with tentacle monsters.OK so with the obvious aside, the next logical question is; Is there a real story there, Is Shikabane Hime really worth watching? The answer to that is: meh! To be fair, there is a story there but as far as worth watching... well no. I\'ve seen better and have been entertained by similar and better told stories: Kite, Gunslinger Girl, Mai-HIME, Blood+, just to name a few.  The fact they flip-flopped between comedy and seriousness was tiresome. And then the fact that Shikabane Hime has no overall message or theme, which is vital to any great story was also bothersome. You can feel them making it up as they go along, working with just the basic concepts but never fully fleshing it out. Just generic storytelling at best with lots of very large breasts,  Is the story about revenge?... sorta, with lots of very large breasts. Is the story about love? again... sorta, with lots of very large breasts! But like I said the story dances around vague concepts and notions, just choosing a ""paint by numbers"" approach to storytelling; Let\'s have a character die here, let\'s have the sauna scene there. But you don\'t ever really find yourself crying over any death or being interested in any cartoon titties.Shikabane Hime definitely did not create any revolutionary characters here. It\'s all pretty much your run of the mill characters, monks & big boobed fighter women all possessing your standard anime stereotypes: big boobed nice girl, big boobed mean girl, big titty ninja chick with toothy fang and cat ears, angry chick with pig tails & ribbons, Loli-type, But it\'s the so called doctor female with half a white labcoat but all the titties that took the cake...I just wanted her to stab herself in the boob with one of those ninja knives. Who fights with sharp weapons half naked? The monks are just accessories. Everyone just bored me and I just kept wishing they all died.I definitely give this show as a score of 3. It\'s lucky to even get that score,  because normally anything lower than a 4, I would just delete it and move on to the next title. one used their imagination or creativity.

Heavens be blessed that did not happen while I was watching Shikabane.I'm so happy I decided to give it another try. The story and the characters interaction makes it a great watch.I want to watch the sequel Shikibane Hime Kuro, but I'll hold my breath and try...not to start watching it until it has finished airing. not to start watching it until it has finished airing."", ""Just gonna say this straight off the bat - a VERY average show, despite the interesting concept. If you've just gone sifted through 4 or 5 average shows because you thought you'd find them interesting, hold off watching this or you will just bore yourself. Anyways, onto the review!I got into this show because I had zombies on my mind (probably because I've been looking at zombie video games/mmos) and decided to scout out some zombie anime. I stumbled across this. I will warn people now, some may consider this spoiler material, and I suppose it is, because I'm going to sum up the plot:-When...a person dies, sometimes they do not depart from this world. They become corpses, and many turn corrupt and want vengeance on the human race because they died. Some, however, have a relationship with a Shinto priest. Because of this, they help rid the Priests of the corpses. They are called Shikabane Hime - oh, the title of the show! How fitting... Reason it scores high is its setting of Japan. Because I simply cannot get enough of the island. 8.Characters - bit of a mix up to my usual setting of a review. We follow the story of Ouri, an orphan (I think) who grows up in an orphanage of sorts that's run by the local priests. Anyway, he moves out once, I dunno, he's turned 16, dunno how it works over in Japan. Ouri is at least relatable - we learn about the story and background as he does. I like that, sometimes shows put you ahead of all the characters then they have to be dumbed down.There's a slight catch. Kensei, a priest working (well, suppose an orphanage isn't exactly a workplace is Ouri's brother, which is why Ouri is not exactly an orphan. I've made that more confusing then it actually is. Anyway, Kensei, like the other priests (yeah, the orphanage I guess is also the local temple because Kensei and Ouri's dad is a bishop, like a corporate executive of the whole Shikibane Hime thing... Really, it's not this confusing!) is a contract priest, meaning he has his own Shikibane Hime fighting corpses with him. Her name is Makina. Anyway, Ouri, despite not wanting to be a priest, gets caught up in all this, knows about the shikibane hime, the work they do, and all the characters get fleshed out, including how Makina became a shikibane hime and what relationship she has with her priest. The first half of the show takes on a 'monster-of-the-week' formula while a plot twist kind of intertwines it's way halfway through, which many will see coming to be honest, and maybe that's why I think the show is average. 7.Art - Again, standard CGI fair, but even in other shows I've reviewed (Love Live and SAO to name two) it's been done better. 6.Sound - Nothing of key interest, kind of a gothic, piano interludes - a soundtrack similar to Mirai Nikki (Future Diary), but not as striking and 'metal' as that. 7.Overall, this was enjoyable enough, but certainly nothing but average. Worth a look for the characters and maybe a couple of tunes to add to your phone/mp3/ipod, but other than that a short show to fill your anime void if you have nothing else to watch. 7. a person dies, sometimes they do not depart from this world.

So I have one review for both seasons (plus bonus).I was both pleased with this one, and also very displeased.  I know, I know.. you want me to make sense.  Lets get the mechanics out of the way.Character Development:  Not bad.. Most of the main characters (I stress MAIN) are developed well.  they have depth.  Some of the secondary and lesser characters are paper thin (Ie:  the otaku Hime).Animation:  Well done.  At least to my preference.  Detailed back grounds,...interesting colours and scenery, smooth animation.Sound:  Also Well Done, except for some of the music overlays.  I felt them to be too loud, and were drowning out the convesations.Sigh.. Story:  I felt the premise to be interesting.  and the action and story development for the most part were good.  And this is the part that kept my attention, Dispite the rest.I found the ending to be poor (EDIT:  By ending here, I am refering to Climax of the story), the story lacked the substance needed to pull of such a strange twist.  It ended like so many other animes..  Feeling rushed.  Also, I felt the whole segment about Shikabane Mother could have been chopped from the story line.  It did nothing to advance the main story line.  they could have used those few episodes to make the main plot clearer.I did like how the very end (The wrap-up portion after the action) left you hanging.  Perhaps a movie?  or another season.  It was left in such a way as it could stay the way it is, or not.Overall:  I do not regret the time watching this, and I will likely buy it (when I see it), and watch it again.  However, I do not feel this will be an anime that will be remebered in the long run interesting colours and scenery, smooth animation.Sound:  Also Well Done, except for some of the music overlays.  I felt them to be too loud, and were drowning out the convesations.Sigh.. Story:  I felt the premise to be interesting.  and the action and story development for the most part were good.

However, I do not feel this will be an anime that will be remebered in the long run', 'Halloween is coming up (Or already passed depending on when I finally get this review done) and so what better way to get the chills is to watch a show about corpses coming to life and killing people, right? What I didn’t know about this was that there was a whole bunch more to this show that meets the eye. It brought some questions I never thought I would have to ask myself.So when we get into the characters, Kagami is our ‘main character’ of sorts. I call him a main character even though most that I read has had Makina as the main...character. Anyway, Kagami has a rather strange personality. At first I found it very hard to believe his reactions to the things happening around him. He wouldn’t freak out at all like a normal person would when faced with the walking dead. He only seemed to react when Tagami, his ‘brother’, teased him. He was out of touch with the real world and had a very drab voice to go with it. As I watched though, I found it easier to understand him slightly, though it did not make him any better at times. Makina is pretty much a tsundara in basic form but then there are parts of her that I would argue that statement. She isn’t a typical tsundara; she has a good reason not to connect herself to those around her. Although she does seem to fall in love, I don’t think she ever really forgets enough of her situation that she falls into the want to leave it all behind. Tagami is… How do I explain him? He has a split personality that makes it hard to actually know what he is going to say. One moment he can be rather smart and wise beyond his years and the next he is acting like a perverted high school boy. I can’t figure out exactly what goes on in his head but I’m pretty sure its messed up. He did break up the tension though with his strange form of humor though which was a nice switch.Can I ask why a Shikabane Hime needs to dress like a high school girl? Because I don’t understand some of the outfit choices of her and of some of the monks. I mean really, Makina wears a school girl outfit, the sword princess has extremely high heals, there is one monk who wears what looks to be a very small bra under a lab coat, there are some really confusing hair designs in a couple of characters. I thought that if you’re going to fight a demon, then you shouldn’t wear those types of clothing. There is also a thing in that these Shikabane are basically dead people, so dressing them up in outfits that make them look ‘sexy’ just makes it really awkward. There is also another question I have to ask, WHY ARE ALL THE SHIKABANE HIME WOMEN? The way they talk about it, shouldn’t men also turn into them as well? I understand they say Hime meaning Princess but I am sure that men could also be made one.Now along with this being a show that has a very high supernatural and horror base to it, there was something I don’t think many notice while watching this. It is the question of ‘what does it mean to be human, to be alive?’ It actually is a basic question that I got throughout the show. They keep going back and forward in the idea of what Shikabane and Shikabane Hime mean. They keep on talking about how Shikabane are just people with regrets, and then how Shikabane Hime is those who are only there to kill Shikabane. The Kougon Sect. (the group that has the Shikabane Hime) seems to be split on weather or not Shikabane should be treated as objects or people. So here I ask you, the reader, a question. What does it mean to be human or to be alive? Does it mean you must have a beating heart and able to breath… or does it mean you should be able to feel, to think, to understand right from wrong?The artwork is rather dark and full of blacks and purples, much like many of the shows that revolve around the supernatural and hauntings. But it’s not all like that. When they are in the normal world, things seem to take on this misty coloring like it was all a dream. It gives a good balance between the two different worlds and also makes the world of the supernatural look more real then the real world. I know that sounds strange to say that, but the real world in this show seems more like a fantasy or a dream with how bright the supernatural world looks. Sometimes with the action, it doesn’t look all that well. Gainax has this thing where when some action happens, they seem to put a lot less work into it. The opening is pretty nice but with the ending, up to episode 5, they were only using scenes from the episode. At 5, they made an actual ending which had a couple pictures of characters.The English dub isn’t much to talk about. It’s pretty bland, especially our protagonist. Kagami just sounds as though nothing ever fazes him. His voice is low and draws out a bit. I think I get a little of what Aaron Dismuki was trying to do but it didn’t work that well. The only time he actually shows off any sort of emotion is when Tagami is teasing him. Even when he finds out that a girl that he knew came back to life, he just seems to stare blankly at the screen he is watching. I don’t know if its just the characters personality or the way the voice actor brought him out as but I think it’s a little of both. I do believe Aaron does get the emotions down when he does put effort into it. Greg Ayres surprisingly did a very good job as a strange talking black cat to a point that I had no idea he was the one voicing him. It’s the perfect sort of haunting voice you would think a mysterious cat would have. You definitely can’t tell weather the cat if friend or foe which I really think is part of his charm. Luci Christian does a pretty good job of Makina with her very harsh style of talking. She is the perfect Tsundara character for this sort of story and I think part of this was because Luci herself has played a lot of Tsundara characters. One of the saddest things for me to say right now is I don’t think one of my favorite voice actors should have been brought in for the voice of the Buddhist Monk. J. Michael Tatum doesn’t really catch the right air I think Tagami was supposed to have. He was rather good for when Tagami got rather series but something just seems a little off when he is trying to do the funny parts of the character. The music is actually rather good, giving an intense feeling when it’s needed and a softer feeling when a sad point is. Sometimes for the sad or emotional points, you can barely hear it which I actually think works well. It makes to try to listen more intensely so you don’t miss anything.Overall this show was actually rather good and a perfect show to watch for Halloween. It has a lot of gore, violence, and mystery to keep you wanting to watch more, although the ending was a little bit of a cliffhanger. Luckily there is a sequel and though I haven’t seen that yet, I am looking forward to seeing how it goes. Even with all the gore and violence, there is also an interesting philosophical question that I look forward to uncovering just how they will answer it. character. Anyway, Kagami has a rather strange personality. At first I found it very hard to believe his reactions to the things happening around him.

Does it mean you must have a beating heart and able to breath… or does it mean you should be able to feel, to think, to understand right from wrong?The artwork is rather dark and full of blacks and purples, much like many of the shows that revolve around the supernatural and hauntings. But it’s not all like that. When they are in the normal world, things seem to take on this misty coloring like it was all a dream. It gives a good balance between the two different worlds and also makes the world of the supernatural look more real then the real world. I know that sounds strange to say that, but the real world in this show seems more like a fantasy or a dream with how bright the supernatural world looks. Sometimes with the action, it doesn’t look all that well. Gainax has this thing where when some action happens, they seem to put a lot less work into it. The opening is pretty nice but with the ending, up to episode 5, they were only using scenes from the episode. At 5, they made an actual ending which had a couple pictures of characters.The English dub isn’t much to talk about. It’s pretty bland, especially our protagonist. Kagami just sounds as though nothing ever fazes him. His voice is low and draws out a bit. I think I get a little of what Aaron Dismuki was trying to do but it didn’t work that well. The only time he actually shows off any sort of emotion is when Tagami is teasing him. Even when he finds out that a girl that he knew came back to life, he just seems to stare blankly at the screen he is watching. I don’t know if its just the characters personality or the way the voice actor brought him out as but I think it’s a little of both. I do believe Aaron does get the emotions down when he does put effort into it. Greg Ayres surprisingly did a very good job as a strange talking black cat to a point that I had no idea he was the one voicing him. It’s the perfect sort of haunting voice you would think a mysterious cat would have. You definitely can’t tell weather the cat if friend or foe which I really think is part of his charm. Luci Christian does a pretty good job of Makina with her very harsh style of talking. She is the perfect Tsundara character for this sort of story and I think part of this was because Luci herself has played a lot of Tsundara characters. One of the saddest things for me to say right now is I don’t think one of my favorite voice actors should have been brought in for the voice of the Buddhist Monk. J. Michael Tatum doesn’t really catch the right air I think Tagami was supposed to have. He was rather good for when Tagami got rather series but something just seems a little off when he is trying to do the funny parts of the character. The music is actually rather good, giving an intense feeling when it’s needed and a softer feeling when a sad point is. Sometimes for the sad or emotional points, you can barely hear it which I actually think works well. It makes to try to listen more intensely so you don’t miss anything.Overall this show was actually rather good and a perfect show to watch for Halloween. It has a lot of gore, violence, and mystery to keep you wanting to watch more, although the ending was a little bit of a cliffhanger. Luckily there is a sequel and though I haven’t seen that yet, I am looking forward to seeing how it goes. Even with all the gore and violence, there is also an interesting philosophical question that I look forward to uncovering just how they will answer it.', 'Recommendation: An action-horror series with more emotional depth than you\'d typically expect from a show about a zombie high school girl shooting demons with a Mac-10.  It\'s dark and gory, but worth checking out if you don\'t mind the content.Story: Shikobane Hime is both the name of the series and what it\'s titular character is.  A corpse raised from the dead to kill other corpses that cannot be killed by humans.  The show follows Makina, as well as Keisei (the monk that keeps her reanimated) and Ouri (Keisei\'s brother), as well as a handful of other monks and their Shikobane Himes as...Makina tries to get revenge on a group of demons known as the Seven Stars that tortured and killed her and her family.  The backstory is pretty straightforward and they spend little time on it, which is fine.  Likewise, the show generally sticks to a monster-of-the-week pattern which is also fine but mostly unremarkable.  Where the story is strong is in its themes and emotional depth.  This is the rare horror series where death means something and doesn\'t come cheaply.  The show\'s thesis is stated outright in the final episode, when the head of the Kougon Sect declares that every death has meaning in its impact on the world, that people don\'t fully become part of the world until they die.  This is illustrated in metaphor in many of the individual stories, but the most important is the story of Ouri\'s cat, whose death alters him permanently.  Many of the characters in the series are defined by negative space, in terms of what they\'ve lost.  Ouri and Makina in particular are defined by the losses of their families, and they both continue to change as they encounter death among people they care about throughout the course of the series.  It\'s a horror series and you should of course not get attached to any of the characters for that reason, but even knowing that, some of the deaths still hit like a real gut punch because the series does an excellent job of highlighting the impact on those left behind.Audio/Visual: The audio leaves a lot to be desired.  The VA work is a bit inconsistent and the music is not to my taste at all.  I was also unimpressed with the sound effects work and thought the voices of the Shikobane should have been more distorted to emphasize their inhumanity.  Visually, it really shows its age in a few places, especially with some of the character designs and cartoonish poses they sometimes strike.  That being said, several action scenes (though not all of them) are animated quite nicely and have a unique style that holds up even to someone watching almost 15 years after it first came out.  The Shikobane designs are also impressively grotesque and very creative.Characters: Most of the characters are very strong, even the minor characters and Shikobane.  The one glaring exception here is Ouri, one of the main characters.  He spends much of the story, to be blunt about it, being a whiny little shit.  His presence is extraneous for much of the series despite being one of the leads, as he mostly stumbles blindly into bad situations, has to be rescued, and then demands explanations in the middle of the rescue.  It\'s very difficult to like him at all until his mini arc with Minai.  His presence in the story is ultimately justified, though explaining why would involve spoiling the ending, so I\'ll just say that even though he does end up having a reason to be in the story, he spends far too long as a simple bystander to Makina and Keisei\'s action heroics and is not fully integrated into the plot until the very end of the season.  While this is probably going to come off as a ""the food was terrible, and such small portions"" type of complaint, they should have pulled the trigger (so to speak) on him being involved with the Kougon Sect far earlier, ideally before the halfway point.As one final note that didn\'t really fit anywhere else, it really sucks that the finale is about 75% recap and just enough new material that you can\'t skip it.  It felt like a cheap budget move and like a major letdown in the aftermath of how episode 12 ends.

While being episodic with the 1 monster-per-week format until about halfway of the series, a lot of things happened in those episodes that told bits of the main story moving the series forward such as meeting up several important characters, his discovery of what his hidden talent can...do, and several other events concerning the Kougan cult and the Shikabane Himes in particular. When the real antagonists finally started showing themselves during the middle part of the series, it was at this point that the show finally started to get really interesting. The finale for the series leaves a lot of things to be desired that was later answered when the second season was aired.The animation for this series is dark, very dark, even when the setting is daytime. It is something that the viewers can eventually get used to because it suits the series quite well as the story is shrouded in mystery and supernatural phenomena, so a dark setting is really appropriate. The background and characters are somewhat lazily drawn, having poor details and generally bland. The animation is not really sharp and crisp makes you wonder if the series is really an HD show or an upscale. The bright points of the animation are the fight scenes, it is detailed in such a way that makes the effects looks stylish and nicely choreographed while maintaining the simplicity of the animation, special attention was given to the animation of the Shikabane-Himes since they provide the fan-service for the series.Music is not really the strength of the series. The OP and ED themes provide a good feel for the series but not really memorable at all. The soundtracks are pretty decent especially during the fighting scenes and several other important scenes have a nice selection of songs playing in the background. Voice acting on the other hand is fairly good. Note worthy amongst the cast are veteran seiyuus such as Sugita Tomozaku, Horie Yui, Fujiwara Keiji, and Yuuki Aoi. What is surprising for me are the seiyuus of the main characters namely Akiyama Nana which voices Makina and Hasome Tatsuya for Ouri, both are very new in the business but did a very good job giving voice and life to the characters they portrayed.I generally preferred female leads that have strong personalities, one that doesn't back down and is always up to the challenge, so Hoshimura Makina is a big win for me and an important factor that made watching this series an enjoyable experience. In addition to that, she is also hot and cool when she wields her two guns and start shooting on her opponents. The male lead Kagami Ouri is also not to be toyed around. He could be annoying at the beginning especially when he came across to the mysteries that revolved around him but he developed into one fine male lead as the series progresses. The other main character that give huge impact to the story is Tagami Keisei, initially a very secretive character but with his relationship with Makina slowly being revealed, his presence is pivotal into closing the gap between Makina and Ouri. There are also several characters from the Kougan cult, other Shikabane Himes, and antagonists that made an appearance mostly to progress the development of the main characters.Shikabane Hime: Aka is a fairly well done series as a whole. Despite it short-comings in animation and the episodic format in the start, it didn’t affect my overall impression of the series which is more on the positive side of things as it improves at the midpoint and ended with a lot of questions that was eventually answered with the airing of the second season. As for my final note, I would recommend this series for viewers who like stories that are supernatural in genre with lots of action, gore, drama, and hints of romance.Note: This is a re-review of Shikabane Hime: Aka do, and several other events concerning the Kougan cult and the Shikabane Himes in particular.

There exist an organization made up of monks who deal with them by using reanimated girls called Shikabane Hime aka Corpse Princess. The girls also possess superhuman abilities. One of their number named Makina, goes into battle against them equipped with two uzi's, along with her guardian a Contracted Monk by the name of Keisei. Together they battle the monsters across the city. But there's a greater threat approaching with sinister motives. -summaryCorpse Princess is another one of those by the number, action oriented titles...that are a dime a dozen. The core premise is the usual girls with guns vs. monsters, and while I was watching the show it felt as if I was watching three other series simultaneously. Therefore, it's a no brainer that originality was never intended to be factored into the equation. Despite this though, there was quite a bit going on that held my attention, and most of my huge pet peeves were kept to a minimum. The action in the series is nothing to really turn a nose up at either. At this point, I would say that the series is a solid action romp. For the record, this is the first half of two, titled Corpse Princess: Aka, with the second being Corpse Princess: Kuro.The plot follows Makina as she battles the Shikabane; her missions become complicated when she constantly runs into her handler's younger brother Ouri. He eventually becomes dragged into the feud with the monsters. At first, it's the standard good vs. evil that results in action packed episode ending showdowns. However, the stories are rather interesting when moving from point A to B. I really don't mind the lack of originality as long as there's some type of creativity thrown into the mix.The Shikabane they come across don't always have interesting abilities, instead their origins and episode story elements are sometimes the main draw. For example, one episode sees a doctor completely controlling one that is protecting something important to it, at the same time, he's injecting people with the cells from the beast, and he's given the idea from a mysterious benefactor. This eventually leads to the supposed lead antagonist of the series. Along the way, although there are several detours, the story eventually begins to take some type of form. My interest began to be aroused when a faction called the Seven Stars were introduced, and Ouri's mysterious background begins to come into play as well.The style of the series is rather dark at times, but there are slight tonal comedic shifts that take place. I doubt it's a secret that I don't care for segments like these, however this is one of those cases where it actually works. The comedy rarely, if ever, clashes with the tense moments which is a plus; and I think the main reason I can let this pass is because Corpse Princess knows exactly what it wants to be, and that's light entertainment in which it succeeds at. There is actually no attempts towards being high art at all, and I have to commend the writers for this because one thing I can't stand is an anime with an identity crisis.The characters are indeed cookie cutter though, for the most part, they're plot devices we have seen about a hundred times before this point, and that is never a good thing. They consist of the tough chick, and whiny male teen who has to question all of her motives, and like always it can be annoying. Thankfully, there are side characters with different abilities who occasionally appear, and sometimes they even have their own drama to deal with. The story behind the Shikabane is interesting in a way, but it feels way too similar to Bleach. People become those creatures when they pass away with certain regrets or obsessions. Even though it feels familiar, this sometimes plays into their powers which adds an interesting twist to the encounters. Corpse Princess does feel like other things, but it tries its hand at being creative.The visuals are pretty good with some fluid action scenes that rarely go the lazy route. There's quite a bit of high intensity shootouts and fist to face segments. The battles are well-lit spectacles that I found to be entertaining on some occasions. I found the character designs to be about so-so, and the backgrounds are dark most of the time, which suits the supernatural element properly, especially since all the battles either take place in the night or inside very dark structures. The soundtrack features two J-Pop songs for the opening and ending that I can imagine some folks getting into. While the BGM is nothing to really brag about outside of complimenting the style rather well.This first half has its good moments and the story ends on a cliffhanger after a very predictable plot twist. The fan service ranks between very tame to almost non existent, and the gore is moderate. If only the characters weren't cut from the same cloth as so many other shonen heroes, it would probably be better. Still, if you dig hot chicks with guns taking on monsters, then Corpse Princess is something that's worth a look.Highs: Production values, light entertainment that pretty much succeedsLows: Bland characters, feels too familiar in many places that are a dime a dozen.

This was a series I happen to stumble upon. It took merely 5 minutes into episode 1 for me to be hooked. This series really created an atmosphere, a storyline, and characters that are enjoyable and entertaining. I watched all of season one in ONE day.The pacing, I thought, was excellent. I would've loved to see more episodes, but they managed to give you a lot of information with a good balance between the 13 episodes. There was never a point where I was bored, or waiting for it to get on with the story. I was thoroughly involved the whole way along....The character development was another really strong point. You come to care for all the characters, especially given how many characters have troubled pasts.The fight scenes are incredibly animated and just BAD ASS.The story is original, action paced, and tragic at times. Definitely check it out! :D The character development was another really strong point. You come to care for all the characters, especially given how many characters have troubled pasts.The fight scenes are incredibly animated and just BAD ASS.The story is original, action paced, and tragic at times. Definitely check it out! :D"", 'Zombies.... ooo zombies... I feel like I can’t think of apocalypse without you anymore. Gruesome bipeds hunting me for my brains, drooling and screaming while you slowly sustain inordinate amounts of lead to the face without cringing... I love you all for all the beautiful dreams and nightmares you give me.You can imagine my excitement when I found out my favorite giant robot making studio was going to give it a shot to epically portray all of you in the most gar-ified way possible.  Right when I got into the show I was overwhelmed with the amount of familiar faces, all it was missing...was a huge drill actually and I would have probably wet myself in excitement. The breasts were there, the over the top action was there, the weak but soon to become omnipotent character was there, “K” was there… but something was missing. This something kept bugging me for all throughout the show and by the end I started to realize I can’t think of mediocrity without you anymore as well, but you know, its zombies so I knew you guys were going to put a good show for me regardless, or so I thought.--Story--ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!  This is all I am used to hear from you, so you can imagine my big facepalm with all the repressed angst I got instead. You still did scream a fair amount and I will say those were the shining moments of your performance here, but whenever you silenced the guns and sat around for a long and tedious talk all we got was…. Well, long and tedious talks. At least that was what I would like to call them. In fact, they were long, tedious and flashbacks... lots and lots of them.Please, don’t take this as a direct attempt to discredit your motives. Repetition aside, they are fairly well constructed and would provide a perfect scenario for your bloody fest if not for the insistence you had in giving the spotlight for some unnecessary, non zombie, characters. I really liked your plight and how you were thriving to fulfill it, just too bad you had to insist in bringing detractions, the worst offender being the one to get the most out of the screen time, a bit of a masochistic choice if you ask me.Even then, the variety of zombies you guys presented me with was nice and I found a few particular main characters, even some non zombie ones, pretty compelling, but the climax would only work if you had built upon it better… you know, like the guys behind you are so good at when they are dealing with giant robots. I also felt a bit cheated by you since you spilled all the few twists you had in store right at the opening, and after seeing it eleven times when it actually came to be I really felt like my brain had already been eaten.I know you must be tempted to tear me apart right now, but hang on a bit longer; I still have some mumblings that might make me even more appetizing.--Animation--I have to hand it to you; you still know how to move. Whenever you guys are flying about exploding people’s heads or cutting them in half you really look your best, this time even better since you don’t have your usual decomposing skin anymore and the close ups on your new assets really does provide some extra oomph.Here is also were the otherwise formulaic nature of your plot helped, since the usually boring queue of weekly monsters waiting to be beheaded brought variety of characters and bloody ways to crush their admittedly interesting entrails. They are vicious, colorful and varied, and contrast perfectly with the pretty schoolgirl variety of zombies you guys brought into display here, bringing to the table that old good “princess and the beast” feel we are all so found off in ample dosages, something that even if we had forgotten for a second a character would promptly shout towards the audience so we would recall it instantly.Still, I know you can do better. Not even once my inner fangirl started screaming at your fights as it is usual when you are around bludgeoning stuff to death, and this alone is a big red flag. The fluidity both you and the hands drawing you are known for is kind of blurry here… it seems I don’t know you anymore! No need to get dismembered about it thought, it’s just that my final perception of you is lower than what I was expecting… please don’t come eat me alive yet!--Sound--Your frenzied destruction is never complete without an appropriate music, and gladly you managed to score it this time.  Not only the opening and the ending, but the climaxes all felt a bit chewer thanks to the soundtrack. I just wish your voices also sounded as good as the rest, but unfortunately most of it were not up to par…. Perhaps if you would be more willing to scream “brainssssssssssssssssss” more often who knows, the truth is, you only sounded good when the only thing I could hear were the guns and awesome explosions you were creating, as for the biggest part, you sounded dull and out of character.…I know you must be drooling by now, but just a bit more and you can have a bite at me.--Conclusion--What can I say to save myself now? I hang at your side your for the whole time, I tried to get as hyper excited as possible whenever you filled my screen with zombie glory and filled my ears with ultra violence, I even gritted my teeth to try to sob for you when you were sad… but to what avail? You delivered anything but the ordinary I am used to with other much less awesome things such as teenage magical girls!Ok, some of this is my fault. The story only got to an enjoyable portion after the 9th episode barrier, I should’ve kept up with you in silence while you explained to your brainless victims how your plot worked for the 100th time, I should have properly ignored the apparent useless episodes where nothing of notice happened, and I should’ve kept my lack of excitement with your twists out of the room when you arbitrarily did stuff just for the sake of your current attempt to flash characters we don’t want to see.But I couldn’t. And this is why I write this to you now, before you munch me, so I leave behind a testament to other people that tread this place. This way they will know that despite still looking good and interesting, you are far from your best here, and they would be much better suited looking for their visceral zombie thrill or cute girl galore somewhere else… at this day and age in a particular high school as well. was a huge drill actually and I would have probably wet myself in excitement.

This something kept bugging me for all throughout the show and by the end I started to realize I can’t think of mediocrity without you anymore as well, but you know, its zombies so I knew you guys were going to put a good show for me regardless, or so I thought.--Story--ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!  This is all I am used to hear from you, so you can imagine my big facepalm with all the repressed angst I got instead. You still did scream a fair amount and I will say those were the shining moments of your performance here, but whenever you silenced the guns and sat around for a long and tedious talk all we got was…. Well, long and tedious talks. At least that was what I would like to call them. In fact, they were long, tedious and flashbacks... lots and lots of them.Please, don’t take this as a direct attempt to discredit your motives. Repetition aside, they are fairly well constructed and would provide a perfect scenario for your bloody fest if not for the insistence you had in giving the spotlight for some unnecessary, non zombie, characters. I really liked your plight and how you were thriving to fulfill it, just too bad you had to insist in bringing detractions, the worst offender being the one to get the most out of the screen time, a bit of a masochistic choice if you ask me.Even then, the variety of zombies you guys presented me with was nice and I found a few particular main characters, even some non zombie ones, pretty compelling, but the climax would only work if you had built upon it better… you know, like the guys behind you are so good at when they are dealing with giant robots. I also felt a bit cheated by you since you spilled all the few twists you had in store right at the opening, and after seeing it eleven times when it actually came to be I really felt like my brain had already been eaten.I know you must be tempted to tear me apart right now, but hang on a bit longer; I still have some mumblings that might make me even more appetizing.--Animation--I have to hand it to you; you still know how to move. Whenever you guys are flying about exploding people’s heads or cutting them in half you really look your best, this time even better since you don’t have your usual decomposing skin anymore and the close ups on your new assets really does provide some extra oomph.Here is also were the otherwise formulaic nature of your plot helped, since the usually boring queue of weekly monsters waiting to be beheaded brought variety of characters and bloody ways to crush their admittedly interesting entrails. They are vicious, colorful and varied, and contrast perfectly with the pretty schoolgirl variety of zombies you guys brought into display here, bringing to the table that old good “princess and the beast” feel we are all so found off in ample dosages, something that even if we had forgotten for a second a character would promptly shout towards the audience so we would recall it instantly.Still, I know you can do better. Not even once my inner fangirl started screaming at your fights as it is usual when you are around bludgeoning stuff to death, and this alone is a big red flag. The fluidity both you and the hands drawing you are known for is kind of blurry here… it seems I don’t know you anymore! No need to get dismembered about it thought, it’s just that my final perception of you is lower than what I was expecting… please don’t come eat me alive yet!--Sound--Your frenzied destruction is never complete without an appropriate music, and gladly you managed to score it this time.  Not only the opening and the ending, but the climaxes all felt a bit chewer thanks to the soundtrack. I just wish your voices also sounded as good as the rest, but unfortunately most of it were not up to par…. Perhaps if you would be more willing to scream “brainssssssssssssssssss” more often who knows, the truth is, you only sounded good when the only thing I could hear were the guns and awesome explosions you were creating, as for the biggest part, you sounded dull and out of character.…I know you must be drooling by now, but just a bit more and you can have a bite at me.--Conclusion--What can I say to save myself now? I hang at your side your for the whole time, I tried to get as hyper excited as possible whenever you filled my screen with zombie glory and filled my ears with ultra violence, I even gritted my teeth to try to sob for you when you were sad… but to what avail? You delivered anything but the ordinary I am used to with other much less awesome things such as teenage magical girls!Ok, some of this is my fault. The story only got to an enjoyable portion after the 9th episode barrier, I should’ve kept up with you in silence while you explained to your brainless victims how your plot worked for the 100th time, I should have properly ignored the apparent useless episodes where nothing of notice happened, and I should’ve kept my lack of excitement with your twists out of the room when you arbitrarily did stuff just for the sake of your current attempt to flash characters we don’t want to see.But I couldn’t. And this is why I write this to you now, before you munch me, so I leave behind a testament to other people that tread this place. This way they will know that despite still looking good and interesting, you are far from your best here, and they would be much better suited looking for their visceral zombie thrill or cute girl galore somewhere else… at this day and age in a particular high school as well.', ""So let me start by saying I haven't finished this series and that is very uncommon and under normal conditions quite stupid to review a series before you have completed it (after all if you drop it half way through or finish it half-way and decides its bad who are you to call it such after as far you know the next episode could very well be the redeemer for the whole series and all of a sudden bring the spark of life it needed to be good). So now let me get to why I am reviewing this one without finishing it (other than...that it has completed airing yet). This is more of a warning than it is a review, if you're planning on completing this series be prepared to fork out some cash because every subbing group out there has dropped it now while I believe it is important to support artist and creators I must point out that the money you pay for DVD's and such barely even benefits them...that's right most of it goes to the company (the same is not completely true for manga and if you have the money I suggest that you probably should buy them). So yeah back to what I was saying you will only find to episode 6 online or at least that's the cap I reached after searching for hours on end for episode 7. It's a good series I honestly want to know how it ends so now I will sit here and wait patiently until I can be the DVD set cheaply off amazon.com. I promise I will come back and give this a proper review once I have seen the whole series but for now you must excuse my unenlightened and slightly negative attitude towards the series.Story- This story is about the shikabane hime (misguided souls/demons that hunt other demons/misguided souls) and how they must kill 108 shikabane (demons/misguided souls). The plot indeed thickens out more to that but because of the limited number of episodes I am able to watch this is about all I can sufficiently provide you with (sorry blame funimation).Art- The art for this series focus on a unique combination of well drawn normal looking characters (okay not that well drawn or normal the eyes and nose seem a little strange in my opinion) with the monsters being drawn to be absolute abominations to the human vision (they seem to using a different coloring and drawing style for each monster which I for one think is amazing if not a little unnecessary).Sound- Surprisingly enough what impresses me most about this series is sound I love the voice acting as I'm quite familiar with a few of the voices I here from other series. Also I love the opening to this series it perfect matches the context of creepy, undead people fighting to the death. This section however lost points from the gun sounds I've fired a lot of weapons in my days and while they did a decent job of capturing the sounds they seemed to have flubbed a little when it came to the sound of the 9mm and rifle.Character- There the leading role (by which I mean the one we follow around the most) Ouri surprisingly has very little to do with the actual story just like us he just seems to be a confused observer that seems to get more in the way of the real heroes rather than show some bad assery of his own however we have a good understanding of his character and how his mind works by the third episode. Makina however our other main character kicks serious butt this only flawed by the fact that she is so cold and mysterious and that even by the sixth episode we only know enough about her to assume things rather than know them (but that's fine and dandy since that's her character type). Kesei I for one think should be the leading role in this series he's charismatic, funny, strong, and has the slight hint of mystery that you always need to make a good story unfortunately the story seems to be focusing more on his brother than him and that can only need to disappointment (also he's a pervy monk hehe he's tries to give his brother porn).Enjoyment- Despite my whining I really do enjoy this series and do hope to finish it one day as the way things are left off now I want to near tear my finger nails to know what happens in the next couple of episodes. What can I say I have weakness for violence, hot girls, pervy monks, and killing monsters which this series has no lack of. that it has completed airing yet).

Spending my days fighting alongside you, means everything to me. The pact we made was worth all of this – and more.” – Keisei TagamiYou know when you go into a show and expect it to be mediocre at best and bad at worst, and it completely surprises you? That what´s happened when I watched “Shikabane Hime” (aka Corpse Princess). I expected flat and stereotypic characters, incoherent plot and plot holes, suspensions less fights, and shit loads of un-necessary fanservice. But boy was I wrong, it´s not often that I get so emotional during a watch as I became during my...time with “Shikabane Hime”. It gripped me on a deeper level then I thought possible, considering the genres (action, horror, martial art). And it has one of my all-time favourite openings – if not watch the show, watch the opening for the music and visuals alone.So, what was it that surprised me so positively? I will explain that now.Story: 9/10The plot has a clear path in its narrative and layout. Each episode giving clues and information to upcoming important events, and head enemies. I didn´t perceived the show as episodic, it´s just smoothly builds up the story and characters to the climax, with some suspense and tensions filled moments along the way.I would definitely not call the plot especially unique or ground-breaking, but it´s for shore executed in a special way. As so many horror anime out there, death is an essential part – and not the physical death only, but the philosophical part of it as well. It has been in myth and folk lore for a long time, that if you die with regrets your spirit can´t pass on, and the spirit is stuck here in our world. This theme has been pondered many times in pretty much all mediums, but it never seems to get old, and can always be interpreted in new ways.“Shikabane Hime” takes the approach, if you die with strong regrets, then you get stuck in the living world, and this regret or obsession will turn you into a “Shikabane” (Shikabane literally means Dead body or Corpse) – a monster that has a physical form, and completely stripped off its former humanity. The only drive left is the Shikabane´s regrets or obsessions. Which inevitably turns the former human evil, and it will havoc upon the still living world with their super human strength. And of course, it has a counterpart, a group of people that has tasked them self with the non-so pleasant job to protect the living from these Shikabanes. They are called the Kougon Clan, and the members are monks that been trained for this special task of destroying these monsters, and keep the truth about them hidden from the rest of the world. To their help, they have Shikabane Hime´s, female Shikabanes, that they formed contract with. Together they form a team, and the Shikabane Hime takes life energy from her contracted monk to heal herself, and pretty much becomes undefeatable – and keeps her sanity and human form. After the Shikabane Hime has killed 108 Shikabanes, she can go peacefully to heaven with no regrets.As a base, this can sound very cliché, but in Shikabane Hime´s case, it made me reflect on some deeper subjects. What´s defines being human? Is it a beating heart and ageing body? Or is it much more complicated than that? Is it our emotions, actions, and thoughts that defines us as human? Because, the Hime´s are treated in many cases as something non-human, more like a tool with an expiration date.I think how the relationships between the Shikabane Hime´s and their monks, really brought up these questions. Yes, the Hime´s are dead. No pulse, no aging, and very time limited to this world. And the monks, are very alive, ageing, and bound to this world for unknown time. And still they both look human, act human, and feel emotions like humans. And they are absolutely forbidden to have any romantic relationships. And that was another surprising part of the show, how it displayed these complicated relationships and the character’s feelings, or rather how they supressed these strong feeling for each other. What I expected to be a gore fest, with cliché fights, and empty character interactions, became something much more. It became a story of living on, even if dead, with the means of fighting, meaningful and touching character relationships, and the fights had meaning and emotional drive behind them. But of course, it contains lot of gore, it is a horror anime after all. As for the expected fanservice, it was actually very limited. Most of the fanservice is provided in the ending song, and it’s used sparingly during the actual show. Huge plus for me.Note: Worth having in mind, is that this is the first season of two so all your questions will not be answered in this season. Also worth mentioning is that the manga was still ongoing when the 2: nd season was released, so if you want a conclusive ending, you have to read the manga.Character: 9/10As mentioned before, I expected empty stereotypes, doing and saying cliché and dumb thing, with non-exciting development. I was wrong. They all had a certain depth to them, with specific personalities, backed up by their past experiences. All the main and main supporting characters, get some important development and backstory (Ouri get his in the second season). The dynamic between the characters was very defined and meaningful, even scenes there Keisei just goofing around with his adopted little brother Ouri, and making him angry and embarrassed, becomes an important part of the show. Also, as mentioned before, the relationships between the Hime´s and their monks are a central part. All or of them are unique personas, who has established a specific dynamic between them. The interactions and dynamic with other human characters and Shikabane´s, is also an essential part to really get to the depth of what these Hime´s and Monk´s go through.Which brings me to Shikabane Hime´s main charcaters.We get to follow the Shikabane Hime, Makina, contracted to Keisei, and his adopted little brother Ouri. Keisei never wanted to make a contract with a Hime in the first place, but as he knew Makina in the past, he couldn’t turn her down after she and her family was brutally murdered by a group Shikabane´s. Makina´s regret is a burning hatred for her and her family’s murderers, and she want her revenge. So, they make a pact to always fight to together, and give Makina her revenge.Makina can at first glance be labelled a tsundere, but her harsh way and words is just a protective shell she´s created. She´s keeping her true feelings and emotions on a tight leash, due to that she knows that some things just can´t be – even though she wishes otherwise. Makina is simply put a badass realist, not a true bread tsundere. Which gives her softer moments a lot more value and emotional impact. Keisei is a character with two very distinct sides – the goofy older brother monk that pretends that nothing is going on, and the more serious and high level Shikabane fighter. Keisei has a heart of gold, and his protectiveness of Makina is nothing but heart clenching. You can clearly see that they harbour strong feeling towards each other. Their relationship and interactions, brought me to tears multiple times during this watch. Sense when did horror anime become such a tear-jerker? Ouri isn´t a monk, and has no clue about what´s his brother is really doing in the beginning, but he is like a moth to light, when it´s comes to death. He seems to be drawn automatically to it. Ouri is very emotionally cut off, much of what he sees and experience almost never faces him in ways that you would expect. He just goes with most of it, and the key to it lays in his past (of course!). And just in he´s case as in Makina´s, his more emotional moments have a lot of more impact, because of his usual lack of response. His loyalty to his brother and those his think of as friends, are nicely portrayed. He´s is the weakling in the beginning, the person all people tells to “Stay out of it, you just going to be in the way!”, but constantly interfere – he just can´t stay away after he came to know about Makina. He´s drawn to her, and sees her as normal girl – which is a huge taboo. Makina tries her best to scare Ouri off, but a time comes there they have to lean heavily on each other. To see there bound slowly grow, also was one of the show´s strong holds for me.All the supporting characters are in some way interesting, with pretty solid personalities, development, and backstories. I came to care for all the teams, and be emotionally invested in them to the point there I was like, “Please, don´t let one of them die!”. Even if I knew that in this kind of show, deaths will occur frequently. I enjoyed their stories and screen time just much as Makina´s, Keisei´s, and Ouri´s.Art: 8/10I personally really liked the art and animation, but it´s clearly out dated, compared to this day’s anime. Shikabane Hime, is a 2008 production by studio Gainax and feel. I think they managed to catch the atmosphere for the show very well, with carefully chosen colours and light setting. I came to love the character designs, even if some can appear lazily drawn at first. It´s was the small details of them, who made them stand out to regular anime designs. Like, Makina´s thick, pinched eyebrows when irritate or mad, or her evil death smile before she blasts her enemy to oblivion with her uzi´s. Or like Keisei´s spikey hair and shaded glasses. All details that defined their personality and mad them stand out from the norm.The backgrounds are beautifully done and coloured, it really could give you an emotional contrast. For example, the cast been out hunting Shikabane´s, and bathed in blood in the dark of night, to watch a stunning sunrise or sunset and have nice small talk. It provided a nice balance, the beauty of life and death, night and day, and violence and peace.The animation is mostly well done, but some parts feel a bit sloppy. Personally, I really liked the action scenes, with their special angles and explosiveness. The actually tension in the fights, was brought by the characters and highlighted by the animation. No complains form my point of view.Sound: 9/10I have already stated that Shikabane Hime, has one of my all-time favourite openings. The song “Beautiful fighter” by angela, is not just suiting the show amazingly well, it´s a masterpiece on its own. I listen to it several times a day, I just can´t stop myself. The two ED´s are also surprisingly good, with my favourite being “My Story” also by angela. There is also where most of the fanservice I provided, but I watched it every time anyway, because the song was so good. Top notch OP and ED.As for the OST, it was great. Dramatic instrumental music during intense filled scenes, and it´s softer counterpart during more emotional scenes. No complains what so ever.I watched the dubbed version, and I liked all the VA´s. Ouri´s VA can sound a bit emotionless or flat, but don´t forget, that Ouri´s character pretty much demand that kind of voice.All background sound was absolutely fine, I could really hear the bullets popping, blood splatter on the ground, rasp of fabric against fabric, and the impact a collapsing structure made. Above standard for shore.Enjoyment: 10/10If you not guessed it so far, I enjoyed Shikabane Hime a hell of a lot. I was taken by surprise of the fact, that just after 2 episodes, I was emotionally invested and highly entertained. Makina as the female lead was a treat, not your typical simplistic main girl, but had a lot of badass traits together with a hidden softer and loving side. Huge plus that they used her very little for fanservice, she was often treated with much more respect. I haven´t explored the horror genre that thoroughly, but I can imagine that this will be one of my favourites in the genre for all time, due to its emotional impact on me – the drama behind it all was well portrayed in my opinion. It made me feel intrigued, interested, engaged in the plot and characters, and excited. And not to mention the river of tears.Overall: 9/10Even do I can see that the show isn´t perfect, with every angle covered, it felt filled with important content and interesting characters, and character dynamics and relationships. Shikabane Hime, also contains some unrequired love aspects, expressed in a very nice and touching way. So, to me the show is much more than an action/horror train going to one destination. It contains, emotional hardships, the importance of the present time, forbidden love, and fighting to stay alive, and not for just the sake of fighting. So I would recommend the show if you like the themes, and haven´t had the pleasure to dig in to this piece that is Shikabane Hime yet.“Look at that. You are scared of me now.” – Makina Hoshimura time with “Shikabane Hime”. It gripped me on a deeper level then I thought possible, considering the genres (action, horror, martial art). And it has one of my all-time favourite openings – if not watch the show, watch the opening for the music and visuals alone.So, what was it that surprised me so positively?

I came to love the character designs, even if some can appear lazily drawn at first. It´s was the small details of them, who made them stand out to regular anime designs. Like, Makina´s thick, pinched eyebrows when irritate or mad, or her evil death smile before she blasts her enemy to oblivion with her uzi´s. Or like Keisei´s spikey hair and shaded glasses. All details that defined their personality and mad them stand out from the norm.The backgrounds are beautifully done and coloured, it really could give you an emotional contrast. For example, the cast been out hunting Shikabane´s, and bathed in blood in the dark of night, to watch a stunning sunrise or sunset and have nice small talk. It provided a nice balance, the beauty of life and death, night and day, and violence and peace.The animation is mostly well done, but some parts feel a bit sloppy. Personally, I really liked the action scenes, with their special angles and explosiveness. The actually tension in the fights, was brought by the characters and highlighted by the animation. No complains form my point of view.Sound: 9/10I have already stated that Shikabane Hime, has one of my all-time favourite openings. The song “Beautiful fighter” by angela, is not just suiting the show amazingly well, it´s a masterpiece on its own. I listen to it several times a day, I just can´t stop myself. The two ED´s are also surprisingly good, with my favourite being “My Story” also by angela. There is also where most of the fanservice I provided, but I watched it every time anyway, because the song was so good. Top notch OP and ED.As for the OST, it was great. Dramatic instrumental music during intense filled scenes, and it´s softer counterpart during more emotional scenes. No complains what so ever.I watched the dubbed version, and I liked all the VA´s. Ouri´s VA can sound a bit emotionless or flat, but don´t forget, that Ouri´s character pretty much demand that kind of voice.All background sound was absolutely fine, I could really hear the bullets popping, blood splatter on the ground, rasp of fabric against fabric, and the impact a collapsing structure made. Above standard for shore.Enjoyment: 10/10If you not guessed it so far, I enjoyed Shikabane Hime a hell of a lot. I was taken by surprise of the fact, that just after 2 episodes, I was emotionally invested and highly entertained. Makina as the female lead was a treat, not your typical simplistic main girl, but had a lot of badass traits together with a hidden softer and loving side. Huge plus that they used her very little for fanservice, she was often treated with much more respect. I haven´t explored the horror genre that thoroughly, but I can imagine that this will be one of my favourites in the genre for all time, due to its emotional impact on me – the drama behind it all was well portrayed in my opinion. It made me feel intrigued, interested, engaged in the plot and characters, and excited. And not to mention the river of tears.Overall: 9/10Even do I can see that the show isn´t perfect, with every angle covered, it felt filled with important content and interesting characters, and character dynamics and relationships. Shikabane Hime, also contains some unrequired love aspects, expressed in a very nice and touching way. So, to me the show is much more than an action/horror train going to one destination. It contains, emotional hardships, the importance of the present time, forbidden love, and fighting to stay alive, and not for just the sake of fighting. So I would recommend the show if you like the themes, and haven´t had the pleasure to dig in to this piece that is Shikabane Hime yet.“Look at that. You are scared of me now.” – Makina Hoshimura', ""I could describe this anime in so many words: touching, exciting, creepy, beautiful, interesting, moving, powerful, and a thousand more.I really loved the relationship between Makina and Keisei. They were so beautiful as a partnership, and I would love to watch the two of them forever.I also loved Ouri. His tenacity and strength is so admirable. He put himself through so much strain and hurt for his brother and Makina.I'm really glad the history of the Shikabane Hime vs. regular Shikabane was touched on (I think more so in the second season than the first). It was interesting to learn about the...stakes of being one or the other as well as the stakes for simply being tied to a contracted monk.Basically, this quickly became one of my favorite anime series, and I'm so glad I decided to watch it. stakes of being one or the other as well as the stakes for simply being tied to a contracted monk.Basically, this quickly became one of my favorite anime series, and I'm so glad I decided to watch it."", '""Death Death Humans die no matter whatNo one can defeat death itself""---MakinaI agree with this pretty sure I died a couple of times while I was watching Corpse Princess.

It was about a girl who was already dead but was revived as corpse and gained superhuman strength. Like your typical story, she partnered a human living guy in order to gain energy. The whole story was about her killing another corpse as so she can go to heaven but it turned out she has personal reason as to...why she was searching for the villains. I strongly believe that the story itself was interesting enough but it didn’t work for the series. It was good but not good enough to leave an impression to viewers.The characters were not particularly interesting, too. You can’t feel any greatness or impression from the lead characters to the villains. They were not interesting enough that you would remember their character. The main female lead was not great. Even with great abilities, she wasn’t specifically strong or special that would make her different from other SHIKABANE HIME which was so important as so to make her stand out as the lead character. The male lead also was not particularly interesting. He was weak-willed, soft, pure, and naïve. His naive character struggled a lot for the type of world the series has.It was entertaining enough to make you want to finish it or anticipate the next season but that would be for the sole reason that you want to finish something that you started not because it was so interesting. I am definitely not loving it but not hating it though. why she was searching for the villains. I strongly believe that the story itself was interesting enough but it didn’t work for the series.

I am definitely not loving it but not hating it though.', 'Shikabane Hime / Corpse PrincessRewatched June 2023TV, 25 episodes + OVA, DubbedRecommendedSometimes good anime gets lost in obscurity. In all instances it’s tragic; any viewer who watches one of these hidden gems will end up shaking their head, wondering why so few have actually seen what you’ve been appreciating week after week. It fills me with a bittersweet pride that I can easily recommend Shikabane Hime, known only on Crunchyroll as Corpse Princess.VISUALS [ 8 / 10 ]>>>>>Classic hand-drawn animation paired with beautifully composed backgrounds are what make up the backbone of this action/horror anime. Movements are swift and deliberate. Action is soaring and...brutal.>>>>>The visuals take a hit from the very obvious, deliberate budgeting that happened in several scenes and even some of the later episodes. There are dozens of rough frames in this show, and while none of them ever outright ruin a scene, the particularly rough spots will be distracting to most viewers.>>>>>Overall it’s a strong showing, especially for a production that was clearly stretched thin.SOUND [ 9 / 10 ]>>>>>The OP and EDs all have beautiful, fantastically composed tracks. The english dub was so good that my brain can’t even fathom the concept of watching this anime subbed. The score is quite minimal in this anime; I remember very few instances where background music is noticeable, but when it is utilized it’s expertly done.>>>>>The only real issue comes from the script, which if anything clearly stuck to the original japanese dub a little too closely. The terms ‘Contracted Monk’ and ‘Shikabane Hime’ are said a couple hundred times throughout the twenty-five episodes; at least it felt that way. Viewers who are picky about dialogue will likely be bothered by this anime, regardless of which audio track they choose.SETTING AND PLOT [ 7 / 10 ]>>>>>Let’s just get this out of the way: the ending isn’t very good; probably because the anime technically doesn’t actually end. It’s yet another goddamn Gainax ending, and I am sorry for it; another twelve episodes of Shikabane Hime would have been great.>>>>>Setting the main grievance aside, there are numerous minor writing flaws in every aspect of this anime. This is a full-length TV anime and it will be treated as such; two dozen episodes is enough to work through all relevant plot details. Shikabane Hime makes a point of focusing on the bloody undead underworld of its setting, which is an odd sticking point considering very little about it is ever revealed, even during the final arc of the anime.>>>>>Essentially, every aspect of this anime’s rather interesting, secret society-driven world is either minimally explained or completely open-ended. So much is never touched upon. Relevant details, such as the frequency of undead attacks, how all the damage and carnage are covered up, how these undead monsters are tracked, and several other plot threads are rarely even acknowledged by the show, much less explored in detail. Would the show have been better off just playing into the atmosphere and thematic storytelling so much that the viewer doesn’t care about the writing so much? Definitely. The production comes off as not knowing how to handle horror from a writing standpoint, and that’s a serious issue here since it’s front and center in nearly every episode.>>>>>Of equal concern is the script’s bad habit of constantly telling instead of showing; the two of those are supposed to be reversed, of course. Most shounen anime are guilty of yammering on about random characters’ powers or motivations, but that doesn’t excuse the subpar world building present here, either. A lot of time is wasted on unimportant information that would have been better spent on atmosphere or world building. Horror doesn’t work so well when half of it is explained beforehand.>>>>>What the viewer is presented with here, however minimal it might be, is unexpectedly engaging and thoroughly disturbing. Horrific yokai/wraith hybrid undead monsters called Shikabane roam the streets at night, plagued with regrets strong enough to bring them back from the dead. These monsters often transform into grotesque abominations of decayed flesh, which are so nasty looking the viewer will be somewhere between ‘Oh god what is that!?’ and ‘Kill it with fire!!!’ Already the premise is more compelling than most horror media out there. Then the distinctly japanese anime part comes in, and living-dead girls start battling them with high-end weaponry. Nice. And there are warrior monks too, because the anime needed to sneak the male cast in there somehow.>>>>>The titular Shikabane Hime, the Corpse Princesses; they are beautiful, tragic, fierce heroines that get an unexpected amount of screen time. It is easy to get roped in by the strong premise here, which is exactly what will make or break this show for most viewers. Too apathetic to care about a bunch of pretty, undead killing machines? Yeah, those types won’t care for this anime at all. Everyone else should go grab the popcorn and kick back.CHARACTERS [ 9 / 10 ]>>>>>Now THIS is how you write shounen anime! Relatable but somewhat disturbed cast? Check. Absolutely phenomenal dynamics between characters? You bet. Relationships and interpersonal drama developed gradually over multiple story arcs? Also well executed. Character arcs set up well in advance and subtly foreshadowed to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat? Expertly done.>>>>>Be they main or side characters, everyone is at least interesting if not outright likable. Every character has their moments of contribution to the plot, which is always good in an anime that has a large cast like this one. The focus shifts between characters, usually in pairs since each monk has their own murder maiden. Since screen time is distributed so evenly among the many pairs, the viewer gets a good feel for the dynamic between them, which is nice to see, considering so many anime struggle with their supporting cast. Fascinatingly, for this reason there are monsters and hunters of the week in this anime. There weren’t many standout character moments, which is no issue when the entire cast is so well written.>>>>>First off I’ll mention Machina, the titular Shikabane Hime. She’s one of those relentlessly punished tragic heroines seen from time to time in anime. Machina is surprisingly likable in spite of her fire-and-ice tsundere personality, which comes off as particularly tsun at first. She also gets caught in an odd love polygon which is impossible to discuss without having first seen the show. In general, her entire character arc is heavily gritty and dramatic; even compared to the rest of the cast.>>>>>Ouri fills the role of main protagonist and male lead, which he does decently well. He’s a more sensitive take on the typical shounen protagonist and serves as the audience’s surrogate as he ventures into the world of the dead. The only real flaws in his character are the typical shounen protag density and a tendency to pursue rash, boneheaded plans that a more cautious individual would likely avoid.>>>>>Keisei acts as a sort of parental figure and stands as the show’s favorite warrior monk. As the viewer will quickly realize, Keisei is one of the bros. He’s the cool big brother that everyone wishes they had, which should go great lengths in explaining why he’s such a well written and endearing character. Keisei is smart, courageous and mischievous, all wrapped into one.>>>>>The second warrior monk I’ll mention is Takamasa, whose role shifts around quite a lot as the narrative progresses. He’s sort-of like Ouri’s rival, only with a way sharper and more level-headed demeanor than is typical of shounen protags. He is undeniably likable in spite of his stoic, philosophical characterization. His character beats were all excellent as well.>>>>>Itsuki is more or less the stand-in for all the Hime that don’t get proper screen time, as she is by far the most normal out of the female cast. She was immediately likable with her warm, bubbly personality. Obviously she’s also waifu bait, but who really cares?>>>>>Briefly, I’ll run through the other notable pairs. Rika and Saki were an excellent pair with an interesting dynamic. The handful of moments they received were all excellent. Sadahiro and Akira are another good pair, with even less screen time. Fortunately all of it was well-written and typically entertaining; Sadahiro is basically the lovable rogue but as a monk instead.PACING AND PRODUCTION [ 7 / 10 ]>>>>>Corpse Princess is paced surprisingly well overall, with the only real complaint being that the plot was a little slow. Too much time was spent on the same handful of recurring themes; time better spent building atmosphere and giving the viewer more excellent action scenes to enjoy. Again, show; don’t tell. Certain scenes early on were too long as well; likely a result of the studio not having found their stride yet.>>>>>Regarding the early production in general, Machina likely needed more screen time early on for characterization. She comes off as too sharp and prickly in the beginning. Introducing her character dynamic a couple episodes earlier would have done a lot for early arcs.>>>>>The show plays into its themes too strongly on a few occasions, making the impact of certain story arcs somewhat diminished. The studio never did quite find their stride during dialogue scenes, either. Broadly speaking, dialogue needed to be de-emphasized in favor of much better pacing overall. Production constraints were not handled very well either, with early episodes being a lot more consistent than later ones.>>>>>Finally, the show was set up for a third season, which was desperately needed to finish its final story arc, which was left depressingly incomplete.[Analysis section redacted due to spoilers]OVERALL [ 8 / 10 ]- Underrated, underappreciated anime that shounen and horror fans will probably like.- Visuals are decent, albeit with noticeable budgeting for some scenes.- Action is solid, with unusually brutal fight direction.- God-tier dub, excellent OPs and EDs, all other sound is minimal.- Sub-par, half baked world building that still manages to be interesting.- Gainax patented lack-of-an-ending.- Too much telling; not enough showing. Too much dialogue in many episodes.- Incredibly well-written cast of characters.- Pacing is good but was a bit slow.- Plot has a bad habit of retreading the same themes over and over again.- Main heroine Machina came off as too prickly at first; likely needed more screen time early on.- An anime I like very much. Score is sadly nuked by exposition scenes and lack of an ending.For recommendations, I’ll start with Highschool of the Dead, which is still my favorite anime. It’s a zombie/fanservice mashup show with incredibly good direction and characterization, not to mention godlike action scenes. For seconds, I’ll choose a less gritty action anime in the form of Kill la Kill. It’s an unusual anime, but the action and direction are both excellent, with many unexpectedly deep themes explored. Finally, I’ll go off the rails a bit and recommend the Rising of the Shield Hero, for its dark themes and excellent characterization.That’ll do it for this review.

Precure All Stars Movie DX2: Kibou no Hikari☆Rainbow Jewel wo Mamore!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8133/Precure_All_Stars_Movie_DX2__Kibou_no_Hikari☆Rainbow_Jewel_wo_Mamore,"[""A big pile of precure get together and get into fistfights with a grab bag of villains. For a lot of fans of the franchise that's all you should really need to know, it's hard to go wrong with this formula. This one is fairly early on so there aren't as many precure running around as later all stars movies. It does have Tsubomi and Erika though, which are a couple of my favorite precure ever and in this movie they have a leading role.This one isn't without its problems. The drawing style mismatches Heartcatch characters a bit, can be a little jarring. Characters weren't...as expressive as I'm used to, Erika didn't feel all that Erikaish. Was kind of weird seeing Yuri sitting around doing nothing while all of the danger was happening, she was precure before Erika and Tsubomi after all but whatever. All I really need to feel satisfied are some good henshin sequences mixed with some kung fu and heartwarming moments and this movie has these things. One of the villains is made of solid gold and has a sweet mustache, pretty awesome. Was funny watching Erika and Tsubomi getting rolled nonstop, they were getting their butts kicked lol.
