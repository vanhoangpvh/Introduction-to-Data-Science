Ensemble Stars!! Tsuioku Selection Crossroad,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55125/Ensemble_Stars_Tsuioku_Selection_Crossroad,"[""Personally, this show is not a good adaptation or a good stand alone watch. It's rushed, as it takes about an hour to condense 20+ chapters of a very heavy monologue and dialogue story (which itself is not good to adapt to a show if you're not doing anything innovative tbh). In comparison to the OG story, it cuts down many scenes that are important or loved by fans. Since it's rushed due to time constraint, you lose out on the characterization of some of the characters, so it might be hard for people unfamiliar to the series to care. If you are interested in...the Crossroad's story, you can try reading the OG story online or in the game (which has good voice acting!!). It fleshes all the characters out better. the Crossroad's story, you can try reading the OG story online or in the game (which has good voice acting!!). It fleshes all the characters out better.""]"
Gakuen Senki Muryou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1179/Gakuen_Senki_Muryou,"['Underrated and overlooked gem, it’s the type of sci-fi that’s relaxing to watch and anyone who likes slower paced sci-fi should consider giving it a shot.Plot: 8The plot can be a bit tricky to pin point, half the time it’s going all sci-fi on you with aliens and intergalactic police, the other half of the time it’s going slice of life with students on you. They’re both interesting parts that actually mingle pretty well with eachother. Upon going through this series a second time, it becomes more impressive that there really aren’t any wasted scenes either, they either go to plot or to characters. The...balance between these segments is good too and leans a lot more towards sci-fi as the series goes on.Characters: 8This series could be considered to have two mains as defined by the series: Hajime, whom the story is told from, and Muryou, whom the series is more or less named after. These two aren’t particularly interesting though, they’re not bad, but they just kinda feel...there. Hajime takes everything a bit too laid back for me, like everything and everyone is normal, and even though Muryou is the main mystery in the series, he’s just a little bit dry. The rest of the cast is all great fun though with varying quirks and personalities. They make the series worth watching and show up in both the more slice of life segments and the sci-fi segments. Both adults and children characters are interesting and believable.Presentation: 7The good part is the animation, which was one of the last cel drawn series, it just has that nice hand-drawn feel to it we don’t get quite as much today. Given that Madhouse animated it, it also looks and moves well. The soundtrack on the other hand....well, it’s like someone stole the soundtrack to an elevator and the track had precisely one and a half good songs on it. The soundtrack is pretty awful, it really interferes with the OP and ED, they’re damn near unlistenable is you ask me, but they don’t really disrupt the rest of the show either, so I suppose I can give it a pass, but it’s pretty crappy if you ask me.Overall: 8It might not be for everyone, but people who want more laid back slice of life need look no further and people who like slice of life who don’t mind sci-fi mixed in there should check it out. balance between these segments is good too and leans a lot more towards sci-fi as the series goes on.Characters: 8This series could be considered to have two mains as defined by the series: Hajime, whom the story is told from, and Muryou, whom the series is more or less named after.

Shingu was actually origionally released to be 40+ episodes, but since the following seemed to be small the company that origionally released it cut it down to only 26 (which explains how the ending felt slightly rushed, but it still made me wanting more).Story:The story development had to be my favorite part about it, it was told by the veiwpoint of Hajime who befriends a new kid at school who\'s a little more than what he bargined for. At first I thought it was going to be the average superficial plot,...but it ended up being quite good--especially at the end, but I won\'t give that away.One thing I liked the most was the almost comical way Hajime told his story, I loved how the charters would stop and say ""Why are you talking to yourself?"" or something along those lines while he was giving his narration, the series played it off very well.Art:I usually don\'t take the time out to watch an older series, but the art didn\'t bother me at all because I thought the story was just too amazing to let that stop me from watching it.Sound:I didn\'t really notice it at all, but at least it didn\'t detract from the series in anyway. The opening and closing theme songs were a little cheesy and very 80s anime, but what else was I going to expect? xDCharacter:The characters in this are simply amazingly portrayed. Muryo stands to still be my favorite character in any series by far, only because he was described as not being able to tell if he was daft or a genius. Because the series was cut short, some of the character development had to be left out obviously, but the series did an incredibly job of bringing out unique and refreshing characters in the series--even the ones only seen a few times were interesting.Enjoyment:10/10. Enough said.Overall:It\'s the kind of series that\'s really easy to get through and doesn\'t crap out or have any filler episodes to fill in the gap that people call the ""middle of the series"". I loved it, and it left me feeling that the story really wasn\'t over at all even though the series had ended. but it ended up being quite good--especially at the end, but I won\'t give that away.One thing I liked the most was the almost comical way Hajime told his story, I loved how the charters would stop and say ""Why are you talking to yourself?"" or something along those lines while he was giving his narration, the series played it off very well.Art:I usually don\'t take the time out to watch an older series, but the art didn\'t bother me at all because I thought the story was just too amazing to let that stop me from watching it.Sound:I didn\'t really notice it at all, but at least it didn\'t detract from the series in anyway.

Shingu tells an interesting story and does it in a way that\'s enjoyable to watch, and somehow relaxing. Except for a few scenes Shingu doesn\'t resort to cheap tricks to suck the viewer in to the story nor does it try to play with the viewers emotions. It just tells a story, and not too bad a story at that.Shingu has a wonderful old school feel to it, from the anthem solo at the opening to the wonderful jazz arrangement by Yuji Oono at...the closing everything in between is a delight. The art is well drawn but not overly detailed and the background music is mostly well done jazz. The characters have the old school wide eyed look and one of the main characters is a mystery superbeing whose facial expression rarely ever changes from amusment. The characters have no problem with breaking the 4th wall and speaking directly to the audience (which usually precipitates another characters saying ""Who are you talking to?""There\'s even narration by the main character as was seen in older anime and each episode ends with the narrator saying something like ""all these questions will be answered in the next episode"" which also is another old school touch.For all the old school qualities this is definately a 21st century anime. The concepts behind the main plot seem simplistic at first but give it time, as the episodes continue the plot and various subplots get infinately more complex. Another plus is that Shingu is unabashedly Japanese. I\'m growing tired of anime that try to position themselves in a generic location. There\'s no question that this story takes place in a small Japanese costal town and it\'s refreshing to catch glimpses of Japanese culture.I recoment this anime for anyone that\'s getting tired of the same old giant-robots-save-the-earth story, this one is fresh and refreshing with comfortable familiar feel to it. the closing everything in between is a delight.

Shingu offers up a mix of slice-of-life comedy and sci-fi adventure focused on middle schooler Hajime and his encounters with a group of psychics that make up the student body of his school, as well as living in a town where its residents react with indifference towards alien ships that appear out of nowhere. While having its extraordinary elements, Shingu is surprisingly quite mundane in many instances as most of the town residents take these events as just a typical part of their everyday routine and focusing on the everyday...routines of Hajime and the other students in the middle school. Instead of the former being around just for laughs, it also shows signs that things in the town are not as they seem on the surface which Shingu takes its time at slowly unveiling and eventually fully reveals what connections that the town has to said alien appearances.The slice-of-life element of this series comes from Hajime slowly becoming familiar with the true inner workings of his town and befriending the not-so-ordinary members of the student body at his school like Mouryu and Naiyuta. The show's cast is a likeable and fun bunch offering a nice balance of comedy and character developments. Characters within the series have their developments and dept as they change throughout the show as they deal with the various alien encounters throughout the show. The comedic moments coming from the casual reactions that the town's residents have with their paranormal developments and abilities, as well as some occasions of Hajime breaking the fourth wall by talking to the audience. The only notable area that the series seemed lacking in was any fleshing out of Mouryu's character as depth on his character is kind of limited with some hints dropped over his past yet never elaborated on and compared to most major characters in the series, he didn't show much diversity or change in his character throughout the show.On the visual end, scenery and character designs are mostly standard for the time period in which the series was animated with a reasonable amount of visual detail and subdued color tones with animation shortcuts apparent in the show's action sequences. The music to the series mostly consisted of mellow tracks which work rather well during the show's mundane and comedic moments, yet had nothing too memorable that stuck out for me.Overall, Shingu: Secret of the Stellar Wars was an addicting little title offering a fun mix of comedy and adventure with its cast as they live out a seemingly ordinary life and fight aliens while slowly digging into its mysteries focused on connections that Hajime's small town have with these aliens.

Well, I'm bad at writing reviews, so let's just start somewhere!Gakuen Senki Muryou.... is very interesting.Scratch that.AGH I just finished the series and I have so many questions!Anyway.Gakuen Senki Muryou has an interesting premise, and it has a mix of SciFi and Slice of Life. And lots of secrets. Aliens attack one day, or somewhere, while the main cast goes off to school and has their school shenanigans. It's a weird mix, but somehow it works.The sound. Well. This is from 2001. The songs were nice, I found some a little cheesy, but overall, totally enjoyed it. The voice acting is...great, very good.Characters are varied, all have their uses, personalities, most get some form of character development throughout the series, etc. And they're all important somehow! Most of the main cast gets at least one shining moment of awesomeness, where only they could save the day and they did.When there's anything happening, there's either some very slow-paced plot development, or character development. Everything's useful in some way.There's also a lot of perspective shifts, from the middle schoolers, to the adults, to the other adults, and to the aliens somewhere who-knows-where. It changes a lot, and they all talk about different pressing matters, but somehow it works together.All I really want is some season two, or some answers, but seeing as it's been nearly 20 years since this aired, I doubt there'll be another one... But please. Answers. I need them ;((Although the plot pacing is pretty slow, it's a good story, though it seemed very rushed at the end. I'd still recommend, and as others have said, this is definitely some sort of hidden gem.) great, very good.Characters are varied, all have their uses, personalities, most get some form of character development throughout the series, etc. And they're all important somehow!

Hajime was kind of a bland character but he wasn\'t the worst, I don\'t really think there was a ""worst"" character in the show because they were all very interesting.The story is what...hooked me in, The fact that in the beginning there was some alien thing and none of the towns people cared just seemed kinda funny but still odd.All in all this show is a must watch and I think it\'s a solid 8 hooked me in, The fact that in the beginning there was some alien thing and none of the towns people cared just seemed kinda funny but still odd.All in all this show is a must watch and I think it\'s a solid 8', ""Looks like I am the one of the few people to watch this show and probably the only one to watch it recently if the other review dates are anything to go by but that's a shame because this is one of the best shows I've ever seen. I was hesitant to give it a 10/10 but I realized that despite being somewhat low-key Shingu manages to achieve everything it sets out to do and doesn't fumble once even considering the fact that they had to rush the ending. This show is just chill personified, watching it makes me feel like I'm biking around the...neighborhood with friends on a late summer night in grade school, wrapped up in a blanket on Christmas eve, and enjoying a glass of wine with a lover on a crisp fall day all in one. It's relaxing to the nth degree and for that I will always be thankful for this show. It's also just incredibly well written. It's been a long time since I've watched an anime that achieves the level of literary merit that's usually reserved for highly regarded works of literature but Shingu knocks it out of the park. There are no bad episodes or plot-lines or characters, nothing is ham-fisted or thrown together haphazardly, the show is just flawless in it's execution.It's a shame that so many find it boring and dropped it early on. I can see why they would because the show doesn't really have a lot of action going for it but it's still a shame that so many missed out on this because of the unavoidable misrepresentation in it's trailer/promotional material. It looks too Eva like for people looking for a relaxing show and it's too relaxing for people wanting an a show like Eva but I assure you if you feel any connection to the themes and vibes of this show in the first few episodes then stick with, you won't be disappointed.10/10 neighborhood with friends on a late summer night in grade school, wrapped up in a blanket on Christmas eve, and enjoying a glass of wine with a lover on a crisp fall day all in one.

Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4765/Gunslinger_Girl__Il_Teatrino_OVA,"['The anime didn\'t include much action as I expected coming off from having watched the previous 13 episodes.To me it felt, as if it were either episodes that were closing the entire ""season"" or just full fledged fillers.With that said, I\'d rate the story: 6The storyline in the first 13 eps were flowing acceptably, but the next two eps seemed to be filled with fillers with an ending that was too calm.  The height of the story could have involved all of the girls in the crew in a state of frenzy, I was somewhat disappointed that it only focused...on one of the girls which made the rating only fair, rather than all of them working together in a different scenario as I would have liked to have seen happen.Art: 7The art didn\'t bother me at all- seemed normal for viewing (with a bit of blurry drawing in some scenery here and there), obviously the first season had better animation and contrast, but Teatrino was viewable and I didn\'t have a problem with the artwork other than the fact that I might have been spoiled by the first Gunslinger Girl production.Sound: 6It was the same old same old.  The only thing that I somewhat enjoyed was the opening theme song from the first 13 episodes.. but seeing how these episodes were #14 and #15, there were no theme songs, but music inside the animations which didn\'t seem to stand out (they just passed me by as it played in the background) as soothing or catchy.Character: 7I enjoyed the character interaction when watching each of them transform and several characters learning to be accepting and respectful of others as well as their past grudges.However, I would have liked to see the character\'s inner expressions more rather than the obvious repeat of how they\'ve been feelng on the outside- it may have been that the characters were too calm in a way and may have left a bored feeling (not too bored but something felt empty).Enjoyment: 8Nevertheless, I do enjoy the series and if there was a third season by any chance, I would continue to watch it.  Something about this strikes me as more than just interesting.Overall: 7 on one of the girls which made the rating only fair, rather than all of them working together in a different scenario as I would have liked to have seen happen.Art: 7The art didn\'t bother me at all- seemed normal for viewing (with a bit of blurry drawing in some scenery here and there), obviously the first season had better animation and contrast, but Teatrino was viewable and I didn\'t have a problem with the artwork other than the fact that I might have been spoiled by the first Gunslinger Girl production.Sound: 6It was the same old same old.

Something about this strikes me as more than just interesting.Overall: 7', ""I've gone over most of the anime Gunslinger Girl series. This time around we're finishing the series with the OVA, like Il Teatrino, this one was handled by Artland. Let's see if it's as amazing as the first two series.Story:We open the first episode with Jean meeting with someone from his past who alludes to the loss of an important woman in his life. This gradually transitions to Angelica and Rico dealing with different groups of terrorists. The second episode gets more into Jean and Jose's past while they give Rico and Henrietta some time to relax.The narrative in the OVA is...a lot looser and more based on giving us character back stories than on giving the girls a grand mission to accomplish. We learn a lot about Jean and Jose and how they became involved with the SWA. We also get some insight into why they treat their little sisters the way they do. It's not a bad idea and it does help develop the characters though it may be a bit slow and it's very light on action compared to the series proper. If anything, the action we do get is kind of arbitrary. They need action because it's a franchise where that's a big focus but the whole brief mission they undergo doesn't really have anything to it beyond the brief interaction with Jean and the guy from his past.Characters:The OVA focuses on Jean & Rico as well as Jose and Henrietta. We get brief appearances from various other characters but those four are the important ones. We learn more details about Rico's past and how her life was before she joined the SWA and why she loves her cyborg body and new life so much. Along with the aforementioned information about Jose and Jean's past. Which is pretty nice. It really helps humanise the two of them.Art:The artwork and animation both look good with a strong attention to detail. Very much like Il Teatrino provided.Sound:Shiono Anri, Akutsu Kana, Mito Kouzou and Koyasu Takehiton all return, from Il Teatrino, obviously. And they do perform their roles well. Koyasu and Shiono in particular get some really strong sequences. The music is well composed.Ho-yay:There's not really any. Henrietta and Rico are mainly enjoying a quiet moment with each other and their handlers but in a very platonic way.Areas of Improvement:1. If you want a brief, peaceful respite to wind down from Il Teatrino, you don't need to throw in a short, insignificant action part. I know that's weird to say but it's pretty clear that the meat of the OVA is adding character depth and exploring back stories.2. The whole sequence where Jean is arguing with what's probably a hallucination would work better if it focused more on him and his actions and less on Jose's. We can sort of connect the dots as they apply to Jose without him being mentioned there.3. There really should be more closure for Triela given what happened in Il Teatrino. Yeah, she's in this briefly but it's really not much.Final Thoughts:This OVA really isn't as strong as the series proper. It's not as cohesive and there are definitely elements that noticeably should have been better handled. With that being said, it is nice to see some quieter, less action heavy moments to wrap up Il Teatrino. It's also interesting to learn more about these characters. If you're a fan of Gunslinger Girl's characterisation, I'd definitely recommend this OVA. On the other hand, if you're someone who only watches it for the action this isn't going to be what you're looking for and I definitely wouldn't recommend it as your first foray into the franchise. I'd go with Madhouse's thirteen episode series for that. My rating is going to be a solid 8/10.

Kaitou Joker,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24909/Kaitou_Joker,"[""This review is based on the fact that I have not watched the other series, so I cannot compare the two. This review is just for the show itself, and nothing else.This anime is fairly recent and there is only four episodes at the time of this review. I can say that I haven't enjoyed an anime as much as I did watching Kaitou Joker.In the pros, the characters are all amazing. The creators made a good decision by not making any of the characters really perfect. The show's protagonist (or however you want to consider him), Phantom Thief Joker, makes miracles out of...thin air. But he also has flaws.

Although others compare it to Magic kaito, it isn\'t the freaking same! Just because both are phantom thieves doesn\'t make them copy cat one another..Kaitou joker is a thrilling, comedic relief, adventurous anime that will set you on your toes to cheer for Joker. Although this anime may not seem ideal for those who are looking for a more ""mature and serious"" atmosphere, the anime does have its serious moments. Joker is a magician who has a lot of tricks up his sleeve, from balloon gums to flashing cards and joker\'s funny disguises, there are even times where he...runs out of items to showcase his tricks.. Joker with his sidekick Hachi they embark on adventures to steal the finest artworks..and treasures, in the while they find old friends and defeat the rich who are up to no good.The art is adorable and very animated. Not stiff.  I quite like the art style. Sometimes there may be a mistake (joker going out in disguise in public) or missing a mark, but rarely do they appear and because of all the things going on it\'s easy to overlook it.Sound. Can I just say how much I love the opening? I sing to it. It\'s very catchy and makes you want to dance. Also there are a couple seasons so you can check up on those too.I love jokers voice acting as well. As well as the other characters Hachi, Spade, and Queen. Their voices match up to their character.Characters: the characters each have their own story to them and it is interesting. Joker, queen and Spade are childhood friends who share their story of becoming phantom thieves. They often appear as well, but they are no companions most of the time. Because Hachi is the main sidekick. The villains are your typical rich guys-but since it\'s a gag, they are more comedic.Overall, I really liked this. And I watched all the seasons which I recommend you do if you are taking up this anime because it makes it EVEN better. runs out of items to showcase his tricks..

Let me start with QUEEN's diamond eyes are so attractive and her design just sings cute cute and cute. In the first season, she don't debut until episode 8 if you waiting for her, and at the start she is filled with hatred because of Professor Clover, so no diamond eyes yet.Since this is Season 1 review, I'll give an introduction to Kaitou Joker. It is one great troll anime I've ever seen and it is also a children's show. WOW, I did not know I'd be loving it that much! Things get deadly, even braver than Magic Kaito. There's a really...good villain here, Shadow Joker under Professor Clover and the plot, really good, finishes in Season 2.  I will talk more about Professor Clover in the Season 2 review.I've seen both Kaitou Joker and Magic Kaito, on paper they're similar, but are different. Magic Kaito is putting on a magic show, stealing under police surveillance, then doing a disappearing act using smokescreens and disguises.Kaitou Joker is more fancy and creative being the miracle maker the anime is themed about. Joker is not afraid of being caught or arrested, in fact unlike Kaito Kid he don't need to hide his real identity, he's a full time Kaitou thief living on an airship lol. Joker is much bolder with entrance and escape, there is lots of trolling and fun. Joker likes to disguise a FAKE DOUBLE of people and the stuff he trying to steal in his tricks to confuse. Using a gimmicky tool, Joker cleverly camouflages, pulls off switcheroos, creates distractions, and uses mind tricks to fool people. Joker comes up with brilliant ideas even when things look bad. Kaitou Joker is putting on a game, a challenge.As a person I'm also trolly, that's why seeing Joker trolling so hard when stealing is really hilarious. Joker is trolly with his friends too even when they need help, but he's joking. He would help them, just not out of the reason to be helping. He takes pride as Kaitou Joker with playing cards as main weapon, would never give up, and is simply the best troll.Spade is super cool and is as good at the heist as Joker and he is handsome. He's another Kaitou trained also by the same master Silver Heart and plays as Joker's rival and ally with great enough skills to outsmart him. His assistant Dark Eye and Joker's assistant Hachi also have their competition who can be the better assistant. Spade uses an ice gun and his appearance always makes the episode more interesting.I've talked about Queen in the beginning, she is a villain in this season because of a misunderstanding, but is really a sweet girl. Queen, Spade, and Joker were all friends trained under Silver Heart in the past. She has a diamond sword that is her favorite weapon. Right now she got the angry eyes, but until we see Queen happy again with her diamond eyes, her hatred and struggling side was also good to see. We know it's flat to see a cute girl just being the good and cute girl, even if she is cute lol This is a little out of topic, but from the SukaSuka anime, I was happily surprised to see a picture of Rhantolk crying, cause she is a strong girl, the crying side is cute XD good villain here, Shadow Joker under Professor Clover and the plot, really good, finishes in Season 2.

The structure on the episodes it's usually that the main characters plan a heist, announce it into advance and then execute.The way the heist is realized is usually with disguises, dispositives and gadgets, but it always amuse the viewer. The humour/comedy is the kind of thing that works for kid shows, like the sidekick getting mad at the protagonist because he...doesn't clean his room, or the antagonist hitting his head in a sign while climbing a train on movement. Simple humour but it works.The art style is clearly focused on kids, with strong colors and characters with a good shounen style - colorful costumes and identifiable symbols. The sound has a good work by the voice actors, and the effects are good as expected.The characters are as good as a shounen kids show is - have some flaws so you can identify, but are really good on what the show proposes. They are funny, and some with a small sad backstory, but all in a good mood.Overall, I would recommend this show if you are looking for a simple, cheerful anime but with the protagonist winning by using his wits instead of super-powers or magic. doesn't clean his room, or the antagonist hitting his head in a sign while climbing a train on movement.

What I like about joker is that this is an episodic anime, anime usually has story progression in every episode unless it's has filler or is poorly written but this series is like an action cartoon like Miraculous Ladybug or Danny Phantom where there are stand alone adventures but They also have episodes with story progression. It's a nice change of pace considering it's anime. I...also like the fact that it takes place all around the world And they use that to there advantage like an episode in Greece has Medusa guarding the treasure, in France they fight a painter who can bring paintings to life and in the middle of the ocean they engaged pirates. Not every treasure has be based on a specific place to stand out like the golden Egg or the ones from there flash back episodes. The show's color-scheme matches it tones great with flashy colors too. Any flaws I have is that Joker can kind of be a dick sometimes but it never that bad and some jokes don't always hit. Still I recommend it a lot. also like the fact that it takes place all around the world And they use that to there advantage like an episode in Greece has Medusa guarding the treasure, in France they fight a painter who can bring paintings to life and in the middle of the ocean they engaged pirates.

The main characters are thieves that steal treasure after giving an advanced notice to the police. It\'s a game of Thief vs Cop and whoever wins gets the treasure.The ""Phantom Thief"" idea is a pretty common story in Japan, I\'ve seen lots of shows use the theme to varying forms of success. DNAngel, Phantom Thief Kaito, and Cat\'s Eye for examples. This is one of the few series that really sticks to the phantom thief theme, it stays being about thievery and trickery for its entire run (whereas most other shows get sidetracked by...character drama.) Since it\'s a kid\'s show it can ignore a lot of reality that gets in the way. They can go anywhere in the world, use all kinds of crazy weird tech gizmos, and steal stuff without being weighed down by the consequences.There’s a deeper arching plot line as well. By episode 5 we find out there is a dark backstory to the characters, so there is a bit of intrigue to pull in older viewers.It\'s a fast paced story but it managed to make me like all the characters. All of the side characters get some background, almost all of them have at least 1 or 2 episodes devoted to developing their backstory and personalities. The main characters themselves have plenty of development and go through changes as the story progresses. Friendships and romances are tested and played with, so the story isn\'t too afraid of changing the status quo, but it IS an episodic storyline so any overarching development is slow.Character designs are colorful, playful, and over-the-top. At first it can be a bit much, but the longer I watched the more it grew on me. Due to the fantastical art direction, they had a chance to draw some really stunning backdrops and fight scenes. While it might seem a bit childish with how vibrant it is, I really do think some of the scenes in this show are visually beautiful.Now for as much as I love it there are still a few downsides:* It is still a kids show, so it just doesn\'t go quite deep enough at some junctures. If you are watching this primarily for the dark drama, you will be a little disappointed.* The explanations of gizmos/tools/science shown in-show have varying degrees of accuracy to real science. Some explanations are downright wrong, but this doesn\'t really impact the plot. (If you\'re watching this with kids, be prepared to re-explain some of this bad science haha.)* There are a few side characters that can get annoying due to their repeated catchphrases and tendency towards shouting. Thankfully their screen time becomes less and less as the season goes on.* In the beginning, our main character gets an \'apprentice\' that is super annoying and whiny. But! The apprentice actually gets character development! By the end of the show he’s genuinely a character you like.Great show, I really do love it.

Just watch episode 52 on crunchyroll and you'll know what I'm talking about.I've got the manga of Kaitou joker and the story and tricks are sooo BAD the tricks are so...predictable and has even less meaning. at the start it was really bad.

Fukumenkei Noise,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33203/Fukumenkei_Noise,"['Melodrama has been the talk of the anime community for quite a while now. Most of the time that I see it being mentioned, it\'s in a negative light. As an example ""teenage melodrama"" has become one of the most commonly used terms when discussing shows like Anohana, Angel Beats, Your Lie In April and many others that set their sights at making the viewer cry by the end of it. The characters are often overblown and stereotyped for the sake of achieving that goal, as you can see in the previously mentioned examples. That\'s pretty much the gist of it: create simple, recognizable characters...that the viewer can quickly empathize with just so you can use that to play with their emotions.I\'ve often been an advocate for melodrama. I\'ve always thought that it created a specific kind of feeling that I grew rather fond of. Most of the time it\'s almost as if the characters inside such stories live in a world that\'s created for the purpose of melodrama alone, it tends to feel almost like a theatrical play. It\'s charming, almost hypnotizing, and if the show can build off of it properly it can achieve some stupendous results.Enter Anonymous Noise (Fukumenkei Noise), created by studio Brain\'s Base who\'s been in sort of a commercial slump over the past few years despite having some of the most beloved franchises under their belt. Was this an attempt at making their way back into the market?Certainly not.Fukumenkei Noise almost feels like a fan project and at times it even looks like one! There\'s so much wrong with it that it almost feels like it was created by an amateur, but it wasn\'t! People who made this have a few projects under their belts, maybe not enough to be called ""experienced"", but they surely had to have some knowledge about the industry. So how did it came to this? How did someone look at all of it and thought ""yes, this will sell"". Add some pretty weird restrictions on the countries that it was allowed to air in (UK, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland only on Crunchyroll, rest is only available on Amazon Anime Strike) and you got yourself a huge, incredibly obvious flop, and let me tell you, I certainly won\'t be advocating for this one.*Slight spoilers included*The show features a love triangle between the three main characters. Nino, also known as Alice, is a girl who got into singing at a young age thanks to singing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" with Momo, her male neighbor who later had to leave for certain reasons. During that time she also met Yuzu, a boy who liked to write music that she would meet on the beach. After Momo leaves, he helps her get out of a slump by leaving her a song that she can sing. With the intention of reaching Momo with her voice, Alice keeps singing, and when she enrolls into a new school it turns out that Yuzu is in her class, what\'s more is that Momo attends it too, though in another building. And so the tale of music and love begins.Gosh, it was so hard to make this show sound remotely interesting.Anonymous Noise has problems since the very beginning, as it decides to start off with the older characters, but then immediately jumps back to a flashback for the entirety of the second episode to showcase their backstories. Wouldn\'t the first episode be more effective if we knew those characters since childhood? Seeing them reunite has no meaning, no impact if we don\'t know who they are. Those characters mean nothing to us. The only thing it does is raise confusion. To be honest it would be fine if the second episode didn\'t exist, because the show does a good enough job at telling their backstory through their actions and dialogue, but it has no meaning when we already know it all and just serves as a constant reminder instead of pushing the plot in any direction. It\'s as if the writer didn\'t trust his viewers to follow their story both in childhood and in the present at the same time, so he just put that episode in post-production to make it less confusing as it goes on. That\'s not a good thing to assume. But that\'s only the beginning of the downward spiral.I think that describes this show perfectly. ""Downward\' because this show keeps going lower and lower with its quality the more it goes on, and ""Spiral\' because while doing so, it only spins around in place without even realizing that it\'s heading to its demise.Alice is obsessed with Momo. I\'m not talking ""oh, they\'re just in love"", I\'m talking actually obsessed. For six years she kept on thinking about him, not letting go of her dream to meet him and be together once more. The entire time we follow the group, everything she does, she does for Momo, for a chance of seeing Momo, for even a bit of news about Momo. She joins a band in order to reach Momo with her voice, as she promised him six years ago, she learns how to play guitar because the guitar came from Momo, she started writing a song because it was going to be about Momo. This is a trait that could certainly be intriguing, if only the show could step back from it when Alice is on the screen. At one point, she pretty much becomes a psychopath, she can\'t function without him, when she gets on stage all she can think about is something related to her precious Momo, she turns berserk while singing exactly because of that. It gets really boring after a while, seeing how much did Nino go through to, in the end, remain with the exact same feeling and with the exact same mindset, because trust me, there are so many events that should influence her that it\'s crazy. If that wasn\'t enough she repeated the name of her beloved so much that it even made me realize how silly it is. Who in the world would name their son Momo (No offense to all the Momo\'s out there, but it is silly)? Doesn\'t Momo sound like a name for a pet monkey?Actually, he pretty much is the pet monkey that belongs to this show. What he really is, is a Deus Ex Machina that tries to hide it by having a resemblance of some sort of a personality. He exists solely to have an impact on others, to push them forward alongside the plot. His own motivations are unclear and tangled like some sort of a pasta dish, but one that\'s from a cheap, crappy restaurant that doesn\'t even have a proper sign on the street. He wants to stay with Alice, but he ""can\'t"" because he clearly wouldn\'t be able to compose music anymore. Why even try right? It\'s better to live a life of misery that you\'re living right now without doing so, right? You know, when you have a different character that can clearly think and recognize stuff, especially when he spends so much time with a character that\'s this much in the clouds, having all other characters act so much out of the ordinary that he sets can be obnoxious. That character is Yuzu.Yuzu has a proper development cycle and actually evolves throughout the show accordingly to the things that are happening to him. He has different approaches to Alice as she becomes more and more psychopathic and relentless, he wants to help her, but he keeps getting blocked out. The worst part, is that the guy who is his rival turned out to be his friend. What a coincidence! Even he ends up getting completely screwed by Momo. It\'s like Momo only exists to screw over other characters! It\'s like everything would go correct for them if it wasn\'t for Momo appearing at random moments!Does this add something to the actual value of the show? Does anything add to the actual value of the show? No. This show is so lifeless and forced that it almost chokes and drowns in its own vomit.This show fails to use anything it has at its disposal, and that\'s funny because, you know, it could\'ve chosen what it had at its disposal in the first place.A) Melodrama? The scenes where it\'s utilized the most are inefficient because of the lazy camera work and animation, pretty much every single one of them has this one, long still shot that\'s just plain boring, no matter how impactful it should be. Not to mention that the melodrama is overused to all living hell and repetitive at that. For example, in one of the earlier episodes, three different characters end a conversation by slamming the door. All of them are different people, two of which didn\'t seem to overblow their emotions as much as they did at that moment. At that point, not only do you ruin you characters with inconsistencies, but the usually strong, effective scenes become less impressive when you have four or five grand, overblown moments before it already.B) Music? The MC never shows her actual passion for music, the only thing that seems to push her into it is Momo, for Yuzu it\'s the fact that he writes for Alice, though it is said that his mother forced him not to pursue anything related to music and he finds peace and transcribed his feelings through it, so he\'s good in my book, and last, for Momo it\'s that he needs money and also because of Nino. So if two out of three of them seem to have no passion, how about the secondary cast? Well, they seem to enjoy it, but just like anybody else, nobody ever talks about how they like music, why they like music and why do they do music. They just created a band because they were at a concert..... cool. Even the manager, as he talks about the songs they create, he talks about this being good and this being bad, but what makes him decide that? I sure as hell don\'t hear any difference. Oh wait, I forgot that once he said that Nino lacks ""something"". Thanks for the info buddy. Very useful.C) Love? There is no real reason for Alice to keep on loving Momo for such a long time, nor is there one for Momo to never forget her, maybe it was a turning point in his life or something, but from what we know, there were other instances that could ignite this, multiple ones in fact. Yuzu has the only reasonable explanation out of the three, it\'s that even though he always remembered her as the first person who was so passionate about his songs and someone that he helped, plus the fact that she\'s the reason why he lost his voice drove him somewhat insane over her, his love was only rekindled after he met her six years after. Once again, I don\'t know whose idea was it to pair one character, that has pretty reasonable explanations for his actions and development that corresponds with the events of the show, with all the others to make them look like some brainless teens who seem to live on another planet, but by doing so it made it pretty much impossible to push the suspension of disbelief more than to a certain point. The only justification is that they\'re stupid.And you know what? Despite that, I think I could\'ve liked this show. I mean, last winter, Kuzu No Honkai came out and everyone was an idiot in there too. What that show had, is some clever directing that kept me coming back to it, it made me want to think about what it had to offer, and it also had some good character designs and solid music. Well, that show also had more themes and more exploration, but that\'s not my point. But you know what? For a show that\'s supposed to showcase going completely crazy through singing, for a show that has so many ""important"" moments, this show is absolutely atrocious in all technical aspects.You know how to notice a quality of a music anime straight away? With the music! Surprising, I know.When your entire series, your premise, your core and your heart is based around the meaning and portraying yourself through music, having the characters not care for it is one thing, but having zero FUCKING passion for your soundtrack is a disgrace. I am so mad at this series with how it treats its music. Let\'s even go past the fact the directing for the music has no meaning, the tracks themselves are lazy. There\'s about four different variations of the same song, don\'t worry though, it\'s not like they\'re associated to any type of scene other than ""sad"" or ""happy"". Not only that, but that song, that one constantly repeated track, is the OP. Yup. That\'s how little effort was put into it. Just take the opening, add some different mixer to it and throw it out there. I\'m sure nobody will notice. Do you know how exasperating it is to hear the same song over and over again? There were points where I was relieved to hear a song that isn\'t a remixed opening. I was relieved to hear any form of freshness in the soundtrack of a music show. Let that sink in for a while.The other tracks are somewhat okay, but they\'re not anything good either, they aren\'t pleasing to listen to for me, they don\'t feel like they\'re conveying anything, and since the show doesn\'t give a damn about how to use them, I feel even less inclined to even give them a chance.The visuals are just as dull, perhaps even more, but they aren\'t infuriating, because this isn\'t a show about visuals, they\'re just disappointing. The character designs say nothing about them, so instead they try to fit some jokes around how long Yuzu\'s eyelashes are or how small he is, other characters though, not so much. Nice try by putting yet another thing into JUST ONE CHARACTER YOU IDIOTS. The other visuals, aren\'t half bad, the backgrounds look solid and there were some nice scenes throughout the show, especially the beach which was a highlight of the show for me every time there was a sunset. Let\'s get back to negatives though, this show has absolutely no idea what is it doing with it\'s setting. It just throws in places, you have no idea how do they connect, it lacks a proper sense of direction in every place. They just jump around between places like it\'s nothing. Nino enters a building to go to a studio, next scene she\'s next to the place she\'s supposed to be in and you have no clue whether she had to walk up, down, just through a door, was it a long distance or whatever, nothing. There are even scenes in other parts of that building, but I have no idea where could those ones be placed either. They spend a lot of time in the studio, just like in some other locations like the beach and the school, but if I were to move around any of those locations based on the show alone, I would get lost in a matter of seconds. Oh, and let\'s not forget that absolutely ""teen-like"" sense of fashion. The casual clothes are so ""rock"" and ""punk"", and the costumes that the band plays in are so ""dark"", that\'s what makes them cool, I mean we all know darkness is what teens are into. I honestly don\'t know how do teens in Japan think or what is the current popular style, but I hope it has nothing to do with this. Same goes for the hairstyles. They\'re weird, unlike anything I\'ve ever seen before, especially Nino with the two balls on each top side of her head. She almost looks like an alien when she has those.And then there\'s the directing. Oh dear lord. I\'ll just go out and say it, but you better prepare yourself for the next sentence. Almost all important scenes are either done in CGI or with a still shot.I can\'t take it no more! Writing this one sentence filled me with so much despair that you can\'t even imagine, it\'s so painful even thinking about how much could they ruin each and every scene with awful, despicable directing hurts me internally. I feel genuinely angry.Sure, there\'s animation after the still shot goes away, but it all looks the same: There\'s a dramatic scene incoming, sudden transition into a still shot and a sparkly or serious sound plays. Yuzu kisses Nino = still shot. Yuzu sees Nino smile when she is learning to play the guitar = still shot. Momo says goodbye to Nino = still shot.The CGI is used for the concerts, where Alice goes berserk and people witness the power of her voice. That\'s not bad on its own. What is bad, is that all it does is puts the character models on repeat. They have a cycle of movement. Also, Alice\'s hair when she has the wig on jump around as if they were two springs. Fuck this. I\'m sorry, but I\'m genuinely mad when there\'s so little effort put into a project that some author worked on for hours upon hour. Even if I dislike the way he wrote it, it still doesn\'t deserve this. This is a disgrace to him, I\'m sure that when he wrote those concert scenes, he wanted them to embody what his story can do, but here comes a studio that took everything he did, and through the things that were completely out of his control, wrecked those scenes, as if the repetitive music wasn\'t enough. The people who made this are actual scumbags and I feel no remorse calling them that.Whooo, okay, let me calm down a bit. This is going to be a section where I ramble about some other details that I left out, AKA the Super Spoiler Section.You know how else was the love theme butchered? There were two other relationships that I didn\'t mention, one between that blonde kid Haruno and Suguri, and the other one between her and Yuzu. But where do those go? Absolutely nowhere, not even a bit, not even a tiniest little inch. There are about two or three scenes that indicate the love interested between them, and they never are brought up again. It\'s like the writer felt as if there weren\'t enough romance sub-plots, as there are in other shows, and had to put it in for the sake of it. There\'s nothing to them, the characters that they try to do something with end up being nothing anyway.Yeah, I didn\'t even mention the side characters before because they are nothing, and yet the author tried to make two of them into something with such little effort and care. They don\'t have any resemblance of a personality outside one quirk, like the drummer who is always straightforward, or the two lovebirds that I mentioned, but they try to make Nino interact with them and have some sort of meaning to her. Like the girl vocalist, who later leaves to join Momo\'s band becomes her friend, but her relationship means nothing to either of them in the end. It\'s like they just needed another female character for Nino to talk about certain topics with. She has nothing to offer. And same goes for the blonde guy, who says things, but he is never established to any degree. And the drummer boy? He\'s practically nonexistent, the only time he has something to say is when he goes for the same joke of ""I""m really straightforward"", so if you see him doing anything, that means it\'s coming sooner or later. There\'s also the manager who likes to not give any details on his work and do nothing while trying to feel important. That\'s not his character description, that\'s just how I see him upon finishing the show.Speaking of finishing this show, it certainly was rushed. The whole sub-plot about Yuzu\'s and Momo\'s mothers? Yeah, there were maybe three scenes for each, both ended as abruptly and added drama that only served as, well, more drama. The characters work perfectly fine without it, it only adds more scenes that, you know, could be used to add some stuff to the already riddled with holes and jumps in logic plot. Oh, and let\'s not forget to add a single line of dialogue at the last scene concerning Yuzu\'s mother that indicates another sub-plot inside a sub-plot, as it turns out music somehow killed his father. Yeah sure, the 11th episode seems like the right place to do it, right before the climax of the main plot with Nino and Momo. Those people really have no idea how to do this, don\'t they? This is just trying to appeal to so many people that it ends up appealing to nobody, every little detail that someone could relate to lasts so short that there\'s no way to develop it. ""Jack of all trades. Master of none"". Fits perfectly. I mean, it\'s fine if people feel like it relates to them on a personal level, but it doesn\'t represent a single thing well enough to call it a proper representative in my mind.By the way, does Nino even know anything about Momo? Because she seems to love him for so long, but what does she even know about him once they see each other again? He clearly isn\'t the same after all this time, so how can she still love him, how can she keep telling herself that she loves him? All it brings to her and others is pain, but what she seems to love isn\'t Momo, as in a person, but Momo, as in an image that she had when they were younger. That\'s what really makes me question this series, it pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. You would think that after all she suffers and after all the suffering it caused others to undergo, she would drop it. The explanation for not doing that, is that she loves Momo, but when you think about it, she actually doesn\'t, as I explained. It\'s a big faceplant right from the get-go really.And now let me tell you about the one thing that I like, it\'s a singular scene, with a singular idea. Yuzu can\'t sing, he lost his voice and can\'t recover it. When Nino finds out it\'s because he wanted to make her stop crying when they were little, he runs off to the roof, and she follows. They confront each other and he finds peace when Alice starts singing. What Yuzu does, is lip-sync to her singing, and calls her ""his voice"". Like, this is a great, well thought out, impactful scene (even though it consists of characters standing and moving their enormous mouths a bit, so pretty much a still shot). Too bad all this wasn\'t set up properly, it was a rushed sub-plot introduced in the same episode. They sort of blew their load early, because no scene came even close to this level of thought.Oh, and I like the ED. It\'s nice, peaceful. The OP is fine too, but when you hear it so much it became annoying.This anime is like a leech. Upon finishing it I was almost drained out of all of my creativity and passion for anything. After finishing writing this review, all I wanted to do is sleep, because I believed that my dream could create a far better story than this show, this piece of fiction that was actually released as a 12 episode series, possible with quality checking and some sort of vision behind it. Turns out, I was right. My random, stupid dream about me riding a watermelon and crashing into my dad riding on a banana, and then us reuniting because we\'re close to each other after all, was more interesting and more expressive than this. So I want to warn you, that if you have any plans to write something soon, maybe even searching for inspiration on a similar topic, don\'t go searching here. Hell, if you just want to pick a random show, don\'t. You know what, don\'t even pick it up if you\'re looking for a bad show, if there\'s a risk that it could suck you dry as it did with me, why risk it? Turn back wanderer, you have traveled too far into the anime depth. Don\'t go any further, or I can\'t guarantee you\'ll come back in one piece. Your imagination might be left behind.As always, this is purely my opinion, but I can\'t recommend you to develop your own. that the viewer can quickly empathize with just so you can use that to play with their emotions.I\'ve often been an advocate for melodrama. I\'ve always thought that it created a specific kind of feeling that I grew rather fond of. Most of the time it\'s almost as if the characters inside such stories live in a world that\'s created for the purpose of melodrama alone, it tends to feel almost like a theatrical play. It\'s charming, almost hypnotizing, and if the show can build off of it properly it can achieve some stupendous results.Enter Anonymous Noise (Fukumenkei Noise), created by studio Brain\'s Base who\'s been in sort of a commercial slump over the past few years despite having some of the most beloved franchises under their belt. Was this an attempt at making their way back into the market?Certainly not.Fukumenkei Noise almost feels like a fan project and at times it even looks like one! There\'s so much wrong with it that it almost feels like it was created by an amateur, but it wasn\'t! People who made this have a few projects under their belts, maybe not enough to be called ""experienced"", but they surely had to have some knowledge about the industry. So how did it came to this? How did someone look at all of it and thought ""yes, this will sell"". Add some pretty weird restrictions on the countries that it was allowed to air in (UK, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland only on Crunchyroll, rest is only available on Amazon Anime Strike) and you got yourself a huge, incredibly obvious flop, and let me tell you, I certainly won\'t be advocating for this one.*Slight spoilers included*The show features a love triangle between the three main characters. Nino, also known as Alice, is a girl who got into singing at a young age thanks to singing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" with Momo, her male neighbor who later had to leave for certain reasons. During that time she also met Yuzu, a boy who liked to write music that she would meet on the beach. After Momo leaves, he helps her get out of a slump by leaving her a song that she can sing. With the intention of reaching Momo with her voice, Alice keeps singing, and when she enrolls into a new school it turns out that Yuzu is in her class, what\'s more is that Momo attends it too, though in another building. And so the tale of music and love begins.Gosh, it was so hard to make this show sound remotely interesting.Anonymous Noise has problems since the very beginning, as it decides to start off with the older characters, but then immediately jumps back to a flashback for the entirety of the second episode to showcase their backstories. Wouldn\'t the first episode be more effective if we knew those characters since childhood? Seeing them reunite has no meaning, no impact if we don\'t know who they are. Those characters mean nothing to us. The only thing it does is raise confusion. To be honest it would be fine if the second episode didn\'t exist, because the show does a good enough job at telling their backstory through their actions and dialogue, but it has no meaning when we already know it all and just serves as a constant reminder instead of pushing the plot in any direction. It\'s as if the writer didn\'t trust his viewers to follow their story both in childhood and in the present at the same time, so he just put that episode in post-production to make it less confusing as it goes on. That\'s not a good thing to assume. But that\'s only the beginning of the downward spiral.I think that describes this show perfectly. ""Downward\' because this show keeps going lower and lower with its quality the more it goes on, and ""Spiral\' because while doing so, it only spins around in place without even realizing that it\'s heading to its demise.Alice is obsessed with Momo. I\'m not talking ""oh, they\'re just in love"", I\'m talking actually obsessed. For six years she kept on thinking about him, not letting go of her dream to meet him and be together once more. The entire time we follow the group, everything she does, she does for Momo, for a chance of seeing Momo, for even a bit of news about Momo. She joins a band in order to reach Momo with her voice, as she promised him six years ago, she learns how to play guitar because the guitar came from Momo, she started writing a song because it was going to be about Momo. This is a trait that could certainly be intriguing, if only the show could step back from it when Alice is on the screen. At one point, she pretty much becomes a psychopath, she can\'t function without him, when she gets on stage all she can think about is something related to her precious Momo, she turns berserk while singing exactly because of that. It gets really boring after a while, seeing how much did Nino go through to, in the end, remain with the exact same feeling and with the exact same mindset, because trust me, there are so many events that should influence her that it\'s crazy. If that wasn\'t enough she repeated the name of her beloved so much that it even made me realize how silly it is. Who in the world would name their son Momo (No offense to all the Momo\'s out there, but it is silly)? Doesn\'t Momo sound like a name for a pet monkey?Actually, he pretty much is the pet monkey that belongs to this show. What he really is, is a Deus Ex Machina that tries to hide it by having a resemblance of some sort of a personality. He exists solely to have an impact on others, to push them forward alongside the plot. His own motivations are unclear and tangled like some sort of a pasta dish, but one that\'s from a cheap, crappy restaurant that doesn\'t even have a proper sign on the street. He wants to stay with Alice, but he ""can\'t"" because he clearly wouldn\'t be able to compose music anymore. Why even try right? It\'s better to live a life of misery that you\'re living right now without doing so, right? You know, when you have a different character that can clearly think and recognize stuff, especially when he spends so much time with a character that\'s this much in the clouds, having all other characters act so much out of the ordinary that he sets can be obnoxious. That character is Yuzu.Yuzu has a proper development cycle and actually evolves throughout the show accordingly to the things that are happening to him. He has different approaches to Alice as she becomes more and more psychopathic and relentless, he wants to help her, but he keeps getting blocked out. The worst part, is that the guy who is his rival turned out to be his friend. What a coincidence! Even he ends up getting completely screwed by Momo. It\'s like Momo only exists to screw over other characters! It\'s like everything would go correct for them if it wasn\'t for Momo appearing at random moments!Does this add something to the actual value of the show? Does anything add to the actual value of the show? No. This show is so lifeless and forced that it almost chokes and drowns in its own vomit.This show fails to use anything it has at its disposal, and that\'s funny because, you know, it could\'ve chosen what it had at its disposal in the first place.A) Melodrama? The scenes where it\'s utilized the most are inefficient because of the lazy camera work and animation, pretty much every single one of them has this one, long still shot that\'s just plain boring, no matter how impactful it should be. Not to mention that the melodrama is overused to all living hell and repetitive at that. For example, in one of the earlier episodes, three different characters end a conversation by slamming the door. All of them are different people, two of which didn\'t seem to overblow their emotions as much as they did at that moment. At that point, not only do you ruin you characters with inconsistencies, but the usually strong, effective scenes become less impressive when you have four or five grand, overblown moments before it already.B) Music? The MC never shows her actual passion for music, the only thing that seems to push her into it is Momo, for Yuzu it\'s the fact that he writes for Alice, though it is said that his mother forced him not to pursue anything related to music and he finds peace and transcribed his feelings through it, so he\'s good in my book, and last, for Momo it\'s that he needs money and also because of Nino. So if two out of three of them seem to have no passion, how about the secondary cast? Well, they seem to enjoy it, but just like anybody else, nobody ever talks about how they like music, why they like music and why do they do music. They just created a band because they were at a concert..... cool. Even the manager, as he talks about the songs they create, he talks about this being good and this being bad, but what makes him decide that? I sure as hell don\'t hear any difference. Oh wait, I forgot that once he said that Nino lacks ""something"". Thanks for the info buddy. Very useful.C) Love? There is no real reason for Alice to keep on loving Momo for such a long time, nor is there one for Momo to never forget her, maybe it was a turning point in his life or something, but from what we know, there were other instances that could ignite this, multiple ones in fact. Yuzu has the only reasonable explanation out of the three, it\'s that even though he always remembered her as the first person who was so passionate about his songs and someone that he helped, plus the fact that she\'s the reason why he lost his voice drove him somewhat insane over her, his love was only rekindled after he met her six years after. Once again, I don\'t know whose idea was it to pair one character, that has pretty reasonable explanations for his actions and development that corresponds with the events of the show, with all the others to make them look like some brainless teens who seem to live on another planet, but by doing so it made it pretty much impossible to push the suspension of disbelief more than to a certain point. The only justification is that they\'re stupid.And you know what? Despite that, I think I could\'ve liked this show. I mean, last winter, Kuzu No Honkai came out and everyone was an idiot in there too. What that show had, is some clever directing that kept me coming back to it, it made me want to think about what it had to offer, and it also had some good character designs and solid music. Well, that show also had more themes and more exploration, but that\'s not my point. But you know what? For a show that\'s supposed to showcase going completely crazy through singing, for a show that has so many ""important"" moments, this show is absolutely atrocious in all technical aspects.You know how to notice a quality of a music anime straight away? With the music! Surprising, I know.When your entire series, your premise, your core and your heart is based around the meaning and portraying yourself through music, having the characters not care for it is one thing, but having zero FUCKING passion for your soundtrack is a disgrace. I am so mad at this series with how it treats its music. Let\'s even go past the fact the directing for the music has no meaning, the tracks themselves are lazy. There\'s about four different variations of the same song, don\'t worry though, it\'s not like they\'re associated to any type of scene other than ""sad"" or ""happy"". Not only that, but that song, that one constantly repeated track, is the OP. Yup. That\'s how little effort was put into it. Just take the opening, add some different mixer to it and throw it out there. I\'m sure nobody will notice. Do you know how exasperating it is to hear the same song over and over again?

And even if you had complete tone-deafness or the goodwill towards anime temporarily impaired your hearing, you'd still be left with the painfully generic, gloomy teenage romance plot between two flavors of generic tsundere boys: the adorably irate pipsqueak (the M for the yaoi fanfiction) and the sexy serial killer that blushes (the S for the yaoi fanfiction) and the subject of their passive-aggressive uncaring-caring: a walking-talking migraine stuck in a girl's body.Though, to be fair, this entire series is pretty much a migraine in animated form...So in short:- uninspired and grating story- constant melodrama- tiring and annoying characters- music comprised solely of off-beat, false notes- not entertaining even in an ironic wayThis anime is simply an unpleasant experience that takes a lot out of you with every second spent watching it. - capable of enduring teenage melodrama without any rhyme or reason (pun intended)- looking for punishment for your recently commited homicide or child rapeDO NOT watch it if- your hearing is at least somewhat functional- you ever wonder what kind of school allows kids to just vansih for weeks to live out their breathtakingly inane traumas that come with incredibly lacking love triangles- you still want to believe in the goodness of musicMy personal opnion:A music anime where the lead somehow fails to hit every single note in every single song, completely ignores the bpm most of the time and is still considered to be a godsent singing wonder is beyond dreadful.

But one day, Momo had to move and without Nino knowing, he disappeared, leaving her alone with her pain. That's where she met Yuzu, a young song writer that will eventually write songs just for Nino to sing.~What I felt:~It was WAY too overdramatic. You know, that feeling when you find a serie that could be good but then is so overdramatic that it turns cringy? Yeah...that's what...it felt like. Every episode was a battle of feeling ''trying to reach this or that person''. Which was pretty annoying to a certain point.ART (6)~The art was pretty decent but the CGI, 3D animation of the concerts really threw me off. Those moments were really ugly and sadly, was bothering me more than anything. The problem is, when something bothers my eyes, I can't focus on the main plot, music and dialogues. Also, most of the CGI scenes were re-used few times in a same sequence. Other than that, the characters designs were pretty diverse and enjoyable. ~SOUND (8)~The music was probably the only thing that made so I didn't drop the serie. (Even tho those ''la la la la'' were pretty annoying after few episodes) I was glad to finally hear real lyrics and the main character's voice.Now, I'm a huge fan of Hayami Saori (Nino's seiyuu), she dubbed many characters that I love and I always enjoyed her singing. BUT, why the hell did she have to sing in such a weird way as Nino? She sounded better in the last episodes but at the beginning, I couldn't understand how people (in the anime) would enjoy listening to her or even want her to be part of the group. Her bersek moments were terrible. And to be honest, I liked Miou's voice better...it was more controlled and prettier.~CHARACTER (5)There are 3 noticable characters in this serie:Nino: The main girl who is obsessed with her childhood friend even tho he hurt her many times. Every episode, she would say ''Momo'' about 10 to 20 times (if not more), making me hate the cute and beautiful word that is 'momo'.Momo: The useless, selfish childhood friend of Nino. That messes with Nino's feelings and would hurt her all the time.Yuzu: Probably the best character in the entire anime. He is kind and think about other people's feelings.The love triangle goes like this:Yuzu>Nino><MomoBut sincerely, Momo only shows..wait..no...Momo only SAYS he likes her in the last 2 episodes. Which came out of no where, he just treated Nino like sh*t the entire anime. Yes, it really pisses me off. Yuzu obviously cares more about Nino but honestly, if he doesn't end up with Nino, I won't be mad, he sincerely deserves better than an idiot with the name Momo stuck in her empty head shell.ENJOYMENT (6)Most of the episodes were frustrating but I do think there was potential for better character developement. I feel like there are lots of plot holes (Momo's parents, Yuzu's mom, Miou, In NO hurry, etc.) making me question most of the characters personality and backstory.OVERALL (6)I did wait every week to watch the new episodes, so I can't say I disliked the anime. To be fair, there were good and bad moments, counter balancing themselves, making this anime nor a masterpiece, not a pile of crap. So my rate is 5 (average) + 1 more point (for Yuzu, my man) so that gives Fukumenkei Noise a fair 6 out of 10. Meaning this anime is FINE.I feel like there will be a next season. I might (or might not) watch it, depending on my mood. it felt like. Every episode was a battle of feeling ''trying to reach this or that person''.

It doesn't even matter if you don’t like romance. Something really good can captivate the attention of people who aren’t even fans of the genre, and i’ll tell you, this is no groundbreaking show. I’ve seen it maybe 5 times in different variations, just mixed and matched here and there.-Story-4/10Fukumenkei is the exact epitome of it’s genre. It takes on a few cliches we’ve seen not once, but a trillion times:1.) The childhood friend love interest2.) A love triangle3.) The dense/oblivious to everything main characterNow I must say though, just because an anime has these things...doesn't automatically make it bad, but it is something to note. It's all about how the show uses/portrays these things.I’d have to say the biggest fail of this anime is the romance portion. These characters are incredibly melodramatic, unrealistic, and annoying. It is especially hard to take their “love” for one another seriously. A good backstory is imperative for this type of series;  Nino, Yuzu, and Momo’s stories aren’t something that seem to be anything more than a simple childhood crush that went on for way too long. They were children, it was not a practical enough love for them to still have feelings after six years. Even if it were, the show does a terrible job of portraying it that way, it's very hard to take seriously. None of it really makes much sense, now does it? and on top of that, after six years Nino expects everything/one to be the same. It really just irked me when things easily could have been resolved or talked though. I guess some of the charters have a case of feels too strong to have any sense of logic.-Music/Sound-6/10One thing Fukumenkei does well is showing it’s characters devotion/drive to music, each (main) character has their own reasons for striding to success. Gradually through the series Nino grows closer to In No Hurry and their music until they come together. Now, Nino’s voice is a questionable one, it isn’t one you’d expect to be praised the way it is in the show. However, Nino’s voice served to portray her emotions and personality, and it did just that. She isn’t supposed to sound as tamed and Miou, the point was to make her sound out of control. Even her band members see this and point it out. So it isn’t really that people are praising how well she sings, it’s how crazy she gets on stage, how raw her emotions are.The few twists regarding the band are also rather cliche and predictable, however, the band itself is by no means bad. I enjoyed their music, even wished I could have gotten more of it.-Characters-5/10The characters of Fukumenkei aren’t anything special, we’ve seen them all before. Although they do fit well for this type of story. Nino is a strong willed, free spirited girl, she gave her all in whatever task she had in front of her (unless Momo came rollin’ in). Yuzu had a similar quality to him, although he's a bit more stubborn but caring in his own way. Momo. Momo's got issues the majority of the anime, honestly I found him annoying- his emotions and actions contradict and his view of Nino is very confusing. His character isn’t as developed as Nino’s or Yuzu’s. Side characters like Ayumi and Yoshito barely had any real showtime or character development. Miou was the only character besides the mains that we really have some sort of understanding personality wise.-Art-Eh/10I am no fan of this stows art style but it for sure works well for the story/feel overall.Definitely thought there were moments where the characters looked pretty odd though.-Enjoyment/Overall-Eh.That’s really what this should should be given, an eh. Because that’s all it really is. Despite everything, I don’t hate this anime, no. Although I was very disappointed by it. Music/romance anime is one of my all time favorite genres.Fukumenkei falls short on so much, it attempts to be something good while having the same regurgitated themes we commonly see in this type of anime, without even trying to use them in an interesting way. Fukumenkei is a shit storm of illogic melodrama. The show is cliche to the point where things become predictable; we see Nino distraught over Momo, pushing herself to sing while Yuzu admires her in silence SEVERAL times. I felt like something was missing to make me feel more empathy towards the characters. This may just be because I found Nino's backstories with Yuzu and Momo childish, but the characters overall are pretty childish.In No Hurry’s  journey as a band/ their music was the highlight of this show for me. Everything else definitely feel way too short.If you’re a fan of these genres, i’d say check it out. Mind you, this is all just one opinion.5/10It’s cliche, it’s  painfully average, it’s lackluster.In other words it’s most  shoujo. doesn't automatically make it bad, but it is something to note.

It isn\'t that hard people come on, even kids know this shit..Nope? Well let me put you out of your misery and tell you.....IT\'S FUCKING TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR!I know, i know you expected something from Cradle of Filth maybe but no, this anime makes Dani Filth and his friends look like a christian metal band from Illinois...What? You don\'t believe me? Well good news cause your instinct was right on the money! No this anime is trying to be Your Lie in April by not being Your Lie in April. I know it sounds interesting but trust me, it isn\'t that at all. Cause what AN did to differentiate itself from YLIA was shittier animation.But more on that later on, for now let\'s see what\'s the story, shall we?So, Nino(the female MC) is a girl who had a friend named Momo and every night they would sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star together under the starry sky. One day though Momo had to be put down cause he had rabies...No he didn\'t actually cause that would be interesting in a weird, twisted way and AN doesn\'t do either! With Momo gone Nino did the healthy thing and did what every other kid does....Put on a mask and play for a deathcore band!Damn i can do this all day and will never get old..Nope she really did put on a mask like those they wear in hospitals to avoid expressing her emotions and scream.....Yup, not fucking with you this time, even i with my wild imagination couldn\'t come up with such a Freudian approach...At this point in the anime begins what i\'d like to call ""the storm of weirdly convenient just so happens situations""... So one day, she meets another boy named Yuzu who likes to write compositions in the sand at the beach. Nino reads the music and begins singing the notes which makes Yuzu hard. Yuzu said some crap about finding his voice and then left...Poor Nino was all alone again and fast forward a few years Nino enters high school where she finds out that Yuzu goes to the same school as her and is a part of the Cultural Music Club which she later becomes a member discovering their dark secrets and somewhere along the way she also finds out that Momo is attending the same school as well.At this point i\'m sure you all are scratching your heads and one question echoes in your brains. WHERE THE HELL WHERE HER PARENTS?And here begin many of the issues i had with this anime. I mean this girl has some major issues and the most obvious one was wearing a mask for no apparent reason for most of her life and nobody wonders what the hell is going on with her? Then it\'s her crush with a boy which if you really sit and think about is....I don\'t know....Maybe let\'s call it disturbing? Not normal in any way? Sure we all had that guy/girl we really liked as kids but i don\'t think we gave it a second thought after, say, 2 days. It\'s called moving on with your damn life.Next in line is Yuzu who i can only describe as a cuck(please don\'t make me explain google it). He has a crush with Nino since childhood and never forgot about her..He even went and made a band with her in mind in the hopes that she\'ll join him and sing together ritualistic songs to summon the dark lord himself and make little satan loving children..But as is always the case, deals with the devil don\'t go as planned and he ends up being an emotional cructh for Nino to use to overcome her feelings for someone she hasn\'t seen since the medieval times. Even when he manages to ""confess"" his feelings he quickly falls back to his cuck form and prompts her with all of his might to jump onto Momo and drain him from his bodily fluids.As for Momo.....Dear lord deliver me from characters with no characterization. Sure Momo has some backstory which was explored for all 3 seconds but apart from that i think he was there just to be there so we can be reminded that he exists...Apart from the fact that Nino calls his name every 3 god damn seconds...And no i\'m not being stupid i swear, she litterally says ""Momo"" every 2 lines or so.So far this seems like twilight but even more stupider...So where does the music fit in?Like i said Yuzu has a band which Nino joined later on to become their vocalist. This band is their secret thus they all wear masks and disguise as characters from Alice in Wonderland..So like Slipknot but more mainstream..I really liked this part of the anime cause the band was alt rock and all was well until the one who voiced Nino started singing. Make no mistake she has a nice-ish voice but it\'s not for this kind of music. Rock needs guts and rasp and soul which she didn\'t have..For a pop band she would be perfect cause that needs no skill at all but rock is another realm of vocal ranges altogether. The end result is appaling, she sure tries her best to sound the part but ends up putting out screams that animals make when they die. I don\'t know who thought she was the best pck but i hope you rot in hell for all eternity for this sacrilege.To add insult to injury all performances by the band are in CG, which seems to be a trend in anime these days cause it saves money and time...So naturally the on screen product looks like watching the fat, sweating face of Ron Jeremy in a porn film when he climaxes.. Not a beautiful sight is it? Well fuck you, you\'re gonna get CG in many other scenes as well..Feeling the burn in your eyes already?And don\'t think that the rest of the animation is even remotely better cause it isn\'t. I found many instances where the animation was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy inconsistent and weirdly scenes where even the food depiction was better than the one for characters.I don\'t think there is more to say about this anime..Unhealthy obssessions, love triangles, the characters and their motivations are paper thin and at times borderline retarted and of course twinkle twinkle...And i\'m not joking about this part of the anime, there\'s an entire episode with nothing but that. The conclusion of the series is just a huge leap back to where it all started, with Momo ditching Nino again because his evil mom threatened to hurt her, Nino quitting the band without any explanation for it, Yuzu quitting the band without any explanation for it, while helping Nino get dicked down by Momo…So if you want to watch rehashed scenes over and over again, a story that goes nowhere and characters that play no part in their own story please do go ahead.. a song so brutal and technical, the likes of which can only be heard from bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Lamb of God, Slipknot etc.Wanna take a guess which one i\'m talking about?

In NO Hurry To Rush are an alternative band, and I love the music sequences, they're enjoyable. The story is a cliche in every sense of the word, but it's enjoyable if you like a cliche and like a love triangle. The art style isn't usually up my alley, but I think that the studio did a great job with it....if you like listening to alternative music, if you like teenage drama and if you're into a good love triangle, this is definitely for you. if you like listening to alternative music, if you like teenage drama and if you're into a good love triangle, this is definitely for you."", 'At first glance, Fukumenkei Noise might be assumed to be just like any other typical shoujo series. There\'s the self-insert female protagonist, the love triangle filled with boys who have jerkish traits, the usual combination of factors of what makes a shoujo romance series. However, unlike the typical shoujo series, it provides very good clear reasons for why the characters are the way they are as well as a thematic that fits the feel of the show. Even if it is fairly typical, some key elements allow it to shine.The characters account for a lot of what makes the show so good, and one prime...example of that is Nino. Nino is like most shoujo MCs. She falls completely in love with the jerk-like male MCs and thinks about them all of the time. (Although at least she is more aware rather than being in constant denail.) Now in most cases, this can be annoying as it takes what could be a complex interesting character who should have multiple layers of interest and simplifies them down to just liking boys. As if boys are all that matters to a girl. However, Nino is able to subvert this with a couple of key facts.Most female shoujo protagonists are just your average girl. They\'re boring, dull, and average. Nino isn\'t average. Nino is weird. Nino is troubled. While everyone else does the normal school life, Nino walks around with big headphones listening to music and spends lots of time singing aimlessly at the beach. She doesn\'t appear to think on the same wavelength as others do, and she frequently doesn\'t listen to others. Even in the show, there were multiple times where the characters told her that she was weird, and her response was to shrug and say, ""Yeah I\'m weird. That\'s who I am."" She even says she wears a surgical mask because it helps her from screaming. Repeatedly she\'s had spasms on stage and erupted into an unpredictable emotional mess. None of these actions are normal. Some of them may be experienced by certain subcultures, but rarely would those people consider themselves as normal. Every bit and part of her down to the way that she things directly flies in the face of a normal girl. And because of that, it\'s much easier to accept her tunnel vision.Especially when one digs into her past life. As in the premise, she got close to both of these boys and twice where they cruelly ripped away from her world. She got close to them and cared about them only for them to disappear. I too had a childhood that consisted of hopping from friendship group to friendship group. I changed schools twice in elementary school, and twice did my friends move away. I didn\'t have a constant friendship group. I didn\'t have friends that lasted longer than a year. It messes with your mind, especially when you\'re that young. It feels like nothing will last forever, and it feels like only a matter of time before fate rips you apart. And if she\'s anything like me, and I think she is, when this is combined with the need and want to be close to others it results in a mindset that can idealize someone so heavily, and eye them so much, that they become one of the most important things. They are what matters. They are the reason for moving forward. Combine this with other emotional problems and it becomes a disaster. The disaster that Nino is.I don\'t want to belabour the point too much but there were moments that Nino had that reminded me of myself.  There were neurotic moments that she had that may seem crazy to most but mirror exact moments and things that I have done before. For who she is Nino is a great character, one that likely also suffers from mental illness, and that\'s what makes her so relatable and perfect for the role. She isn\'t a competent average girl reduced down to just BOYS, she\'s a struggling obsessive mess who wants the happy times of her childhood back.And then there are the boys. In the usual shoujo series, the boys are dicks with pure hearts inside even if they never show it. And overall one could say that these boys fit into these roles, however, they also break apart from them at the same time.In the case of Yuzu, he is possessive and wants Nino all to himself. There are parts of him that want her to be his and only his. But at the same time, he wants the best for her as well. Throughout the show, he is stuck between trying to further himself and his own goals or whether to support Nino in her goals. Sometimes he takes steps towards his own wants grabbing her and pushing her closer to him, while other times he listens to her. He listens to her wants and tries to help her out and give her advice. He tries to help her make her goal. He routinely does this, weakening his own position but he does it for her. It\'s the strive of love where one wants something so badly but they also want their love to be happy. It\'s a feeling that is so relatable and so human. Humans aren\'t perfect beings, they have conflicting wants. And the way that Yuzu expresses it I can understand it so well.Although I don\'t relate to Momo nor do I care for him much I do think he\'s also another really interesting character who has his own baggage. His struggles are the struggles between maturity and the childlike wants that still reside in a person. While he wants to have Nino and go back to the times of yore, he has a job and has things that he has to take care of. He can\'t go back to his sweet escape, and he feels like he has betrayed Nino, and betrayed his childhood. He takes his steps forward never looking back. The struggle he faces is another struggle that many face. When we grow up can we still desire for the things we wanted before? Our childhood dreams? In Fukumenkei Noise this conflict takes an interesting role in the relationship between them.Even the side characters are well written and rather than them all be jerks to each other they\'re all overall nice, although flawed. Miou and Nino help each other out and give each other advice even though it\'s not always in their best interest to do so. And that\'s just the serious moments, there are also lots of fun playful moments between the band, Yuzu and Nino, Nino and Miou and others. It feels like more than just melodrama, it doesn\'t even feel like melodrama sometimes. While there are a few exaggerated moments, (like their parents) for the most part it feels like the result of their feelings and their ills. Even with some of the more hyperbolic emotional moments it never felt out of place. It felt so right.The music also plays an important role. Not only are the ideas on muse interesting, but they\'re very accurate given my own experience. I am a composer myself and I know the value of a muse, and how different emotions can sway one\'s writing, and their playing and all of that. And Fukumenkei Noise has this down to a T. Not only that but they\'re able to create music and lyrics that not only fit the show and the characters that write them but that are generally well written and convey strong emotions even better than most songs. They come from the heart and shine with the emotions that lie in them. Hayami, Saori did a great job with Nino\'s singing as it feels so emotional and it feels so authentic. I have tried to sing with raw emotion and it\'s really hard. But she is able to nail it so perfectly that I feel the emotion dripping from Nino\'s voice as she sings, and it hits me right in the heart.The way that music is used to both express themselves and release the emotional tension that\'s inside them is so well done. It mirrors the struggles of the plot and it enhances the struggle of the plot. Fukumenkei Noise is a music anime in the truest sense of the word. Not only is it about music but the way that it lives and breathes and relates to the themes of the show and the emotions of the characters it ends up working so perfectly well.I think the story is overall great. It\'s a basic story but the musical themes, and the ways the characters drive the story are fantastic. The art is mostly great and works well with it too, except for when they do the CG. Why did they do the CG it looks awful.Overall this show is an underrated gem. The characters are fantastically designed and the music fits so perfect with what the show does. It may have some of the typical shoujo trappings but it actually works to the shows advantage because of how well they\'re done and how well they work. Most shows aren\'t able to get me to relate to even one character, but here both Nino and Yuzu feel like kindred souls lost in the same struggle and emotions that I am. I am in awe at Fukumenkei Noise\'s ability to speak to me, and it\'s ability to write well naused characters. This show may be ripe with teenage melodrama, but it all fits so right. example of that is Nino. Nino is like most shoujo MCs.

The art kinda has that feeling to it in some scenes wich bugs me out, some movements made by the different characters seem kinda out of place as well. But for me, that is pretty much all the critic I can give it that actually annoys me.The story is rather plain and. One girl, two boys, conflict is ensured. While I\'m still not sure how it will end, wich many animes fail horribly at, the story is kept alive thanks to the characters.Now you might think of them as generic and you...would not be wrong, we have a dream chasing female protagonist with two boys influencing and conflicting her life and choices nothing too special. However, what makes these characters stand out is a very nice connection to the music that plays during the show. They are both harsh.They portray feelings more forward and clumsily while still maintaining that oh so classic ""I can\'t reveal my feelings"" cliché, but it feels so much more life like that way. Emotions are rash, irrational and harsh and the way the music is used to describe the feelings or try to reach out is harsh and there\'s a charm and an understanding of being a musician that is hidden from plain view. What is also very important is that every note doesn\'t HAVE to sound good or ring out clearly, the fact that sometimes it dosen\'t adds very much to the feeling of being a musician, an amateur, a dreamer.Added Comment: Oh no. It has 3-d animation.If you are searching for a music-themed anime with a direct conflict and connection of emotions and character this is the one. would not be wrong, we have a dream chasing female protagonist with two boys influencing and conflicting her life and choices nothing too special.

So I decided to watch more and more until I couldn't stop it, many people suggested that I should also read the manga, but I prefer to watch anime completely before I take on the manga part.For me, I can fully relate to the female main character, as the story progresses, her struggles get worser and worser. As for the other male main characters,  I understand their struggles and the way they act. I can see this anime becoming one of those...animes that will make you cry at the end or during mid-story even.I enjoy an anime where people can really relate to, it also has been awhile since I have watched something like this.

Everyone knows this. Any good singer knows how to use the full extent of their vocal abilities to draw in their audience and leave them wanting more. It can bring up feelings of calmness, excitement, love or hatred, allowing us to forget our many daily woes and just enjoy the moment. May we be the ones listening or the ones on stage, all that truly matters during that performance is the singing.Anonymous Noise is the love triangle between Nino Arisugawa, Kanade Yuzuriha and Momo Sakaki, a group of students that all...have a love for music. Once childhood friends and now unfortunately seperated for various reasons, they slowly find out they all go to the same school and try and rekindle their lost spark. The story, although nothing special, is quite interesting as it throws in different aspects such as romance, music and the feeling of loss. From students to professional musicians, it takes us on a journey that is fairly enjoyable.The drama that appears in this anime is quite thrown together, taking in tragic backstories from each of the three mains to create the base and bulk of the problems the characters face. However, the anime has a problem of showing these same backstories over and over, forcing them down our throats as if we didn't hear them the first time. It quickly loses it impacts as it starts to get annoying seeing the same thing over and over.Romance is explored, but it's not very satisfying. To get the gist, Yuzu (Yuzuriha's nickname) and Momo are in love with Alice, (Nino's nickname) while Alice is only in love with Momo and sees Yuzu as a friend. You may think that there is a simple solution to this love triangle, as Alice clearly only has feelings for one of them, but certain circumstances (looking back at their backstories again) prevent the two from being able to share their feelings. It's also quite frustrating seeing how Yuzu tries to get Alice to have feelings for him, but she's just too dumb to realise them. Instead of it being lovely and sweet, it becomes incredibly annoying.Most of the characters are shown with flaws about their music and/or love lives, providing an interesting spectacle as they all struggle to deal with everything that is thrown at them. Looking past their choices over romance, they're all fairly likeable and bring their own perspectives and personalities to create a pretty nice cast.The music, sadly, wasn't exactly my kinda thing. I could enjoy it, but I don't find myself listening to that type of music outside of the anime. The only parts of the music where it got slightly annoying is the constant LA LA LA during the start of the series. It never felt natural most of the time, just something thrown into the show to add a little makeshift depth to Alice's character.Comedy was an area that felt the most poorly done, as it would feel out of place most of the time. Even during moments that were meant to be serious, comedy would just appear out of nowhere, ruining the flow of scene and preventing us to fully get into the show.Anonymous Noise was ok. It had its good points, but it kept doing things that upset the way the show was flowing. It would be a decent watch if you can look past these types of issues, but I myself would not recommend it. I'm in NO hurry to rewatch this. have a love for music.

I had been interested the moment I had seen the original cover image and read the synopsis.Things I think it did well:- Slowly drops in backstories. While many others did not like how they did not start off with the usual first episode telling you how everything comes to be, I thought it was smooth.- It makes you question the motives of the main male characters, Yuzu and Momo.- It contains some feeling. Emotions. The characters actually...aren't dead and nor are they boring.- It was somewhat hard to predict for some things, especially with the backstory parts, those were hard to expect. Most episodes reveal something new about one of the three main characters.- Love triangle or whatever shape: some might be able to relate to the different characters' unrequited feelings and how they cope with it.- Amazing songs throughout.- Character relationships get strengthened within In NO Hurry To Shout.- Very funny and at the right times. Some repeated parts, but were not overused.- No fanservice, none was needed.- Smooth story progression.- Great performances by the voice actors, they were able to portray powerful bouts of emotion, especially the voice actors of Nino and Yuzu, Saori Hayami and Daiki Yamashita respectively.- Nino had quite a unique voice when she sang, and I think that's pretty cool.- It was never boring, and brings you into the story. I was able to get pretty invested in the story.- I liked the themes explored.Things I think it could have done better:- Not used CGI during the performances, those parts looked horrid.- Usual art could be improved too.- Explored the feelings of the other characters more, it would have been nice to know more about Yuzu's parents, Momo's parents, Momo's manager, Miou, Kuro and Haruyoshi, especially about Haruyoshi's feelings for Miou.- Drama may have been a bit unnecessary at some points.- It is a little cliche, not that it's completely bad.- Open ending, romance is not resolved.- Momo was a bit annoying for me, and he remains a mysterious character. Probably needed more screentime and perspective of him to understand his feelings better.- Nino's feelings and screaming may feel a little exaggerated. Characters, in general, may be a little unrealistic to some.Overall, I quite recommend this anime unless you are the judgemental type that does not appreciate these genres of anime. I did not find it disappointing at all, but I advise that you go in with as little expectations as possible. I probably contradicted myself somewhere in this review, mind you. I don't think we can expect a sequel, but if they decide to make it, I will definitely watch it for more of these characters. aren't dead and nor are they boring.- It was somewhat hard to predict for some things, especially with the backstory parts, those were hard to expect.

Nino is a girl that refuses to give up, a girl that sings her heart out in remembrance of a promise, she basically walks around with a mask on her face and doesn't give a single shit in the world , she has one purpose and it is to reach people with her voice, including Momo, her first love.Yuzu is basically the amazing second lead that the main girl never looks at, he is everything you'll ever want, he has been piecing Nino's heart back since Momo disappeared, he has feelings for her and is ALWAYS THERE FOR HER.̶M̶o̶m̶o̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶l̶i̶t̶t̶l̶e̶ ̶b̶i̶t̶c̶h̶  *cough* sorry Momo is the cold hearted lead of every shoujo anime, he pushes away Nino, has a deep past and family problems and he's obviously taller than Yuzu...These 3 characters along with the rest are very well developed, through the episodes, their past is explained which helps a lot to understand the actions that they take today and the way they interact with each other, yes they are based on a typical shoujo stereotype but at the same time they are each very unique in their own way and have a little something that makes the difference.The music: You will not like it at first, I'm not gonna lie, this alternative berserk thing is very weird, something you're not used to, it sounds just like she's screaming. Thankfully, if you're open-minded enough to try out new things, then let me tell you something, it ONLY gets better. The seiyuu did a WONDERFUL job, you can ACTUALLY feel Nino improving the more she practices, her voice becomes more powerful, more stable, and her last performance literally shooks you to the bone , you are captivated , she will NOT let you walk away from her , SHE WANTS YOU TO LISTEN, and believe ME you will!LIKE WTH MAN IM STILL LISTENING TO '' CANARY'' AND THE SHOW HAVE BEEN OVER FOR A MONTH!Art: Nino is different from the typical shoujo girl look, she is tall and always wears a mask, her distinctive feature is her hair and her beautiful smile. All the characters are nice to look at and they are drawn in a specific style that is pretty interesting and different from what we're used to.Enjoyment: At first, this show is definitely hard to get into with all the annoying '' la la la la'' and the weird music, but believe me once you're into it, you simply CANNOT walk away from it , Nino is captivating , In no hurry IS captivating , the story might seem typical but the characters are what makes it unique , they make you laugh, smile, cry and shake your head in frustration! The adrenaline that they give you when they perform is as intense as any real concert you will attend, your feet move with the beat your lips are trying to follow the lyrics and your brain is truly fascinated by Nino's voice.TEAM YUZU EVEYRONE ! the story, surprises along the way and everything comes to place by the end,  this ain't your regular dose of shoujo BELIEVE ME !!!Characters: PROBABLY THE STRONGEST POINT of this show apart of the music!

I may bring up spoilers for the manga or the anime, but I\'ll try my best to not let my love for the manga version of this series go in the way of my review.Story = 8The story is cliche, indeed. It doesn\'t stand out too much based on the sypnosis and cover art alone. At first, it seems like your typical romance, mainstream shoujo anime/manga full of predictable happenings,...but when you start watching it and/or read it, it gets better between the character interactions and drama. Now, people may say that this story is overdramatic, or may contain LOTS of drama between episodes. I\'d like to say that the drama in this story is handled very well, despite the story being slow-paced (as for the reason why I think so, my opinion on this is in the ""overall"" section, my bad for putting it there).The anime covered a lot of things (yet there were some that they didn\'t cover from the original manga) that made a path for possible plot holes.I\'d like to say that the plot holes didn\'t bother me that much while watching the anime, but I\'d be lying about that. Here are the three main reasons and plot holes in which I gave the story an 8--- I believe everyone can at least relate to one of these reasons being annoying or soul crushing in the story.(1) Yuzu\'s love for Nino goes unrequited and he wasn\'t able to tell her how he TRULY felt; wanting to stay as ""just friends"". And yes, Nino thought that Yuzu likes someone else even though he kissed her in that one scene. So basically, nothing progressed at all for the both of them. As this anime had just 12 episodes, Nino being able to move on from Momo and being able to be with In NO Hurry would be an IDEAL ending. Even if Yuzu wasn\'t able to be with her romantically, but no. Nothing happened.(2) Nino, despite being able to move on a bit out of her love for Momo in the middle of the story, came to love and care for Momo ""again"" on the last two episodes which is kind of annoying and irritating. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m sure nearly everyone relates on this kind of issue (crushing on your childhood friend), but in anime, it doesn\'t really work in a lot of ways.(3) Plot holes (i.e Yuzu\'s mom, Momo\'s mom, Momo\'s backstory, Miou\'s backstory, etc.)Despite the negatives, I\'m 60:50 on the story. I still found it enjoyable.Art = 7The big eyes disturb me, and honestly, Nino\'s character design oddly suits her personality--- this goes as well for the In NO Hurry members, Yuzu, Momo, and Miou.Sound = 9I\'m not a big fan of rock/electrical/just any ear-blasting music. ""High School"" that was sung by Nino in the first episode is horrible, too. The characters were all over her ""berserk"" voice while it sounded plain to me. Good thing Nino\'s voice got better and better in each and every episode--- not to mention, she sounded the best in the last two episodes. Her ""super berserk"" was done very well--- in ways I wasn\'t able to imagine.Character = 7I believe I\'ve already mentioned the character interactions once in this review. Feel free to look at the review I did for the three main protagonists in the ""Story"" section again if you want. I\'ll try to cover some other points but with a detailed explanation.(1) The In NO Hurry member\'s interactions with one another felt natural. At first, it didn\'t felt like it because of Miou and Haruno\'s (Haruyoshi-senpai) issues and problems with Nino. But right after dealing with it, it was fun to see the members going around and fooling with each other naturally--- Nino\'s time spent with Haruno didn\'t even feel forced as they have surprisingly good chemistry with each other.(2) Momo and his mom\'s interactions sparked up lots of plot holes to the story. Why is he scared of his mom? Why doesn\'t he want to live with her? Does he have a trauma? ...So on and so forth. Nobody knows.(3) Yuzu and his mom\'s interactions also sparked up plot holes in the story. I\'d like to know what his family backstory is, but I suppose the anime wasn\'t able to put it in.(4) Nino\'s love for Momo, a childhood friend from 6 years ago is relatable, but annoying if it\'s done in an anime. Her love for him was over done, and if I was ""Yuzu"", I\'d be fed up about hearing ""Momo"" come out of her mouth nearly every episode as ""Nino"" is someone I hold dear. I\'d like to see the one I love doing well with the person he likes, but in Nino and Momo\'s case? No. Childhood crushes are something that fades away by time. Nino WAS about to move on, but her ""moving on"" failed, and it\'s a very big mistake that turned the tables of romance in the anime. Also, they didn\'t even interact much (Nino and Momo), which was something that bothered me. (I\'m saying this in an anime-viewer perspective) They mostly relied on their memories of each other and their ""longing"" for each other, but they weren\'t able to make use of the ""present time"" that destiny gave them. And sadly took the present for granted; such as the ending of the anime.(5) Yuzu\'s love for Nino. He\'s probably the best character in the anime--- cute, tsundere, shy, blushing, and tries to protect her at all times. He even risked ""that"" just so to stop her from crying (I believe it\'s in episode 2). He\'s different from Momo despite the tsundere act, and her interactions with her was enjoyable and it felt natural. Befitting interactions for the two main protagonists of the anime.Enjoyment = 9Despite the plot holes and a bit of the ""overused"" drama others say, character personalities, and cliches that this anime has; the slow-paced story with well written character development, along with the songs made up for it.Overall = 9As someone who has read over 200+ romance manga\'s (some of which I haven\'t put in my profile entry yet), I\'m starting to find it hard to keep up with reading the same stories, same cliches, same interactions, same dramas that shoujo manga\'s mostly follow, and Fukumenkei Noise is such a refreshing breather amidst the cliche-filled manga\'s.Yes, it may have cliches, but it doesn\'t overuse it. Out of all the shoujo romance manga\'s I\'ve read, they overused the cliches and drama to the point it\'s annoying, cringe worthy, and made me lose hope in the shoujo industry. But Fukumenkei Noise is a different one. I\'m saddened to say this, but Fukumenkei\'s drama is indeed handled very well compared to other shoujo manga\'s. I\'m sorry that I can\'t find the right words to say or explain why, though. However, its drama is on another level out of the other shoujo manga\'s.I believe that a great anime has to have cliches, but people shouldn\'t rely on it alone. We got all the characters, story lines, and plot lines to think about too. But, if we mix in all the idea\'s and polish it, comes a great anime.I believe that\'s all that I have to say about the anime version. I\'d prefer Fukumenkei Noise having even just about 24 episodes to fully cover everything, from the little to the biggest plot holes (the anime is slow-paced, but it gets a lot of things done in a short amount of time in huge leaps), but we had 12 episodes to cover. Sadly, the anime wasn\'t as perfect as I thought, but it\'s still enjoyable as is. but when you start watching it and/or read it, it gets better between the character interactions and drama.

Too bad replacement has be girl’s tool for him to hear her voice.Poor 3, Art:Ok, so don’t expect to see Nino’s panchira around here, cu’z there aren’t any fansrevices around to see here, but seriously, the art was just too too terrible as if everyone there were suffering from a serious case of bulimia, also what’s with Alice having to wear that medical mask? Could the original creator and illustrator just give her a normal look like anybody else?Great 9, Sound:Well, you might say that seiyuu Hayami Saori has this owned in a musical aspect, it only goes to show that she can do both song and voice act, beautifully, and the score is for her , btw I don’t a fuck about the other seiyuus.Poor 3, Character:Ok, the story plot maybe very good, but the characters here were pretty annoying, since the reason for why Momo tries to distance himself from Nino was just too much of beating around the bush, and his character was a dichotomy , were at one point he likes Alice but on the other hand he keeps dissing her away, his charater plot alone was too esoteric , where there is no other girl that would give him a reason to diss Nino nor there were indications that he’s gay, nor does Alice did anything wrong.  Nino on the other hand was this typical obsessive girl who seemly can’t let go of Momo, despite of all the dissing and things that he have said to her , she just can’t let go, also she is as complicated as Momo, but in a wishy washy way , at one point she has given up on him,,,at least for while, but then again she still clings to a hope that her voice would reach him and it did, but not enough to renew their childhood romance. Let’s not forget the replacement, Yuzu whom Nino kinda see as an intruder in her life , poor guy, it seems that he will never be her love interest , also I kinda hate that he has to be this repeater, who has to repeat being a freshman again, his character would have been better off if he is in the same age and year level of that of Nino , too bad since original creator Fukuyama Ryoco have to put his character in a bad situation such as a a repeat student, struggling composer, band  crossdresser (for a while) and a love reject.  Other support characters were I would say, were in their proper places, thought, I’d wish that they were give a piece of their pie.Fair 6, Enjoyment:I may have enjoyed the songs, but the complications about the characters and their quirks, kind of annoys me, there were episodes I’ve watched , but there were also that I’ve skimmed cu'z of Nino’s overdramatic fits is one reason when there were episodes that she had to act out, really makes me wanna just go to the ending and hope that the next episode would be better and that she gets the hint and just goes for the replacement Yuzu and have a relationship with him.Good 7, Overall:Nino maybe annoying with his overly dramatic fits with Momo, but then again this anime was annoyingly good, besides it not always …..or at least for this year to that we get to have a kind of love triangle where it involves 2 guys one childhood friend and the other is a replacement, girl loves guy but guy love him too, but in some rocket science reason distances himself from girl, girl on the other hand just can’t get the hint and keeps dreaming to get him back, meanwhile replacement Yuzu loves girl, but girl was just too stupid to fall for him, Overall, this is a reverse of another good anime Fuuka.

Hell in all cases Fuuka from last season did a much better job albeit with it\'s few controversial decisions it did...it\'s still better than Fukumenkei Noise.For the things that Fukumenkei Noise does right however is that at the very least has some of it\'s morals be in the right...place, such as not giving up, being the underdog (be it both in the music industry or romantically) and all that kind of stuff, LA really does like those underdog type of stories and Fukumenkei Noise in it\'s deepest regions has that in the spades. As for everything else...This is gonna hurt...Fukumenkei Noise\'s problems are vast and many and although this isn\'t LA\'s worst anime of Spring 2017, it certainly has hallmarks of being in the typical shoujo romance fair of anime. Fukumenkei Noise\'s characters if anything is one of LA\'s prime reasons as to why LA just had such an infuriating time with this anime, romantically the anime really went NOWHERE and is merely teasing our main love triangle of Nino Arisugawa voiced by Saori Hayami the muse of both love interests because of her singing, Momo Sakaki voiced by Kouki Uchiyama a composer for a big shot music corporation and the one Nino is trying to find because of a childhood promise and Momo unexpectedly disappearing (hmmm typical shoujo plotline tropes there) and Kanade Yuzuriha voiced by Daiki Yamashita, another of Nino\'s childhood friend and ""support"" for Nino to use Nino\'s singing for Nino\'s ambitions. Sounds interesting but this love triangle is merely teasing at you and never progressing at all and sure some progress especially towards Nino as an individual as well as Momo and Kanade\'s interest of Nino grows from long lost friend to band member/crush is there but by the end of it...it\'s left open-ended. Next is the overuse of flashbacks to get it into our heads that YES...they liked each other as kids and even now, but the overuse nearly every episode from flashbacks of backstories that were DEDICATED to the love triangle\'s childhoods is there but too much can just easily make us say ""WE GET IT ALREADY MOVE ON!"", or just redundancy because ""We can ALL see it already"". Next is the level of angst this anime oozes from it\'s characters and how the majority of it\'s characters are just stupid or soo thickheaded they can\'t understand the obvious hints until it\'s too late. The angst does come in many ways (from Momo and Kanade\'s parental problems that links to their music, to Nino\'s indecisiveness to the situation at hand) though for LA, Momo and Kanade\'s angst is manageable albeit overly dramatic just to get be dramatic for the sake of it. Nino on the other hand is unbearably annoying, from her constantly shouting lyrics of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" (seriously...LA had enough of that from BanG Dream!) to her concert performance being soo batshit loud and oozing angst that LA got a migraine from the many performances Nino went through. Yeah...this isn\'t a music anime that\'s for sure...it\'s a typical shoujo romance anime under the guise of it being geared to the music genre and it pretty much shows, sure Fuuka did this too and with it\'s similar premise it\'s easy to compare too, but even then Fuuka was a bit more down to earth than Fukumenkei Noise (well at least in LA\'s eyes anyways).Seriously it\'s a problem in an anime when LA cares more for one of the minor characters (this being Miou Suguri voiced by Ayahi Takagaki) that had less screentime and is more interesting as a character than the angsty overly dramatic love triangle the anime is trying to push at us.In terms of animation done by Brain\'s Base, the character designs are exotic to say the least, but even then the animation especially on the characters face sometimes get janky (especially on the sides made it look like character\'s chin are blatantly triangular), the CGI on the concert scenes is also soooo blatant and poorly rendered as well and LA gets it their cutting corners to make up for time and everything but this is NOT the way to do it and again LA will mention that BanG Dream! ALSO did this and that also didn\'t work out and made it look cheap and lazy. The animation has a few points of interest but other than that, the animation is awful in many areas.In terms of voice acting...well for once Saori Hayami isn\'t getting praise from LA as she was LA\'s most annoying and infuriating voice actor in Fukumenkei Noise, now LA REALLY does like Saori Hayami as a voice actor...but only when she picks good roles and this is not one of them (others include Misuzu Sonokata from ēlDLIVE and Izumiko Suzuhara from RDG: Red Data Girl) and LA doesn\'t blame Saori for her role as this...LA more or less blames how Nino is than Saori Hayami but nonetheless annoying. Nino MANY times in the anime shouts her lyrics and from that Saori Hayami pretty much sings AWFULLY, LA KNOWS she can do better (just see Kaede Takagaki from the Cinderella Girls franchise or her singing in the The World God Only Knows Openings) but for a character like Nino where she is suppose to be a newbie at singing but is actually really good at the end...it doesn\'t help Nino\'s case when she\'s SHOUTING TOO LOUD ALL THE DAMN TIME makes her out like she actually ISN\'T a good singer and sounds more like a kid crying louder and louder just to get some attention or that the kid thinks shouting louder makes his/her argument more valid a la a better singer. Again for that, LA blames Nino\'s angst for this one and again for those Saori Hayami fans out there (heck LA IS ONE OF THEM), LA isn\'t saying Saori Hayami is a bad singer or voice actor...it\'s just the character she voiced is a horribly annoying singer. Ok rant about that done, *ahem* the rest of the voice cast was decent enough though LA\'s favourite voice actor easily goes to Ayahi Takagaki because at the very least she didn\'t annoy LA to no end (ok...dead horse..dead horse).Fukumenkei Noise is for LA\'s account a soo good it\'s bad type of shoujo romance anime but horribly irritating at it\'s worst. Fukumenkei Noise isn\'t LA\'s worst anime of Spring 2017 but it was definitely it for the romance genre and probably second worst by overall. If you had to say to LA which anime was worse? Fuuka or Fukumenkei Noise?, then LA would say Fukumenkei Noise, because at least Fuuka albeit controversial they went the safe route it turned more cliched and typical, but Fukumenkei Noise took soo much risk and in it\'s execution failed on that risk to be something different that it became annoying, what\'s worse?..cliched and safe or risky and annoying...LA goes to risky and annoying in this particular situation. Fukumenkei Noise doesn\'t understand that there is no point in shouting louder will make it go all away if the vacuum of angst won\'t even allow that to happen. Fukumenkei Noise...just being ""loud"" and making noise doesn\'t mean your gonna be better. place, such as not giving up, being the underdog (be it both in the music industry or romantically) and all that kind of stuff, LA really does like those underdog type of stories and Fukumenkei Noise in it\'s deepest regions has that in the spades. As for everything else...This is gonna hurt...Fukumenkei Noise\'s problems are vast and many and although this isn\'t LA\'s worst anime of Spring 2017, it certainly has hallmarks of being in the typical shoujo romance fair of anime. Fukumenkei Noise\'s characters if anything is one of LA\'s prime reasons as to why LA just had such an infuriating time with this anime, romantically the anime really went NOWHERE and is merely teasing our main love triangle of Nino Arisugawa voiced by Saori Hayami the muse of both love interests because of her singing, Momo Sakaki voiced by Kouki Uchiyama a composer for a big shot music corporation and the one Nino is trying to find because of a childhood promise and Momo unexpectedly disappearing (hmmm typical shoujo plotline tropes there) and Kanade Yuzuriha voiced by Daiki Yamashita, another of Nino\'s childhood friend and ""support"" for Nino to use Nino\'s singing for Nino\'s ambitions. Sounds interesting but this love triangle is merely teasing at you and never progressing at all and sure some progress especially towards Nino as an individual as well as Momo and Kanade\'s interest of Nino grows from long lost friend to band member/crush is there but by the end of it...it\'s left open-ended.

Fukumenkei Noise...just being ""loud"" and making noise doesn\'t mean your gonna be better.', ""Honestly I love music, but in terms of knowing what's good and up to par or not is not something I am capable of judging. So this review is strictly based on my likes.Unlike some of the other music anime, I really love this one because of how realistic it is.Storyline: 10/10 I personally think the story is unique because it's different from other music anime where high schoolers start a band because of their love of music/talent. Our female protagonist has a history with our two male protagonist when they were children. She experiences heartbreak as a child and is left feeling...suffocated, always seeking to find the first male lead. Then she meets the second male lead who helps her breathe. Both male characters are important to her one way or another. Some people may think it's annoying or that she leads one on or that she's stupid for being blind and not seeing the other guy, but truth is... IT'S REALLY REALISTIC.Music: not much to comment. I always love anime with music.*Update: after finishing it I do have to say the songs really arent that great. It just sounds like a lot of her screaming vs singing.I really do enjoy this anime. I think it's underrated. It brings up real life experiences other than music. Memories, Promises, Goals, Love, Friendship, Personal Hardships, Restraint, Freedom, Trust suffocated, always seeking to find the first male lead. Then she meets the second male lead who helps her breathe. Both male characters are important to her one way or another. Some people may think it's annoying or that she leads one on or that she's stupid for being blind and not seeing the other guy, but truth is... IT'S REALLY REALISTIC.Music: not much to comment. I always love anime with music.*Update: after finishing it I do have to say the songs really arent that great. It just sounds like a lot of her screaming vs singing.I really do enjoy this anime. I think it's underrated. It brings up real life experiences other than music. Memories, Promises, Goals, Love, Friendship, Personal Hardships, Restraint, Freedom, Trust"", 'Story: 5/10It\'s your average love triangle plot, with some music elements to mix things up. It\'s nothing new and it doesn\'t really surprise you at any giving point. The worst part of the whole story was how there is never an actual conclusion to anything. There\'s no closure to at least give you some sense of fulfillment, which is one of the most frustrating aspects of Fukumenkei Noise. Also, I really don\'t think it\'s fair to even call this a love triangle when Yuzu never even had a chance to begin with. Honestly though, the story had potential, but they failed to...make it shine to its full potential.Art: 8/10It\'s pretty good and consistent overall, except here and there, especially in some of Momo\'s scenes where things just seemed a bit less worked on. Also, unfortunately, there\'s some CGI in the music scenes (it\'s very minor though), which I\'m not a fan of at all, so that takes away some of the immersion for me.Sound: 9/10This is where Fukumenkei Noise really shined for me, I\'d even go as far to say that it was one of the main reasons why I kept watching until the end (besides Yuzu, that is). Personally, I was really captivated by Alice\'s voice. It\'s something I haven\'t come across before in all of the other music animes I\'ve seen. Now, of course, this will be all dependent on personal taste. I know from some reviews I\'ve read that some people really hate Nino\'s voice. However, if you do enjoy it, it will make you hang on a little bit longer. Personally, I\'ve even downloaded all of in No hurry\'s songs aftewards, if that goes to show you how much I\'ve liked them.Character: 6/10Definitely one of Fukumenkei Noise\'s biggest flaws, apart from the story, is the main character, Nino/Alice. She isn\'t relatable, she\'s incredebly frustrating to watch (especially if you\'re on team Yuzu) and there\'s no real character development from her side, besides her voice training. On the other hand, I found both Momo and Yuzu enjoyable characters, they were more complex and thought out and felt way more human than Nino ever did. Despite all of that, every character in this story is still frustrating to watch at the end of it all, because the right choices for them to make are always in their grasp, yet they always go with the most obnoxious and angsty choice possible instead. Everyone\'s a masochist.Enjoyment: 6/10Besides the music bits, there\'s not much to work with here. I do admit the first few episodes were a lot better than the last few. I felt like I was losing interest more and more with each episode, yet I powered through in the vain hope it would get better, that I would get something out of this whole ordeal. But, as I mentioned before, I didn\'t. There\'s no closure, no actual meaning to any of what you just watched. That alone annoys me enough to steer me away from reading the manga, which is still an ongoing project. Despite hearing it\'s actually better than the anime, I still have a bitter taste left from the anime, so I don\'t think I can handle diving back into this work just to get my heart broken all over again over nothing.Overall: 6/10Are you missing anything if you don\'t watch Fukumenkei Noise? No, not really. If you\'re interested in the music aspect, I recommend watching the first episode and go from there. You get a great feel for what\'s to come musically and if you do end up enjoying it, watch up until you reach ""Canary"" and then you can skip right to the end where they finally debut a new song ""Noise"" (which is my least favourite of the three). If the music aspect isn\'t that appealing to you, I suggest you skip this and give the manga a shot, since it seems to be the better option. Overall, if you\'re looking for something like this, but with much better execution, character wise, I recommend you watch NANA. It\'s still frustrating to watch, but at least everything actually makes sense. make it shine to its full potential.Art: 8/10It\'s pretty good and consistent overall, except here and there, especially in some of Momo\'s scenes where things just seemed a bit less worked on.

Yuzu, on the other hand, is a great character overall, and he seems to genuinely care about Nino\'s happiness, even encouraging her to ""reach Momo"".The same can\'t be said about Momo, the love interest of Nino, who acts in a despicably way towards Nino, as if she is at fault for him having left without saying anything to her. I understand he wasn\'t much at fault either, but to treat who used to be a close friend in such a cold manner, without any valid reason, makes me wonder why. Why is Nino still insisting in ""reaching him"", like, GIRL, CAN\'T YOU SEE THE WAY HE TREATS YOU? What happened, happened, please just move on. It\'s been six years since Momo left, why are you still hanging on him? Yes, you were good friends, but, come on, six years is too much to still feel that strong sense of attachment. I guess.Worst of all is, Momo, for some illogical reason, after treating her like trash, on the later episodes, decides to let Nino know that he ""misses her"", and ""likes her"". It came out of nowhere. See, Nino is obsessed about Momo, and Momo is obsessed about Nino. But their obsessions towards each other differ. While Nino\'s obsession is about reaching Momo, Momo\'s obsession is about forgetting Nino. Needless to say, Momo fails to achieve that, as he is constantly reminded of Nino as he hears her voice echoing from the radio (she sings in a band) and also because they go to the same school (as well as Yuzu. What a great coincidence, they all meeting in the same place after six years of unknowing each others\' whereabouts! Minus Yuzu and Momo, they were friends in high school before Nino showed up there). So, why does Momo decide to let Nino know about his so called ""feelings"" after treating her disrespectfully? And after doing so, all he does is running away from her. Momo\'s way of dealing with things that bother him is running away.*end of spoilers*Nino, as a character, is bland, because she doesn\'t really has a personality. She\'s either thinking about reaching Momo, or just singing, and later, playing the guitar, all that  mostly because she wants to reach Momo. She\'s clueless to what\'s around her because, AGAIN, she wants to reach Momo and that\'s all she thinks about for the most time.The other characters, such as the bandmates of Nino and Yuzu, Miou and  Momo\'s manager, are actually nice, even if they don\'t stand out much, but help to equilibrate with the frustration generated from other characters, who happen to be the main.Regarding the art, there isn\'t much too say. It\'s good, nothing outstanding, but it certainly is acceptable. Except for the parts where they used CGI in the concerts. That looks very awkward and out of place; doesn\'t blend well with the rest.The sound is acceptable as well. The songs didn\'t really do much to me, they weren\'t bad, they just failed to grab my attention. Also, I still don\'t understand what\'s so incredible good in Nino\'s singing. Ah, not to mention the ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", even if I\'m aware it\'s a special part of Nino\'s and Momo\'s past, it gets irritating after a while, along with the ""la la la la"" (not accurately represented. No need to thank).Overall: it\'s not the worst anime ever, but it\'s not the best, or close to it, as well. It\'s average, the story is full of mindless drama, some characters are aggravating, while others are way too good and the love triangle is... sad, and the ending isn\'t satisfying.If you don\'t mind that, feel free to watch it. Also, there\'s plenty of music here, so it\'s just a matter to check if it suits your taste. If so, maybe you should watch it, otherwise, better skip this one, or just watch it when you have nothing better to do, or watch, for the matter.

It seems many people disliked Fukumenkei Noise because Alice is quite annoying by always sing ""la la la"" in the very first episode along with the boring story, but I don\'t think so.There are reasons for her behaviors and it makes sense. The more you watch the show, the more you understand and will empathy with her. She\'s stubborn and not the kind of person who tells people she loves A and then at the last episode it turns out that she falls in love with someone else. I love Alice\'s personality....Everyone in this show loyal to the one they love, and I like that.About the story, it good but nothing has solved and many questions left unanswered in the last episode. That\'s because the story still goes on, this is not the end. I hope there\'s will be season 2 soon. I want to know more about Alice\'s stories, Momo\'s stories, Yuzu\'s stories as well as stories of others.The music is excellent. The first time Nino perform on her high school\'s stage got me hooked to this show. Words can\'t describe how I felt. Her voice is so powerful, so raw, contains so much of her feeling and there\'s something more in Alice\'s voice that attracted me.Fukumenkei Noise\'s songs are really good, I don\'t have anything to complain about.In summary, this is a very good show and I recommended you to watch it.

Its cute, sometimes you cry, sometimes you smile, but if Im not in the mood for it I get bored.That is not how it works for Fukumenkei Noise, I really liked it, it was good, its true that Fukumenkei Noise have its problems, the first is Yuzu. Yuzu is... how can I say it? Yuzu is annoying, he is the ""I love her but I cant tell her"" dude, so he just treat her bad, and thats freackin annoying, its stupid, its the kind of cliche you see in romance movies....But thats it, for a first season its pretty good.Characters-Nino is cute and she wants to tell Momo she loves him since she couldnt in the past-Yuzu is...

However, the anime gods have blessed us in the past with decent and even great shows, like Nana and Beck to name a few. Even getting a music series with a decent plot and not a rushed and shit conclusion is a miracle. Fukumenkei Noise is not at all from the best of its caliber, but *angelic voices...awing in absolute harmony* it is decent to good.I had lost faith in this type of anime since the cow manure that Fuuka was. I thought that all anime concerning music will just keep on playing the op song constantly in every episode and have 1 or two original songs. Fukumenkei noise does the exact opposite. It plays the op song only during the first and last episode. Personally, the sound of the show was the best department. I am a fan of this kind of music and I believe that the songs are well-written and fit in well with the show since some of them were written by the mangaka. My personal favorite is Noise since it describes Nino's emotions about Yuzu and indirectly, Momo. The OP is one of my favorites of the season and the ED is even better. The voice actors did good but my least favorite was that of Miou's and Haruyoshi's whom I found extremely annoying.The story is pretty decent for a shoujo but still flawed. It has many weakpoints in its narrative such as Nino's crazy infatuation about Momo and her complete lack of perception of Yuzu's love. Also, let's say the lalalas were the most annoying part of the whole show and the love triangle is doomed since its character has his own problems. Momo suffers from psychological domestic abuse by his good-for-nothing parents, Yuzu's mom is too overprotective of him and Nino has a crush on Momo who keeps on rejecting her. So the whole situation is a mess but they only find themselves when playing/singing music. It is the only time when they are honest about their feelings and they try to reach the ones they care about. Otherwise, the story is victim of plotholes, such as Yuzu's dad, Miou's character development and the list goes on. However, it holds up nicely till the end and the series ends on a sad but hopeful tone, although it leaves room for a season 2 which will probably never happen, since it is a Brains Base anime.Talking about Brain's Base, the animation was a little bit above average in the show, which relied heavily on 3D which made the flow of the hands on the guitar more organic but otherwise it has to be one of the least pretty anime I have seen from Brain's Base.Lastly, the characters is the weakest point of the show who mostly are underdeveloped except from the three mains and the drummer of In No Hurry who is devoid of any personality. I was disappointed with how many were left on the sidelines such as Yuzu's parents and Momo's mother who just served as a creepy reminder that Momo is still under their control and greed. Even though Momo is not treating others nicely at all and can be kind of a pain sometimes, he is actually a good person. However, his way of living have made him lose his childhood and his own path, since he is not free and music does not offer much of a liberation on him due to his abusive mother. If only the show had more episodes explaining important holes in characters, I would have given a better grade overall.But as it stands, it is by far one of the better anime of the spring season that was sadly unnoticed alongside Uchouten Kazoku 2. It is far better than many on its genre, like BanG Dream and Fuuka, but it is far from great. It is an anime with potential that manages to use around 60% of it. A second season will be greatly appreciated if it ever gets the chance to exist.Overall: 6.98/10Alternative Recommendations:-Nana: Shoujo and music series done right.-Your Lie in April: I have similar feelings about this anime. Only difference is that in terms of melodrama it wins by a long shot. awing in absolute harmony* it is decent to good.I had lost faith in this type of anime since the cow manure that Fuuka was.

Well, I liked it because it was a music-oriented anime after all. Artists need to be sentimental and eccentric to feel inspired for their music, they aren´t  ordinary people in the first place.What I didn´t like that much is that they overused the flashbacks even in the middle of a concert! I get why though, they only had like 12 episodes to show and had to include every possible content until the end.There´s still the manga ongoing so it´s a nice intro to a decent shoujo that can be liked by...many. many.', ""TL;DR – A melodramatic sledgehammer with characters that shed enough tears to fill a swimming pool & more angst than a lifetime of Linkin Park albums. But if a teenage soap opera about pop-rock & unrequited love sounds like your kind of thing, either to cry or laugh along to, then it fits the bill.Love is hell for a shojo heroine. Particularly so for Nino, whose feelings have remained unrequited since her childhood friend Momo suddenly skipped town in elementary school. Despite the years & common sense suggesting she should move on, Nino has continued to hold those feelings inside, determined that one day they...will finally reach him. Meanwhile, her blinkered vision left her oblivious to the obvious feelings of another childhood friend, Kanade, who pined for her much as she did Momo.Boy, would it be awkward yet convenient if all three of them started at the same high school...Whether Anonymous Noise will appeal or not depends entirely on one's tolerance for one thing: teenage melodrama. The series is twelve episodes of unrelenting emotion, with its characters constantly agonising over what they're doing & whether what they feel is getting through to others. While the set up for its main love triangle is hardly original, being very similar to Chihayafuru's, the series compensates by cranking everything up to eleven, tears, fears & deep conversations on school rooftops occurring with startling rapidity.Nino, Momo & Kanade's relationships form the crux of the series, with Nino's singing voice forming the metaphorical “object” at the heart of it. For Nino, it's through singing that she hope's to finally express the feelings that she can't bring herself to say in person, hoping that her voice will somehow reach through to Momo & make him realise her true feelings. To Momo & Kanade, Nino's singing in different ways gave them something missing in their own lives, inspiring both of them to write songs she might one day sing. This also provides the conflict between Momo & Kanade, who both lay claim to her voice & her by extension, the series sadly not being above the usual shojoism of having suitors fight over the heroine like boys over a toy while she remains obliviously reactive to it all.Be that as it may, Anonymous Noise does put one somewhat notable spin on its set up. Since Nino knew Momo & Kanade separately, they don't realise they're mutual connection to her until well into the series. Before then, they happen to meet at a train station & gradually develop a friendship over their mutual musical interests. It makes a nice change from the usual animosity between love rivals, though of course that comes eventually & both of them occasionally exhibit the possessiveness that can make even good shojo romances a bore to watch. But considering that possessiveness has been pushed to the point of parody in series like My Little Monster & Wolf Girl & Black Prince, Anonymous Noise seems comparatively restrained in its use.Music in different ways provides the emotional outlet for each of the trio, Nino in particular. Indulging in some rather eye-rollingly on the nose visual analogies, Nino wears a surgical mask during school – reflecting how she keeps her feelings to herself in regular situations. When the mask comes off, you know the emotions are coming out, probably accompanied by shouting & crying. As a member of Kanade's band, she is prone to going “berserk” unable to restrain herself because of the raw emotions that burst forth when singing from the heart.To that end, Anonymous Noise is sound-tracked by that most raw & authentic of music – over-produced j-rock with a visual key aesthetic. To begin with the music does not bode well, with the band music sounding forgettably generic while Nino insists on repeatedly singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (get it? Because she's wondering what Momo is up to) & la'ing along to music. But the music does improve, with the final song “Noise,” which Nino writes the lyrics for herself, being pretty decent. One gets the sense that it might be at least partly intentional, with the music improving along with Nino & Kanade's musicianship & enthusiasm for the band.Frustratingly, Nino's improving musicianship over the series doesn't mirror any real growth in her character or relationships. When it comes to Momo & Kanede, she flip-flops between pining for Momo & being oblivious to Kanade's feelings & occasionally appearing to accept the apparent reality & start to acknowledge Kanede. Her relationship with the band, likewise, yo-yo's between her only seeing it as a means to get her feelings across to Momo & wanting to pursue it for herself. That conflict between being a story about self-improvement & one where everything they do is merely to get someone else's attention runs throughout the series for all three main characters, reducing any real sense of meaningful character development even if the series can hardly be said to end where it started.The twelve episode length & focus on the main love triangle also means there is very little time given to the support cast. A secondary love triangle between Kanade & band members Miou & Yoshito is quietly discarded after Nino replaces Miou as singer. While she goes on to join a rival band, it seems more for the purpose of keeping her involved in the story than anything more significant; her only real role thereafter being to occasionally talk girl to girl with Nino. Other characters get even less attention, meaning that there isn't anything to really act as a respite from the melodrama of the main story.It's also notable that the first few episodes, particularly the first, feel a bit rough & rushed. The series clearly wanted to focus on events after Nino has joined the band, which leaves what comes before feeling like set up & back story that has to be got through to get to the meat of the series. Episode one feels like forty minutes of content squeezed into twenty, which leaves a lot of the dramatic turns feeling insufficiently established to make the exaggerated responses given to them.The production itself is okay. Character designs all have a fairly typical shojo look, though there is something just a bit off about them – the faces seem a bit too wide, while Kanade's head is too small for his eyes. Possibly connected to this, there is a notable downgrade in quality when characters are in the middle distance, with significantly less detail & faces sometimes appearing narrower or completely off model. It looks better up close, which is fortunate because there are an almost endless number of close ups on characters crying, shouting or reacting dramatically.The band performances are done with a mixture or 2D & CG animation, rather like Bang Dream. It's not high quality stuff, but it does the job & the mixture of animation & still frames was done to decent effect – though it's hard not to notice the animation loops in the crowds. Nino's berserk moments are made to look all the more over the top with the exaggerated poses & colouring given to them & credit is due to VA Saori Hayami, who is acting the hell out of her role.Yet while it's easy to criticise Anonymous Noise, it's also hard not to get caught up in its excessively heightened emotionality. Comparisons to Nana are overblown, a shojo White Album 2 perhaps being more apt, but the decision to ramp everything up to maximum drama is what lifts it from forgettable to enjoyable – if you're into that kind of thing. While I'm sure some would jump out a window to get away from it, if you do enjoy over the top teenage romance – or non-romance as the case is here – Anonymous Noise will have you crying or laughing along with it, possibly then leaving you scratching your head as to why. will finally reach him.

This anime has a very great art style like expected of a shoujo anime, specially the eye style looks different yet familiar. the story relies on the back story of the protagonist nino, sometimes it shows some flashbacks of momo and yuzu too. it really feels good, i kinda wanted to see hayami saori in a romantic music anime but i didn't expected that it would be this good, people complain about how nino looks but don;t mind it you'll like it....it's a good love triangle which wouldn't hurt the audiences and entertains people, it's a happy your lies in april , nothing too negative in here. personally i like this anime so much it's a good love triangle which wouldn't hurt the audiences and entertains people, it's a happy your lies in april , nothing too negative in here. personally i like this anime so much"", 'FUKUMENKEI NOISE ANIME REVIEWWARNING: SPOILER ALERTOVERALL: 5.2PLOT: 5/10Music supposed to soothe a listener\'s heart. Whether you will make them feel what you feel, understand what you want them to understand or express the message you wanted them to know. It is one of the most powerful medium you can use in order to make someone truly know you. You can make them moved just by hearing you sing. But why? Why didn\'t I feel such things in this series? I felt kind of annoyed when the protagonist shouts whenever he lost his mind over his childhood friend. I think, the series overly exaggerated the...need for the protagonist to have a good voice. Not good, great? Amazing voice? Well, yeah. She have a good voice. But the way that voice was expressed is a total disaster. I understand that the series wanted to show how she really cherishes that person, but I still don\'t want to accept any of it. I don\'t want to accept that a person will go waste his time for years waiting for it, gping crazy over it, loving it, when there\'s someone out there who can do the same thing you do to you. The decisions made in this anime is poorly out of nowhere. It has no solid explanation and the character is having a hard time justifying it. It has its good side, but yeah, the dissatisfaction is still there.CHARACTER: 4/10In this kind of genre, a great character is always the one who learn. The one who knew and realize what is lacking, what is needed to be done, what is moving forward means. However, this series completely neglect that. It\'s just like playing tag on someone who does not want to play with you. Every character complicates every little thing. The one who is crazily loving someone. The one who she can rely on eventhough also love her. The on who is stupidly running away. Not doing any moves or actions to get what he really want \'coz he don\'t have balls. It\'s just too cliche. Development of characters are needed on this one, not just love here and there. It is freaking annoying and too cliche. The protagonists failed to live for herself. To do something \'coz she want to. Not because she needed to.ARTS AND SOUND: 8/10Even if I don\'t come to like the story, the arts are great. It is plain but the characters successfully expressed in their faces what they truly meant, what they really feel. There are times they looked so cool and great and awesome because of how the arts was shown. It is detailed and fancy. The voices, along with the faces they\'ve made, are cool. But I really felt annoyed everytime the girl sing. Except for the last episodes on their concert, that song gives me chill. Apart from that, there is no song which made an impact. Oh hey, there\'s also this twinkle twinkle which is their trademark.ENJOYMENT: 5/5It bored me, bigtime. The history repeats itself. The protagonists is not learning her lesson. The other two failed to make a move. There are no episodes that made an impact to me. Yes, I still remember scenarios and faces if I want to, but one who can moved me? Who can make me feel the hurt, the love, the pain they are feeling? It\'s nowhere to be found. It is too slow paced that you needed to bear from the very beginning up to the last episode. Still, you will not find that enjoyment. That is, in my opinion.ENDING: 4/10The continuation of the anime is on the manga, as usual. The way the series end is like the theme ""The ending is just the beginning"". Yes, it is acceptable that the ending is cliff hanging since that is still not the real ending. And no, it is not acceptable that along with all the episodes of the anime, they failed to show changes on the heroine. A development that can make me keep going and excited on this one. I do check the continuation in the manga, and honestly, got bored and keep it on hold. need for the protagonist to have a good voice. Not good, great? Amazing voice? Well, yeah. She have a good voice. But the way that voice was expressed is a total disaster.

Oh hey, there\'s also this twinkle twinkle which is their trademark.ENJOYMENT: 5/5It bored me, bigtime. The history repeats itself. The protagonists is not learning her lesson. The other two failed to make a move. There are no episodes that made an impact to me. Yes, I still remember scenarios and faces if I want to, but one who can moved me? Who can make me feel the hurt, the love, the pain they are feeling? It\'s nowhere to be found. It is too slow paced that you needed to bear from the very beginning up to the last episode. Still, you will not find that enjoyment. That is, in my opinion.ENDING: 4/10The continuation of the anime is on the manga, as usual. The way the series end is like the theme ""The ending is just the beginning"". Yes, it is acceptable that the ending is cliff hanging since that is still not the real ending. And no, it is not acceptable that along with all the episodes of the anime, they failed to show changes on the heroine. A development that can make me keep going and excited on this one. I do check the continuation in the manga, and honestly, got bored and keep it on hold.', ""This anime left me speechless, it is simply amazing. The music shoots straight into your soul and the love triangle draws you in and you feel entwined. The story doesn't let you breathe, sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting, entrapped in the emotion. This is one of the best anime I have EVER seen and I have seen many, there's just so much heart and soul in this anime. The art at first bothered me but after a while it became apart of the beauty. If a character was heart broken, you FELT IT, you felt everything, every emotion was there! This anime...was so passionate and the music showed that. The music is just, I can't even explain it, I have never EVER heard something full of so much emotion and soul. It stuck with me, it reminded me of the times where I just want to scream, Nino captured the essence perfectly, her only escape was music, was singing. Letting everything out, screaming her heart out, being HEARD! I recommend this anime to everyone especially people who feel trapped sometimes, people who find music as an escape, people who just want to feel involved, present, ALIVE. was so passionate and the music showed that.

After all, such obsessive characters like hers and his are extremely dangerous to have. Nino sticks to her feelings for Momo from six years before the show\'s timeline but cannot accept the fact the world around her and Momo is changing. Momo, conversely, adapts to the change around him but is not able to accept his sheathed, lingering feelings for Nino.

The reason I gave this a four is because of multiple aspects going wrong.For story, that is what keeps the show going. That is the reason I was able to finish it. Reading the summary roped me in because I like cheesy cliche romances. If you like love triangles this might be for you.Now let me tell you about the art. I’m not a fan of the style in general. Very shojo-y but that makes sense for the genre. The thing I really didn’t like was the cgi within the performance scenes....It’s just the worst.As for sound, the music was alright but half the time she was screaming and apparently that’s the only way to portray emotion while singing in this anime. Her voice is really annoying at the beginning but I guess that’s to show how she improves throughout the series.The conclusion is not complete which is common for a lot of 12 ep. romance anime. If you like more open ended endings then go for it. But if you’re anything like me and need a solid conclusion, DONT WATCH THIS.

The music was good, especially since I'm a big fan of alternative rock. The melody and lyrics were both good. To be honest I don't have any complaints on this part of the anime.The characters weren't to bad. It is also a romance so a love triangle would seem inevidable. There were funny moments among the main characters. There was also sad and caring moments. I would have liked it if they went more into the other characters storylines, but this show is only 12 episodes so its understandable.Lastly,...the storyline was easy to follow.

Dispersed among the pile is the paper-thin plot, a book that was so generic, well worn, and riddled with hackneyed clichés that it legitimately felt recycled. The characters here are the balled-up scraps of a starving artist’s rough drafts (the artist is starving because he has absolutely no talent or ability when it comes to writing) which failed to meet even the artist’s low, low standards. The music is a scratched...CD that barely plays anymore – it’s rough and feels unfinished in places it shouldn’t (i.e. the OP and ED) and is without the level of polish I expect from a contemporary anime.

What pulled me in was initially the first scene with the girl we learn to be Nino singing a lovely tune on a beachside. It\'s a really lovely melodic tune. We learn that she is singing so she can find her childhood friend/crush.The story of this anime really was portrayed well in my personal opinion. Sure, a love triangle is a cliche of course but the...characters were in my opinion so lovable that you can\'t help but root for each of them despite their conflicting motives. Nino is a sweet girl who really was obliviously in love with her childhood crush whom she sang with each night underneath the moon and the stars. Yuzu is such a cute tsundere who does anything to protect Nino\'s smile even if it meant hurting himself. That in my mind was admirable and he instantly became my favorite character. Plus the fact that he lost his voice and can\'t sing was so sad. It made his love for ""Alice"" or Nino so sweet. She literally was her voice. Momo, Nino\'s childhood crush was a bit of a jerk but I understood his reasons and couldn\'t really blame him for being the way he is. The characters were all dynamic and all had their faults but all are redeemable. No one was evil and malicious and that is another thing I loved about this anime. It was pure and genuine. All the emotions were real and you really did root for all the characters.Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime purely because I love the idea of a girl singing her heart out so her crush can find her and hear her voice. It\'s a sweet concept and in my opinion, was portrayed well. The music was catchy and I loved all of the performances. I wish there was another season so I could know how things end up for all of them. I really hope that they all have happy endings haha. characters were in my opinion so lovable that you can\'t help but root for each of them despite their conflicting motives.

As plenty people say “I don’t usually write reviews” which is very true in my case but, I just had to write one for this show. The low ratings this anime was getting I felt it was necessary for me to write one. At first this anime was on my plan to watch list for months. I finally gave it a chance and within the first episode it left me with multiple feelings such as shocked, curious, confused and determined. The story was great. Not only does it teach you about life it teaches you about relationships....It’s not your typical romance where at the end boy and girl falls in love and they live happily ever after. This shows reality. You have to work hard for your goals weather it’s career or relationship wise. Throughout this anime you’ll see multiple characters being constantly shot down but they NEVER GIVE UP! Nino aka Alice and Yuzu are the definition of perseverance. The storyline is great, realistic and easy to follow, you can actually feel the characters emotions. The music is amazing because you can clearly hear the emotions of the characters through them. Reminds me of NANA. SPOILER..... (I hope nino notices Yuzu feelings soon) It’s not your typical romance where at the end boy and girl falls in love and they live happily ever after.

I do not usually do reviews because I always try really hard when I am experiencing new anime to try my best to like them. That was the case for Fukemenkai Noise. I had high hopes for this anime in the beginning but unfortunately for myself it ended up not delivering on a few aspect. One major aspect for me being character dynamics but we will get into that a bit later. To begin I will start with the soundtrack.Soundtrack: (7/10) I actually liked the alternative music and I...know that was one of the major aspects that people had a problem with but the songs in my opinion were very nice and had some good beats to them. The setback being the female lead who sang those songs. The main character Nino seems to be put on this pedestal that she is this magical singer sent from the heavens and when everyone hears her sing they are all in awe. For me though, she wasn't singing. She was screaming and I think this partly has to do with her actual voice actress. No hate towards her as I have watched other anime she has been in, but singing is definitely not her string point and when you have a main character whose main attribute is singing you should find a voice actor who is relatively decent at singing to play the ideal role. That's just my opinion, we are all entitled to our own.Animation: (3/10) When I saw the poster cover for this anime, I was excited to see the animation because I really liked the overall art style. It gave me Kimi no Todoke and Lovely Complex vibes. However the actual animation wasn't top notch in my opinion. Sometimes I feel like animators stop caring after awhile and the animation begins to derail each episode or at least in certain parts of every episode it becomes noticeable. A major turn off for myself was the 3D animation that occurred during the musical performances, it honestly hurt my eyes and I really didn't even find it necessary to have the conversion to 3d.Plot: (5.5/10) I liked the overall synopsis of this anime, that's why I gave it a chance in the first place. However some parts in the anime, there were some moments that were oddly placed. When anime reference someone's past or talk about their back story they do so in episodes that are stagnant to each other, at least from what I have seen. I feel like when this anime tried to include back story, it was placed completely randomly as an excuse to further expand the plot but it honestly didn't even do that for me, aside from the backstories being all over the place from episode to episode I really didn't even feel they needed to go so much into depth with the backstories, we know they left her six years ago. We know there is denial of feelings. We know they held hands and sang twinkle little star, why keep repeating the same aspects of the past?Finally moving onto characters which really frustrated me the most in the duration of this anime. I give the character dynamics a solid 1 out of 10. Two of the main leads Nino and Momo were super one dimensional. They were practically obsessed with each other and they were both equally selfish which was something I couldn't personally stand. Momo in particular was the worst of them all, I honestly couldn't for the life of me understand why he wanted to stay away from Nino. He claimed because she would ruin his music, but at the same time he still appeared to be writing music just fine and the music was basically all dedicated to her to begin with so I don't see his real issue here. Also there is the fact that he is just completely in denial of his feelings and that is something that drags out for far too long, and to be completely honest here he and Nino hardly had any chemistry throughout the anime. I really just couldn't grasp why they even liked each other. Which is why I really felt bad for Yuzu, because he was pretty much the only enjoyable and most realistic character in this anime. I really found his shy but still firm and honest personality to be endearing. He is incredibly selfless, a bit comical and extremely passionate for music. Throughout the anime he had done so much for Nino even when he knew she wouldn't reciprocate his feelings. I liked them together a lot more then I liked Nino with Momo and I was really rooting for Yuzu. I honestly thought they had a slight chance towards the later episodes but that chance was ultimately crushed by how dense and oblivious and just overall selfish Nino is. She can't function for one second without going on and on about Momo 24/7. I swear it was like Momo was the only word she could utilize in her dictionary, I still don't get how she can just disregard someone like Yuzu for someone like Momo, but I guess that is just how some things play out.Overall I rated this anime 4/10 for the given reasons above and I wouldn't say I would recommend this anime to anyone unless you are looking for that anime with a useless love triangle that really isn't even a triangle, more like a square missing one of its connected sides as well having terrible animation and a cringey female lead who can't even operate the talent hee entire character was built on. know that was one of the major aspects that people had a problem with but the songs in my opinion were very nice and had some good beats to them.

Not bad, but not so good either. Nothing really new in this part, and perhaps the most lacking thing in this show.Art: 8Multiple bishounen with detailed long eyelashes, the art totally screaming Shoujo here. With sublime CG mixed in between here and there, which may or may not be noticeable. The Lightwork on the concert part really push up the intensity which somewhat rarely seen on the other show.Sound: 9This is a Music show that actually focused ON the music with some of them spread along the show, unlike the other 'Music' show. And the...music itself, is good in my taste. What actually gives me in is the sublime changes in vocalist voice while she sung throughout the show. Notice that her voice changes with her current emotion, it's very slight but it's there and it's definitely a plus for the show. The band reminds me of the old Akeboshi rockets.Character:8Main Heroine is very likeable. I like the way she doesn't give a fuck to everyone including her crush. Glasses MC being a teenage edgelord and keeps exhaling lame puns. While the shorty MC being bullied left and right by everyone, poor guy.Enjoyment:7The concert part alone is really good.

Sure, the anime upholds the actual style, but it fails in the most simple ways, with something like logic or getting a 17 year old teenager's fingers looking like a 8 year old's.Now, I've read and am caught up with the manga and have to advise that if you want the whole experience of this mixed up musical with a mediocre love triangle: read the manga. If you want to hear their voices and the songs, then prepare for...that horrible CGI and lacklustre singing.It was a letdown in someways, the casting wasn't perfect and it didn't have the same effect as the manga did. But it was still somewhat enjoyable. I like hearing and watching adaptations to listen to the different voices and seeing how people interpret the stories... so I'm not going to say it isn't worth watching, because for people who enjoy the 'love triangle' trope and the whole shoujo based around music, then frankly, it's perfect for any shoujo lover.I'm a big fan of the manga, what can I say that won't berate the anime down to every detail?Anyway, the characters were fine and are fine still. I must say I loathe Momo as a strong Nino x Yuzu shipper, however they were portrayed as expected and the feelings each character felt were portrayed near to perfectly and the comedy was fine, I'm bias towards Yuzu of course. I must say I expected a VA with a deeper voice to portray Yuzu but... I'm fine with his chibi middleschooler sounding voice. It fits his personality perfectly unfortunately.The drama was portrayed within the facial expressions and voices and, of course, the idiocy of breaking out into song (every time Nino thinks about Momo) too. Then the pity for Yuzu's painstakingly one sided attraction, this one sided theme appears very frequently I've found and it has gotten rather overplayed. And then the stampede of fangirls...I may keep listing negative titbits but I thought it was alright seeing as it's only a seasonal anime, I'm guessing, but it followed the basic plot and succeeded in making people interested in reading on.-The characters were portrayed fine and everything was just, fine.It is, overall, a fine anime. Not great, fantastic, or really amazing; just fine. It's like a non-canon lacking movie of a long and popular anime like Conan or I daresay, Naruto, that had barely any thought or work into it- just a way to earn money I'd say.So, I'd recommend for anyone who enjoys shoujo. A love triangle, frustration, shoddy singing yet pretty good songs, and overall a plot based solely around music. Well, and love I suppose but we aren't getting very far. that horrible CGI and lacklustre singing.It was a letdown in someways, the casting wasn't perfect and it didn't have the same effect as the manga did.

The story goes back to Nino, a student who has been singing for almost her entire life to catch up with Momo, her childhood friend of hers who moved out of town without prior notice. With all that, Nino gets on with Yuzu who teaches him the basics of singing music. Nowadays Nino must join the group that Yuzu created for her and where she will try to reach Momo more easily. It is not a bad premise, obviously...it could be better but it is enough not to fail. The problem is that in many moments of the story there are very forced events or changes in the attitude of characters that do not make sense just so that the story does not stay stagnant and follow its original flow. An example would be that Nino has always been shown as a childish and very carefree girl and when Yuzu kisses her she changes her attitude and shows herself as someone mature who has been angered by what happened when at no point in the series we have seen her that way.ART 8/10The animation of this work is quite good. There are no times when you say ""I can\'t stand to see this"" and it is generally quite enjoyable. It is true that in the moments of the beach they focus so much on making a good landscape that they forget to animate the characters well or make their eyes or mouth more detailed. But what I really like about art is that expressions are worked out a lot to make you emotional at times. At Nino\'s first concert with the group they cheer him on in such a way that you feel the song inside your heart. They also make you look very good when a character is nervous or depressed, in general the expressions are great.SOUND 10/10The sound effects are good. The sound of the guitar strings, the hits, the sudden silences of the soundtrack to make you see that it is a tense scene ... among many other things. But above all I want to mention the songs. It is probably the musical anime that has the best songs. When I finished it, I had my entire Play List with songs from In no Hurry to Shot. Canaria, Noise, Othello ... all perfect, they have no fault. They have feeling, good melody, good chorus and they are catchy, in this aspect Fukumenkei Noise is perfect.CHARACTER 6/10The characters are normal, as a strong point I would say that they are quite charismatic and they all have their personality fixed and that distinguishes them. Apart from that they have no evolution and a past to remember, obviously Nino, Yuzu and Momo yes but because they are the protagonists but the secondary cast should be taken into account more. Also mentioning that you dislike a character does not mean that he is bad, I am going to give you some examples, Ichika from Gotoubun no Hanayome dislikes everyone but he is the best character in his work, the same happens with Mami from Rent a Girlfriend, as irritating as she is, is a very good character. I also say that for Momo since I personally like her very badly but her actions are justified by the bad past she had and how it caused her evolution to reach this point.ENJOYMENT 7/10I have enjoyed this anime, in general I really like musical animes and if they have their point of romance, even better, the problem is that the point of romance in some aspects is poorly constructed, so as I was realizing, I did not enjoy it as much.In general it is a good anime, it is not perfect but if you do not know what to see I recommend it.

I think their idea is a good one, but they did a bad job carrying it out. Let's break it down:STORYIt wasn't fleshed out enough, wasn't paced well, and didn't do such a great job at creating the appropriate ambiance/emotions around its sub-arcs/main arc. The biggest reason for such failure, I believe, is the lack of character development.CHARACTERSFor a story to be good, it has to have strong characters. Otherwise, weak characters will seem like puppets simply going along with whatever the author needs them to do to progress the story. That was kind of...how this anime felt. Since the anime neglected to flesh out the characters, it also missed a lot of chances to flesh out the story to make everything more meaningful and impactful. What I mean by this is that, if some random kid won an award at your school, you wouldn't really care. But if you're best friend won an award, you'd be excited for them. Why? Because they're your best friend, you know them and you've shared memories with them. But the memories that this anime goes through is not enough/not diverse enough. Ok, so everyone is connected by music, it's a special thing they share, but there's not reason to have such a strong connection as the main characters do. The story needed more things/different things to happen to flesh out the characters, their connection, which would in turn give more substance to the story.And about the love aspect of this story—it kind of makes no sense to me. Sure, Momo and Nino liked each other when they were young kids. Nino and Yuzu met each other during a sensitive time that made them closer than any other time would have. I think these are good starting points to grow a relationship, but they're not enough to have full blown head-over-heels love. This was part of what made the story seem superficial/forced.Also, very few things were mentioned about the characters backstories—their families, friends, own experiences outside of being with Nino—and this again contributed to the flatness of the characters.ARTThe art is appealing. BUT the 3D animation they use for the concert scenes really hurt my eyes. It's probably not such a big deal, but I hate it when 3D is mixed in with 2D, especially such poor 3D. It ruined the mood for me.SOUNDDespite being an anime centered around music, the music wasn't actually all that great. I like Japanese rock, but I did not like what songs this show presented me with. For a show, I guess they're fine. But the voice they chose for Nino was not meant for rock. I originally thought the voice actress could not sing, but after a while I came to the decision that she can, but she is no rock singer. Good rock singers can sing intense songs without losing the notes, but when things got intense, Nino's voice lost its musicality and seemed to be screaming. It was a good enough voice, just not good enough for rock.I've seen a lot of good reviews for this anime, and considering it currently has a rating of around 7, I'd say that it's relatively well received despite my criticism. Honestly, I think this is because of differences in age and preference. If you're a preteen, you might like this show. But if you're my age (young adult) you might have some of the same problems watching it as I did. how this anime felt.

Honestly, if it weren't for the art style and music, I probably would have stopped watching. Love triangle animes usually have a reasonable amount of angst to keep you hanging, but this one was so cliche it was annoying. Basically, Nino is clueless and not only in the romantic sense. She's incredibly selfish and obsessive about some Momo dude she hasn't seen in 6 years even though he brushes her off harshly every time she tries to reach him. Momo is such an underdeveloped character...that the show barely even tells you anything about and he was merely used as a toy for the very weak plot line. He might as well not even have been in the show because it's just about Nino obsessing over his 8 year old self. Then there's Yuzu, a dude who's had a crush on Nino for years and made a whole band for her AND lost his voice for her AND fuels her obsession for Momo by giving her more opportunities to reach him. The guy is digging his own grave, but he's more tolerable than Nino because at least his character somewhat develops. Nino barely acknowledges how much Yuzu has done for her and when she does acknowledge it, it ends up being about Momo anyways. Some unconditional appreciation would be nice but that's a lot to ask for when you have a main character like that. Miou is the only character I felt for because she was in the band since day one and helped build their foundation just to get outshone by Nino instantly. It makes sense why that happened since the band was specifically made for Nino, but if I were Miou I would have expected Yuzu to grow out of his obsession at some point.. But I mean, he DID make a band for her and that says a lot in the first place lol.. Well, if the reasonable characters were the main characters then this show wouldn't exist in the first place. However, the plot development was very poor overall and it was hard to connect to any of the characters. The anime frustrated me more than I enjoyed it, but I love music and band animes(shoutout K-ON) so I stuck through some of it anyways. It has a simple shoujo art style that I found cute and the music genre was right up my alley, that was the only aspect that kept me watching. that the show barely even tells you anything about and he was merely used as a toy for the very weak plot line.

Nino, Yuzu, and Momo are decent leads who pull the story. I love their dynamic and relationships with one another. Each of them do music for a reason, and often that reason has something to do with their feelings towards each other.Speaking of which, the music of the...show is great. I love it that Nino isn't necessarily the best singer in the world, but nonetheless has the talent and emotional drive to pulls people in. There's always an emotional weight to the songs she sings as she wants those songs to reach to a certain someone. The fact that both Yuzu and Momo are composers who can't sing due to certain circumstances also enhances the trio's dynamic in the show.That being said, the one thing that holds Anonymous Noise back is its ending. It feels incomplete (probably because the manga wasn't finished when the show aired). Major conflicts aren't resolved or at least answered. Characters changed, but with how the story ended it feels like it's still just the beginning of something great. Since it seems unlikely that the show won't continue even though the manga now finished, it further emphasizes that there's something lacking.

You shouldn't miss this story."", ""There might seem a bit of a contradiction in how I've rated this show. I've given it an 8/10, yet claim to have mixed feelings on 'Anonymous Noise'. I'll get to why in a little bit.First, I'll do the fun part, and talk about the show itself. That's the bit that gets the 8/10. It's honestly been something of a surprise to me, not because it was especially outside of my normal tastes (I'll always love a show about musicians), but simply because I knew people didn't talk about it much, and that suggested to me a degree of mixed reception. So, when what I...got was a pretty overwhelmingly competent work, I certainly found myself pleasantly surprised.From a production standpoint, there's probably nothing mindblowing about the show, but not in a bad way. Brains Base's animation is consistent and competent; the movement in the animation is nothing special, although not anything bad either, but the artwork, especially the characters, is very clean and has a sort of sharp feel to it that gives the show something a little distinct (I think the studio has a bit of style here, given it reminds me a little of 'Durarara' in terms of the artwork. The direction has plenty of flair to it, especially during the music sequences, but is similarly nothing we've never seen before. It's good, has good shot composition, establishes the tone of the world well. Nice, solid, competent work in terms of the production.Naturally, music is important to a show like this, so it's fortunate that the soundtrack is probably the standout part; much as I loved 'Beck', I did find it a little difficult to believe that the titular bands music caught as much attention as it did, but 'in NO hurry to shout;' definitely stands up to the in-universe hype; composition and lyrics perfectly with Saori Hayami's raw, character-filled vocals to create I sound that I definitely think would break through the indie scene IRL. The music really elevates the scenes that rely on it, which is good for a show where so many important scenes do. The incidental soundtrack complements it nicely too, with plenty of strong, easily-identifiable leitmotifs tying it together.And the characters get to be the power source for the whole thing, with the central trio of Nino, Yuzu, and Momo each being complex, unique, and imperfect in just the right way, with their dynamics being perhaps a little on the overexaggerated melodrama side, but not in a bad way - I do like overexaggerated melodrama, after all. The supporting cast is generally fun, although perhaps a little underdeveloped in places; I know literally nothing about In NO Hurry's drummer, Kuro, that isn't included in this sentence. But generally, it keeps the focus where it needs to be; I think there's scope to expand on certain aspects of the story and characters, but not in a way that leaves what's important underdeveloped.So, 8/10, great show, had a very good time, definitely need to find a way to get that soundtrack. Why do I have mixed feelings?Well, it's very clear that this show did not adapt a whole manga, and it is very clear that the story is incomplete. It is also very clear that, given the show didn't seem to make a huge amount of impact when it landed in 2017, it seems somewhat unlikely that we're going to get to see that fact change. Perhaps there's hope; certainly, there can be a difference in popularity between the western and domestic audiences, so perhaps there's more demand for it in Japan that might make it viable. But I'm not holding out too much hope. If you can accept that, and perhaps live with the manga after the fact (I may look it up myself), then there's still an awful lot to enjoy here. But, if you can't handle the fact that this just isn't a complete story, and won't give you as much resolution as you'd like, then I can't say you won't come out it a little disappointed. I'm very much in the former category, but if you're in the latter, this might not be for you. got was a pretty overwhelmingly competent work, I certainly found myself pleasantly surprised.From a production standpoint, there's probably nothing mindblowing about the show, but not in a bad way.

But generally, it keeps the focus where it needs to be; I think there's scope to expand on certain aspects of the story and characters, but not in a way that leaves what's important underdeveloped.So, 8/10, great show, had a very good time, definitely need to find a way to get that soundtrack. Why do I have mixed feelings?Well, it's very clear that this show did not adapt a whole manga, and it is very clear that the story is incomplete. It is also very clear that, given the show didn't seem to make a huge amount of impact when it landed in 2017, it seems somewhat unlikely that we're going to get to see that fact change. Perhaps there's hope; certainly, there can be a difference in popularity between the western and domestic audiences, so perhaps there's more demand for it in Japan that might make it viable. But I'm not holding out too much hope. If you can accept that, and perhaps live with the manga after the fact (I may look it up myself), then there's still an awful lot to enjoy here. But, if you can't handle the fact that this just isn't a complete story, and won't give you as much resolution as you'd like, then I can't say you won't come out it a little disappointed. I'm very much in the former category, but if you're in the latter, this might not be for you."", ""I'm not really well-versed when it comes to music and anime but I'll give my 'normal person' review.First of all,for a 2017 anime, this could have had better premise. The love triangle should have been more subtle. And there should have been a better character development especially for Alice. The 'comedy' in there wasn't that funny. Lastly, the drama was kinda forced.What caught me was the first episode. It was really nice, especially the music. The characters were nice too, at the beginning. but then, i felt like everything went haywired when they always had flashbacks after.But there's really no harm in wanting...to watch it.

Kiddy Grade: Ignition,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2176/Kiddy_Grade__Ignition,"[""Kiddy Grade: Ignition is the movie form of the first quarter of the Kiddy Grade series.  A summary movie which tries its best to capture the soul of Kiddy Grade, and to a point it achieves it.If this were a review of the Kiddy Grade series you would find the scores to be somewhat higher, but alas this movie at least in my opinion doesn't stand up as well.When watching the movie, I find myself questioning it's purpose.  The first section of the movie does pretty much everything I would expect from it, it steals content from the first few episodes of the...series, and the ending section does from the last section of the first story arc.  All on all I found this to be rather enjoyable, although some parts of story seem misplaced, probably due to deleted scenes.  These sections of the movie bring back quite fond memories and my knowledge of the series worked well enough to fill in the missing bits.  That said, I would have been better off just watching episodes 1,2,9,10,11, it would have probably flowed better.What perhaps is the worst part of the movie is the clip show in the middle.  After the ending of the 2nd story, the movie throws up some music and plays a 10 minute video montage of 2-8 second clips from episodes 3 though 8.  There is enough clips to give a somewhat piecemeal summary of the missing episodes, I dont think there is enough there for people to get more than a rough grasp of what went on, unless you've actually seen the episodes the clips are from.One of movies better points is that during the first arc of the series there was a series of episodes which did little other than to serve as slight character development and to give the watcher a greater idea of the universe, in fact that is probably why when making the movie they decided it would be fine to cutting those episodes out completely.  The movie concentrates on the initial character introduction and then skips to when the series begins to get serious.If by this point you have any doubt on my position, I personally don't believe I could recommend that anyone should watch this movie unless they had refused to watch the series, and this was the only way I could convince them to give the story a chance.  That said I believe the story itself deserves some credit and I place that as being in my top 10 anime series of all time. series, and the ending section does from the last section of the first story arc.

This movie version of Kiddy Grade is a good start to anyone going into the science-fiction genre with a love for space, colonies and different politics, crimes and an organizations with members that have unique abilities to help put under control. Compared to the TV series this will easily resume a nice beginning to the story while featuring what other members can do apart from the...main ones Eclair and Lumiere.This movies will also get anyone into a sentimental feeling for both of the character Eclair and Lumiere for who they are or might have been within a past time frame.

Kud Wafter,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35960/Kud_Wafter,"[""This is a short story that follows Kud being in relationship with Riki, with main events being focused on her dreams and her past.As a fan of Little Buster (VN), I couldn't help but enjoy the characters, being reminded of the everyday life with friends just playing around. And the music that just reminds me of the VN moments.Addition, non-anime related but necessary to understand my score:Due to the low score of the Anime (not even 7 when I wrote), I can tell that most people have not read the Visual Novel (get it on st*em as its outstanding, it has everything except +18...stuff that were so bad they didn't bother bringing back even after so many remakes were done). Highly suggest seeing this after doing her route for the best experience of this episodee stuff that were so bad they didn't bother bringing back even after so many remakes were done). Highly suggest seeing this after doing her route for the best experience of this episodee"", ""Despite being a spin-off to one of my favorite pieces of fiction ever, Little Busters!, I didn’t have high expectations coming into Kud Wafter. VN into anime adaptations are always scary, even more so when they’re getting adapted as movies. More so, Kud Wafter was never thought of as quality work in the first place, and Studio Key in general doesn’t have a good record when it comes to spin-offs. I'm looking at you, Tomoyo After.Surprisingly enough however, the final product we got here turned out to be much better than I ever would’ve expected. The movie starts out in a very lighthearted manner, aiming...at providing classic Little Busters! comedy content, which is very much welcome. The whole group of characters is back at it with more jokes, banter and just being themselves. All of these characters are simply wonderful and manage to be incredibly hilarious at all costs. The only sad part is that the best girl, Rin, has probably the smallest role out of anyone in the movie. 2020 hasn’t been sad enough apparently :(The biggest question marks with Key shows are always their transitions from comedy to drama, which can often be sloppy, rushed, and overall poorly executed. This is sadly the case here as well, as the movie at one point randomly decides it’s tired of being a comedy, and in a matter of few scenes totally changes its tone and narrative, without much explanation as to why. This very strange and unnatural transition is definitely the biggest weakness of the movie, and if it were half an hour longer and used that time to patch this hole, the end result would also be much more satisfying.After such a poor tone-change, one would expect the whole dramatic side of the movie to crumble. Surprisingly enough, that isn’t necessarily the case, as the movie manages to pick itself back up. That is achieved mainly by keeping things simple and in-line with what the original Little Busters story provided. The movie fully capitalizes on the fact that it doesn’t have to build a new conflict from scratch, and instead works as an extension of a story we already know. Thanks to that, the only thing it can focus on is the execution of said extension, which is why, even though with very limited time, it does manage to tell Kud’s personal story relatively well. There are no glaring weaknesses when the drama is in full swing, and some interesting direction elements help to keep the movie fresh and interesting.Kud’s character doesn’t go through much we haven’t already seen her go through in the original show, although the ending of this movie does give her side of the story a more complete closure, which is definitely a good thing. The ending scene overall is quite sudden but incredibly important and powerful, while also managing to be very sad without really trying too hard to appear so.One area Kud Wafter definitely could’ve been better at are the production values. The animation oftentimes feels sloppy, despite the project only being about 50 minutes long and also getting postponed a few times. Not only a bigger budget would make the anime look more consistent, it would also help to produce some interesting direction choices and elements into their fullest potential. But, we can’t except that much from a crowdfunded project, I guess.Which is honestly why I’m even more surprised that this turned out the way it did. Sure, this movie definitely ain’t no masterpiece, and it also is more silly and fun than legitimately meaningful and profound, but considering what kind of project it is and what I expected of it, I really have no reason to dislike the work presented here as a whole.It’s funny, sweet, it has Kud, and it does considerably well in its dramatic parts as well.Hence I can crown Kud Wafter as a success. at providing classic Little Busters! comedy content, which is very much welcome.

But little busters is my favourite anime and nothing more, I never read the visual novels, and never really wanted to, it seemed like too much work to try get the ending i already knew i wanted, the rest would just be extra icing on the cake. So my attachment to Kud as a character in...little busters is that she had some cute and funny fanservice for the show to build up the universe a bit, and that was it, very little opinion on her, with that said lets actually review the film. (I'll be spoiling major parts of the story for the 'Little busters!' anime, of which i guess this act as a spinoff sequel to, so make sure that's all watched before thinking about watching this)The Kud Wafter movie appears to take place in the dreams of Kud after the Bus crash in Little busters refrain, where much like the other characters in the anime, Kud reflects on herself and her life thinking shes weak and shit with riki being the romantic interest to get her out of this mindstate and wake up from the dream, its pretty clear she's in the dream from early in the film, but thats here or there, if you've come from either the VN or anime its no biggie, what I wanted to see from this film was all that was good in little busters, Pretty art, quality characters voiced well, some bangin music, and a good warm hearted story about friendship, youth, loving yourself, all that shit; We have those things i guess, its a strange kind of movie though.To talk about the animation quick, its great, if you like the bright colours, linework and general design layout of the little busters anime, its the exact same thing, it would of been nice to see something new done considering this is meant to be a special kind of spin off and the first piece of little busters content we've seen in a while, but it's still good eye candyIt would of been nice to see more characters that weren't Kud or Riki, especially considering riki's character is having no character, and its been so long since little busters came out i imagine a good few of you like me hardly even remember kuds story apart from her being naked a few times on a hill. We got to see a little bit of the classic main characters, that nowhere near enough time was spent on, it would of driven the plot of the story that she needed her friends better if we saw her friends for more than 5 minutes, and the rest of the watch time wasn't just swooning over riki. And the new characters they introduced, i must imagine they had to be a hell of a lot more interesting in the VA, because here they don't do anything, the younger one whos name I forgot is just there, makes a water bottle rocket and thats it, and the older one has her past told to us, says a few things about space and then also doesn't appear much, It just be nice to be shown characters a lot more so we feel Kud's connection to them instead of just being told about them.Music was a bit lacklustre compared to what we've seen before, nothing really memorable, and no real throw backs to anything from the anime, I've been told the Kud VA at least had an opening that was good, but its just stuff that's Un-insulting hereAnd finally the story, which from my perspective felt like a fever dream more than a story, i feel like this is a story that easily could of been told by changing a few bits and slapping Rin on the cover instead. Probably annoying to hear for Kud stands, whoever you are, but it followed a lot of the structure Little busters refrain did, which i guess might just be what the structure of the VA was to get you to your ending, depending on which girl you considered best, so is this just fanservice for the Kud fans after 0 Little buster content in the past 7 years? Pretty much, but when i think of little busters, romance hardly comes to mind, Little busters is a story about enjoying friendship and coming together, loving what you have while you have it, and how the hardships of life can be beaten with your friends, THATS the story of little busters we want to here, and its just hidden within a strange romance esc story where everyone wants to bone you, or in the animes case riki. So making a 50 minute film for a slight adjustment of a story we've already seen in a sense seems kinda pointless. If you like Kud that much and wanted riki to end up with her, well go read the VN, or just close your eyes, and picture REALLY hard that Rin was Kud at the end of refrain. Because in 50 minutes you can't really tell the story of kud anyway, and thats excluding the fact that portions of this film are just a bit strange, like randomly panting on each other on a hill, the useless inclusion of Aziruzki Shinna, some strange and offputting sex scenes between a young loli and a character who might as well be a plank of wood, It just doesn't play out well in this format, they either needed to do a longer piece dedicating more time to setting things up and how they wanted to demonstrate things, scrap the OVA, and just make Kud wafter into a small spin off anime season like Little Busters EX, or just scrap the whole idea all together, and as much as I've just dogpilled on the story, if you liked little busters you will probably at least fine some light enjoyment out of this, getting to see what little chemistry between the characters as you do, and if you really liked Kud in the VA, then getting this little bit of fan service i guess is a nice little cherry on top to the Little Busters Anime. For 50 minutes, its not insulting, but considering how long this took to make, and how long its been since we got any animated little busters content, it just would of been nice to see something that was more than an extended Kud episode from another reality. Hope you enjoy it Kud stans... whoever you are little busters is that she had some cute and funny fanservice for the show to build up the universe a bit, and that was it, very little opinion on her, with that said lets actually review the film.

Because in 50 minutes you can't really tell the story of kud anyway, and thats excluding the fact that portions of this film are just a bit strange, like randomly panting on each other on a hill, the useless inclusion of Aziruzki Shinna, some strange and offputting sex scenes between a young loli and a character who might as well be a plank of wood, It just doesn't play out well in this format, they either needed to do a longer piece dedicating more time to setting things up and how they wanted to demonstrate things, scrap the OVA, and just make Kud wafter into a small spin off anime season like Little Busters EX, or just scrap the whole idea all together, and as much as I've just dogpilled on the story, if you liked little busters you will probably at least fine some light enjoyment out of this, getting to see what little chemistry between the characters as you do, and if you really liked Kud in the VA, then getting this little bit of fan service i guess is a nice little cherry on top to the Little Busters Anime. For 50 minutes, its not insulting, but considering how long this took to make, and how long its been since we got any animated little busters content, it just would of been nice to see something that was more than an extended Kud episode from another reality. Hope you enjoy it Kud stans... whoever you are"", ""I don't think there's any right way to adapt a visual novel. It's a medium often overlooked by the western anime watching community, but the influences of those early gal games are strong across many genres of anime. Many of the character archetypes we find so common today can trace their origins back to visual novel tropes. The problem when adapting these things, and trying to do it faithfully, is the choose your own adventure nature of vn storytelling. How can you faithfully adapt every route, every choice? You can't, without making some fans angry. Best you can do is adapt the common route, throw...in a few episodes with hints of some of the other girls' routes and adapt the good or true ending with the main heroine. Then make side content like this.I guess I should say that I never played any of the original visual novels. My knowledge of Little Busters is solely based in the anime adaptations supplemented by cursory wiki reading to fill in the gaps. Frankly visual novels are a huge time sink and I've got enough in my plan to watch to merit not wanting to spend more time on extra homework. My assumption is that this movie exists in a sort of alternate route from the main story, where Kud is the main heroine that Riki focuses on. That's just the best I can come up with from conjecture.I really liked Little Busters, and certainly this story won't make much sense if you aren't familiar with that story. This is like a fun little side adventure in that world they created together. It ends on a more poignant note with Kud being the girl to pull through. It actually isn't clear what the fate of the rest of them is in this version. I don't remember them saying anything about it anyway.So if you were a huge Kud fan and wanted Riki to choose her as his best girl here's the story for you. If you prefer the more generic ending you can just think of this as non-canon, or make up whatever ending you want, really. Like I said at the outset, there's no right way to adapt a visual novel. If you're a purest you can just dump the 80+ hours into playing the original game. Have fun with that.8/10 in a few episodes with hints of some of the other girls' routes and adapt the good or true ending with the main heroine.

And this review has spoilers.In the beginning they make a melodrama for Wafu (I don\'t care what her name is, go with Wafu anyway) only for her to say that she wanted to spend more time with Riki. What is the point of this? It had no narrative function that it is really necessary to use drama. This part was right after the beginning, when the boys have to stay in empty rooms in the girls\' dorm because their room was flooded with water.There is one part that was so stupid, I started laughing....Wafu takes it and starts to take off his T-shirt together with Riki to both draw an emblem on each other with what looked like chocolate. Seriously... WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? And seriously, when Riki starts drawing on her, she starts moaning ""wafu""... What the fuck! Seriously, why this? Why so fucking cool about a bad fucking romance? It makes a fucking drama just for them to kiss and in the next scene they appear naked on the bed? They were outside the dorm at night, I guess they went to the dorm to have sex after this bad drama. Hahahahahaha After that, Wafu starts singing a lullaby while putting her hand on Riki\'s head just as he is sleeping. SHE STARTED SINGING A LULLABY AFTER HAVING SEX WITH THE KID? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? That was one of the stupidest (and even funniest) things I have ever seen in an anime.(This was all in 30 minutes of torture watching this OVA)After all this stupid stuff, Wafu goes to make breakfast for Riki, since the whole school is closed and everyone has gone home. Wafu making breakfast, they keep focusing on her skirt while she is humming and swaying. All right, you want to show me that this loli is hot? Show me her naked at once.Oooooooooh! at the end it shows that Wafu was in a coma. So all this stuff that was so bad to watch only happened in her dreams. Hahahahahahahahaha-It\'s hard for me to complain about original dubbing, in this case Japanese dubbing. But in this anime, the voices of basically all the characters don\'t match with them, no matter how much I got used to it as the episode went on.Seriously, this is the first time I have complained about the voice not matching in an anime with the original dub. I am not going to list the reason why each character does not have a voice that matches themselves.Within 10 minutes of this OVA, I was already wanting to watch this on mute. The characters have such discordant voices and are so annoying that I really wanted to mute it. Seriously, the characters are as annoying as the entire cast of the Trashgatari Series, an anime that I can\'t stand to see or hear the characters (just thinking about Trashgatari stresses me out).Character design doesn\'t bother me as much.Well, at least it doesn\'t come close to being garbage like Sword Art Online\'s design.The characters themselves, I didn\'t like any of them. I won\'t go into detail as to why I didn\'t like any of them.I can say that Wafu is one of the worst characters. For example: Hoshino from Planetarian, or Ayu from Kanon, they are cute in a natural way, and are not forced like in this OVA (don\'t forget that these two characters and works I mentioned, are also from Key).No, her talking ""wafu"" doesn\'t make her cute.The production is pretty consistent, so there\'s nothing to complain about. And I don\'t even want to talk about it.Anyway, I only saw this OVA for the simple fact that I am watching one OVA each year, starting with the first one in 1983 (so far, Kud Wafter was the worst), and in 2020 I had no choice but this.That OVA made it a point for me to never come close to Little Busters.I give up on Key\'s works. I like Planetarian and Kanon, but I refuse to watch any of their other works again.

Kishin Douji Zenki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1573/Kishin_Douji_Zenki,"['To sum up this anime in three words: ""It\'s very 90s""Art and Sound: 5/10-The demons, besides the \'nice\' ones, look like classic demons from Japanese paintings. They\'re fairly well drawn and interesting to look at.-The overall art is a little dated and generic but is still nice to look at.-The music is pretty forgettable and the sounds used throughout sound as if they were ripped from well known audios that have been heard a hundred times over.Characters: 3/10-There is very little to no character development and they all fall into tropes. The perverted old grandfather, the whiny high school girl, the all muscle...and no brains demon who yells about everything and cares about no one (if zenki isn\'t basked off goku i\'ll eat my left shoe).Enjoyment/Story: 1/10-I wanted to like this show. I kept skipping large chunks of each episode hoping something interesting or new would happen. Nothing ever did. Even the ending climaxes for archs were meh.-My biggest peeve is it suffers from magical girl transformation syndrome. First, it\'s one stock transformation. Then two. Then three every episode as the show progresses. It gets redundant and is a waste of screen time.-You could probably watch the first episode of each arch then skip to any of the episodes and feel like you haven\'t missed a thing. and no brains demon who yells about everything and cares about no one (if zenki isn\'t basked off goku i\'ll eat my left shoe).Enjoyment/Story: 1/10-I wanted to like this show.

It is an action anime with relatively quick (5-10 minutes on average) fights between monsters drawn in the traditional Japanese style and usually spawned by some nefarious being or beings and the guardian demon Zenki. The show has two main arcs featuring different villains in each one and takes on different tones, with the second one being somewhat darker than the first.As far as production values are concerned the anime is good for the era, having everything that one could expect from a show like this: hand-drawn art, usage of theme variations as incidental and battle music, a growing cast of characters and elements of comedy. These are all done to an acceptable standard.As far as personal enjoyment is concerned, the show was very entertaining and always had my attention for the entire episode and kept me guessing as what was going to happen next, as there would be occasional plot twists as well.Overall, this show receives my recommendation as one to watch, even if it is lesser-known.Additionally, subtitled and dubbed offerings are available, so everyone should be satisfied with their show requirements.I have averted spoilers outright, but if you want more, then I have written a more detailed review on my website, but due to review guidelines, I cannot leave it here, so please view my profile in order to get the link.

Thank you"", ""The Kishin Douji Zenki anime series consists of 51 episodes, which were based on the work of Kikuhide Tani and Yoshihiro Kuroiwa.This was one of the few anime that were on TV in my country, but it never reached the same popularity as Dragon Ball and Yugioh.I have no idea how popular Zenki is outside, but seeing the lack of it everywhere it's probably not that popular.STORY/PLOT:The story is nothing special, it follows a school girl named Chiaki Enno who is able to free Zenki, a powerful Demon God and together they try to stop Karuma and other bad guys. While ''main character...who owns demon'' is pretty common trope, you have to remember this was made in the 90s.CHARACTERS:I have no idea how to feel about cast. It's small and it lacks development, but it's not like they are bad.In the second arc the cast becomes bigger and Zenki even gets a teammate, who’s name is Akira, but despite having powers he doesn’t do much (well until the latest parts), which is a shame because I was really hyped, only to be met with the wasted potential.The best characters probably would be Souma and Dog Deity.SOUND:The opening is banger. It is in the top 10 best old school anime openings, for sure.As for voice acting, well I’m not a pro when it comes to it but I didn’t see any problem with it. I think it was fine. I mean I absolutely loved Zenki’s voice, when he was in his real/adult form of course.ENJOYMENT:Some episodes were meh, but most were nice. Even though I don’t like episodic anime, Zenki was surprisingly fun.I just wish Zenki spent more time in his real form, instead of his dwarf/shota/little kid form lol.OVERALLUnderrated gem. Despite it flaws, I had fun with it. If you love old school anime you should definitely check this one.

Now that i've seen it, I can exclaim that Zenki is one of the most middle of the road 90's anime I have ever seen. In everyway it feels like it did things other anime did and would do later but worse.The story is very simple, there's these evil seeds that control people's desires and turn them into monsters, Zenki is unwittingly freed from his...seal to fight one-dimensional bad guys who want to use them to their advantage. Most of the series is episodic mosnter of the week fights that are over in one attack, but when the story finally gets on going, most plot threads are solved two episodes after they're introduced and nothing really changes beyond some extra powerups. Other plot threads just feel predictable, like Zenki almost losing control for the third time. And when there finally is something interesting, such as both villain x good guy ships, they don't lead anywhere.The characters are equally simple, good guys are good, bad guys are evil. Zenki is just a one-dimensional version of a character like InuYasha or Tora (though he's still entertaining to watch), while Chiaki is a more one dimensional version of Kagome (I'm aware this anime predates InuYasha btw). Yukai and Kuribayashi are the comic reliefs, but they're mostly jokes you'd see on other anime at the time (Kuribayashi being embarrased at his pervy grandpa master's antics). Though there are two jokes that actually made me laugh so that's something. Almost all the others have the personality of a wooden plank, with the exception of Inugami, which has a Vegeta-esque arc, and Kazue, who is pretty badass.The animation is very cheap, it reeks of repeating transformations to pad out time like it's Sailor Moon, panning shots with little to no movement, low framerates, everything that people dislike about 90s anime and anime in general is in this show. I can't say much about the japanese voices, but i've seen the LatAM dub and it's servicable, some songs are also pretty good, OP was sung by the same guy behind Chala Head Chala (DBZ) and Sonic Drive (Sonic X) too, so it's an expected banger (though not as good as the previous too)The show really dragged on at times mainly due to some very slow storytelling and excessive monster of the week filler. Overall, if you want a good demon fighting show in the same style, look for Ushio & Tora, which do everything this show does in a vastly superior way (granted the anime for that one came out 20-ish years later) The story gets less time to get going, and when it does, it's very well written.

Much like a classic James Bond opening, it's over the top and a lot of fun, plus here it does tie into the main plot as well.This time the Lupin gang are up against an all female terrorist organization, the Bloody Angels. They want the artifact from Lupin, and it leads to an engaging story with some nice twists.Lupin, his trusty sidekick Jigen, his sexy accomplice...Fujiko, and his swordsman buddy Goemon all are in top form in this.

He has some great one on one scenes with Lupin as well, very effective stuff.Pretty much, this has everything you can ask for in a Lupin tale. Great comedy, cool action, and some solid drama, starring a classic cast of lovable characters. Done with style, terrific animation, and a very cool jazz soundtrack by Yuji Ohno.Without giving away the story, I'll just say that this is a terrifically done anime that left me very satisfied.

When Sasuke calls Naruto a loser, he says 'bunny swim' for some reason. It cracked me up. The story isn't that great, but it's still fun to watch and the end is really surprising. The reason I enjoyed it so much was probably the subs, otherwise it would have been a regular special. But it was really fun. "", ""Esta review también está en español.Naruto to Mashin to Mitsu no Onegai Dattebayo!! (wich means Naruto, the Genie, and 3 Wishes) is the special (not movie, like the info page says) that accompanies the fourth movie of Naruto Shippuden. This short is similar to Konoha's sports festival (but without the eschatological humor xD), the special that was in the first movie. So, don't take this thing too seriously.Story: Konoha's rookie teams have a day off, and they decide to go to a picnic all together. While team 7 is eating, Naruto finds a strange bottle, which have a genie inside (no f*cking way!) that will...grant three wishes to the person who ask them. Thanks to Naruto's idiocy, two wishes were wasted, so there's only one left... And that's the start for the battle in which all the Genins (except Chouji, he's too busy eating to be worried about something as trivial as the fulfillment of his dreams; and Hinata, who just stands there) will try to get the last wish.Animation: Very good. Despite being a pre-shippuden story, with the younger characters, this was done in 2010, and we can see a slight improvement over the original series. The character designs is correct, though Ino has long hair, and Sakura has it short, so this special can't be placed chronologically in the series's continuity (a detail so stupid that I'm not even sure why I’m mentioning it xD). The jutsus are well done (especially the fire ones), the techniques are the pre Tsunade search ones.The landscape is a semiparadisiac island/resort, that reminds a little the forest in the Chunin exam.Sound: Nothing new here, the voices are good as usual. Good intonation, good presence, blablabla. There's virtually no music in this short, there's no opening and the ending last less than twenty seconds.Verdict: Despite being relatively simple, this special fulfills its purpose quite well: it makes the viewer laugh for a while, with a relaxed and humorous story. This is highly, highly recommended for Naruto fans, and since it set in the classic stage, Shippuden is not needed to understand what's going on.--------Naruto to Mashin to Mitsu no Onegai Dattebayo!! (que se traduce a algo así como Naruto, el genio y los tres deseos) es el especial (no película, como figura en la info de esta página) que acompaña a la cuarta película de Naruto Shippuden. Es un corto humorístico similar al festival deportivo de Konoha (pero sin el humor escatológico xD), que estaba en primera película de Naruto. No debe tomarse demasiado en serio.Historia: Es un día libre para los cuatro equipos novatos de Konoha, y lo aprovechan celebrando un picnic todos juntos. Mientras el equipo 7 está comiendo, Naruto descubre una extraña botella, en la que adentro vive un genio (aunque no lo crean), que le concederá tres deseos al que se los pida. Por culpa de la estupidez de Naruto, dos deseos se desperdiciaron, y solo queda uno... es por esto que se desata una lucha en la que todos los Genin (excepto Chouji, que está muy ocupado comiendo como para preocuparse de algo tan trivial como el cumplimiento de sus sueños; y Hinata, que simplemente se queda parada) para conseguir el último deseo.Animación: Muy buena.

Thanks to Naruto's idiocy, two wishes were wasted, so there's only one left... And that's the start for the battle in which all the Genins (except Chouji, he's too busy eating to be worried about something as trivial as the fulfillment of his dreams; and Hinata, who just stands there) will try to get the last wish.Animation: Very good. Despite being a pre-shippuden story, with the younger characters, this was done in 2010, and we can see a slight improvement over the original series. The character designs is correct, though Ino has long hair, and Sakura has it short, so this special can't be placed chronologically in the series's continuity (a detail so stupid that I'm not even sure why I’m mentioning it xD). The jutsus are well done (especially the fire ones), the techniques are the pre Tsunade search ones.The landscape is a semiparadisiac island/resort, that reminds a little the forest in the Chunin exam.Sound: Nothing new here, the voices are good as usual. Good intonation, good presence, blablabla. There's virtually no music in this short, there's no opening and the ending last less than twenty seconds.Verdict: Despite being relatively simple, this special fulfills its purpose quite well: it makes the viewer laugh for a while, with a relaxed and humorous story. This is highly, highly recommended for Naruto fans, and since it set in the classic stage, Shippuden is not needed to understand what's going on.--------Naruto to Mashin to Mitsu no Onegai Dattebayo!! (que se traduce a algo así como Naruto, el genio y los tres deseos) es el especial (no película, como figura en la info de esta página) que acompaña a la cuarta película de Naruto Shippuden. Es un corto humorístico similar al festival deportivo de Konoha (pero sin el humor escatológico xD), que estaba en primera película de Naruto. No debe tomarse demasiado en serio.Historia: Es un día libre para los cuatro equipos novatos de Konoha, y lo aprovechan celebrando un picnic todos juntos. Mientras el equipo 7 está comiendo, Naruto descubre una extraña botella, en la que adentro vive un genio (aunque no lo crean), que le concederá tres deseos al que se los pida. Por culpa de la estupidez de Naruto, dos deseos se desperdiciaron, y solo queda uno... es por esto que se desata una lucha en la que todos los Genin (excepto Chouji, que está muy ocupado comiendo como para preocuparse de algo tan trivial como el cumplimiento de sus sueños; y Hinata, que simplemente se queda parada) para conseguir el último deseo.Animación: Muy buena.

Correction: this is NOT a movie.This episode could have easily passed as one of the filler episodes, I still don't see its co-relation to the fifth movie but there you go, a Genie wakes up and all the kids wreak havoc to make their own personal wish, it really does remind you of how clumsy Sasuke once was, makes you kinda miss him when it was all fun and play, an, of course, some Kakashi fun into the mix as well, it can never go wrong.Honestly, I don't see anyone watching...this outside of nostalgia for the old OG Naruto days. this outside of nostalgia for the old OG Naruto days."", ""It's nice to have a little special in the original Naruto anime now and then. This one had a nice ring to it. I find the genie concept really humurous. This special is almost equivalent to the holy grail war from the Fate/Stay Night series only with Naruto characters. We see a little bit of character development behind the characters here (i.e. What they wish for). The subtitles were poorly edited but even if it had subtle subtitles, the results of this review would be the same.  The results of this review: The special was phenomonal! "", ""After watching a lot of one-offs and specials, I can confidently say this not only my favorite Naruto special, but my favorite anime special in general. There was never a dull moment, and the comedy that was there hit pretty well. This special has aged pretty well and would be enjoyable for anyone to watch, even without much experience with the source material. Obviously, this plot shouldn't be taken too seriously as it is a special, so it's bound to be a goofy adventure.as a side note, I would like to think that at the end of the special they jumped Kakashi lmfaoooooo "", ""This Naruto short is strikingly gorgeous when you look at the visual quality, and the story is, though largely predictable, captivating. The makers have pulled off an Aladdin twist on Naruto this time and have largely succeeded. A lot of things about the story are predictable, but in a good way instead. There's a lot of cool action and comedy throughout. No drama. Just 14 minutes of typical Naruto fun. Even though you might be familiar with the genie concept, it still keeps you engaged amidst fast-paced chasing action to find out what wish is exactly fulfilled in the end. It truly is worth it. "", ""This is another humorous romp with a fun, silly concept, and if you go into it expecting nothing more than just that, you'll be entertained.Here you have the Konoha genins fighting over the last wish of a genie bottle. It lightheartedly pits the characters against each other, so we get to witness more of their interactions and group dynamics, something I always think is fun. But my favorite part would have to be just watching the characters' responses or reactions. It's refreshing seeing a playful Neji and Sasuke, and adorable watching a hesitant Hinata. A diplomatic, rational Shikamaru is also right in character.This...is just what I expected it to be. is just what I expected it to be.""]"

Diane has regained her memories of her 500 years with King. I am infuriated that they stuck such a big moment inside of such a fillery anime.  I am doubly infuriated by the way it was handled.  It was already hard to suspend belief that King behaves the way he does around Diane.  He spent 500 years with her, the whole time knowing she cared deeply for him.  He stole her memories because of that.  But, throughout he keeps acting like a teenager crushing on the new girl.  Imagine spending 182,500 days with a woman, seeing her naked, sleeping on her chest, telling each other you\'ll stay together forever, and then nose-bleeding because you touched her boobs.  Boobs you literally slept on before. It makes no sense.But do you know what makes even less sense?  Is that the woman whose memories you took, at some point, come flooding back into her.  And instead of exploding with shock, or happiness, or rage at you not returning...she says nothing.  A lost 500 years comes flooding back into her mind, that the guy she\'s been hanging around for the past 15 years is actually like her soulmate, and she\'s just going to play it coy?  And then when she finally reveals she remembers, she doesn\'t cry, she doesn\'t ask why you never said anything, she just starts subtly saying things you said to her and then kisses you on the cheek when you ask if she remembers.  Nonsense.And as weak of a reveal that is, they then stomp on it with sheer stupidity by having King get hit on the head by a brick and getting convenient amnesia causing him to forget what happened.  And then the illogical cherry on this nonsensical cake? Diane just doesn\'t bother to remind him of what just happened. ""This is fine."". THIS IS FINE?! You just remembered your love of 500 years, and he just forgot that you remembered him and you\'re fine with that?  Screw you anime.  Screw you and the stupid horse you rode in on.Anyway...2.

The entire first episode is all about chasing Hawk who, for some reason, after years of travelling with Meliodas actually believes he\'ll eat him. (Filler logic).  The second episode is mostly Ban and Meliodas fighting a pointless fight in a box.  The third episode is King playing tag with Diane.  The fourth episode is Vivian stalking Gilthunder, because yes, they thought that was important enough to dedicate an episode to.

Diane has regained her memories of her 500 years with King. I am infuriated that they stuck such a big moment inside of such a fillery anime.  I am doubly infuriated by the way it was handled.  It was already hard to suspend belief that King behaves the way he does around Diane.  He spent 500 years with her, the whole time knowing she cared deeply for him.  He stole her memories because of that.  But, throughout he keeps acting like a teenager crushing on the new girl.  Imagine spending 182,500 days with a woman, seeing her naked, sleeping on her chest, telling each other you\'ll stay together forever, and then nose-bleeding because you touched her boobs.  Boobs you literally slept on before. It makes no sense.But do you know what makes even less sense?  Is that the woman whose memories you took, at some point, come flooding back into her.  And instead of exploding with shock, or happiness, or rage at you not returning...she says nothing.  A lost 500 years comes flooding back into her mind, that the guy she\'s been hanging around for the past 15 years is actually like her soulmate, and she\'s just going to play it coy?  And then when she finally reveals she remembers, she doesn\'t cry, she doesn\'t ask why you never said anything, she just starts subtly saying things you said to her and then kisses you on the cheek when you ask if she remembers.  Nonsense.And as weak of a reveal that is, they then stomp on it with sheer stupidity by having King get hit on the head by a brick and getting convenient amnesia causing him to forget what happened.  And then the illogical cherry on this nonsensical cake? Diane just doesn\'t bother to remind him of what just happened. ""This is fine."". THIS IS FINE?! You just remembered your love of 500 years, and he just forgot that you remembered him and you\'re fine with that?  Screw you anime.  Screw you and the stupid horse you rode in on.Anyway...2.

It is 4 episodes of mostly filler. That being said it does not make it any less enjoyable.Many have complained about personality changes however this is not true, everything is developmental. Diane changes as she regains her lost memories. Gil is a lot more laid back and less serious now that Margret is safe. Jericho's opinion of Ban changes due to the fact he saved her brother and herself from the Demon.At the end of the day Season 2 is probably best called an OVA but it is still...a good watch a good watch"", ""Warning possible SpoilersUsually I don't dig filler episodes, but SDS Signs of Holy War was actually ok from what it showed and honestly it just made the sins even more fun characters.Story (9/10)Now these episodes take place in the aftermath of the battle for Liones and before Meliodas along with the others leave the city.Each episode had a specific focus, the first focused on the characters recovering from the battle and chasing Hawk around the city, because of a joke Meliodas made. The second episode focused on the fight between Meliodas and Ban as they settle the score. The third episode focused more on the...relationship between King and Diane, while the final episode pretty much cleared up whatever happened to Vivian after the battle and also shows Gowther trying to understand human emotion more.Each of these episodes were really fun to watch and carried on the aspect of why I loved the series in the first place.Yet somehow it continues to annoy with it's lack of character deaths by showing Hendrickson is still alive though not for long as he sacrifices his body to open a seal, but he managed to do it thanks to Dreyfus, who has somehow come back from the dead which didn't seem possible since he was literally turned to ash by Hendrickson. Luckily these scenes were short and are pretty much the buildup for the threat season 2 is going to offer us.Characters (9/10)Despite being only 4 episodes we still see the sins develop quite a bit, especially King and Diane who are pretty much my favourite ship at this point now.We get to see Gowther develop a little too, considering he went out of his way to help a young boy remember what his mother looked like, even if it didn't go the way he expected.We also got to see a little more of Merlin and what her character is like, but it was only a little and doesn't give us much to make her a truly likeable character yet, however we do know she's the only sin who actually doesn't go along with everything Meliodas does.The tension between Meliodas and Ban also grew more here and it was sorted out in a pretty epic way, much like during the tournament match when they were trying to get Diane's hammer, we really got to see why their best buddies with each other and why they are more than just comrades in arms.Art (8/10)There really wasn't anything significant with the artstyle, other than it keeping up with the previous series, although Meliodas and Bans fight was definitely a sight to behold.Sound (8/10)The op wasn't exactly that great, it's a far cry from the two good ops we got in the first season, but considering this is just filler type series leading up to season 2 I'll cut it some slack, plus it was interesting seeing the sins wearing classy outfits.Extras:There isn't really much to say here, other than that this filler series still retains what made the first season so enjoyable, a bunch of funny comedy, good character development and some kickass action, although the only action was between Meliodas and Ban, but that was enough for me.Enjoyment (9/10)Overall (9/10)Overall this is a nice filler series leading up to season 2 and the hype for me wanting to watch season 2 when it's finally finished just keeps on growing. relationship between King and Diane, while the final episode pretty much cleared up whatever happened to Vivian after the battle and also shows Gowther trying to understand human emotion more.Each of these episodes were really fun to watch and carried on the aspect of why I loved the series in the first place.Yet somehow it continues to annoy with it's lack of character deaths by showing Hendrickson is still alive though not for long as he sacrifices his body to open a seal, but he managed to do it thanks to Dreyfus, who has somehow come back from the dead which didn't seem possible since he was literally turned to ash by Hendrickson.

There wasn't that many over-the-top battles like the previous two seasons, and the show mainly focused on character interactions. Some of them were bland, others were memorable. The only memorable ones were with Ban and Gowther, since they are the only ones that have more depth to them. The bland ones were with the redeemed villains. After the Holy Knights were redeemed, they had no purpose. Their only purpose was to stand there and provide small talk. Oh, and to provide surface-level drama.

Just mostly my positives and negative for each episode in my opinion. (I do curse every now and then, if that offends you...

Then the anime lost me when they completely cucked King out of a decent ending with her by having him forget the whole day... When not even a season ago, this man was tanking far worse with his guard down and completely fine...

In addition the constant struggle between nations led to chaos and destruction where countless lives were lost. The war took to oblivion the...meaning of the civilization that once existed. The bonds of this condemned world are reflected in the few survivors who day after day must be scavengers to obtain some food for humans and this is where Tsushima works as a business man.Story: An anime with a good story. It has everything, mystery, emotion, sadness, love, action, tears and much more. The story could be straightforward and conceptually very simple but that\'s not the case. The show highlights concepts such as friendship, trust, why the old man\'s house became important to Tsushima. Also, we can observe the constant need to find the truth and the need to resolve the ""what is going to eat Tsushima tomorrow"" mysteries. Besides, the story blended very well with the art and soundtrack to produce a beautiful animation.Art: The artwork is way more than movie quality, it does not feel like a crappy TV anime at all, every single scene looks like something out of the reality. From the background art which looks lifelike at times due do some absolutely amazing pastel drawing, to the food which looks like it belongs in a Ghibli film with its detail and rich colors, everything in the show has a lot of love and care put into it to an extent that is shocking for a TV anime. Most of the transition scene backgrounds, such as the old man (actually an old woman) walking in the rain or the trash cans in the alley can very well work as wallpaper for a 8k computer background, it cannot be understated exactly how detailed all the art is for this series.Sound: The sound is pretty amazing. I am a bit amazed by the score; it can compete with Kalafina\'s soundtracks. Also, the track rises the climax of each episode. For example, the central theme (Episode 1, Ending) adds the concept of mystery and innocence to the story. The sound mix is excellent, you can feel with your senses the desolation and the ruins because the sound boosts the ambiance and the characters actions. The OP is very catchy, has a constant rhythm where you can see some traits of the main characters, and it has interesting lyrics. About the ED, it isn\'t as good as the OP but in general is a good song.Characters: Everyone is back with the adaptation of this masterpiece but this time there will be some additions to make this masterpiece even more enjoyable. Of course the spot light is on Tsushima in this series, and this journey for him has been a rough one and full of difficulties. Now like I said earlier some fans will be split on Tsushima\'s actions in the latter half of this series. So it is up to you to decide on how you feel at the end, but for me it was tragic in a good way. I\'ve rarely ever felt more understanding, and sympathetic for a character. Concerning the rest of the cast, none of them were really side lined, except for the new addition, Cha. Cha is one of the already adopted cat, and she is orange. Which I am actually fine with considering I came to see the characters I have grown to love, but then I just think back to why she was there to start with (fan service probably). Anyways it was great to see everyone for one last show, and minus the addition of Cha, they brought their all.Enjoyment: Ore, Tsushima is a philosophic western with equal parts humor and seriousness, and is already considered by many within the anime community to be even more than a classic. There is a level of sophistication in both the story and its characters that is rare for a show, regardless of whether it is an anime or not. The great cast, the heavy drama tempered with bouts of comedy, the excellent music, all serve to cement its place in the hearts and minds of anime fans the world over. It is a testament to its quality that there is only one show, anime or otherwise, that can be held up as a fair comparison. This is considered by many to be a must to see series as it is a testament to what can be achieved in anime with the right ingredients.Overall: The anime speaks for itself, I have no more words to describe it, it is way more than a masterwork, I would like to consider it as ""The Masterwork"", everything is excellent and I\'m looking forward to see how the story continues and what is going to eat Tsushima tomorrow. meaning of the civilization that once existed.

Who doesn't know about the behaviour of cats? Cats have been one of the most traditional pets in our current society. Used to be worshipped by egyptians, cats were instrumental in plague control. They were viewed as guidance for us, the humans, exalted souls that were mute and exhibit an apparent selfish behaviour, which difference themselves from the dogs. Cats are also a sign of good fortune, and how couldn't it be? The usage of cats for pest control and get rid of the mice was extremely important to our survivorship in the past.Cats. Which is the role of cats in the modern society?...Cats. Cats are strange creatures. They seem distant, but when they want your attention they try to communicate. They seem lazy, but at 3 AM at night they start to go raw. Nocturnal creatures, we as humans couldnt less relate with that, as our forced behaviour is to sleep at that hours. They are then a passive company, that we need as lonely as we are when everything start move so fast, when the money come and goes and the people start to drift apart.Cats.

That of course is entirely obvious whilst not being obvious. It's about cats that aren't entirely cats.

Sure, there isn't a lot of plot, sure, you may find the characters to be flat, sure, it may lack any reasonable time to develop into something bigger, but why must the lives of cats be...so complicated? This is the perfect fit, nothing else could have served better.On the production side of things, this is nothing more than incredible, it was almost as if the artwork designers used microscopes to elaborate on the more minuscule artistic detail because when the characters physique was presented to the viewer, all you could see was glory in the fur, this isn't true for backgrounds and such, but the children bookish style of such was probably Jun Aoki's way of getting a universal target audience. The audio side of things was entirely reliant on character voicing, of course, were all exemplary performances, how could one not love the reactions.Overall, this anime is just another one of those manga gems based Jun Aoki will adapt for the world to see as an anime spectacle, him + Ore, Tsushima was entirely the correct decision, without question resulting in one of the most enjoyable things in anime, it's time-efficient too.

Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31138/Overlord__Ple_Ple_Pleiades,"['Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character \'Ains Ool Gown\' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades.Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines.The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6...Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you.Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good.I know I haven\'t talked about the story, that\'s because there is no story. It\'s just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me.If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended.Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

Rinne no Lagrange Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12281/Rinne_no_Lagrange_Season_2,"['Watching Rinne no Lagrange II is like taking a walk on the beach but with a breeze of fresh air where you feel and experience the fun as well as the joy of being young. But somehow, some way, this series at times seems like one of those titles where you can watch through but feel bored of the somewhat repetitive moments. Those moments are heartwarming, filled with joy, but occasionally also has emotions that can be connected to each of our own young lives. At any rate, this series seems be one of the most underrated titles of this summer. But that\'s ok because...Rinne no Lagrange II isn\'t here for a popularity contest but rather to deliver entertainment that the audience deserves.Rinne no Lagrange II (also known as Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne Season 2) is the direct sequel of the original series that takes place several months after Lan and Muginami leaves Earth. Homesick yet? Well, Madoka should be but thankfully, she gets a surprise visit soon. Now that she\'s a high school student, Madoka has responsibilities to handle but with a little bit of help from her friends, she can do just that.Like the original series, this sequel is also lighthearted with an atmosphere that is suited for more of the younger demographic audience. That doesn\'t mean it\'s for little kids though as there is some drama and intensity involved later on. But still... if you\'re looking for some sex, gore, or mindfuck, then this sequel might disappoint you. (unless a small bit of yuri is part of your taste category)The setting of the sequel is roughly the same. Friendship is one of the key themes in the original series and as such, the Jersey Club is reformed once again and becomes the flower of hope. It\'s more about cute girls doing cute things although at times it is, especially some of the filler episodes. Speaking of which, the story itself in this sequel plays a more direct approach and addresses some more sibling-like dilemmas involving the brothers of two main characters in the series. It becomes more emotional and dramatic to watch and sheds some of that lighthearted feeling. Still though, the filler episodes added in occasionally gets quite bothersome. It certainly isn\'t “maru!” like Madoka often yells throughout the series. No, it\'s not perfect and the story does seem to lose touch at times.Thankfully though, we have the Jersey Club to make up for that. The club still consists of three members:Madoka Kyouno – She is a cherry young girl who is now attending high school. Often or not, she\'s very cheerful, friendly, helpful, and patient with dealing with not only with her problems but those who she cares for. When she accomplishes something or likes what she sees, the term “maru!” comes out of her mouth. She is an adorable character in this sequel especially in some of the latter episodes that explores more of her inner self, in more places than one.Laffinty Fin E Ld Si – or simply just Lan! This girl is a strange one in this sequel alright even from the original title. Her personality hasn\'t changed much although from the beginning of this sequel, she seems to be off balance a bit. Thankfully though, there\'s the Jersey Club who help the helpless. And of course, being a prominent member herself, her cute “woof” personality is retained in this sequel.Muginami – the dramatic character of the trio. In this sequel, she still has that witted personality. Her motivations are to be what\'s best for her friends and maintains a good relationship with her beloved brother. But at times, she shows her emotional self and is even willing to harm others to protect what she treasures the most.These three girls still brings forth entertainment, joy, and also emotions in this sequel on a peaceful Sunday weekend.Well, not exactly. Not everything is peaceful because there are still conflicts. In the latter half of this sequel series, there seems to be troubles brewing among the older peers concerning past events that have left both physical and emotional scars. Beyond that, a new character named Yurikano also joins the series who has one hell of a time during a particular episode with our Jersey Club member, Madoka. She is a strange character to say the least that seems to blur the lines between cheerful and moody. How do I say this? Sometimes, she seems bossy but other times is more emotional especially with Diselmine whom she shares a special bond with. On the more antagonist side, Moid loves brewing trouble and shows his colors to the audience later on.The artwork and battle scenes in this sequel remains relatively the same. Production I.G. delivers that lighthearted style of the typical cool life with the bright sunny daylight and cherry atmosphere. Some of the battle scenes inspire some thrilling action but mostly still retains that lighthearted style of fighting. It\'s not something like Muv Luv: Total Eclipse where aliens are out to eat you alive and have to be exterminated immediately. No, it remains its typical lighthearted Rinne no Lagrange style theme with the girls half naked riding those bad boys (Ovid) in combat. It\'s amusing to watch again in this sequel and brings some chuckle to our heads thinking the way they fight with the danger it poses yet  to them, it\'s like playing a video game without the joysticks. Overall though, the art is alright. Not too special but to the point.The soundtrack of this sequel remains somewhat intact although I have to admit that the original OP song has a better rhythm to it. ""Marble” by Megumi Nakajima does not seem to work here in my opinion. It lacks a sort of rhythm that the original OP song bought to the viewers. That and the fact that it\'s a near replication montage of the Jersey Club girls is a bit repetitive to watch. Jin Aketagawa (Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile, sola) is someone who has experience with creating lighthearted music. In this sequel, he once again presents that soft touch of Rinne no Lagrange-like melody that is dramatic to the ears. But at the same time, it seems to lack any flavor and inspires more of that boredom. It\'s hard to judge but give or take, the music is just so-so.Rinne no Lagrange II is a fun series to enjoy and watch on a bright sunny weekend. You know the first thing you wake up, open your windows, and smell the morning breeze? Ya, that\'s a similar feeling you get when you play the episodes. It\'s not all about play and games though as there is a story going on here. Unfortunately though, the story seems be a bit out of shape although it comes together at times. Pushing forward and rushing it through the story is not a good idea and in this sequel seems to repeat a bit of that mistake. But at the same time, the series presents entertainment of the Jersey Club that is enjoyable to watch. Cute girls doing cute things may be a bothersome at times, but I\'m sure Madoka has a few things to say about that especially since her hobby is to help others in need. It\'s not bothersome to help people and you\'ll feel good about it. That\'s what the Jersey Club is there for and in this sequel, it\'s exactly what they do.Ultimately, Rinne no Lagrange II isn\'t a “Maru!” or “perfect” as Madoka states. Yet, it can be a relaxing, enjoyable series to enjoy on a weekend with the Jersey Club. Rinne no Lagrange II isn\'t here for a popularity contest but rather to deliver entertainment that the audience deserves.Rinne no Lagrange II (also known as Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne Season 2) is the direct sequel of the original series that takes place several months after Lan and Muginami leaves Earth. Homesick yet? Well, Madoka should be but thankfully, she gets a surprise visit soon. Now that she\'s a high school student, Madoka has responsibilities to handle but with a little bit of help from her friends, she can do just that.Like the original series, this sequel is also lighthearted with an atmosphere that is suited for more of the younger demographic audience. That doesn\'t mean it\'s for little kids though as there is some drama and intensity involved later on. But still... if you\'re looking for some sex, gore, or mindfuck, then this sequel might disappoint you. (unless a small bit of yuri is part of your taste category)The setting of the sequel is roughly the same. Friendship is one of the key themes in the original series and as such, the Jersey Club is reformed once again and becomes the flower of hope. It\'s more about cute girls doing cute things although at times it is, especially some of the filler episodes. Speaking of which, the story itself in this sequel plays a more direct approach and addresses some more sibling-like dilemmas involving the brothers of two main characters in the series. It becomes more emotional and dramatic to watch and sheds some of that lighthearted feeling. Still though, the filler episodes added in occasionally gets quite bothersome. It certainly isn\'t “maru!” like Madoka often yells throughout the series. No, it\'s not perfect and the story does seem to lose touch at times.Thankfully though, we have the Jersey Club to make up for that. The club still consists of three members:Madoka Kyouno – She is a cherry young girl who is now attending high school. Often or not, she\'s very cheerful, friendly, helpful, and patient with dealing with not only with her problems but those who she cares for. When she accomplishes something or likes what she sees, the term “maru!” comes out of her mouth. She is an adorable character in this sequel especially in some of the latter episodes that explores more of her inner self, in more places than one.Laffinty Fin E Ld Si – or simply just Lan! This girl is a strange one in this sequel alright even from the original title. Her personality hasn\'t changed much although from the beginning of this sequel, she seems to be off balance a bit. Thankfully though, there\'s the Jersey Club who help the helpless. And of course, being a prominent member herself, her cute “woof” personality is retained in this sequel.Muginami – the dramatic character of the trio. In this sequel, she still has that witted personality. Her motivations are to be what\'s best for her friends and maintains a good relationship with her beloved brother. But at times, she shows her emotional self and is even willing to harm others to protect what she treasures the most.These three girls still brings forth entertainment, joy, and also emotions in this sequel on a peaceful Sunday weekend.Well, not exactly. Not everything is peaceful because there are still conflicts. In the latter half of this sequel series, there seems to be troubles brewing among the older peers concerning past events that have left both physical and emotional scars. Beyond that, a new character named Yurikano also joins the series who has one hell of a time during a particular episode with our Jersey Club member, Madoka. She is a strange character to say the least that seems to blur the lines between cheerful and moody. How do I say this? Sometimes, she seems bossy but other times is more emotional especially with Diselmine whom she shares a special bond with. On the more antagonist side, Moid loves brewing trouble and shows his colors to the audience later on.The artwork and battle scenes in this sequel remains relatively the same. Production I.G. delivers that lighthearted style of the typical cool life with the bright sunny daylight and cherry atmosphere. Some of the battle scenes inspire some thrilling action but mostly still retains that lighthearted style of fighting. It\'s not something like Muv Luv: Total Eclipse where aliens are out to eat you alive and have to be exterminated immediately. No, it remains its typical lighthearted Rinne no Lagrange style theme with the girls half naked riding those bad boys (Ovid) in combat. It\'s amusing to watch again in this sequel and brings some chuckle to our heads thinking the way they fight with the danger it poses yet  to them, it\'s like playing a video game without the joysticks. Overall though, the art is alright. Not too special but to the point.The soundtrack of this sequel remains somewhat intact although I have to admit that the original OP song has a better rhythm to it. ""Marble” by Megumi Nakajima does not seem to work here in my opinion. It lacks a sort of rhythm that the original OP song bought to the viewers. That and the fact that it\'s a near replication montage of the Jersey Club girls is a bit repetitive to watch. Jin Aketagawa (Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile, sola) is someone who has experience with creating lighthearted music. In this sequel, he once again presents that soft touch of Rinne no Lagrange-like melody that is dramatic to the ears. But at the same time, it seems to lack any flavor and inspires more of that boredom. It\'s hard to judge but give or take, the music is just so-so.Rinne no Lagrange II is a fun series to enjoy and watch on a bright sunny weekend. You know the first thing you wake up, open your windows, and smell the morning breeze? Ya, that\'s a similar feeling you get when you play the episodes. It\'s not all about play and games though as there is a story going on here. Unfortunately though, the story seems be a bit out of shape although it comes together at times. Pushing forward and rushing it through the story is not a good idea and in this sequel seems to repeat a bit of that mistake. But at the same time, the series presents entertainment of the Jersey Club that is enjoyable to watch. Cute girls doing cute things may be a bothersome at times, but I\'m sure Madoka has a few things to say about that especially since her hobby is to help others in need. It\'s not bothersome to help people and you\'ll feel good about it. That\'s what the Jersey Club is there for and in this sequel, it\'s exactly what they do.Ultimately, Rinne no Lagrange II isn\'t a “Maru!” or “perfect” as Madoka states. Yet, it can be a relaxing, enjoyable series to enjoy on a weekend with the Jersey Club.', 'Rinne no Lagrange Season 2 is one of the more enjoyable series I\'ve watched recently, although it\'s a little hard to explain why. To put it bluntly, this is a horribly written series, and there isn\'t much to like from an objective standpoint. And yet I still liked it.Taking place several months after the conclusion of the first season, it follows Madoka and her two alien best friends, Lan and Muginami who with the power of their magical mechas--the Vox--they try to persuade Lan and Muginami\'s older brothers Dizelmine and Villagilio (respectively)  to stop warring with each other, and prevent an apocalypse that\'s somehow...connected to the Vox.And that\'s pretty much half of what I could give as a summary to the plot. The story of Rinne no Lagrange is a confusing one, in that it\'s a fantasy series where none of the fantasy elements are ever given explanation.  What exactly are the Vox? Are they bad or good, and how are they related to the apocalypse? Why are the nations of  De Metrio and Le Garite warring with each other? What is with those huge flower things in the sky? None of this is given a clear answer, and since these are the things which the main story revolves around, it causes the whole thing to fall apart.And yet it\'s all tolerable to the point where it\'s actually rather enjoyable in a non-ironic way. Most of the characters themselves are well-written; I wouldn\'t exactly call them deep or anything, but they have likable personalities, and they\'re dramatic needs were believable and clearly expressed--even if the plot surrounding these dramatic needs was not. You may not understand why Madoka and the others are battling against the powers of darkness (or something), you still enjoy watching them do so because of how likable they are.This in part is due to the slice-of-life qaulities of the first season, which allowed you to feel more attached to the characters. The first season also had the problem of infusing these qualities with the more dramatic parts of the story, which consequently made it hard to take certain scenes seriously. Although the straight-up slice-of-life scenes are toned down in Season 2, it still has the problem of having a light-hearted atmosphere when it would probably have done better if it could have taken itself more seriously.It seems as if the writers put so much focus into the characters and slice-of-life elements, that they never bothered to put much thought into the actual plot. Nothing was really even presented as ""questions""--all of the characters just went along with the flow of events as if they already knew the nature of the Vox, or why De Metro and Le Garite were warring.Despite this, Season 2 still manages to have its share of emotional moments, which only get better as the series progresses. However, sometimes you\'ll be enchanted by one of these wonderfully presented scenes, only for some other aspect of the plot to ruin it--canceling out what could be seen as a redeeming quality. In fact, the plot pretty much cancels all of the good qualities that the show has to offer, no matter how enjoyable they might have on their own. connected to the Vox.And that\'s pretty much half of what I could give as a summary to the plot.

Season 1 ended on a bittersweet, unfulfilling note, and the aim of season 2 is to finish the story and finish the journeys of many characters.Season 2 begins several months after the end of season 1, and whatever warm feelings there were between Lan and...Muginami are now swallowed up by conflict. De Metrio claims that Le Garite is trying to use the Vox (Madoka\'s Vox Aura in particular) to destroy the De Metrio star system to avoid a collision expected to happen in 1000 years. To that end, Muginami is ordered to eliminate Madoka if she is ever involved in such a plot, and naturally Lan won\'t stand for such a threat to her best friend. The trio\'s journey starts at an impasse, but seeing them grow into girls who could support one another, even when the exact same situation arose in the final arc, was a fulfilling moment. There\'s a similar evolution in Villagulio\'s character going into and through the final arc.While season 1 did involve extraterrestrial humans to some extent, nearly all of the key scenes are at Kamogawa or in the skies above it. Season 2 added one combat scene at a research facility in another star system, and extensive scenes aboard the Le Garite flagship, but the vast majority of the story is still told at Kamogawa. So while the show is far from leaving Kamogawa behind, we do get more background on Lan and Muginami, as well as their brothers, the leaders of the star systems in conflict.Between the two major arcs in the show, are 2 ""fun filler"" episodes. They\'re all right, in that we get to see the chemistry among not only the 3 heroines, but also their counterparts, the 3 Orbit pilots who settled in Kamogawa as employees of the BWH seaside shack. We see hints of what\'s to come in the final arc, but I feel that there could\'ve been more in the lead-up, like actually showing the manipulation of Dizelmine rather than Moid casually chatting about it.As in season 1, the prime weakness of season 2 is the story, whether in the planning or the execution thereof. The reason why Villagulio is ""exiled"" to what appears to be a prison planet is not very clear, even when it\'s spoken of in dialogue, yet another example of why telling the story in dialogue is far less effective than showing it in a flashback scene. This is the primary weakness of season 2\'s plot, because this is closely tied into the Vox incident involving Yurikano (and hence, the first major conflict in this season), and the final conflict of the series. When a bloodthirsty Dizelmine showed up in a Vox 3 episodes after he signed a ceasefire, I was like, ""Wut? Did Moid give you a lobotomy?"" Similarly, Moid\'s so-called ""voice from beyond"" motivation is likewise either poorly planned, or merely tossed in as part of the rantings of a madman. Because his backstory is conveyed entirely through dialogue (mostly from a maniacal rant in the style of 1980s American cartoon villains), it\'s impossible to tell whether he\'s delusional or lying. I would\'ve pushed for another episode just to show his story-- this is an anime, right? It\'s almost as though 50 different ""cool"" ideas were brainstormed during the planning stages, and lacking a coherent way to tie them together, they just threw them in and made them decorations. Well, all right, it\'s not quite that haphazard, but it really feels like there wasn\'t enough time to express everything.I will admit that the climax made for a really funny Moid scene where he got exactly what he deserved. I suppose that some viewers will have a problem with all the galaxy\'s problems being solved by giant magical flowers popping miraculously out of a planet-darkening cloud of doom because Madoka (more than likely) flew donuts in the ""afterlife"", but I thought that was a decent way to bail out of the story and say ""they all lived happily ever after"" (at least the epilogue was written such that everyone\'s stories went on from there). It\'s a fictional (emphasis: fictional) giant robot show, and the Memoria aspect already borders on magical girl territory, so I can forgive this. Kinda like Sailor Moon without the outfits.It\'s good to see Yurikano\'s character developed beyond ""second Yoko in the afterlife"", but one thing really nags at me, and that\'s the fact that she refuses to say how she feels about her fiance Dizelmine, but she\'s less hesitant to remind Izo of a embarrassing event in their past. Now, I don\'t mind tsunderes, but it\'s a bit of a stretch from the straight shooter in the season 1 finale. The way she thought she could get Dizelmine to behave is a rather ludicrous stereotype that Japanese writers often fall back on: the idea that ""if I sacrifice my happiness, he will be safe or be a better person"". Rarely does it ever work out that way, and suggesting that to viewers as a valid path forward is, in my opinion, continuing a tragic cycle. Fortunately, there are roughly 3 female characters in the show who don\'t think this way.The soundtrack didn\'t sound like there were any major additions to it, and Mamegu\'s opening and ending are fantastic; the ED in particular feels, again, like an echo of Stellvia\'s second ED by Angela compared to the ED in season 1. Unlike the doomsday minor key love song ""The end of the world"", however, the warm orchestration with what sounds like Okinawan instruments brings to mind an ocean sunset, perhaps at Kamogawa. ""Track Suit Spirit"" (USAF ""flight suit attitude""?) is a silly number that probably would\'ve been better used in the filler episodes; but then, ""Wasurenaiyo"" was meant to be used when Yurikano\'s character became more prominent.Lagrange is, through and through, a character show, so plot elements that are great in isolation, serve to further development and drama in this production rather than tell an epic story. There are a number of flaws in the storytelling as a result, but this doesn\'t really compromise the core themes of the show; rather, again, telling fresh stories with good characters is Hard. To the credit of the production staff and cast, this is about the only glaring flaw of the show-- the characters are well written and directed in general, the visuals range from good to amazing, and the soundtrack is solid.

It's an overall enjoying package and honestly for a 3 minute short with 13 episodes a critical part by part analysis seems foolish.Chi-chan and Sora are really couple goals. Chisato is for sure my waifu of the season. Her drunk face, her serious face and her face filled with the love for her husband are too damn cute. If only there were cute girls like that in real life(deep sighs of regret).Rather than reading the many review, go watch it. You will not be disappointed unless you have made up your mind to hate it.P.S. About the many alcoholic recipes given in the anime, I tried to make a few. It was hard and didn't taste right.

Maybe you’ll have more patience for it, but I’m a pretty cynical person by nature so I struggled to not look at it spitefully.The worst issues that plague this show:1. A man gives woman alcohol for the first time, now she’s an alcoholic. (Great influence! Why not marry him!?!)2. She marries him to have a personal bartender. (a Hilariously misguided example of romance.)3. Guy buys his wife with alcohol. (There’s more to love than just substance!)4. She becomes drunk very easily and throws...herself at him.

Even then, the lemon mascot (that shows up a lot) though he\'s expected character design for a mascot isn\'t that bad either. Either way the animation is pretty good if only because of the detailed cocktails.The voice acting....well LA already said it but Eri Kitamura is MVP in this anime short if only because of her great transitioning between strict and focused office lady accenting to delightful drunk.Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is FAR from being a horrible anime short, it\'s just merely a relationship of a husband and wife with alcohol involved and how they help each other from the worst or best of times and the alcohol in question is NOT brought up in a bad light and THAT is quite something even for an anime short.So if you wanna see Eri Kitamura beergasm then Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara has your order. this during a backstory about how they met.The ""beergasm"" if anything is VERY similar to Shokugeki no Souma\'s foodgasms and with Eri Kitamura\'s brilliantly done drunk vocals and her great accenting makes the beergasms all the more to look forward to.The animation done by Creators in Pack did decent enough with this short by showing off some detailed animations on the cocktails as well as the decent enough character designs to make them all distinguishable.

Yes I did.If you were to look at it in a story point of view then don't expect much as the series are just simple 3 minute episodes for our enjoyment.

That was a nice touch the show decide to put at the end to give a bit more closure and also as...a chance to have more cute moments with the two.The entire show is built around these cute moments. Nothing really matters aside from these. Well, maybe aside from the drink recipe you're shown in every episode. If you feel like it you could probably make these drinks on your own since they're really simple, I however haven't tried it.What else is there to say, really? The animation is below average, being mostly very still. The music may as well be non-existent and as mentioned above there's really no story to speak of.What you see is what you get: a lovely, perfect couple and some drinks which make Chi-chan go all red and adorable.I recommend watching this once a day, or once a week since it could get old watching what is essentially the same few story beats over and over again.If you do decide to give this anime a try you'll find a relaxing three minute show that will make you wish you had a wife like Chi-chan or a husband like Sora and maybe also a cold drink in hand. a chance to have more cute moments with the two.The entire show is built around these cute moments.

A good animeAs I have said many times, finding series whose protagonists are a couple is difficult and the issue is even more complicated if you are looking for a place where both are married. And I say really married, those contraptions of an arranged marriage (not consummated) where nobody wants to be; or that couple that is committed, but by third parties and in reality they do not feel...anything, they do not strain anymore.Especially since at the end of the day it is obvious that the intention of the authors is to ""get out"" of the cliché of the epilogue couples by ""putting them together"" at the beginning; but in the end, however theoretically they may not be, in fact they are epilogue couples.And if we get into comedy, the matter is even worse because it is almost a rule that the couple is not together.In addition, the premise is attractive. It is a couple where he is a master to make cocktails and she is an alcohol lover who gets super sweet when she gets drunk. A couple sent to do. In fact, they know each other when she went to have a drink at the bar where he works.Obviously it is that dynamic of her being super serious and cutting when she is sober and super tender when drunk; and he is always looking for ways to make her drunk to enjoy his cuddly wife that moves the whole plot.It is this premise that moves all this anime and as every series that shows a recurring pattern, there is always the risk that it ends up being boring for the repetitive. However, it is the variety of situations that give freshness to the couple\'s interactions.There the manga shows that while you can find variety in the details, repeating the same structure is not a bad approach; and the anime knew how to capture that essence and capture it faithfully and impeccably in each of the episodes.At a technical level it is not a series to highlight, the animation is regular, the design of characters too, the soundtrack does not have much to offer except the ending that lets itself be heard; and the management, although it was not extraordinary, has the merit of having found the ideal way to faithfully adapt the original material.In short, a series that will not be in any top, but that is one of those different and interesting things offered by the season that has just ended.

I realize they're not running on much of a budget but if you're going to make anime, then at least put some effort into it. After looking into the studio who created this anime, I can't say I'm surprised. Everything that they've created is bad. It has no soul, no creative passion. They just find as many web manga/4-koma manga, no matter the quality, to adapt. I fully admit that there are some redeemable things. The ed is good. Drunk moe girl is...cute. But seriously mon, ask yourself, is that worth it? The characters are bland, uninspired, etc. It seems like they've been purposely created to make you viscerally go aww but really their relationship dynamics are nonsensical.

His only perceivable trait is that he is super nice, the perfect hubby.

As a development of a story, the characters, appropriate scenarios, moral of the story, techniques well used. Unfortunately this anime did not live up to expectations.The story is about an alcoholic woman, in which she should produce comical or sexy moments after drinking. From the perspective of being an anime of short duration does not require a dense script, with deep dialogues, yet it does not comply with what is available. The scenes that should be sexy...or comic do not construct dialogues or images that emphasize or convince this.While the characters are at their worst, the author seems to be bold in moments, but overall he is only committed to feminist, politically correct, and ""morally modern"" clichés. There is an inversion in the amime of the roles of man and woman they occupy in society, which is bold, yet it does not seem to be so daring in the scenes when they demanded a little more female sexuality. The woman several times shoots, then cuts the scene and ends the anime frustrating who watches, but if they had a little bit of eechi maybe they could convince and even become funny.Scenarios are limited, within what was expected, the picture quality, stroke rule, sharpness and focus are satisfactory. Although it does not have large fluid scenes, but it is within the proposed and without disappointment. If in other of the quests the anime sends badly at least in this one he is well, presenting / displaying no great error.With regard to techniques what bothered was the sound. The male voice actor, Ichiki, Mitsuhiro of Sora was very annoying, and the lack of a soundtrack, of music, made all the difference to not transmit any emotion. In the other technical aspects no major problems were perceived.The end of the anime, the last three episodes give an improvement, with finally some evolution in history. Despite being a flashback, there is the construction of a novel with a good development and repeating only in the last episodes. We can say that it is the only thing that really saves the anime and possibly also the lemon.Soon the anime if it is that we can call thus, does not have a satisfactory moral conclusion. It could be said that this is a bad taste of alcoholic drinks for women, in which the message is to marry a bartender, make him your domestic servant, and get drunk that he will love you.

Time to read too much into a 39 min anime (closer to 33 from closing credits).1. Q: Are the characters lovable?A: Absolutely! I\'ve not seen much of this season to my own regret but I can still say this is one of the best couples I have seen in a long while.The main couple is once married so instead of the classical cringe of them never admitting their love when it blatant here it is reminded they love one another every...episode.The greatest representation of this is when Sora comes down with a cold and Chi cooks for him. Her ability to do anything is shown to be horrendous but for her husband, she tries multiple time to get it right. ""Through sickness and in health""Every other episode is a representation of Sora\'s love for his wife, Chi. The greatest show of this is when Chi tries to go without alcohol for multiple days. He is shown to be depressed as her condition worsens from fatigue to where he makes a drink specifically to help her. After such, he is shown to be restless in bed without her as he stares at his clock seemingly counting the minutes without her.Leaving bed he walks to her workroom to find her asleep on the computer the complete report beside her. With a smile, he picks her up and carries her to bed before kissing her and complimenting her. ""To love and to cherish""2. Q: Did I enjoy the anime?A: Yes! It\'s very much an adult Himouto! Umaru-chan. Each episode gives you a different drink to try and to go along with diabetes from sugar overload. Maybe not that second part but it sure felt like it. Having now tried three of the twelve they\'ve shown, egg shake, fake beer, and Irish coffee, they seemed to be pretty good.3. Q: What did I dislike about the anime?A: The length of the episodes, but I feel if they were longer the appeal of them would drop. The main part of this show really seems to be showing different types of drinks. In a thirty minute episodes and or a movie-style anime that feeling would be lost.With each episode being short there aren\'t many changes in personality. That doesn\'t mean there isn\'t a story you can read into. I say this because there is a story that if you sit down and ignore the drinks you can love and enjoy.4. Q: Closing words?A: Much like everything else this isn\'t perfect nor is it for everyone. This is about two people who found their love for another from a fateful day of tripping and alcohol.

I just don't know much about their personalty beyond that...or even anything about the supporting cast as well. With little comedy in each episode that kind of got a chuckle out me, the same setup and same joke in each episode makes it predictable and tiring to watch.Animation was surprisingly good for a series with only a three minute run time per episode. It looks fine for what sets out to be with characters looking good and the drinks looking colorful and distinct. Yeah I'm not a person that likes alcohol that much but they were good to look at. As were the voice actors they were fine for what they given to do, though I was not a fan of the ending song.I have seen many short anime series with three to five minutes of content each episode such as this, some of have been great and some have been terrible, Love is like a cocktail falls right in the middle. Its not bad nor is it good, i just personally find it average, though I do wish that the relationship between the main characters was better explored in some of the episodes.  It still is fine especially when I took my time to watch each episode a little at bit throughout my days of watching it, then I would have if I watched it all in one day binge. or even anything about the supporting cast as well.

As were the voice actors they were fine for what they given to do, though I was not a fan of the ending song.I have seen many short anime series with three to five minutes of content each episode such as this, some of have been great and some have been terrible, Love is like a cocktail falls right in the middle. Its not bad nor is it good, i just personally find it average, though I do wish that the relationship between the main characters was better explored in some of the episodes.  It still is fine especially when I took my time to watch each episode a little at bit throughout my days of watching it, then I would have if I watched it all in one day binge."", 'As someone who hates alcohol I found this show to be horrible and greatly disturbing. The show is all about a MAN constantly taking advantage of his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) by using DRUGS such as alcohol to loosen her inhibitions so he can RAPE her, EVERY NIGHT. Now our girl Chisato wasn\'t always a horrible drunk, but she was made that way by a MAN.The origins of Chisato\'s alcoholism is revealed in a flashback later in the series. Back when she didn\'t have a crippling alcohol addiction, then everything changed when a MAN introduced her to alcohol as a fun thing to drink....He lured her in with a sweet alcoholic dessert then as the night went on he continued feeding her these sweet cocktails until she passes out drunk in the bar (I bet that MAN RAPED her while she was passed out). From that moment it is all down hill for Chisato as she is addicted to alcohol now and is all but forced to marry the MAN that started her addiction in the first place. He used alcohol to start her addiction and then using her FORCED addiction he continued to string her along with alcohol until she became his SEX SLAVE (read as wife) and sugar mommy so he wouldn\'t have to work (truly this show is nothing but RAPE CULTURE propaganda propped up by the PATRIARCHY).These tragic events lead to the series proper in which each episode we see this STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN come home to her leach of a husband who feeds her alcohol until her inhibitions are loose enough that he can RAPE her. That is pretty much the story for every episode. The only saving grace of this anime is that it is so short.At a merciful run time of 3 minutes every episode, which is thankfully cut even shorter by the 30 second outro of a fun little ending song with a cute lemon person riding a motorcycle (The only good part of the show in my opinion), I still cannot recommend this to anyone but pedophiles, racists and republicans, after all RAPE is still RAPE no matter how long it lasts. I really liked the little lemon person though so I am adding plus one to the overall rating of the show, and with that I give ""RAPE is like a FORCED ADDICTION"" a 2 out of 10 and a recommendation to skip it.

You don't get a lot in terms of story and development, but it provides just enough enjoyment to be worth the short watch. Plus, the variety of drinks featured (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) provide an interesting educational angle.I will say, the implications of this story are a little disconcerting, as it appears that the wife is an obsessed alcoholic, though she wouldn't allow herself to be drunk in public if at all possible. Considering the target audience of the show, working adults who probably drink a lot anyway, the show does a very good job of presenting the main...couple as responsible adults who care for each other deeply, even if that is mostly implied rather than seen.TL;DR Short cute series for adults that are equal parts story and alcohol couple as responsible adults who care for each other deeply, even if that is mostly implied rather than seen.TL;DR Short cute series for adults that are equal parts story and alcohol"", 'Every now and then, you see one show in a season that no matter what other shows you watch it sticks in your mind, and slowly but surely it becomes your AOTS, or Anime of the Season. Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara is my AOTS for Fall 2017, easily edging out Urahara and more importantly edging out fan favorite Shokugeki no Souma\'s third season. How? How did such a small and less known (in comparison) title beat out Shokugeki? Read on and find out.Story: 6/10Being my first entry to the ""short anime"" sub-genre, I felt quite irritated at first that a show was just...3 minutes per episode and thought it wouldn\'t be able to pull it off. Boy was I wrong. The central theme of Osake wa Fuufu was Alcohol, no prizes for guessing, but it wasn\'t just alcohol, no no, if that was true it would never have beaten Shokugeki (I\'m bringing it up constantly since it\'s also a show having to do with a consumable, food compared to Osake which is also focused on a consumable, alcohol). What made it superior was the relationship between the characters, their interactions, the brilliant way the anime showed how alcohol takes it\'s place in different times of the day and at different situations. There was no central plot, but there was alcohol, and there certainly was a lot of cute moments WHICH by the way, were totally still related to alcohol. The most amazing thing with the anime was that Alcohol became the story, the plot. Coupled with the fact that it marvelously mixed alcohol with every other aspect of the anime, I give it a standing ovation. If only it had been longer, if it were a full length anime I\'d happily award it a 9, no joke.Word of the paragraph: AlcoholArt: 5/10The art was a wonder to watch. Since it was based on booze, the booze HAD to look good, and it looked damn mouthwatering. One of the wierdest points I felt in a good way about the anime was that the art, especially the alcohol looked oddly satisfying. Character designs were different from the generic style in the way that the colors were way more rich (like a good glass of bourbon) and what was the cherry on top of the wine was how cute they looked. Chi-chan could easily be my favorite character design in the WHOLE of 2017. Not exaggerating. More praise coming in the character part. To end the art section here, it was as mentioned before: Oddly Satisfying. \'Nuff said.Word of the paragraph: BoozeSound: 5/10From the cute and perfect Seiyuus to the addicting ending song to the sound the liquor made when it was poured into the glass, the sound section was amazing and easily one of the best parts of the anime. Chi-chan was adorable (wait for the character section for more), Sora too sounded like the perfect husbando and the other supporting cast also sounded very much like real adults just going out for a drink.Word of the paragraph: LiquorCharacter: 6/10Easily my favorite part of the show, the characters were beautiful, both by looks and personality. Chi-chan was so perfectly and so realistically done I can name her my Waifu of 2017 in just a heartbeat, NO OTHER CHARACTER came EVEN CLOSE to her quality. Why? Relatability, the ""moe"" effect, heck, even spirits helped her boost her appeal in my eyes to that of ""Waifu of the year"" (though I\'d prefer calling it ""Best female character of the year""). You might think the male\'s side won\'t have the spotlight, well you\'re wrong, Sora ALSO takes the top cake as ""Husbando of the year"" (once again, I prefer it to be called ""Best make character of the year""), why? He\'s perfect! He\'s charming, he can cook, but most importantly, HE CAN MAKE THE BEST ETHANOL. Not just that, a later episode also shows the backstory of how they met, why an I mentioning this? To prove that this anime isn\'t all ethanol everywhere (although admittedly you won\'t be wrong if you guessed alcohol snuck everywhere too).After almost a paragraph of praise you look at that score and look at me confused. Why 6? Why so much praise then? Well, some of you might have noticed that I haven\'t talked about the supporting cast at all. Sadly this was the problem this anime faced. Being a short anime, it couldn\'t focus on the supporting cast at all... They were shown at some points but looking for the impact they made is like looking for a needle in a haystack... The supporting cast was barely shown and you might bring up the excuse saying ""but Osake focuses only on Chi-chan and Sora"" to which I say then why bring up the supporting cast AT ALL then? If you show them once, make them appear frequently if you can\'t develop them. That at least would be enough to make me give this a perfect score... But to end in a good note, Chi-chan and Sora alone handled it all by themself, if the supporting cast disappointed me, the main cast FAR exceeded my expectations. Both of them won my Character of the Year. That\'s enough to make me happy.Word of the paragraph: EthanolEnjoyment: 7/10An anime about intoxicating drinks got a 7/10 from a non-alcoholic drinker? Impossible? Well, what can I say. I loved every bit of this anime. The characters were my favorite part of Osake wa Fuufu. Chi-chan and Sora gave me diabetes from sugary moments. To say that Osake Fuufu had a lot of sweet moments is a gross understatement. It was like I said, DIABETES worth of sweetness. Couple goals, sweet, relatable, making-you-jealous-of-being-lonely, an anime that restores your faith in humanity. All this is what I and many other watchers felt from watching Osake Fuufu. And this was just on the surface of the cake, if I went beyond I wouldn\'t be able to end this review and would likely hit the supposed character limit for a MAL review.Word of the paragraph: IntoxicantOverall: 8.2 (Averaged)Overall Osake Fuufu is an anime that surpasses most full length anime, even though it had a measly 3 minutes on hand. It didn\'t waste those 3 minutes on pointless filler, beach episodes, hanabi festivals. It used up it\'s weapons very wisely and didn\'t waste them away. It was centered on Sake. But what was arguably better was how well the main characters were presented; Sora and Chi-chan. I\'ve seen some good female characters over the years, and very less even moderately decent male characters. I felt this year was vastly inferior to the past years (my mean score chart took a huge dip from the previous years and 2017 is my lowest rated year in THIRTEEN YEARS, since 2004. I didn\'t expect much from Osake. But what Osake did was shatter ALL of this, it gave me 2017\'s best female character, it gave me 2017\'s best male character, and though it couldn\'t do much to keep this year\'s mean up, it certainly gave me something to feel positive about 2017. It made me end my anime year on a good note. Arigatou Osake wa fuufu ni natte Kara for making me feel positive about the year. As for you readers, if you like me were dejected at this year and your mean score too took a huge dip, try Osake wa fuufu. It\'ll leave you with a smile. That\'s a promise.Phrase of the season: Shifukuuuuuuuun!P.S: Seriously guys, Chi-chan is best girl of 2017, no arguments. As well as Sora being husbando of 2017, if not the decade. But to be honest, Sora felt more and more like best Waifu material somewhere along the way too XD So anyway everyone, here\'s to a somewhat okay-ish 2017 and here\'s to a hopefully awesome 2018 especially the Spring season. On that note, this is my first review of this year, the first of many. Happy New Year everyone! Drink lots of Osake! 3 minutes per episode and thought it wouldn\'t be able to pull it off.

Drink lots of Osake!', 'It\'s an anime about love, alcohol, and a relationship that every weeb wishes they could get. That\'s about it.Story: 7Woman experiences life\'s daily struggles. Guy makes an alcoholic drink. Woman drinks said alcohol. Then comes... Love? Bliss? Glee? I\'m sure it\'s one of those. While every episode typically follows this formula, because of the short length and small variables within each episode, you won\'t feel like it gets old. Other than that, there isn\'t a story. Normally, that would get points taken off, but this is one of the few anime that doesn\'t require an overarching plot.However, they did give two episodes dedicated to...the backstory of our main characters. In all honesty, they could have done much less.Art: 7It\'s clear that there was a budget here, even if it was small. There isn\'t much ""animation"" to speak of, but the artwork itself is vibrant and keeps your attention. You can see that there were a few cut corners, but you\'d have to look for them to actually notice. Overall, there is at least some effort put into the art.Sound: 6I don\'t think that an anime about a woman getting drunk actually needs a soundtrack. Clearly, the creators knew this as other than a few sound effects, there isn\'t any distinct music. Luckily, the voice acting is good, and the ending theme is, while odd for this series, is relatively catchy.Character: 7There are only 2 characters worth mentioning, Chisato (otherwise known as Chi-chan), the wife, and Sora, the husband.Chi-chan is a alcohol loving, and caring wife. However, they didn\'t just leave it at that. It is clearly defined that she is self-conscious about her drinking habits. Frankly, it\'s not much, but it\'s all she needed.Sora is the caring husband. While he loves making all kinds of food and exotic drinks, he loves his wife even more. Even if he is pre-occupied with something else, he always finds time to treat his wife with his drinks.You could compare the characters here to almost any other anime and see that there isn\'t too much development here, but it gets the job done.Enjoyment: 7You see a woman become drunk and then proceed to become adorable. Do we have to ask for more?Overall: 7While I don\'t think anybody on this site falls under the demographic this anime was aiming for, even I found some enjoyment out of it. While I don\'t think I would\'ve watched it normally, because of the lack of other things to watch this fall, I resorted to this. Honestly, I don\'t regret it.

When denied this due to the current Queen falling victim to old age, all manner of normal things: animals, plants, fossils, inanimate objects - are mutated into monsters of rather original design. The Princess Aurora is sent to the Great Planet to bring an end to this, and three brave cyborg warriors go with her, Kugo Jogo and Hakka. Thus begins our epic adventure to save not only the...Earth, but the Galaxy.Starzinger was renamed Spaceketeers for the United States\' market, and this is the version that was overdubbed for the Yugoslav market and what I watched as a kid. Not much survived in my memory so I decided to watch the series. This review covers the original show (I have not seen Spaceketeers). It is one uneven show, with both strengths and weaknesses. But it certainly doesn\'t deserve to be wiped from existence, so I am perplexed by how it became as obscure as it is, considering it is a Leiji Matsumoto show.Sure the weaknesses are easy to spot while the strengths only become apparent after a number of episodes, so if you know yourself to be impatient with anime and maybe value the smoothness of the animation over the work put into writing the characters and weaving the plot, this anime is probably not for you. The science is non-existent, scientific terms are thrown around and made to mean whatever, and generally any verisimilitude towards the natural world is missing. These are naive kids stories, imagine it as a story being told to a five-year-old. A definitive strength of the animation are the abstract landscapes of space, with vivid colours and strong strokes they give you impossible worlds. Otherwise the animation relies on repetition a lot, and styles of realism and caricatures will often clash. Characterisation can be very flat for most, only Kugo Aurora and select villains will be fleshed out, the rest will remain extremely simple.However there are also strengths to Starzinger: the music and the drama. The funky tunes add a lot to a show built around action, however they too are used somewhat repetitively, to what you might or might not object. Finally, what I feel is the sole reason this anime might be worth watching is the character drama. Kugo is a hot-blooded warrior while Aurora is an idealist devoted to peace and universal well-being, and this conflict between our two main characters is what drives the plot for the first leg of it and remains to a lesser degree throughout. Always the difficult questions arise over what is the right thing to do, and these questions are underlined by personal experiences and grand tragedies. To build a kids show around moral dilemmas and tragic confrontations, how foreign! It is also worth noting that Starzinger bases itself on the Journey to the West, not unlike Dragon Ball or a number of other anime. And yes, on the topic of relationship dynamics, it is a reverse harem, with all three of our cyborg warriors pining for the Princess Aurora - I am told this is somewhat rare.But I must tell you of Belamis. Rose of Versailles was a huge manga, and then it got its cult anime in 1979, after the conclusion of Starzinger. Belamis is a powerful rogue cyborg we encounter in episode 36. Kugo butts heads with them and they are rivals until episode 64. For episodes people are shocked to learn that this dangerous character driven by a passion for justice and a desire to prove ones mettle - is a woman. Big enemies to lovers and the obvious gender-nonconforming tag.Also on the ending. In episode 64, our heroes have seemingly achieved what they had set out to do, but the abrupt news of new monsters is clumsily inserted at the end. Until episode 73 it is really Starzinger II, where things change a bit. Aurora and Kugo get upgrades, the Princess can now use Galaxy Energy and actually fight in battles, and Kugo gets some special circuitry that allows him a giant transformation, so at this point its an animated tokusatsu show. I found the actual ending satisfactory as the unspoken relations between the characters are finally stated and in a way resolved. For this final chapter of the story we get a clever bit of writing as the enemies scale in power as they exhibit more human traits - fighting alone cannot fix these problems, human interaction is necessary.All in all, this is a show one watches for the character drama as the ideals of pacifism and the greater good are confronted with both a world that mutates everything into vicious monsters and the emotions that define our characters.

I was caught up with the story and not once got confused. There are multiple things that made this anime good, for one, the explosion/collision sound effects. I don't know how to really say it, but it has a different feel than any other anime's sound effect. The comedy/ecchi moments blended pretty well with the action/fighting moments which is good for those who don't want to see fighting for 45 minutes straight. Mostly everything about this anime was very good in my opinion with very few minor things...that could be improved such as some parts in the plot although if you're watching this as an ecchi anime then I guess you wouldn't really care whether the plot is perfect or not. that could be improved such as some parts in the plot although if you're watching this as an ecchi anime then I guess you wouldn't really care whether the plot is perfect or not."", ""This is Strike the Blood, and we know how STB works before.

The anime series gave off a To aru Majutsu no Index vibe under differing circumstances, you know like how Taboo Tattoo tried to do it and failed at it. Ramblings aside, did Strike the Blood II succeed from it\'s first season?...or did it go in the ways of Taboo Tattoo?...Strike the Blood II follows the same arc system as the first season, this time consisting of 8 episodes spanning 3 arcs covering Swords-Shaman of Shadow (3 episodes), The 4th Progenitor on the run (2 episodes)...and the Knight of Sinful God arc (3 episodes).Swords-Shaman of Shadow arc consisted of a new harem member that Kojou meets during a beach episode by the name of Yume Eguchi voiced by Nao Touyama whom Kojou tries to protect and the titular Swords-Shaman of Shadow Kiriha Kisaki voiced by Yukiyo Fujii comes in as a opposite to Yukina Himeragi and comes to obtain Yume. Yume as a character isn\'t that bad a character though she meets another of the harem\'s lolicon status but after her arc she becomes like your typical clingy harem member which was a shame as they kinda wasted Nao Touyama here. On the other hand Kiriha is quite the interesting character being within the rival organization to Yukina and thus an enemy to Kojou and Yukina\'s goal to save Yume. The fanservice in this arc gets focused on Sayaka Kirisaka which was a bonus for LA and considering this arc starts at the beach...yeaaaaahhhhhhh...their servicing the fans for this OVA series. Overall Swords-Shaman of Shadow arc was the introduction of some interesting characters and saving the world (typical stuff from Strike the Blood) but had some faults with some of its new characters and arc plot points.The 4th Progenitor on the run is nothing but building up the climax to the next arc, nonetheless it still has some pretty good moments. For one, Kojou\'s dad appears and like father like son, LA can definitely tell where Kojou got his perverted right timing scthick comes from, second is that Nagisa Akatsuki, Kojou\'s little sister gets focus in this arc being something of catalyst as to the events in the next arc. The BEST thing about this arc is Kojou vs. Natsuki of all things and ohh boy it\'s a glorious fight and LA loved it.Knight of the Sinful God arc is the climax of this OVA series and betrayal is a foot and at first confused LA as to why the Akatsuki family wants to release Avrora Florestina the last Progenitor through Nagisa which backfires spectacularly. New allies and villains comes into play, but allies comes in form of Grenda voiced by Misaki Watada (who the true villains of this arc are after), Yuiri Haba voiced by Sayaka Senbongi and Shio Hikawa voiced by Kaede Hondo who are both Sword Shamans with Yuiri getting bit more screentime due to Grenda. The most interesting character would go to Shirona Kuraki a shaman who works for the Lion King Organization and LA thinking she was a villain at the start. Knight of the Sinful God arc is a good climax all things considered as even the villains have their beliefs of wanting their world to return to ""normal"" before all the demons came into play however their actions don\'t suit such a noble gesture making this arc\'s world building and character beliefs all the more better albeit with a small white and black morality to it.The animation was pretty great from Silver Link and CONNECT, from the same character designs from the first season with some ""exotic"" character designs for the newer characters. LA overall for the new characters, LA really like Kiriha\'s design and character overall and being the Nega-Yukina in a ways. The battle scenes were pretty decent too what the Persona-esque monsters and beam spams along with some military grade battles mixed in with the supernatural, the battle animation was overall decent and enjoyed most of the battles especially the Natsuki vs. Kojou battle.Since this is an OVA series...YES, if your wondering the nudity is there in full force with no censors whatsoever and LA didn\'t mind it AT ALL. Yes sometimes the nudity was forced at times, but in others they felt slightly justified (eg. beach episode, clothing tearing or damaged in battle or just some of the harem in *ahem* fanservicey outfits etc.)The voice acting was on par with the first season and LA overall enjoyed it. LA will keep this section short, but there were TWO great as well as surprising voice actors from this and that was Yukiyo Fujii as Kiriha as the great voice actor for this anime as she plays a cold-hearted yet with a heart of gold character and just overall Yukiyo\'s mysterious and teasing dark haired girl vocals about her was an obvious playing against the type role for her. The other voice actor? Satomi Sato as Shirona Kuraki why?...because LA hasn\'t seen Satomi take on such vocals since her role as Nana from Golden Time, only this time she\'s a powerful shaman and she ACTS like one too...just DAMN was LA surprised it was her.Strike the Blood II is a good continuation of the first season by adding in arcs that affects the majority of the main characters, new and old as well as previous plot points from the first season being brought up and put into focus in this second season. Strike the Blood II fulfills what any fan of this series wants what with it\'s ""To aru Majutsu no Index""-like plot progression, awesome supernatural fights to save the world, world building, new harem members and *cough* uncensored fanservice *cough* and sure coincidences happen all these arcs and it does happen at times to move the plot forward but nonetheless LA still enjoyed this second season all things considered.

They handle lewd scenes very well too and even creating comedy that made me laugh more then a few times within those scenes and that is always a bonus.One issue that carries...over to this season is the lack of Main character growth since he is still not really improving in combat at all and usually standing still watching the entire time while someone else is risking their life which just doesn't feel right for the strongest vampire in the world.I also wish they created some more unique ost for this season instead of reusing the same sounds and songs but it isn't a major turn off since the overall atmosphere is still good its just important to bring attention to reused assets.Overall this was extremely enjoyable and they manage this large cast very well throughout this season. over to this season is the lack of Main character growth since he is still not really improving in combat at all and usually standing still watching the entire time while someone else is risking their life which just doesn't feel right for the strongest vampire in the world.I also wish they created some more unique ost for this season instead of reusing the same sounds and songs but it isn't a major turn off since the overall atmosphere is still good its just important to bring attention to reused assets.Overall this was extremely enjoyable and they manage this large cast very well throughout this season.""]"
Sirius,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37569/Sirius,"[""Although vampires have always been quite popular in the western culture they have never been mainstream in the anime medium. There are only a few titles which have the 'let's kill the vampires' premise, like Owari no Seraph and Hellsing, and they all have their own folklore and way to depict vampires. Now, does Sirius bring anything new to the table? Let’s find out.This review contains some spoilers.STORYSet in 1930, Sirius the Jaeger follows the story of Yuliy and the “Jaegers”, a vampire-hunter group which is chasing the Ark of Sirius, the plot device that gathers both sides of the conflict. As the Jaegers start...their race to find the mysterious item, they find out they’re not the only ones interested in the Ark, since vampires are also chasing it. Although the premise sounds really cool on paper, its execution was rather poor not only because of the extremely linear plot and uninteresting characters, but also because of the weak way everything was presented: the dreadful main character, the unexplored setting, the forgettable villains, just to name a few things.First of all, the author forgot a crucial thing about making a vampire story: that the audience actually cares about the vampires. In Sirius, they’re just boring creatures with not much detail and there’s just nothing that differentiates them from other shows that have vampires in them. The only things about the vampires that should have been explained in order to enrich the world building are unexplained so that the audience can figure them out. And even if they are given an objective –like being immortal- the vampires are presented in a very shallow way, so you won’t care when they are killed. If you want the audience to care about the enemies of your story don't just present them as one-dimensional monsters whose only trait is to kill humans.However, the main problem with Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is that it doesn’t really do anything with its setting or characters. You have a cool group of guys that kill vampires and carry their weapons in musical instrument boxes and you don’t do anything with it? It could have worked perfectly as a rule-of-cool type of show or even as a drama, but somehow they managed to make it a typical action show with nothing new. At least the battles are great, right? Unfortunately, no. Despite being well animated, there are no tactics or strategies involved in any of the fights, it’s just a typical combat with no real way to know what each character will come up with or if they’re going to use an inventive way to take down their enemies. The only thing you know for sure is that Yuliy is somehow going to win.-MAJOR SPOILERS-Another thing I should mention is that the last episode seems completely disconnected from the rest, pulling things that were not foreshadowed or mentioned before –like the role of a Sirius saving the world and to let humanity live in peace with other races or the other sirius box that literally comes out of nowhere-. So I guess the sales are going well and P.A Works thought it would be a good idea to end the show hinting a second season.-END OF SPOILERS-Not everything is wrong with this anime, though, and it’s actually satisfying that it doesn’t try to be melodramatic or sad except for a few scenes and it always keeps its serious -no pun intended- tone, without adding unnecessary comedy. Plus, its pacing is actually bearable for the first part, since most of the chapters have a decent amount of action to keep things interesting and the plot doesn't seem as rushed as the second part, but that’s just it.CHARACTERSThe main character is that one we’ve seen dozens of times ever since Attack on Titan came out: I want to kill all the titans-, I mean vampires! Yeah, he is also the only one the conveniently survives the massacre of his village and conveniently gets chased by only 1 werewolf and conveniently awakens his true powers, wow! How original was that? Even if he's given some development, it feels so rushed and disconnected from his original character that it makes it laughable. He changes at the very end of the story with nothing happening in between that would make him start thinking in another way.All the secondary characters are just blank pieces of paper and serve no purpose in the story since they never have a big impact in the grand scheme of things and most of them are not even fleshed out. In a 12-episode series, you would generally expect to have at least 2 or 3 important characters on the spotlight for a couple of minutes but here no one is allowed to kill the enemies except for the main character. If the author at least bothered giving each of the Jaegers a backstory or some sort of development this wouldn't be so significant. The thing is, we don't know anything at all about them! The only member of the group which is given some screentime is Phillip and even that doesn't really tell us anything about him. The others -Dorothea and Fallon- are completely useless and are not given any sort of development.Then there’s another particular character which for practical purposes I’ll be calling the ‘stalker girl’. She is basically the generic love interest that is constantly trying to get some attention from the main guy. The stalker girl also constantly follows the main character wherever he goes (imagine if it was the other way around) and for some reason she is at least given some focus throughout the story. The funny part is… She was completely useless! She didn’t have any purpose to be in the show and things would have been exactly the same if she wasn’t there.Now about the villains… they’re just as bad as the rest of the cast. When the first episode came out and a dozen villains were introduced it was quite obvious that they would be the generic one-dimensional villains that the good guys defeat in a single episode and you wouldn’t remember their names afterwards. Also, as I mentioned before, there are a lot of things that were not explained about them. What’s the origin of vampires and why is the rest of humanity not aware of their presence if they’ve been around for so long? Not answered. What’s up with the vampires’ decease? How does it only affect some vampires and why did they think that the Ark of Sirius would save them? Not answered either.Siriusly, considering you have a boring and cliched main character, an underdeveloped cast and forgettable villains how can you root for any side or character in this show?ART AND SOUNDVisually speaking, it is decent enough. The art style reminds me of other Bones shows, and especially resembles a lot to Bungo Stray Dogs (they even share the main character's voice actor). Most of the fights are, although bland, really well choreographed, the animation is fluid most of the times and the backgrounds are nothing special.The art director worked on many great titles like Gundam: The Origin and Cowboy Bebop and the one behind the sound direction was the legendary Jin Aketagawa, so you can expect quite a lot from the production values. The music in particular was actually really fitting, and the guy who composed it also produced Fate/Apocrypha and Iron-Blooded Orphans soundtrack, which are enjoyable at least. The voices are done by all well-known actors which play the same roles as they usually do (like Takehito Koyasu and Kenjirou Tsuda playing the villains) but nobody really stands out.CONCLUSIONAll in all, Sirius is a forgettable, shallow and generic show. It doesn’t do anything with its setting or characters and apart from the soundtrack or animation, there’s really nothing fresh or new that would make it stand out from any other vampire show. If you are looking for good vampire action go watch Hellsing Ultimate or Vampire Hunter D. The first one is more of a rule-of-cool with silly comedy while the second one holds a more dramatic tone. In any case, both shows deliver a more compelling story and at the same time have a much more interesting cast. their race to find the mysterious item, they find out they’re not the only ones interested in the Ark, since vampires are also chasing it.

Unfortunately, I can’t remember any series of similar nature that intrigued me from these past few years. Many of them run with recycled concepts that includes Beauty and the Beast romance tales or the same survival themes over and over again. Then came along this show called Sirius the Jaeger.It’s quite unusual for P.A. Works to jump into a show with a vampire genre. They’re mostly known for their slice of life shows and coming of age stories. Sometimes, they can pull out a surprise...or two like Spring 2016’s Kuromukuro. However, this isn’t mecha so you’re not going to encounter giant robots. Instead, Sirius the Jaegar deals with a time of crisis when vampires are on the loose in the city. In the year of 1930, we are introduced to a group known as the Jaegers who act as specialized hunters with a goal to exterminate vampires. The plot focuses on a young man named Yuliy with a vengeance to kill vampires after his hometown was terrorized by them.Sirius the Jaeger marks its spot very early in the show with its beautiful setting of the 1930s. The dark domain of Tokyo looks and feels like it’s a time era for revolution. In fact, the first minutes of the episode had my eyes glued just at the background setting. P.A. Works are well known for their well-polished cinematography and production quality. In this series, they didn’t disappoint with that in any way. The eerie alleyways, artistic architectures, and the old fashioned vehicles are just a few innovations to admire. Still, I think what people mostly are interested in here is the story. Vampire storytelling tends to be very niche these days that often involve in soap-opera like modern stories. For this show, it takes on a darker tale of revenge and self-discovery.In wasting no time, we discover quickly that vampires are ravenous monsters with little care about mortality. In essence, they are beings with a desire to eat and kill humans for their own desire. Some vampires in the show are more sophisticated than others but most if not all possesses a insatiable appetite. They attack a party in the first episode while Yuliy and his gang of Jaegers hunts them down. It established them as a mercenary-like group who work like professional hunters. Yuliy tracks down a vampire named Agatha and the expression on his face says it all. It immediately gave me the impression that his hate of vampire runs much deeper than just what they are. Through flashbacks, we also learn about his past and how he became the person he is today. It’s a tragic story that changes a person forever and he still seeks vengeance for his loss. Meanwhile, the vampires themselves have their own goal in the story and that’s to find a mysterious object known as the Ark of Sirius.At the heart of the show is still Yuliy. No matter how you look at it or accept him for who he is, it’s very plot driven about his character. Yuliy is bent on revenge although he also cares about his comrades and certain people in the show that he encounters. This includes a girl named Ryouko who gets involved in his affairs. While not being an official member of the Jaegers, she does learn much more about the nature of vampires and occasionally provides assistance. The series also made it obvious that she develops affections towards him although their relationship doesn’t really become a loving couple. This falls under a bit of the character cliché that I’ve seen over and over again in vampire theme shows. However, there are several other characters in the show that are worth looking into. First, there’s Williard, a man who acts as commander of the Jaegers. He genuinely cares about his comrades and the show makes it clear how far he is willing to go to make the world into a better place. Dorotha is introduced as the main female of the group. With her expertise using firearms, she provides invaluable assistance on their missions. Similar to Yuliy, we also meet Philip, who shares a hate for vampires. Fallon offers more of the muscle for the group as the Jaegars needs a balanced team to get their business done. As impressive as this cast is, don’t expect too much characterization on them. Yuliy is the one that gets the most spotlight and his character relationship with others is quite important.One of the most prominent character relationship in the series is between Yuliy and a man named Mikhail. Rather, they are actually brothers but now stands on the opposite side of each other. While Yuliy plays the role of an action hero, Mikhail follows a darker path that resulted in him becoming a vampire. As such, he is now the very embodiment of what Yuliy despises in the world. Their complicated relationship is told through meaningful dialogues, flashbacks, and how much each have changed. It sort of gave me the impression of a show called Owari no Seraph so for those who are familiar with that, this anime may be a treat for you. On the other hand, the vampire side of this series is mostly clouded in mystery. We meet characters like Yevgraf and Kershner with mysterious motives. Others like the vampire girls in the series are mostly added to bring in more action. There’s even a mad scientist named Klarwein who allied himself with vampires for his experiments. I’m also quite disappointed that one of the vampires advertised for this show  got killed off way too quickly. In retrospect, I think there’s a big gap between the antagonists of and heroes of this series in terms of presentation. And unfortunately, the vampires took the pitfall.Original series made by P.A. Works can be a bit of a hit or miss. But as I mentioned before, it’s hard not to take eyes off of the exceptional visual quality of this series. From the very first episode to the end, everything looked fluid and in style of the 1930s. Vampires are designed with a menacing look and their action speaks for themselves. Expect graphic violence to happen often in the show including blood being spilled by being bitten brutally or limps being torn off. It sells its fan service to make the vampire society look as dangerous as they can be. The Jaegars themselves also have distinctive looks especially for Yuliy’s trademark blue eyes and hair style. Others such as Mikhail and Yevgraf are dressed in a more gentleman-like manner as a deception of their true nature. I should also mention that characters in the series all speak in their native tone regardless of their origins. Most of them deliver their personalities to the bone. Similarly, the theme songs in the show adds a feeling of dark melodrama with and unsettling mood.I think in the end, Sirius the Jaegar is a show that took on the vampire theme and made it into an action thriller with a feeling of suspense. P.A. Works remains one of my favorite studios for not just their production quality but also being able to continuously reinvent itself. For this particular show, it managed to do that by taking on a darker side of storytelling. To me, that’s a thing of beauty. or two like Spring 2016’s Kuromukuro. However, this isn’t mecha so you’re not going to encounter giant robots. Instead, Sirius the Jaegar deals with a time of crisis when vampires are on the loose in the city. In the year of 1930, we are introduced to a group known as the Jaegers who act as specialized hunters with a goal to exterminate vampires. The plot focuses on a young man named Yuliy with a vengeance to kill vampires after his hometown was terrorized by them.Sirius the Jaeger marks its spot very early in the show with its beautiful setting of the 1930s. The dark domain of Tokyo looks and feels like it’s a time era for revolution. In fact, the first minutes of the episode had my eyes glued just at the background setting. P.A. Works are well known for their well-polished cinematography and production quality. In this series, they didn’t disappoint with that in any way. The eerie alleyways, artistic architectures, and the old fashioned vehicles are just a few innovations to admire. Still, I think what people mostly are interested in here is the story. Vampire storytelling tends to be very niche these days that often involve in soap-opera like modern stories. For this show, it takes on a darker tale of revenge and self-discovery.In wasting no time, we discover quickly that vampires are ravenous monsters with little care about mortality. In essence, they are beings with a desire to eat and kill humans for their own desire. Some vampires in the show are more sophisticated than others but most if not all possesses a insatiable appetite. They attack a party in the first episode while Yuliy and his gang of Jaegers hunts them down. It established them as a mercenary-like group who work like professional hunters. Yuliy tracks down a vampire named Agatha and the expression on his face says it all. It immediately gave me the impression that his hate of vampire runs much deeper than just what they are. Through flashbacks, we also learn about his past and how he became the person he is today. It’s a tragic story that changes a person forever and he still seeks vengeance for his loss. Meanwhile, the vampires themselves have their own goal in the story and that’s to find a mysterious object known as the Ark of Sirius.At the heart of the show is still Yuliy. No matter how you look at it or accept him for who he is, it’s very plot driven about his character. Yuliy is bent on revenge although he also cares about his comrades and certain people in the show that he encounters. This includes a girl named Ryouko who gets involved in his affairs. While not being an official member of the Jaegers, she does learn much more about the nature of vampires and occasionally provides assistance. The series also made it obvious that she develops affections towards him although their relationship doesn’t really become a loving couple. This falls under a bit of the character cliché that I’ve seen over and over again in vampire theme shows. However, there are several other characters in the show that are worth looking into. First, there’s Williard, a man who acts as commander of the Jaegers. He genuinely cares about his comrades and the show makes it clear how far he is willing to go to make the world into a better place. Dorotha is introduced as the main female of the group. With her expertise using firearms, she provides invaluable assistance on their missions. Similar to Yuliy, we also meet Philip, who shares a hate for vampires. Fallon offers more of the muscle for the group as the Jaegars needs a balanced team to get their business done. As impressive as this cast is, don’t expect too much characterization on them. Yuliy is the one that gets the most spotlight and his character relationship with others is quite important.One of the most prominent character relationship in the series is between Yuliy and a man named Mikhail.

My expectations were similar: 5/10 experience offering momentary satisfaction and some sucking. Turns out it has a story to tell, presents it with some humor and it's something bit different from the usual.Story:Even after 3 gigazillion different anime series about the same subject, the vampires still haven't learnt no matter who kicks their asses and how. This time our blood-sucking vampires are on rampage and give no shit about anything or anyone, baka. Lucky for us, intergalactic jazz band lands to Tokyo with their airship, and starts...kicking vampire butts in a way that goes beyond your wildest imaginations! Unless you have already seen the movie 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' in which case you will be entertained in the animated manner.The story is pretty bro. Our main characters are part of this vampire hunting organization which is almost like a mafia where everyone is part of the family. They go from place to another and save the day because they are real heroes and real men (/women). All of this is pretty based, of course, but its cliches are mainly presented in comedic manner, making sure viewers realize that the author is well aware that these are general tropes under these settings.Characters:Little boys descending ropes while one handedly using a minigun. Rambo and Arnold make way, new GAR Jesus is in town and he weights like 60lbs. Another dude is probably Donatello's cousin or otherwise has mastered his art. There is also a dude who wears a monocle because he used to slaughter vampires before it was kewl. The real main character who can tell from the smell of a flower how well its roots are doing.The vampires aren't typical villains who go insane and love murder because they do. Rather,  seem to have similar thing going on among themselves as the vampire hunters have. Our characerts are also not heavily protected by plot armors and nakama powers because characters can actually die in this narrative.Production:Interesting choices exist here. The approach is rather similar to Princess Principal which had similar settings within almost the same time period. We get tons of scenery and design from the early 20th century from cars to city lights within the atmospheric towns. The art isn't amazing, but slightly above of the current medium quality. The series is not super detailed either, but some ideas have been executed in quite respectable manner, moon shots, for example. Seiyuu works aims to deliver seriousness and achieves it. The OP is also my personal favorite from this season, easily.Enjoyment:This series is fun as heck. Vampires drop like it's Skrillex with bass. It's almost hard to contrabass how well Jaegar succeeds with its entertainment value. kicking vampire butts in a way that goes beyond your wildest imaginations!

Don't skip over this one.A lot of people are hating on this piece because of the whole vampire/werewolf cliche. To be somewhat candid, if you hate cliches you probably don't actually like anime. Cliches are what defines genres in this scene and it's really not indicative of a series being bad or not (although it can definitely seem that way since so many bad...anime use a terribly large number of cliches).Forget about that for a second and you'll find beautiful artwork, an engaging story line, great soundtracks, vibrant characters, smooth plot progression, well balanced tropes, and just an overall well coordinated anime. Now at the time of this review 4 episodes have come out so I'll definitely end up changing my final score for this anime (will almost probably drop from a 9 to an 8 in the middle and definitely drop again towards the end) and I really wish MAL would block people from reviewing anime until the whole series comes out but in any case here's my 2 cents on this in the hopes that you won't be deterred by the cliches! anime use a terribly large number of cliches).Forget about that for a second and you'll find beautiful artwork, an engaging story line, great soundtracks, vibrant characters, smooth plot progression, well balanced tropes, and just an overall well coordinated anime.

Good vampire anime. Which is a shame because vampire anime can be diverse from the typical Horror anime to a more light hearted comedy anime. Normally, vampire anime land in the former with vampires either being the main villains or just being bad asses as the main character. Thankfully, P.A works has given us a vampire anime following a group of vampire hunters hoping to wipe them all out and stop any plans that they may have. But is the anime just style or does it have substance as well?Sit back, relax and burn all...copies of Twilight and then show the fans what a real f*****g vampire looks like as I present to you the anime review of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger.....wait. When did they decide to change the name? Oh never mind. Lets begin shall we?Story: 4.5/10In this world, vampires have been manipulating humanity for a very long time, influencing events so that they can maintain a food source, like the entire Earth is just one entire farm for them. However, once people starts realising what\'s going on, they will retaliate. Enter the Jagers, group of vampire hunters vowed to hunt down every single vampire. One Jager, Yuliy, has a bigger reason than most since he is the last survivor of his village which was destroyed by vampires. That is until his brother, Mikhail, returns from the dead and says that the vampires are looking for their peoples\' greatest treasure, The Arc of Sirius. So Yuliy and the Jagers must stop their plans and kill all vampires that stand in their way to obtain The Arc of Sirius.Sounds like a pretty good base for a story right? Well, when you start watching it, yes. The show does start out good with some bad ass vampire slaying and an overarching major plot element that is building in the background. But it then starts to slow down and the momentum of this show starts to halt. Now I blame this on the fact that the story just doesn\'t have substance to it. There are side plots in this show that don\'t get developed enough to make them interesting and can make them forgettable. But these side plots could have helped make the story more dynamic and added some context to some of the characters motivations.The focus is always placed on stopping the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius, but it stumbles in that area too. It lacks detail and context behind some elements in the plot that can help make the plot more interesting and dynamic to help give intrigue of what the actions of the heroes and villains could cause to the main plot of the show. I\'ve watched all episodes and I still have no idea what The Arc Of Sirius actually is. Instead, things just simply happen and we then move on to the next part of the story.Characters: 3.5/10The shows biggest weakness is without a doubt its characters. Outside of one character, the cast of characters are just either boring, bland or just one note. Yuliy exemplifies this because he has no unique qualities. He is single minded and filled with revenge against the vampires for destroying his village. He sees his life have no purpose outside of killing vampires and when he hears about The Arc of Sirius, he realises he has a purpose in life but he must do it alone because only he can do this task and must shut out everyone. Talk about being boring and generic. When I saw that Uemura Yutto was voicing Yuliy (who also voiced Hiro from Darling in the Franxx this year, who I also thought was generic and boring), I knew that we were getting a generic character. What Yuliy says and what he does doesn\'t surprise or intrigue me because his motives are nothing new or unique from what I\'ve seen from other main characters so I get an idea what he will say and do next.This also applies to the Yagers as they are just as uninteresting as Yuily. Willard is the level headed leader of the group. Fallon is the happy and strong ""bro"" character. Dorothea is the smart but sexy female character. And Phillip is the back talking, sarcastic t**t character. The fact that I dismissed these characters with one sentence just shows how uninteresting they are. Willard is the only one that has some intrigue due to his backstory but not enough to get me interested. There is even a love interest, Ryouko, that goes nowhere. Like seriously, she has no relevance to the plot whatsoever and normally ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.The only interesting character is Mikhail, Yuliy\'s brother. Since he became a Vampire after their village was destroyed, he essentially becomes a point of conflict with Yuliy\'s desire to kill all vampires. But even though he his essentially the enemy, there are hints that he might be indirectly helping Yuliy stop the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius. He becomes a more intriguing character than Yuliy because you don\'t know where his true loyalties lie until near the end of the series. Does he want to help Yuliy or does he merely manipulate Yuliy to trust him only to betray him later on?Animation: 10/10This show\'s animation is fantastic. Whether it is from the art direction or the fight scenes, everything in Sirius the Yager looks superb. The 1930s setting is greatly captured here with the character and environment designs being very distinct from one another. Now, in terms of the animation in the fight scenes, it is important that the fight scenes are fluid through the animation itself or though its use of clever cinematography to capture each scene. Thankfully, P.A works capture this very well and the fights are just an enjoyment to watch every single time due to the fluidity to it all. It helps distract the viewer of the poor story and characters because it is fun just seeing them slaughter vampires and show them who\'s boss.Sound: 7.5/10The OST is something that also captures the scenes but not enough to make it stand out. But unlike other shows, I know that it is there and is does help set an atmosphere and I appreciate that. Rather the sound effects were more noticeable to make it sound more realistic and add to the scenes. This especially true in the fight scenes where the clashing of weapons helps us feel the impact of each swing and clash.The opening ""Sirius"" by Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets is a very solid opening. Its use of silhouettes in its imagery help set a rather dark and broody atmosphere with the song being catchy enough to make the opening enjoyable to watch and listen to. The ending is again, very solid. It helps emphasise the fact that Yuliy and Mikhail were very close as brothers and had a lot of fun together before being torn apart when the vampires attacked their village. Kind of sad when you think about it.ConclusionThe main problem that I have with this show above everything else is that the overall show is just....boring outside of its animation quality. It\'s difficult to review something that does not do anything good but not anything bad, but instead is just bland. I said earlier that does this show just have style or does it have substance? No. It is all but style and little substance. The high quality animation can only carry this show so far before its story and characters have to help carry this show but it then stumbles when this happens. It doesn\'t develop its plot well enough and its overall characters are just too one note and boring to make me care. I like to prioritise story and characters to look for good anime since animation and sound only enhance the anime. This show is the opposite of this and it is a shame because I wanted to enjoy this show. It looks and sounds good but unfortunately, that is all there is to it.My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Overall score: 6.1/10  Recommendation: Don\'t Bother copies of Twilight and then show the fans what a real f*****g vampire looks like as I present to you the anime review of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger.....wait.

It looks and sounds good but unfortunately, that is all there is to it.My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Overall score: 6.1/10  Recommendation: Don\'t Bother', 'Watching this series reminded me so much of spectacular vampire-supernatural series that have gone by like Hellsing Ultimate or Owari no Seraph. It\'s a good series through and through, and although there are many whom have milked the genres and put their own spin on it (only to fail badly), Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger offers something up its sleeve to the point of being captivating, and yet being so underrated.Story:Similar to series like Princess Principal for the old 20th Century London-esque time period, we have the usual Van Helsing or Constantine type of shows, where said person arrives in some place that is chock-full of...vampires to hunt, then meet up with people (presumably the Japanese government) that liaise to do and deal the same treatment: investigate, plan, seek, kill and destroy the source. That\'s what Yuily and his team of vampire exterminators are here for this purpose.For Yuliy, it\'s a fight that has been overbearing since his childhood days: The village of Dogville, the people residing there may look normal, but with Yuliy being the last of its kind as Sirius, there presents an unescapable fate with what is the triggering catalyst: ""The Arc of Sirius"", a ball-shaped item of powers unimaginable meant to keep both Jaegers and vampires away that could reshape humanity according to the user\'s wish. This is protected by Yuily\'s father, in preparation for the future to come, and for both survivors of the massacre, Mikhail (older brother) and Yuliy (younger brother) must both protect at all costs. Midway, the unexpected betrayal ensues that Mikhail changed sides to help the vampires (with Yevgraf), presumably to keep his life intact from protecting Yuliy from the vampires. With that in mind, Yuliy has a number on his shoulders to not just fend off vampires alone, but to awaken his brother back to his senses.For such a story, it\'s refreshing to have an omage to certain series and the tried-and-true methods past. However, you\'re gonna have to plunder through boring and slow parts (say for the majority of the series), but when it picks up steam, that\'s when the story gets more interesting and engaging with the ever-so-constant build-up towards the end.Characters:The ""Jaeger"" team: Yuliy, Dorothea, Philip, Professor Williard + the side counterparts (Fallon etc.)A merciless band of vampire slayers crafted from their usual expertise, I must say that these characters, as fun as there is to watch their every move, they give the sense that for all their strengths and weaknesses, they balance well together, making up for the subtle differences which testifies their skills to a T. And if you can tell from the usual cliche of a team of men and a woman, where the female is the damsel in distress? Sorry, but that ain\'t the case as Dorothea is a skilled shooter herself, firm and able to be trusted with much.The commoner team: Ryouko, Hideomi (and I know I\'ve missed a few others)For once, I thought that her love obsession with Yuliy was just for show...but for her to follow Yuliy along with his plan is underwhelming to say the least. At most, she\'s just there for story exposition to make Yuliy\'s life a bit more interesting, but other than that, a filler character. At least there are people in the Japanese government would be concernedThe vampire team: Yevgraf, the vampire Twins (vaguely shown), Kershner, Klarwein, Mikhail (through blood pact), the catalyst AgathaYevgraf is the epitmony of evil: the Devil incarnate himself. Awaiting the Arc of Sirius that has been laid dormant for the vampires for an insane amount of time, he does not stop at anything to achieve his ambitions, at the expense of others. The fearsome enemy who uses a blood pact to hold those who has been resurrected as vampires, and then sees them as a tool to help aid in his efforts. Kershner is no different, except that he sees it as being Yevgraf\'s strategist and most capable helpline to him. Same issues and characteristics with Klarwein, the insane experimentalist (equal to Back to the Future\'s Doc Brown). All are committed to seeing Yevgraf\'s vision happen, with the side-effects of being tools just for the moment.An overall (almost) well-rounded character lineup, but the problem of being one-dimensional is truly the weakest connection here.Art and animation:Whenever P.A. Works are down for almost any anime, I\'m a hardcore fan for whatever shows they make for their beautiful artwork and great animation, and Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger doesn\'t disappoint. Since it\'s an action-oriented show, what better way to call forth a director who handles good action, and that name is Masahiro Andou, known for his works on Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell and more.Not to mention that this series is a major departure from their usual SoL or coming-of-age of works past, but what\'s best to know is that everything about it is left intact, and is safe to say that this series stands out because of impressive art and animation. Good game and a job well done.Music:Damn, yet another area where the series nailed it to perfection. The OST is a spectacular pickup just for the series alone. Both the OP and ED helped set the pace for the series to follow, shadowing the events that lie ahead for everyone (especially Yuliy and Mikhail), and is a blast listening to. As with any action series, the SFX really gets loud under load so much so that it causes some distortion and causes a major distraction sometimes. It\'s noticeable, yet it feels just about any other action anime would be at its best caliber.Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is quite the production, but production itself can\'t tell the whole story, and that\'s where the series\' Achilles Heel start to show up: The slow and methodical story along with the characters, emotionless and only care about their field of range (or mission). After being burnt by so many vampire series, I\'d say this is at a level where it\'s neither good nor bad, but the hopes of knowing whatever the heck is going on here is least to say the best. Good try, but one could hope there\'s improvements to be made. Recommendations though? Just purely for action alone. vampires to hunt, then meet up with people (presumably the Japanese government) that liaise to do and deal the same treatment: investigate, plan, seek, kill and destroy the source. That\'s what Yuily and his team of vampire exterminators are here for this purpose.For Yuliy, it\'s a fight that has been overbearing since his childhood days: The village of Dogville, the people residing there may look normal, but with Yuliy being the last of its kind as Sirius, there presents an unescapable fate with what is the triggering catalyst: ""The Arc of Sirius"", a ball-shaped item of powers unimaginable meant to keep both Jaegers and vampires away that could reshape humanity according to the user\'s wish. This is protected by Yuily\'s father, in preparation for the future to come, and for both survivors of the massacre, Mikhail (older brother) and Yuliy (younger brother) must both protect at all costs. Midway, the unexpected betrayal ensues that Mikhail changed sides to help the vampires (with Yevgraf), presumably to keep his life intact from protecting Yuliy from the vampires. With that in mind, Yuliy has a number on his shoulders to not just fend off vampires alone, but to awaken his brother back to his senses.For such a story, it\'s refreshing to have an omage to certain series and the tried-and-true methods past. However, you\'re gonna have to plunder through boring and slow parts (say for the majority of the series), but when it picks up steam, that\'s when the story gets more interesting and engaging with the ever-so-constant build-up towards the end.Characters:The ""Jaeger"" team: Yuliy, Dorothea, Philip, Professor Williard + the side counterparts (Fallon etc.)A merciless band of vampire slayers crafted from their usual expertise, I must say that these characters, as fun as there is to watch their every move, they give the sense that for all their strengths and weaknesses, they balance well together, making up for the subtle differences which testifies their skills to a T. And if you can tell from the usual cliche of a team of men and a woman, where the female is the damsel in distress? Sorry, but that ain\'t the case as Dorothea is a skilled shooter herself, firm and able to be trusted with much.The commoner team: Ryouko, Hideomi (and I know I\'ve missed a few others)For once, I thought that her love obsession with Yuliy was just for show...but for her to follow Yuliy along with his plan is underwhelming to say the least. At most, she\'s just there for story exposition to make Yuliy\'s life a bit more interesting, but other than that, a filler character. At least there are people in the Japanese government would be concernedThe vampire team: Yevgraf, the vampire Twins (vaguely shown), Kershner, Klarwein, Mikhail (through blood pact), the catalyst AgathaYevgraf is the epitmony of evil: the Devil incarnate himself. Awaiting the Arc of Sirius that has been laid dormant for the vampires for an insane amount of time, he does not stop at anything to achieve his ambitions, at the expense of others. The fearsome enemy who uses a blood pact to hold those who has been resurrected as vampires, and then sees them as a tool to help aid in his efforts. Kershner is no different, except that he sees it as being Yevgraf\'s strategist and most capable helpline to him. Same issues and characteristics with Klarwein, the insane experimentalist (equal to Back to the Future\'s Doc Brown). All are committed to seeing Yevgraf\'s vision happen, with the side-effects of being tools just for the moment.An overall (almost) well-rounded character lineup, but the problem of being one-dimensional is truly the weakest connection here.Art and animation:Whenever P.A. Works are down for almost any anime, I\'m a hardcore fan for whatever shows they make for their beautiful artwork and great animation, and Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger doesn\'t disappoint.

Soo many things going on on top but no one realy explaining details here at all what people would be interested ... like the think how mikhail packstory and stuff you get just always the side of the yeagers but not what the vamps are about and their reasons -- really angers me .and also really bad = ui watched the 4th ep yesterday and have...too say come onfinnaly a little action and than the ep is over wtf i mean from a ep with 24 mins i enjoyed the last 7 mins soo not really satisfied since it really could make soo much of this show but it seems the love is missing totally in it.still love the art/ seiyuus and ost + hope also the story gets more thrilling from now on too say come onfinnaly a little action and than the ep is over wtf i mean from a ep with 24 mins i enjoyed the last 7 mins soo not really satisfied since it really could make soo much of this show but it seems the love is missing totally in it.still love the art/ seiyuus and ost + hope also the story gets more thrilling from now on', 'I am confused by the reviews that I’ve been reading. I have never considered to write a review until now. I feel like this show needs to get the defending it deserves.No, the anime isn’t perfect. The show pacing is a little rushed and there were times where the main characters revealed something or made some sort of revelation that got me thinking, “huh already?”. They definitely could have drawn some things out more, but it didn’t take away any of the enjoyment out of the show for me. The anime also doesn’t shy away from blood (lots of vampire sucking action going on)...and it delves into darker themes. If you are a little squeamish and are looking for something lighter hearted, you should probably avoid this one.HoweverThe plot is interesting, the artwork is BEAUTIFUL, the sound (there honestly isn’t much music throughout the series, and I’m that beach who skips the intro and credits so I wouldn’t know if those songs are any good), and the character development seemed well done and typical of most anime. At first, I was worried that the main character was going to be emotionless and robotic throughout the series. However, it is soon revealed why he is the way he is and the reveal is presented in a way that makes the viewer root for him.Throughout the series there are some unexpected plot twists. I found myself never really knowing where the show was going to take me. I binged the first couple of episodes because I wanted to know what the relationship was between the reporter, military, vampires, gangs, and shipping companies had to do with one another. The creators also took the cliched trope of vampire vs. werewolf and put their own creative twist to it.Overall the show has been enjoyable, and I hope anyone who reads this ignores the other reviews and give this anime a shot. and it delves into darker themes.

The first few episodes were clever. It made no shounen anime-like pitfalls, no cringes, and very clever directing, full of unexpected and interesting cuts. I was sure that this would be a strong runner for the best anime of the season.But from this anime, I realize a lot of series could be measured using a two-number metric. The first number is the episode where you cringe for the first time. The second number is the episode where...you feel like everything is falling apart; the art quality is no longer brilliant, the directing is no longer interesting, the plot has succumbed to cliches and boring tropes, the characters no longer have a distinct shine.For me, for this anime, these two numbers were 7 and 10. you feel like everything is falling apart; the art quality is no longer brilliant, the directing is no longer interesting, the plot has succumbed to cliches and boring tropes, the characters no longer have a distinct shine.For me, for this anime, these two numbers were 7 and 10."", ""- Story -Seems like a fairly standard story involving different factions, the main two being the Jaegers and the Vampires. As of episode 4, the pacing feels a little slow for my taste. Most of the story elements are all things that we have seen before in other anime, and they are told in a very familiar way, as well.- Art / Animation -Very solid and consistent so far. The fight scenes are 90% the reason why I'm still watching this.- Sound -Sound is great, especially during fight scenes. No complaints here.- Character -This is where the anime fails for me. In the first...episode, we are introduced to Ryoko, a character that falls in love with the MC (not sure why). Her character feels completely useless to the story and she does not seem to serve any purpose other than the writers wanting to shove an unnecessary love story down our throats. She is given way more screen time than she deserves, screen time that could have been used to develop other interesting characters (i.e. the MC or the Jaegers).To be fair, she is the character that is most removed from any of the conflict in the show, therefore offering us a unique perspective. Unfortunately, her perspective is boring af, she is simply uninteresting and irritating. IMO, some of her actions are irrational and make little sense for a girl her age, and make her character even more insufferable.Because they are giving her a fair amount of screen time, I believe they are planning some type of arc for her trash character. Which is a shame, because I just don't see it paying off, and I would have liked to learn more about the other characters.- Enjoyment -As you can probably tell so far, I really enjoy the fight scenes, they are certainly the highlight of this show for me. However, the slow pacing, partially due to the writers giving a shitty useless character too much screen time, is really making my viewing experience unenjoyable.- Overall -Story feels unoriginal, but not too cliched or tropey.Animation and fight scenes are great, so far.Ryoko is a shit character and I hope she dies.TLDRWould have been a perfectly fine - good anime if it weren't for a POS character. episode, we are introduced to Ryoko, a character that falls in love with the MC (not sure why).

In a way, I feel like that describes the series in a nutshell.The plot is the story of all time: a protagonist driven by revenge and a tagtag bunch of misfit hunters race against several factions to obtain a McGuffin, one of which involves the MC\'s sworn enemy, and which acts as the... antagonist, I guess. Now, formulas work for a reason: you just have to know how to work around them. Tales as old as time will continue to...be retold for generations to come, and thousands, millions will fall into obscurity, while a few will survive, even if not by name, as inspiration for future artists. As a creator, which one would you rather be? How do you wish to achieve that? What separates your tale from the rest? What gives it meaning?Now, it\'s not to say that \'mediocre\' series can\'t stand out in their own way (just look at SAO). There\'s a something that makes them stand out, a concept, an idea, a character, regardless of whether the product as a whole passes the MAL vibe check or not. That\'s fine. Quintessential Quintuplets, for example, might not be high literature, but its character interactions and surprisingly heartfelt story has inspired many with stories of their own, so that even if/once it\'s forgotten, its impact will remain and, again, I wouldn\'t call it the pinnacle of anything. It\'s aight, but it works.What\'s aight and doesn\'t work? This series. Many others (maybe most), but this one was what finally got that sneeze out, except that, instead of catharsis, I got phlegm.The characters, save for one, maybe two, feel like salad dressing diluted with water because the restaurant you got it from can\'t be damned to do anything above serviceable. The protagonist started out fine, honestly, a silent, strong type with an interest in botany, who\'s also kind of weird and out of the loop, and whose actions baffle the rest of the squad until they have the necessary bonding. See? Doesn\'t sound too bad. Alarm bells rang when at the end of the first episode he began screaming about revenge, but, sure, I told myself, sometimes people act very differently under extreme situations.And then... poof. No more plant talk. No more quiet weird OP kid. For the rest of the series it felt more like I watched a puppet show where the puppeteer forgot to disguise himself, and no matter how much I tried to block them out, they were always there, with the face of someone who worked 70 hours this week and not someone proud at their own creation. The protagonist then acted the way millions of others have because that\'s what other stories have done, screamed about revenge when needed, had a breakdown when apt, cried when Emotional Beat happened, and like... sure, in a vacuum, the scenes might have been well-done, but people/characters have PERSONALITIES for a reason. Not everyone reacts the same way. By the end, he was nothing more than a vessel for the story to story, and for me to get depressed.So if that\'s the main character, imagine the rest. EXCEPT! Except for arguably the second most important one. They were the only one whose actions felt as though he were the one in charge, consistent with what was established, and had actual conflict, both inner and outer, which lead to legitimately emotional payoffs the rest of the puppets failed to pantomime. They were my favorite by far, and probably the only thing I\'ll remember about this show once I\'m done with this rant. A minor character seemed to be following the same line, but unfortunately he didn\'t have much screentime, and the puppeteer found his string, so his IQ dropped and he got drunk in order for the story to story. There\'s a third one I was fiercely protective of, moreso because her archetype is usually hated than her being or doing anything (because her archetype never is or does anything). I wouldn\'t call her good, though, just... she was cute. Yeah.The rest are the water dripping off the salad dressing; you take it off and nothing changes. The antagonist was boring, had a glimpse of something more, then turned into an Antagonist because they also found his strings. When will anime stop doing that thing where their villain loses all semblance of self to laugh maniacally, gloat about conquering the world, and start indiscriminately killing allies to show how Evil they are? Stop. It\'s like hitting a candyless piñata. Just cancel the party at that point.The plot is lettuce without condiment, and I already summed it up above. It doesn\'t matter. It exists because Stories have Plots. Themes? Eren Yaeger (story was called Sirius the Jaeger and got renamed LOL). Animation and music were great because P.A. Works. Seriously, what is it with their original shows (save for Angel Beats and Nagi no Asukara) having great production values but mediocre to terrible writing? Out of all things to emulate, why Guilty Crown?So anyway, I wouldn\'t be wasting my time with this review if it weren\'t for the last episode, because it was, in my opinion, legitimately good right until the end. Why couldn\'t the rest of the series have had that, you know, actual humanity? Sure, there was still the antagonist being an Antagonist and the rest of the characters not mattering, but the final encounter and ultimate MC\'s goal almost reflected this story\'s sad excuse of a theme, on top of a resolution that could\'ve been good had the GODDAMN puppeteer not found the strings. Stop it. Stop adding stuff you say elsewhere just because you thought it was ""cool"".That\'s what this story lacks, I think: humanity. There\'s plenty of anime I enjoy and consistently rewatch that doesn\'t pass MAL\'s vibe checks, but which feel like the writer cared. That\'s all I ask for: heart. Hell, even Seikon no Qwaser did the revenge plot better, and that was a fetish show with plot as an excuse. It helps that the characters had actual chemistry (no pun intended If you know you know).What did this show accomplish?

I'd had my eye on this one for a while and finally decided to boot it up on Netflix to play in the background while I worked. I was a bit concerned at first that I might miss parts of the plot, but...yeah...I'll get to that.So Sirius the Jaeger is basically another Vampire vs Werewolves show with a magical macguffin that one side wants to use to have ultimate power, blah, blah. It's far from groundbreaking, but that's part of the fun....The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch and I binged all of the way to episode ten without hesitation.When it's good, this show is on a potential par to shows like FMA (some arcs of it really reminded me of FMA). When it's bad, it's a mess, and for the most part it's a mess.Sirius the Jaeger suffers from SEVERE pacing issues and a lot of that comes down to its 12 episode run time. The story line, world and characters simply don't get the time, love and attention they need, except for Sirius, which again, I'll come to later. In one scene, it's revealed that there's conflict between two of the main characters because of something very bad that happened in the past (trying to avoid spoilers), but it's not really touched on ever again. Early on there's a plotline with a doctor that reminded me of the Tucker arc in FMA, where the doctor character lives with his cute daughter and is doing desperate experiments. It's a really interesting arc and given a good deal of gravitas...but soon afterwards that plotline is quite literally dropped and when we hear about it again it's played up for a weird kind of comic relief by a villain who literally falls down a cliff face after what might as well be a five second fight and is never heard from again. Like...what?? Discount Shou Tucker didn't die for this level of disrespect. Even the final battle falls flat to the point of being funny because there is no build up or tension.The pacing also causes issues with continuity. One character basically leaves home and their family follow them (to ANOTHER country I might add), only for them to come back a couple of episodes later like yup, I was being young and stupid I'll be good now...and it's literally NEVER commented on or addressed. Did the family ever find out? Are they still randomly stuck overseas? Are they still looking for them?We never really find out much about the mysterious order that Sirius and the others belong to. Heck, we don't even find out much about the Ark, which is the core of the plot. I got all of the way to the end of episode 12 without really understanding what it was beyond the fact that the Vampires shouldn't get it because That Would Be Bad.The only character who gets a decent character arc is Sirius, which I don't mind because he is semi decent as an anime protagonist for the first half of the show. By the second half, the storyline about his brother and the Ark and his tribe borders on contrived and at the end I was pretty bored of him because he fell into almost every protag cliche in the book. Run away to deal with things on your own even though it just...DEFIES logic? Check. Keep the valuable object on your person even though you KNOW you're going to end up in a fight soon and it's probably going to get stolen? Check. The final episode has a very, very emotionally charged scene, but it falls completely flat because of the terrible pacing.So in summary, this show isn't awful, but it could have been so much more. It's fun to watch, but that's about it. It's not going to leave you thinking afterwards, but it will leave you wanting more (if that makes sense).End note: are his tribe supposed to be Inuit? Because if so that's HILARIOUS... inuit...inu...they're werewolves...I'll let myself out The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch and I binged all of the way to episode ten without hesitation.When it's good, this show is on a potential par to shows like FMA (some arcs of it really reminded me of FMA).

Because if so that's HILARIOUS... inuit...inu...they're werewolves...I'll let myself out"", 'Sirius the Cringe Beast Review (Minor Spoilers You Won\'t Really Care About)I think the most analogous scene to summarize the whole of this series can be found halfway through the end of its final episode. In that scene our main character says this, ""I know what to do, I\'ve finally found my path"" and he is then immediately punched straight in the face and sent plummeting into the depths of the Atlantic fucking ocean. Visually, this is a pretty great looking show, the lighting effects and fight scenes can be pretty entertaining, but it is also somewhat inconsistent with quite a few instances of comically...janky animation in less action-oriented scenes.The main cast consists of a ragtag group of the most bare bones, stereotypical members of your party in literally every JRPG ever made. There\'s jolly buff guy with beard, special agent d cups, edgy guy with dark past, elderly mentor wearing a monocle and of course, twink, how could we forget about good ol\' twink? The antagonists on the other hand are stock mini bosses and minions ripped straight out of Castlevania led by possibly the most insufferable Shakespearean twat with a top hat in the history of anime.To get a good grasp on the entertainment value of this show, here\'s a description of a portion of its epic final battle. An insufferable twat with a top hat eats a big marble and transforms into a gargoyle with the face of Anthony Hopkins, but also somehow transforms his full suit into a bedazzled black unitard with sparkling elf shoes that somehow grow back even after you cut his legs off. Now that\'s anime. The first 3/4ths of the show were actually decently engaging and entertaining, but man oh man, grab yourself a couple of buddies and brews and you will have a banger of a time watching the bombastic circus fire it devolves into for the final quarter. Sirius the Jaeger is an initially average anime that evolves into such supreme trash as it goes on that I\'d have to classify it as a 4 out of 10, so bad it\'s good. janky animation in less action-oriented scenes.The main cast consists of a ragtag group of the most bare bones, stereotypical members of your party in literally every JRPG ever made.

Works is defined by the company\'s ability to sustain itself with primarily original works with only the odd adaptation here and there with major influence by the company itself.\xa0 And so here we\'re presented with \'Sirius the Jaeger\', P.A.\'s take on vampires and a war against them.Story:In the town of Dogville lies an ancient artifact known as the \'Ark of Sirius\', an object filled with such insurmountable power that all major countries in the world (seemingly) wish to possess it.\xa0 It\'s here where we meet the last Sirius, Yuliy, and the vampire hunting Jaegers who try to uncover and thwart the...plan of the vampires that\'ve set foot in Nihon land in search for the Ark for unknown reasons.Spanning a vampire defeating plot that lasts a cour, Sirius is a show set in 1930\'s Japan that follows many of your typical revenge plot tropes in order to sustain its story.\xa0 Yuliy, being the last surviving member of his people after they were slaughtered by vampires, sets out to \'KILL ALL THE VAMPIRES\' in order to get his vengeance.\xa0 It\'s a show that has a decently paced by the numbers story that doesn\'t try to overstep its boundaries before the conclusion.\xa0 It\'s because of this that I find few positives to note cause nothing about its storyline is even that memorable, yet still manages to be a decent viewing experience despite that.That being said, given how this is a P.A. Works show, the importance of the story lies in its ending, as the company\'s history of floundering to the finish line becomes evident the closer episode twelve reaches.\xa0 Reason being is the show just throws down reasons in front of the audience for things like like why the vampires are searching for the Ark in the first place towards the end like it fixes the innate issue.\xa0 The attempt at sympathy and explaining previously untouched details so close to the end doesn\'t impact things too much, but instead misses the show\'s overall potential as the motivations and overall storytelling could\'ve been drastically improved had it been revealed and built upon earlier, instead of being an ""Oh crap, we forgot to add some things"" moment that muddies the overall ending.Because of this, Sirius the Jaeger ends with the same P.A. Works standard of \'Good idea, bad execution\', as some aspects like the Sirius as a people was one that had potential, but failed due to the show never bothering with giving them the time they needed to be fully fleshed out.\xa0 Its slower climb to the climax ultimately hurts it, which is a darn shame considering the amount of innate potential that could\'ve happened should the series have gotten its feet off the ground a little sooner.Overview:+ Decent pacing+ Good slow buildup-\xa0 Way too fast of a climaxCharacters:Personally, I describe Yuliy as a discount first season Eren Jaeger, as our protagonist\'s main quirk in the series erupts from his desire to avenge his people after vampires slaughtered them all seventeen years ago.\xa0 Thankfully rage isn\'t his only character trait, and we instead get to see a lost puppy looking for answers for a greater majority of the series.\xa0 There honestly isn\'t much to say about Yuliy, as the plot is pretty much the only drive he has to even do anything.\xa0 His motivations come from the events of the story, and any decisions he makes only seem to be a natural progression that results in the show\'s conclusion.And this sadly is a fact that the rest of the cast faces as the show\'s is the only real driving motivation for them.\xa0 Any actual motivation for Yevgraf, the show\'s supposed antagonist, is revealed so late (episode 11) that there\'s almost no reason for the audience to care because of it.\xa0 Sure you get some quirkiness like banter between the Jaegers and the apparent obsession of the vampire mad scientist Klarwein, but most of that is just fluff and doesn\'t add anything to note aside from drawing lines in the sand to note who\'s on what side and add the illusion to flavor in an otherwise straightforward and kind of bland show.Overview:+/- Entire cast is just kinda...thereArt:Now, this being a P.A. Works show, I don\'t actually have a lot of complaints for it because of how consistent the company usually is in its production.\xa0 A few off scenes here and there did happen, but Sirius is otherwise a show that\'s presented in the P.A.

Works is surprisingly good at achieving.\xa0 By comparison,\xa0""Hoshie"" by sajou no hana is a more somber piece that I find isn\'t as memorable as its OP sister, but still has its fair share of memorable points being a song that ties more into the emotional aspects of Yuliy\'s existence as the last Sirius, which exemplifies the point more even if the show doesn\'t do much to aid it.Personal Enjoyment:The mantra I have for P.A. Works as a whole seems to always trail back to ""Good ideas, bad execution"".\xa0 It\'s happened to Charlotte, it\'s happened to Nagiasu, Angel Beats!, hell I\'ll even extend that notion to Kuromukuro despite that project\'s rockiness from the start.\xa0 Because of this, I came into Sirius with very cautious expectations, reminding myself that things still can and will go wrong later down the line, which was an unfortunate truth that came into being, though thankfully the crash wasn\'t nearly from very high up.That being said, I still found Sirius the Jaeger to still be an enjoyable viewing experience.\xa0 While I don\'t trust that the company will ever find its footing, it\'s nice to see the diversity in their works and how they still have the heart and soul to create original projects even though they don\'t always work out like they may have originally intended.\xa0 Many things like the lore of the Sirius and that copout of an antagonistic motivation, as well the mess that was Ryouko\'s sideplot (which wasn\'t even a necessary aspect of the show aside from cheap excuse for some romance) REALLY could\'ve used work, but it\'s still all in all a decent show that makes a good callback to original portrayals of vampires as people preying, grotesque, transformed creatures of the night.My recommendation would be to watch it if you feel inclined, as its good for a piece of non-fanservicy entertainment, but not one that can garner a lot of praise due to numerous flaws and overall lack of anything new to bring to the table.\xa0 Not much more can be said, but I\'m at least glad P.A.

But be warned that there is an element in this show that, at least for me broke my enjoyment to where it became unwatchable.Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger has a lot of promise, but at least for me it was bogged down by the one aspect of anime that can make or break a show; the romance element.Character is the lifeblood of a visual medium as we the audience have no other means to immerse ourselves in the world we are...presented in than through the characters presented.

However, what goodwill I have for the story stops the minute the designated romance character enters stage left.

She feels like less a character and more a device set up solely for the purpose of being with the main character. You just know the story will bend to the will of the writers insistence on her importance and her being with the main character, and that is the saddest part.Now of course, I could be wrong about all of this.

The premise of the anime was great. A group of people who make their mission to find and battle vampires. However, the execution of it was just . . . lightly put, EXTREMELY subpar. Ryouko's character didn't add ANY substance to the plot at all, and in fact, was more so a hindrance. When you add a character, there has to be some development and growth that the character adds to the other characters or to him/herself. But nope, she was just blindly in love with Yuliy (MC) and followed...him blindly and didn't even cause trouble to clean up! Just a minor subplot that again, didn't add to anything. Another thing that bothered me was Mikhail's character. He reminded me of Uchiha Itachi in his relationship to Yuliy/Sasuke. He was good turned evil and wanted his brother to stop chasing vengeance. But due to the episode constraints, the development of this relationship was too fast and ultimately too little of a buildup towards the ending. The only character I liked was Hideomi Iba, the detective guy. He was witty and well-developed, showing background of the military while simultaneously funny. In contrast to the other tropes mentioned, he added background to the story and ultimately was what made me continue watching. All in all, I would not recommend this anime at all, but if you're looking for something that has good art, sound, and a semi-decent plot, here's something for you. him blindly and didn't even cause trouble to clean up!

I wouldn't highly recommend it but if you're just looking for something to watch this is a nice anime to try because it doesn't have to many episodes. Because of this, I give Sirius the Jaeger a 6. "", ""I came into this series with low expectations and came out with an extremely mixed set of feelings.Having binge watched this series over the course of three or so days, I can safely say this is probably the most mediocre anime I have ever seen. That's not to say it's bad, but that is to say it's nothing special or groundbreaking at all either.In short, it's a fairly poorly executed idea for an original anime series with some high hopes from its backers, a respectable studio at the helm, but just an absolutely poor execution of just about everything in this series, from start to...finish.My immediate complaint with this series when I first started it was the amount of information, names, and players being dropped on us that felt like an overload of information, a confusing mess for what was beginning to sound like a series with a large conspiracy in its plot.However, the series immediately removes all of that by at least the sixth episode, where the anime makes things simple and brings us down to our simple dilemma of “Hunters vs Vampires”.The whole issue with this series is this waste of time in its writing to effectively convey this world to me. What year is it? What sort of alternate history is this? What exactly is the politics like? What safe assumptions can I make? And within the span of the series, these questions become fairly clear to you the viewer, but it can come off as overwhelming at first, then again that could be just me.But at the heart of this series is the issues in its writing and pacing. I honestly feel like this could have been something fairly decent, but the pacing of its plot, getting to know its characters and world, and so forth is so marred by a feeling of a rush that shouldn’t even be there.A rush to what? The next action sequence? This series is a yawn in its fights, so if that’s the offering on the table, I must refuse because there is not a single fight where anything felt interesting at all.Going back to writing, I can’t help but feel like this script was rushed out the door just to be animated. The only proof I have is the fact nobody on staff with any form of English capabilities asked “Hey, is Dogville really what we are going to call this one important place?”. Nobody asked that, ever. So either someone never noticed, or someone played a really big joke, because that was a nuisance of a name right there.All in all, I recommend just passing on this series and watching something else. You might be able to get a more enjoyable experience from 2006s “Black Blood Brothers”, which was something this series made me nostalgic for in a lot of respects. There’s no similarities really, just some nostalgia really.Plus, this series absolutely failed in making our protag turn into a werewolf. I was sitting here for many episodes waiting for that to happen, and it never did. It’s so obvious that’s what was going on here, and it didn’t happen.There’s better anime than this out there, and there’s far worse anime than this.

But there were just some foundational things that made it a complete mess.Let\'s start with the good:1. Character Design and Setting--BEAUTIFUL. All the characters are visually bright, diverse, interesting and modern despite the time period of the setting. Quite a few hotties here, and that\'s never a bad thing.2. Action-- FANTASTIC! From the start, it\'s fast-paced, engaging and there are many moments where I was literally on the edge of my seat. There\'s a fairly badass train scene that I watched multiple times, actually.3.

It moves a mile a minute, never taking the proper time to set up conflicts and build the stakes. By the time you get to the climax, you don't really know what will happen if the bad guy wins,...you just know it will bad, and that is supposed to be enough.They flesh out a handful of the key players and the rest of the not that massive cast of heroes and villains are lucky if they a couple minutes of backstory to flesh them out. So when there's a scene where two of these characters are in a bad situation, I feel zero tension because I don't really know these folks beyond being bad ass.The problem here is they were telling an origin story, unfortunately that origin story clearly had at least two major story arcs in the manga, and the studio decided to jam them together and trimmed too much fat.

But, in this case, it's a good vampire anime that does a lot of things right.So, as far as the story, it's pretty good. There's a group of Jaegers (vampire hunters) doing their job plus some related drama with the main character and a hometown relic. At first, some things don't really seem to be closely related. It starts out with somewhat of a broad story line and then things become more connected.Most of the characters don't really change. Yuliy is somewhat of a copy of Yuuichiro Hyakuya (from Seraph...of the End). Both of them are apart of a group that kills vampires and they start out with revenge being their only reason to live. Also, that reason to live changes as the series progresses. There are some differences though. Yuu is more of a tsundere while Yuliy is simply a more mature, nice guy struggling with some things. Ryouko changed as well but she simply matured with age. So, while the characters are consistent, there isn't much development.The art's nice.

Our latest addition is Tenrou: Sirius of the Jaeger, which is the show I’ll be analysing in more detail. Warning, this contains spoilersStory: 7The story follows the secret organisation called the ‘Jaegers’, a vampire hunter group who kills vampires, and have been tasked in finding the secret artefact called the Ark of Sirius, before the vampires who are also trying to get their hands on it.The ark is stated to be a national treasure from the village called Dogville,...which contains immeasurable power and anyone who possesses can become “a god or a devil”. Basically, the ark serves as a plot device that gathers both sides into the conflict to advance the plot.The story is set in the 1930s, but the writer does nothing with it. What’s the point in having your story set in this age if you aren’t going to explore it? The story could have been set in the modern era and it would have made no difference. Poor world buildingAnother issue I have is the weapons the Jaeger use. For a group of hunters who’s assigned to killing vampires all the time, there’s nothing unique or creative about them. We don’t see these weapons used in any innovative way during fights. I would have rather the weapons be special enhanced tech designed to kill vampires than your typical standard staff that anyone can use. It would have added some characterisation giving them diverse weapons which complemented their personalities well. Hell, most of the time it seemed the Jaegers (besides Yuily) were using guns to kill vampires.Characters: 6One of the weaker parts with this show I have to say is the characters.Our main protagonist Yuily, is the last survivor from Dogville and a royal member of Sirius. His initial goal is to kill all the vampires that killed his clan. Does this remind you of a certain Sasuke? Yuily’s is a annoying, reckless kid with a revenge arc and a relationship with his nii-san (older brother). Luckily, Yuily’s motivation slowly shifts from wanting to kill all the vampires to wanting to retrieve the ark that’s sealed away, as he takes responsibility being the last Sirius member to try uphold the dream his father envisioned where humans and vampire united and lived together peacefully. Yuily’s development is handled well as it spans over several episodes, so it doesn’t feel like it’s a drastic change in motivation like Shippuden Sasuke felt. However, one of my main problems with Yuily is he never learns anything about teamwork. Everyone is saying “Calm Yuily!” “Slow down!”, yet the amount of times this fool runs off acting recklessly trying to fight the vampire, only to either: get shot several times, cause someone else to get hurt, let the ark to stolen or has to be rescued becomes annoying. Even in the last episode Mikhail has to come to his aid and rescue himMikhail is Yuily’s older brother who was turned into a vampire, but still looks out for his brother from the shadows.The dynamic between Yuily and his nii-san is one of the crux and best aspects about this show. Despite how similar the characters and their relationships are to Sasuke and Itachi, this ones a lot more healthy and you can tell that they genuinely love each other.The worst character who brings this show down is Ryuoko. I swear, I hate this girl with a passion because of how pointless she is and adds nothing to the overall story. Ryuoko is the ‘female lead’, except she’s fails at being one. She chases Yuily around the world like some obsessive, love struck stalker- fully aware of how dangerous the mission the Jaegers are on. Remove Ryuoko’s scenes and the story would still function without her. The writer tried setting her up as this strong swordsman, but she does next to no combat afterwards. It’s as if the writers didn’t know what to do with her. Ryuoko’s love for Yuily is as one sided and poorly written as Sakura’s is for Sasuke. Piss off with the “I learnt a lot from Yuily on my journey” in the last episode, you barely had any meaningful interactions together and barely talked!There’s barely any indication that Ryuoko likes Yuily for any other reason, besides his looks. Yuily does not give a fuck about Ryuoko, he does not mention her and cares more about his relationship with his brother, the Professor and the Jaegers. I rant about Ryouko because she’s a pointless character that’s nothing more than a love interest, which took up valuable screentime that could have better been used fleshing out or developing the Jeagers and the Vampires.I don’t care for most of the Jaegers tbh, besides probably the Professor and that’s mainly because of his relationship with Yuily. They don’t recieve enough development or screentime for me to bother remembering their names. Partially, the problem is Yuily’s fault because he constantly runs off on his own and the team are separated from him for most of the episodes. It’s only the first few episodes where we actually see them being a team and actually bonding. Even Yuily and the Professor’s relationship isn’t developed that well. We don’t receive enough backstory on them for the viewer to witness this “father-son” relationship they supposedly have, besides a scene of the Professor finding Yuily and riding on a train with him. Had we got more scenes of the Professor raising Yuily I could have bought what the show was trying to portray, but when Yuily finally called the Professor “dad” it fell flat and did nothing for me.Another crucial aspect this show fails at is exploring the vampires. In Sirius, they’re depicted as generic vampires with nothing that differentiates them from other shows about vampires aside from their design. The lack of characterisation about the vampires that should have been expanded on in order to enrich the vampire lore is left unexplained. For example, where do these noble vampires originate from? How did the vampires get stricken by this disease? How did they came to be? Is Yevgraf even related to the twins?!The writer sets up an interesting objective by having the vampires being plagued with a deadly disease that will kill them them without the ark, but it’s not executed well enough for the viewer to sympathise and want to root for them. The story wants to maintain the status quo of the vampires being the bad guys and that’s further enhanced by the last episode when Yevgraf’s objective becomes seeking immortality through the ark, being consumed by power and becoming your typical, generic villain with a evil laugh. It’s a shame that the vampires are presented in such a shallow way, that you won’t care about them enough to remember their names when they’re killed. Yevgraf had potential to be a compelling villain. Kershner died too early on and was wasted potential.Animation: 7The animation is decent. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and were smooth at the start, but it gets worse in the last few episodesSounds: 6The opening was alright. The osts were mostly forgettable.Overall: 6The show tried to cover too much content in 12 episodes. Sirius should have gotten two cours (24 episodes). With that many episodes we could have seen more from the other Jaegers- their backstories and given them character arcs, the fight leading up till Bishop becoming a vampire and his team that were massacred- that way his motivation would have held more weight, we could have gotten more worldbuilding, lore about Sirius and the vampires, fleshed out the vampires, gave Ryouko a proper role and spotlight, developed some relationships better e.g. Yuily and the Professor, Yuily and the rest of the Jaegers, Yuily and Ryouko.Sirius had potential to being a great vampire story, but it failed to captualise in anything that would have made this show great and became mediocre. which contains immeasurable power and anyone who possesses can become “a god or a devil”.

Ending felt a bit rushed, but then again only had 12 episodes can\'t blame them if it ever gets second season they might make up for it. There was potential romance which I kinda enjoyed but they didn\'t expand on it which would\'ve been sooo much better. There were quite a few things they showed but didn\'t talk a lot about, again this leave potential for a better second season. The story was different for sure, but some aspects were similar to other stories. Really good visuals and...overall I enjoyed it as a nice side anime, nothing that makes it stand out from others, maybe the fact that its about vampires and werewolves but they didn\'t really call them ""werewolves"" and that is something we don\'t get a lot of in recent anime. overall I enjoyed it as a nice side anime, nothing that makes it stand out from others, maybe the fact that its about vampires and werewolves but they didn\'t really call them ""werewolves"" and that is something we don\'t get a lot of in recent anime.', ""This is a good anime to watch if you are trying to kill time and are okay with a 12 episode binge spree. This anime is nothing new in the Genre where you have 2 main groups, one the vampires and the other the Jaegars which is an organization that hunts vampires. You will notice there are a lot similarities between this and 2 really good anime if you pay attention (FMA and D-grayman).The story starts out really well and seems unique minus the vampires part where the time and setting is historically based in after WW1 japan. This period in japan is rarely...covered in anime so seeing it and watching how japan was really refreshing and the interactions with foreign characters. But then as the story gets going the its seems rushed where in the beginning its slow and at the end everything comes to an conclusion in one episode (a problem with most 12 episode anime).The characters seem to be diverse an cool but you don't get to see more of the background of the other characters other then Yuliy (Main) and his brother. The villains are not that special and don't really have back story either. covered in anime so seeing it and watching how japan was really refreshing and the interactions with foreign characters.

The villains are not that special and don't really have back story either."", 'I\'ve had this anime on my ""to watch"" list for a bit (since I first saw the trailer actually), and seeing as my school year was finished and I didn\'t have much else to do, I thought I\'d go ahead and watch it. And my overall feeling was that the anime doesn\'t really live up to what the trailer seemed to promise. I mean, don\'t get me wrong, I enjoyed this anime to a certain extent, and the vampire hunting aspect of the trailer was clearly there, but the anime seems to be lacking a certain ""je ne sais quoi"".The story is somewhat stable: Yuliy...(the writers were probably going for the Russian-sounding ""Yury"", but hey, that\'s just my theory) is part of a globe-trotting Vampire-exterminating outfit which is based in London. They track down a head Vampire in Shanghai, who then scuttles off to Japan in search for safety, and a mysterious artifact called the Ark of the Sirius. Hi-jinks ensue, much blood is spilled, many Vampires are ashified and many plot twists are found, but basically the rest of the story is a race against time to find said Ark, before the Vampires find it.""Now, we all know what a Vampire is (hopefully), but what is a Sirius?"" I hear you cry. Well to be honest, the series doesn\'t really explain as such. They seem to be non-humans, with a rather ancient and complex culture, all the while living rather simplistically in a secluded area in (what I suppose is) the North of Japan, possibly rather close to Russia. During the whole series, the Vampires refer to them as ""dogs"" or ""wolves"", so it could be more or less safe to assume that they\'re a kind of werewolf-proxy which are on the brink of extinction, but they don\'t really take a wolf-like form: the closest they get to that (and only a couple Sirius seem to be able to do it) is a form of berserk rage they display when in danger, or angry, which apparently can consume then if they lose control (their eyes shine Will-O\'The Wisp blue, and veins of the same colour appear on their skin). But this ability isn\'t really explained much either. Yuliy (who is a Sirius by the way) uses it a couple times, most impressively in the second episode, while fighting against a female Vampire (but that gets cut short) and even more impressively some time later while fighting against the head Vampire, but more or less stops using it completely after that. And I must admit I found that somewhat disappointing.The characters were okay, nothing to write home about (still trying to work out why a British Intelligence agent looks so much like a cowboy, but hey, Japan), there\'s a vague, one-sided, slightly force love interest which goes nowhere, the Vampire-hunting posse is relatively fun (with backstories which aren\'t fleshed out enough as far as I\'m concerned, but this is a 12 episode anime, so I guess time was of the essence). A few other side characters which fill gaps more or less snugly, including a lisp-less, limp-less hyperactive, slightly daft Igor with only one  pair of thumbs who\'s not very interesting; a twist-filled elder brother covered in scars; two loli Vampires and a Head Vampire (not the one who fled Shanghai, another one) who wants the power of the Ark for a ""good"" reason and is more or less a Dandy.The art in itself is magnificent, the ""beast-form"" of the lesser Vampires remind me quite a lot of the Vampires from the Castlevania Series (the one on Netflix), some 3-D CGI pops up from time to time but it isn\'t too shocking (unlike that which can be found in ""Giniro no Kami no Agito"" for example). The recurring blood splatters are sufficiently splattery, the dying animation (the ashification) of the vampires is rather well done and the overall imagery is very nice.The background music is good, but it doesn\'t really stick in your mind, so it\'s somewhat forgettable. The overall sounds are rather good as such.So yeah, over all, this anime was a rather enjoyable watch, combining shônen-style combat and plot with the darker, grittier side of Vampires, all the while being very enjoyable artistically. This anime is a good way to spend a few hours, if you have nothing else to do or if you want to sit back and relax after a hard day\'s work. (the writers were probably going for the Russian-sounding ""Yury"", but hey, that\'s just my theory) is part of a globe-trotting Vampire-exterminating outfit which is based in London. They track down a head Vampire in Shanghai, who then scuttles off to Japan in search for safety, and a mysterious artifact called the Ark of the Sirius. Hi-jinks ensue, much blood is spilled, many Vampires are ashified and many plot twists are found, but basically the rest of the story is a race against time to find said Ark, before the Vampires find it.""Now, we all know what a Vampire is (hopefully), but what is a Sirius?"" I hear you cry. Well to be honest, the series doesn\'t really explain as such. They seem to be non-humans, with a rather ancient and complex culture, all the while living rather simplistically in a secluded area in (what I suppose is) the North of Japan, possibly rather close to Russia. During the whole series, the Vampires refer to them as ""dogs"" or ""wolves"", so it could be more or less safe to assume that they\'re a kind of werewolf-proxy which are on the brink of extinction, but they don\'t really take a wolf-like form: the closest they get to that (and only a couple Sirius seem to be able to do it) is a form of berserk rage they display when in danger, or angry, which apparently can consume then if they lose control (their eyes shine Will-O\'The Wisp blue, and veins of the same colour appear on their skin). But this ability isn\'t really explained much either. Yuliy (who is a Sirius by the way) uses it a couple times, most impressively in the second episode, while fighting against a female Vampire (but that gets cut short) and even more impressively some time later while fighting against the head Vampire, but more or less stops using it completely after that. And I must admit I found that somewhat disappointing.The characters were okay, nothing to write home about (still trying to work out why a British Intelligence agent looks so much like a cowboy, but hey, Japan), there\'s a vague, one-sided, slightly force love interest which goes nowhere, the Vampire-hunting posse is relatively fun (with backstories which aren\'t fleshed out enough as far as I\'m concerned, but this is a 12 episode anime, so I guess time was of the essence). A few other side characters which fill gaps more or less snugly, including a lisp-less, limp-less hyperactive, slightly daft Igor with only one  pair of thumbs who\'s not very interesting; a twist-filled elder brother covered in scars; two loli Vampires and a Head Vampire (not the one who fled Shanghai, another one) who wants the power of the Ark for a ""good"" reason and is more or less a Dandy.The art in itself is magnificent, the ""beast-form"" of the lesser Vampires remind me quite a lot of the Vampires from the Castlevania Series (the one on Netflix), some 3-D CGI pops up from time to time but it isn\'t too shocking (unlike that which can be found in ""Giniro no Kami no Agito"" for example). The recurring blood splatters are sufficiently splattery, the dying animation (the ashification) of the vampires is rather well done and the overall imagery is very nice.The background music is good, but it doesn\'t really stick in your mind, so it\'s somewhat forgettable. The overall sounds are rather good as such.So yeah, over all, this anime was a rather enjoyable watch, combining shônen-style combat and plot with the darker, grittier side of Vampires, all the while being very enjoyable artistically.

With Vampires.So this story is interesting. In essence you have Vampires vs. Vampire Hunters, and they\'re all chasing a McGuffin. What is a McGuffin you ask? A McGuffin is a plot device, an object that everyone wants for some reason that no one can explain. In this anime it\'s an object of great power and everyone mysteriously wants it for some reason that no one can really explain why or what they need it for, and even when they have reasons for needing it, they can\'t explain why it will help them with their need. All we get is...them chasing this mysterious object, that is ""powerful"" and grants ""mysterious powers"" and everyone wants it. And along the way theres lots of vampires, and werewolves, and vampire hunters and secret agents, and battles where everyone wants the McGuffin and wants to kill each other for the McGuffin, and for reasons of simply they don\'t like each other. That\'s the anime in a nutshell.Art: The art is pretty cool. I\'d say it\'s along the lines of Blood the Last Vampire in terms of quality. Maybe a little less, but it\'s pretty decent.Sound: Really not that great in terms of musical score. Mostly just kinda repetitive actions swishes and clangs and stab noises and the usual blood gurgling splatters as people get hit or killed or injured. Lots of closeups as people stab one another.Character: This is where this show really shines, lots of neat character design. Unfortunately we don\'t really get to see much backstory for most of them. Really only two characters get a decent backstory explained and allows us to go in depth with them which is kind of the focus of the story anyway, but at the same time it kinda leaves you wanting for more, and wanting to know more about the other characters. But their design is cool at least.Story: Battle royale over a McGuffin chase. Vampires vs. Warewolves and Vamprie Hunters and Secret agents. That\'s the story pretty much. And I mean not all at once of course, they draw it out with different encounters, travels and battles, and then calm spots inbetween but that\'s pretty much the story.Overall: I mean I liked the art and character design. And it\'s got good action. It definitely had a lot of potential with deeper story and character development though. If there\'s a Season 2 I\'d definitely want to see some actual explanation on what the hell the McGuffin device actually is that they\'ve been chasing and what it does, but I mean, if you just want an action anime, with lots of swishing of blades and fighting then this will definitely give you that. So when you\'re in one of those moods, this satisfies.I guess I\'d recommend it if you like the Vampire genre, and it\'s been a while since you\'ve had a good vampire action. Don\'t expect a great deal of plot, it\'s mostly a capture the flag over the McGuffin. But within that, there\'s some fun along the way, and hints at possible future plot expansion in a second season but this first one is mostly just capture the flag. them chasing this mysterious object, that is ""powerful"" and grants ""mysterious powers"" and everyone wants it.

The trailer looked pretty cool and filled with enough action to drive me in to add it to my Netflix watchlist. After waiting roughly about 4 or so months, I finally decided to watch it in one-sitting and was left confused.Animation - 10/10The animation is done beautifully well, and I would say it's on par with Violet Evergarden's level of animated scenes. The art was visually appealing to look at and it was the main factor for what kept me...watching.Story - 3/10The first episode was probably the best episode in the show, because I actually felt like the plot was flowing in the right direction. The main cast is introduced and I'm excited to learn more about them as well as the MC but that doesn't happen. For some reason, the plot focuses more on the MC's goal of revenge than the work that him and his team does. Personally, I felt like the first season should've been the second or third season with how little we, the audience, know about the MC and the main cast. If the first season focused more on character development, then it could've done better story wise.Character - 3/10The only thing we know about the main cast is that they were coworkers with the MC. I wish we could learn more about each character from the main cast, because it seemed like they each had their own personal motive and backstory. The MC also lacked anything to grab onto with how generic and cold he appeared to be. Like I know his family got offed by vampires when he was younger, but damn, I want more to him than just vengeance and hatred.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because the beautiful animation cannot save a story with missing character background. watching.Story - 3/10The first episode was probably the best episode in the show, because I actually felt like the plot was flowing in the right direction.

So short that everything is kinda rushed. Although the plot is good and consistent, the characters interesting, the whole thing being quite polished, it just feels like you would have wanted more...to happen. Some characters for instance are under-developped, and even though the fights are really well made in term of pure action sequences, they feel a bit too quick. Some vilains only appear for a split second before getting sent to hell by the MC, even though the entiere Vampire organisation vs Private societies being supported by the army mixed with political plot is remarquably good. I enjoyed the universe, the steampunkish-Van Helsingian vibe works pretty well imo (but that might also be something you either love or don\'t), but everything is going so fast that i feel that 3 seasons for the show would have developped all of that to its full potential.So yeah, it\'s good, fights are good, story as well, characters (although some are under-developped) have this attaching thing to them, OST is gold (imo again); but everything is too quick, plot could have been developped with time, giving us more insight on the world that is depicted, and some bad guys are quite too stereotypical (might be due to the fact that you can\'t grant them time to explain who they are).You\'ll probably think it\'s painful if you\'re a ""puriste"" but in the end I would recommend that to any viewer that could go over the fact that it could have been soooo good. You might also appreciate how this is an ""honest"" anime. I had the feeling that it really wanted to try showing something new with old concepts inherent to the genre.Also it\'s Netflix, so I don\'t really like their means of production, but if you don\'t care you can go for it. to happen.

To preface, for personal enjoyment, any anime with an interesting plot and world has to stoop pretty low for me to not just ""enjoy"" it. I would rate this an 8 in terms of watching for leisure, but objectively speaking, this show is a 4 that misses the mark thoroughly. If you watch with the mindset of character development, and larger scale plot creation, it\'s a 0.Sirius the Jaeger is a short and sweet anime that will definitely keep you hooked with colorful visuals, intense plot twists (more so the beginning of the story), and very...intriguing character dynamics. However, the show is HEAVILY flawed with the amount of opportunities missed and the show lacks to find depth in a way that really hits hard. The review hardly hits all the possible examples.The show simply revolves around Yuily, and only his closest relationships. With that being said, the show is not about the Jaegers (his friends), so to speak, but Yuily happening to be a Jaeger and his gang being there as merely support for the plot (very much so the opposite of Avatar: The Last Airbender). Furthermore, his entire Jaeger gang is unexplored except for that of Mr. Willard, who is quite frankly is a mild character. If you’re searching for a ALTA protagonist structure, you’ll be disappointed because the show feels a lot like a one man mission.Combat is enticing but dry at the same time since it seems like there are no tactics being used but all we can assume is that the better fighter will win.Altogether, an anime definitely worth watching. I never felt bored, but I also couldn\'t help but notice flaws and wish for more from the characters. The show felt very incomplete and I was yearning for more.There is a significant spoiler in the next paragraph, and the rest of the review is further explaining the issues of the story.______________________________________________________________The buildup for Yuily\'s arc is pretty good, but Yevgraf, his final enemy (i.e., big bad guy) is extremely underwhelming when faced upon Yuily. It didn\'t feel like an epic fight at all, simply because Yevgraf loses not to Yuily, but to his own greed for power that consumes him.Take it as you wish, but the show unfortunately falls short in so many areas. It felt VERY short with 12 episodes, and you can only fit so much information in that amount of time. But it\'s very disappointing to not see it to begin with.In terms of pacing, the show is pretty rushed altogether. Dorothea explaining her background and reasoning to join the Jaeger\'s is straight up poor writing. All she mentions is that she came from a wealthy family and that after the she saw vampires, that she didn\'t want them to live anymore. That\'s it. Fallon on the other hand is not looked into at all. We also get to see nothing of Yuily and Phillip. Personally, I thought their initial conflict was going to rise between them in a good or bad way, as Phillip had an initial hatred for Yuily because his brother killed his family. However, it’s just waved off in the story with the scientists 4-year old daughter talking some sense to him – literally.On some personal notes, I think the anime may have done better with a little more shock.

Although we\'re nearing the end of 2018, we\'re still full of big-eyed, brightly colored girls everywhere, so to see a relatively realistic color palate and art style was refreshing.Now for the actual substance. It was a strange experience. Mild, lukewarm. Hard to explain, but here\'s my effort.Story: 6The story itself was one you\'d find these days in a teen fantasy novel.

Vampires are also looking for a powerful macguffin which is a good excuse for some globetrotting and throwing in other factions into the mix to complicate things.

We get to know them a bit better as times goes on and even though though there’s not much depth to all of them combined, expressive animation and snappy dialogue makes them feel a bit more alive than just generic cardboard cutout and it made me get attached to them even if a little.Action was always a real highlight however. Animation quality in this show is consistently very high (even though it’s not without blemishes throughout the 12 episode run). The first episode or two do a good job of setting the tone for the kind of fighting we’ll be seeing. As supernatural as everything is, the violence here is quick and brutal. Vampires getting cut in half, their heads blown off with a shotgun or chests riddled with bolts and bullets. It’s all very visceral and satisfying and most of the time the stakes feel appropriate. A meager fight with some grunts is not much but when it comes to royal vampires and other more threatening enemies, the high agility and power of both fighters really comes through in the animation and every hit looks like it could be the last if it lands right. I don’t usually talk about the visuals so early on but it’s a real highlight of the shows and one of the bigger reasons to watch it. From character designs to backgrounds it almost always looks great and when it doesn’t, it’s easy to overlook. Music enhances all this significantly. Even though the show is set in early 20th century the soundtrack is not at all period appropriate and I feel like the reason for that is that it seeks to fit the tone and aesthetic of characters rather than the setting. A lot of the time the events on screen are accompanied with smooth electronic beats that make even more mundane things actions seem like they’re being done by the best of the best with utmost confidence and finesse. When we switch to action it also becomes obvious that this is the same composer as the one that worked on Gundam IBO because his string focused action tracks are almost comically similar to the music he did for IBO. Yet it still does a great job of accompanying show’s hectic action scenes and making them feel like important and dangerous clashes between deadly opponents.Unfortunately at about episode 7 the show starts the downfall. It has some great actions and a few of the better character building moments in the show but it’s also where the balance starts to shift from characters and action towards story. That might not seem like a flaw in and of itself but the problem with Sirius is that it didn’t really have a story to properly focus on, they should’ve just ignored it and made it about the parts that did have promise and appeal.The only thing going on with the story of Sirius is the Ark, something that used to be nothing but a macguffin, a plot device. To explain this a bit more, the Ark is a powerful artifact that Yuily’s werewolf people tribe used to guard in their village away from everybody. Unfortunately they do a shit job of it cause everyone and their mom are onto it which eventually leads to vampires ransacking their village and killing everyone in it with only Yuliy being able to escape thanks to his brother. Our main story starts about 10 years after that, everyone and their mom are still looking for the Ark and vampires seem to be getting closer than ever. At that point you don’t really care much about the Ark because it’s used right. It’s used to justify characters coming together in the same places, interacting and possibly derailing into something else. To give you another example of this plot device being used extremely well, look at One Piece. The actual treasure, One Piece, is nothing but a tool to bring everyone together on the same quest. What it actually is, where exactly it came from and all the other details don’t matter.Similarly it should’ve have mattered what the Ark is, what matters is how we get to it and what happens on the way. We don’t need to know what kind of effect Ark had on the people of Dogville cause Dogville and everyone in it and the entire species of Sirius don’t matter. We know nothing about them and don’t have much of a reason to care what did or will happen to them or their species. We don’t need a giant detour for the a large portion of the cast just so that could find a counter macguffin that justifies something later on that could’ve been dismissed much easily.By putting so much emphasis on the Ark instead of characters and action the weight of the narrative also starts to rest on the Ark. If we shifts the focus from characters and action to the Ark the payoff of the story also shifts. If the first half can bring satisfaction from seeing how Fallon messes with Philip or Yulyi’s attachment to Willard, the second one has to deliver on what it builds up to so much, the Ark itself. And it fails miserably.By episode 10 the Ark that grants you the godlike powers is casually unsealed thanks to Yulyi having the special blood of royal werewolves like his Daddy. The reason he unseals it is so that everyone can coexist, even the vampires. Why he cares about the vampires so much after wanting to eliminate them completely? Well obviously cause his brother is half vampire and one of the vampire lolis he fought before had sad eyes and then there was another vampire that was a nice guy. Those three I guess entirely redeem vampires who previously were complete edgelords intent on ruling the world and killing everyone. Doesn’t matter though, we’re here to see what the Ark can do. It doesn’t activate right away cause apparently it needs werewolf blood. Luckily Yulyi’s brother awkwardly activates it and tosses it to the flying vampire lolis. At this point you’re probably supposed to be excited or worried at the prospect of this godlike thing being delivered to the number 1 bad guy who was already exceedingly strong. You sure you’re ready for the grandiose final battle? Well then fuck you. Vampire dude eats the ball, seemingly gets a bit stronger though it’s hard to tell. Then he morphs into a more monster looking form and we get a final battle where Yulyi chops him up until Vampire dude stops regenerating. Apparently the power was just too much for him…This is what the show built up to. It build up to a completely flaccid final battle where an incredibly powerful villain get the most powerful thing in the world and completely fails to do anything even remotely noteworthy with it. Yulyi then gets the ball, he already has a counter ball so that his body won’t go crazy from taking on such huge power. Now maybe we’ll finally get to see what the Ark that we heard so much about is capable of? Haha nope, get pranked bro, Yulyi pretty much disappears and becomes a traveling hermit for… reasons I guess and everyone else moves on doing what they’ve been doing before.So now not only did we miss out on proper fun with characters but also the most powerful artifact that was so revered eneded up doing absolutely nothing, leaving us with an ending that’s neither satisfying or conclusive. What a damn disappointment.Despite all this I still think this show is worth a watch if you’re into action and good animation cause there’s plenty of it here. First 6 episodes in particular do a good job or ramping up the action and the show could’ve been fantastic if it could keep that up and even though we don’t get to see some characters anywhere close to as much as we should have, the stuff that is there is usually pretty good and endearing. story is this light, that usually means characters and the adventure they’re on will be a main focus of the show.

I thought Blade, Underworld and Hellsing, and anything vampires and bloody witchcraft sacrifice was the coolest shit of all time. Ultra-violent media was the needle into my veins.The first episode to Sirius the Jaeger kind of sent me hurtling into nostalgia, I thought it was a pretty strong initial impression. Cool fight scenes, walls in the scenery are perfect canvas for blood splatter, and perhaps some stereotypical but still cool characters with a little political intrigue. But the thing about nostalgia is that the longer you stare at it, the...more the Vaseline blurry sheen fades away, and you realize it ain\'t all you remember.I think if I was fifteen years old, and not the closer and closer to thirty year old I am, I would be incredibly fond of this work and probably recommend it more than I do now.I can\'t say there\'s too much egregious about it, it just fails to be remarkable. Which is hardly a sin but it\'s not redemptive either.All of the side characters, except for a few, are just to fill roles and space in the plot. You get barely anything from them, and quite a few in the main roster you could completely omit and nothing would change at all.The main group of Jaegers, for instance. Besides the protagonist and one other character, they are absolutely meaningless and add nothing. They are not fleshed out beyond their archetypes, not even hinted at having more depth beyond the cardboard they\'re printed upon.No character was more unnecessary than Ryouko. Established as being a tomboy sword training girl, this pays off one time. And then she spends the rest of the story just tagging along for absolutely no good reason, and the skills they established never come up again.The political intrigue was interesting initially. There seemed to be a few factions.  There\'s political parties, the vampire hunters, the vampires. I was interested to see how this would unravel into something bigger but instead it kinda just... falls away as the plot progresses and the story becomes incredibly straight forward and simple. Oh, everyone just wants this object of power.And then it fight scenes its way to the end. Introducing new things to the plot that I thought were going to be a bigger deal and then aren\'t. Introducing new characters with motivations and betrayals you can see like they\'re stapled to their foreheads. Nothing ever being really fleshed out, just enough to essentially say, ""and this is why this is happening!""I enjoyed it in the moment while watching. But the second I gave things too much thought, I started to feel like things here and there should have been expanded on and fleshed out. I couldn\'t tell you half of the characters names. But it didn\'t completely fail in it\'s promise presented in the opening episode.It missed the opportunities to be extra, and instead is merely ordinary. It felt like ground I have seen in circles before.If you already have Netflix, it\'s not a bad watch - you can do a lot worse. I wouldn\'t go out of my way to see it, but honestly, send this back to 2008 and I would have loved it.

YMMV', ""This was my second vampire anime and I was glad that it turned about to be better than the first one I watched (servamp). I think this anime would've had the potential to be big, but it's not that easy for anime to become popular with 12 episodes. In fact, a lot of people don't like how short a good anime is because the pace gets too fast and the character development is not good at all. You have to understand the fact that the reason why studios make 12 eps is because they don't have enough budget so they want to see how good...the first season of an anime goes before they can make more. It's only a coincidence that other anime become pretty popular with more than 12 eps, but that's because their studio is taking the risk into putting most of their money towards that one show.For this anime, I also think they went a little too fast, but if the anime was a bit longer, it could've turned into a big success. Right now, i'm not wishing for another season not because it wasn't good; it was good, the plot was amazing. But they ended the story at the end, so I can't really imagine what can happen next without making the story confusing too much. Everything about this anime was done ideally great, but I think the director wasn't too sure on how to end it. the first season of an anime goes before they can make more.

An interesting enviroment, a good character desing I guess and some other things that may promised.The main problem to me was the characters, they didnt have any developement, just July, his brother, the professor just a bit, and thats it. (Even some tertiary characters like the oldman had more developement than the others).The secondary characters and the enemies were just a piece of paper with nothing behind, (Even with only 12 chapters, they wasted that time in another things not so importants for the plot, like the story of...the girl and his father) and most of them didnt do so much in their time in screen. The only that matters were July and his brother (I mean they are the main characters after all, but even so they dont have the charisma to take all the show only for them).Puting that a side, the behind plot was good but too simple, not so interesting with out a deeper view. And I felt that the rest of the world ""Looking for the ark"" (Box, Hako, whatever) was unexistant, nothing else was happening, the best comparison in that sense is ""Shingeki no Bahamut"" the entire world was moving, but this is not that kind of show so I cant ask for that much. And some secondary things like the mad scientist, the short time with the little girl and the doctor, etc didnt have any real value for the story, so many things just ended up in the air without finishing.12 episodes were not enough to make all of that, but anyways those weak points are visible.Some battles were good, the animation is remarkable but the final battle was sh*t, the desing of the final boss was f*cking horrible and the battle wasnt more than just a couple of hits and a chase.But I have to acept that the end was good, very nostalgic.7/10 the girl and his father) and most of them didnt do so much in their time in screen.

It made me extremely sad how criminally underrated this anime is. my review is going to be short, but i hope i can make my point clear.Once in a while we may find anime that gives us utmost enjoyment, reminds us why we even started to watch anime in the first place and why we love it so much. Sirius the Jaeger is exactly the anime, that reminded me of that. I do not remember, when was the last time i got so hyped about particular anime...from the first episode. Sirius the Jaeger has almost everything, Art, Story, Action, Sound were splendid. The only thing i wished throughout watching this series, was that it would be longer and for more background character development. The story may be fast-paced for some viewers, but even though it was not hard to follow and did not lack any major points, overall leaves you quite satisfied, plus considering that it is only 12 episodes, you realize that the pace of the story development is quite acceptable, at least it was for me.In conclusion, if you read this short review i would suggest you to totally give it a try, i can say i did not regret it and probably neither will you. from the first episode.

Has style out the wazoo at the least. Follows a group of sorta vampire hunters named jaegars, one of whom is a human like beast named a Sirius hence the title, as they try to hunt down the last remnants of the vampires whom are searching themselves for an item called the Arc of the Sirius to save themselves from a vampire disease. So safe to say that where it starts and where it ends are two very different places. It's a very all over the place show. Narrative wise and quality wise.Like...I said to start it's definitely got style and flair that few shows can have. Fights scenes are incredible to see and the animation keeps pace pretty much all the way through. The characters are pretty interesting for the most part. The main character Yuliy is ok. Nothing that separates him from any other random action series protagonists. Sense of duty, tragic past, fights well, yadda yadda been there done that. Other characters are cool like his older brother Mikhail, probably my favorite part of the show was their bond tbh, and the other Jaegers he's teamed with. But the main villain Yevgraf is hokey as can be and the girl Ryoko, the main love interest I guess you would call her, isn't much more of anything really.The plot also leaves a lot unexplained. I don't think it ever once have a concrete answer as to what the Arc did. It sorta laid it out but not really. Extremely cryptic about it despite tons of time dedicated to backstory and history lessons. Solid answers yee will not find.That's really the series biggest hold up. It's super basic. I'm willing to bet you've seen the basic structure of this story dozens of times. Doesn't really do much to stand out or set itself apart. So while it's a great action fest there isn't much else. The plot relies on that stupid mcguffin of the Arc of Sirius for way too much of the driving force. It's really dumb. A lot of the plot points are easily predictable too. If I had to some this show up in one word it'd be: basic. The action is awesome but the plot gets downright dumb sometimes.Extremely by the numbers but the action gets its style points from me.7/10.

I'm hunting for good anime to recommend to my friends so I dive into everything and this happens to be one of the anime I anticipate. Let's get on the review.Title: 5/5Well the title make sense since it's about a Sirius who is one of the Jaegar, hunting vampires.OP/ED: 3/5I prefer the ending song of this anime. Try to listen to them! It's good.Art: 5/5Amazing graphics. I thoroughly enjoy the graphics....Sound: 4/5It's good but I still feel like it can be improved. More could be polished and added especially during the dramatic moments.Plot: 4/10On first look, I don't feel like this is cliche. It draws me in. However, the pacing of this anime is slow. I actually need to push myself to click the next episode. I wasn't eager to know what happen. As the story unravels, it becomes mediocre and soon, it becomes cliche. Orphan, special, beastly (follow his instincts a lot), tragedy falls upon them, revenge, etc. Basically, you know the drill. It's taking a long time to reach the climax and even the climax, it feels like I'm left hanging. It does not exactly show the true power of the Ark, does not exactly show it's speciality or why everyone is fighting to obtain it. There are unnecessary fragments inserted between the actual plot due to unnecessary character but we'll get back to that part later.Fighting Scene: 8/10I love it. I like the 'goriness' it portrays. It's likeable enough but I do feel like I want more. It is not censored but not described in detail. Good but can be improve. Good but just not there. BUT, I expect more power, more intense fight considering it's a fight between vampires and a sirius which is a Jaegar on top of that. I'm expecting more stunts and I expect more power from the Ark. More power from the so-called speciality of a Sirius.Characters: 4/10I'm not going to dive into each character. Just the good ones and also the bad ones.Misha: I love love love him. He is cool character, limited strength due to not being a noble. A bit cliche though but his character make sense.Yuliy; Eren. You watch this, you'll understand why I put Eren in this review. Eren at least shows his power he has but Yuliy, it just isn't enough. I don't feel the specialness in him. I need more. MORE. The main character feels like Eren- feels a lot like the characters that shares the same archetype as Eren. Has an element of Owari No Seraph.Ryouko: Alright, lets get to the nasty part. I don't think her character is necessary. I hate weak pretending to be strong character. Her love interest for Yuliy is definitely not needed in this anime. I got annoyed whenever she tries to tag along with the group. Like seriously, I definitely feel her character is a pain in the ass.Over all: 33/50It's a mediocre anime for me. Some annoying characters, can be improved. I recommend this anime for those who would like to enjoy gory scenes. Sound: 4/5It's good but I still feel like it can be improved. More could be polished and added especially during the dramatic moments.Plot: 4/10On first look, I don't feel like this is cliche. It draws me in. However, the pacing of this anime is slow.

It does not exactly show the true power of the Ark, does not exactly show it's speciality or why everyone is fighting to obtain it. There are unnecessary fragments inserted between the actual plot due to unnecessary character but we'll get back to that part later.Fighting Scene: 8/10I love it. I like the 'goriness' it portrays. It's likeable enough but I do feel like I want more. It is not censored but not described in detail. Good but can be improve. Good but just not there. BUT, I expect more power, more intense fight considering it's a fight between vampires and a sirius which is a Jaegar on top of that. I'm expecting more stunts and I expect more power from the Ark. More power from the so-called speciality of a Sirius.Characters: 4/10I'm not going to dive into each character. Just the good ones and also the bad ones.Misha: I love love love him. He is cool character, limited strength due to not being a noble. A bit cliche though but his character make sense.Yuliy; Eren. You watch this, you'll understand why I put Eren in this review. Eren at least shows his power he has but Yuliy, it just isn't enough. I don't feel the specialness in him. I need more. MORE. The main character feels like Eren- feels a lot like the characters that shares the same archetype as Eren. Has an element of Owari No Seraph.Ryouko: Alright, lets get to the nasty part. I don't think her character is necessary. I hate weak pretending to be strong character. Her love interest for Yuliy is definitely not needed in this anime. I got annoyed whenever she tries to tag along with the group. Like seriously, I definitely feel her character is a pain in the ass.Over all: 33/50It's a mediocre anime for me. Some annoying characters, can be improved. I recommend this anime for those who would like to enjoy gory scenes."", ""This is a vampire action anime with a nice setting of the 1930s, one of the anime's strongest points is the overall atmosphere of the pre world war 2 ambience which is embedded splendidly into the animation of the show.StoryThe story is average at best and it is out of place for the most part, it felt like some subplots were a lot more interesting than the actual main plot.

There isn't anything particularly special about this anime but at the same time, everything is done very well.I could tell from seeing the OP for the first time that this anime would be a good finished product. Each of the 12 episodes was expertly animated and the soundtrack for each one was awesome. This is one of the few animes that doesn't take half of its run time to really get interesting. I found every episode to be exceptional and each one better...than the last.What surprised me the most was how this quickly turned into so much more than just Hunters vs Vampires and how Yuliy's story progressed from a basic hunter to something truly beautiful. than the last.What surprised me the most was how this quickly turned into so much more than just Hunters vs Vampires and how Yuliy's story progressed from a basic hunter to something truly beautiful."", ""This Anime is set in 1930's Japan and Russian Siberia. It does a good job of portraying the setting. It blends in the vampire and the werewolf elements nicely, creating a believable alternative history.The place were this show really shines is the characters. Especially Ryouko, who is portrayed as a strong young woman, but still believable.But the second half of the show freezes all the character development except for Mikhail, and then by the last two episodes, the show completely jumps the shark, going into a mystical feel-good mumbo-jumbo land.So overall, I would recommend it, but don't expect too much from the last few...episodes - just watch them for the fight scenes & eye candy. episodes - just watch them for the fight scenes & eye candy."", 'Found this anime by chance and wasn’t expecting much out of it, just wanted to kill some time. Scrolled through anime recommendations and recent anime before chancing upon this. At first glance, the anime just seemed like an adventure anime like Grancrest Senki. The profile picture of Sirius here did not do justice to the anime itself. Not saying that the anime was an amazing masterpiece yet since I am only half way through the anime, however, I would say that in my case, I was bearing much expectations for this anime after looking at the picture. Therefore, I went to search up some images...on the anime and I finally got to watching it after being swayed by the blue eyes of the main character.Music wise, I would say it is not as memorable as those hits in other anime like Sword Art Online, Tokyo Ghoul and Your Lie in April (just to name a few), though it could grow on me if I gave it a few tries in the upcoming episodes I have not watched.Halfway into the episodes and I would say I had the impression of this anime being a rip-off from Owari no Seraph based on the plot, just a little darker. Both have their own pros and cons, however, I liked how the confrontations were portrayed. It was more realistic in Sirius. I appreciated how the smaller numbers in the protagonist group and the fact that there was little bromance like how you can ship literally any two guys together in Owari no Seraph.May I just say that the voice-acting was really on point? I liked the voice actor of Mikhail, as expected of the voice actor of Sting from Fairy Tail. Mikhail calling out Yuliy was heavenly and gave me chills (just my personal preference).Another point to note is that I liked that the vampires were not portrayed as beautiful as that in Owari no Seraph, yet I felt that it was better than those in ONS like Ferid and Crowley.It is definitely worth watching. I take interest in the vampire genre though there have not been many of such anime. To end off, I am anticipating more since I’m only halfway through but I think that there are much more surprises packed for us viewers.Note: I do think that Alexei has a much more significant role although I may be mistaken. Additionally, I’m looking forward to how Yuliy and Mikhail’s story would unfold.Overall: 7.5/10 on the anime and I finally got to watching it after being swayed by the blue eyes of the main character.Music wise, I would say it is not as memorable as those hits in other anime like Sword Art Online, Tokyo Ghoul and Your Lie in April (just to name a few), though it could grow on me if I gave it a few tries in the upcoming episodes I have not watched.Halfway into the episodes and I would say I had the impression of this anime being a rip-off from Owari no Seraph based on the plot, just a little darker.

The characters were all good, although we could have gotten a little more backstory on the rest of the jaegers (hopefully if there is a season 2 we will see that happen.) The ""20th century European setting of this anime along with the plot involving vampires really works well in my opinion and makes this anime just that more immersive and enjoyable. I was slightly let down by the ending based on the fact several characters died, such as bishop and Mikhail...(and tamara, but that isn\'t confirmed.) The ending was still satisfying none the less and proves to have a plot that could be used for a second season. I am also disappointed that they ended the last episode with tamara ""dying"" although it is not confirmed since her clothing wasn\'t there neither her body, so she couldn\'t have died from the disease or have been killed from injuries. Hopefully the particles were just snow and she is alive, considering the character has grown on me a ton, considering i thought she was very annoying with her sister at the beginning of the anime, and the fact that she and yuily both lost a sibling, can maybe cring up chemistry between them. Although that is what i hope. Overall this anime was very good, and although it does have a few cliches, an anime wouldn\'t be an anime or enjoyable to me without cliches. Sadly we can only hope for another season since there is no manga that this show/anime was based off of, so the creators would have to write up a new story/plot for the second season if we are to get one (and covid is most likely making it even harder to produce if they are going to make another season.) 10/10 from me, is one of if not my favorite current anime.

They all have different reasons that are revealed in the throughout the story. The main plot though surround Yuliy, whose goal is to avenge in family, but lets just say that there was a lot of stuff in the background that he was unaware of that makes it so that killing vampires isn’t the exact revenge he should be seeking per say. Since this is spoiler free I can’t go into detail, but this series really keeps you on your toes with the mysteries,...cryptic backgrounds, and just wondering how a certain relationship (not romantic) will end!Character: I liked how all the characters came from different backgrounds/ethnicities. Though it really didn’t play too much of a role in the series as a whole it was still a nice concept. The character relations were also very interesting, though it is hard to say without spoilers but there are a few strained relationships in this series that either started like that or were introduced. With that comes a lot of character development, there is so much character development in just 12 eps and that is amazing! There are also questions (as watchers) as to why each character chose the path they’re on so it is always a treat when we get the answers.Art: Animation was not the strong suit of this series. It wasn’t BAD but it was very flat. Let me start with the good though, the movements were amazing. Fighting scenes were so fluid and just in general the ways the characters just walked naturally etc was very nice. Also, I LOVE the eyes and the attention to details to that feature. All the main characters had such beautiful and different eyes. Onto the bad now. For one, the background didn’t match the people. I can kind of compare it to if you took a picture of the real world and used that phone app filter that makes it look like a cartoon. The characters themselves don’t have depth, except for super basic shadows/shading. But I think where it really fall through is the gore. It reminds me of an 80s horror movie where they didn’t have budget and anything red is blood. For an anime with so much violence I would’ve liked blood splatters to look decent.Overall I give this series an 7/10, my typical ‘you should watch this’ rating. I know I didn’t write much but that is because this is spoiler free and the plot just has so much! Also, anime original? YES PLEASE! The animation was it’s biggest flaw but it wasn’t unbearable, I really adored character designs and the movements were so fluid. Anyway plot matters more.Overall: cryptic backgrounds, and just wondering how a certain relationship (not romantic) will end!Character: I liked how all the characters came from different backgrounds/ethnicities.

Anyway plot matters more.Overall:', 'Took some quick notes after each episode to document my impressions. SPOILER alert or what not, not really. Make what you will of it:1st episode shows potential.The era setting is underused, glad to see it being used.For a first episode it did well introducing the characters and playground.Already expecting a more in-depth introduction to each of the main cast as well as to the lore and myth of the vampires. If this won\'t be provided, I will be disappointed.I heard the bad rep this anime gets but I do not trust apologists and MAL sycophants so I will give this anime a chance. Off to...ep2.2nd episode was decent.I expected to learn more about the characters but it seems not in this episode yet. The ending gave away more about Yuri.Speaking of which: the OP visuals were nice but song was generic forgettable J-pop. The ED visuals were simpler but the song was nice though.Things I disliked was that the doctor that fished the wounded Yuri out of the river coincidentally is also involved in a vampire plot.That choice was cliché and cheap.The Enemy sniper (vampire?) at the end of the episode is Yuri\'s brother!?! Coincidences again.. Did they have to go that route? Cliché.I did not understand the purpose of the cute little girl in a blood & gore anime, she seemed out of place. Vampirism is related to tragedy not comedy or cuteness. When her father the doctor turned and died was the redeeming factor. This fulfilled the vampire tragedy quota for me.Quick note: Yuri being knowledgeable about gardening/nature is a good link to the overall wolf myth that considers them protectors of nature and balance. Attention to detail, I see you.3rd episode was pretty good.Yuri\'s hometown, traditions and clothing were culturally correct. I can\'t deny the attention to detail.Finally getting some backstory to the main character.Will we get to know the other characters? When will we learn about this universes vampire lore?Three episodes in and questions like:What is a Sirius?What is the Ark of Sirius?still have not been answered. They are playing coy with the answers dangling them in front of us to keep the viewer hooked. They do not realize that simply explaining what a Sirius is, is a core necessity especially in the first 3 episodes.Because now I have doubts if they will ever give us answers, such doubts should not exist in the first place! This anime is still fun but making some mistakes.As expected from an Original anime but come on..4th episode was fine.finally got some information on the vampires. So nobles and slaves types of vampires. I see, so the basic stuff. Ok ok.Nobles do not fear sunlight? Hmm noo, I don\'t like that. This way they are no different from other monsters like ghouls, chimeras or whatever else from all folklores... The thing that distinguishes vampires is their fear of sunlight.Those that do not follow that rule end up like Twilight and we all know how we feel about those glitter bugs.Interested in what they will do with the Frankenstein monster that was hinted in the OP and since episode 2.Last time we had vampires, werewolves and frankensteins in one place was the Hugh Jackman movie Van Helsing.5th episode was very good.Action packed and good soundtrack.Characters that have served their purpose and now were useless got discarded. That is good. Means they are not afraid of cutting off characters for the sake of the story.The action sequences have been great since episode 1. Say what you will about the show but for 5 episodes now it has been quite entertaining.Another show in a similar genre and style comes to mind ""Fairy Gone"" which got boring pretty quickly and had nothing to offer after the 2-3rd episodes.So far so good for an original anime. Not 10/10 but let\'s see and find out.6th episode was great.The action was good. This anime is underrated, I have seen worse anime getting more love than this one. Just because some self-important MAL sycophants went all out hate on this show, doesn\'t mean they are right.Good thing I refuse to listen to apologists and gave this show a chance.Ryouko who is a reckless child seemed that way and I expected her to become the damsel in distress of this story but looking at it another way, we can see her joining the Hunters (Jaegers) and maybe forming a Japanese branch of Hunters in the future. They had to put in a Japanese character in the midst of all these foreigners.We are halfway through the show and I am still hooked.7th episode was fine.I thought Yuri\'s hair got white permanently or would become so gradually. Shame they turned it back. I don\'t like this DBZ hair color shenanigans, that\'s not how hair works.The fight was great, Michael choosing sides showed he had more freedom to act and may have an ulterior motive.The professor Willard drama with Yuri was decent, good enough to not waste any more time on overdramatizing things. In fact it was handled very human like.The government was shown as capable and not as obstructive, corrupt and useless. They knew about the Ark of Sirius and sent Iba after it. That was fresh.Still no character progression or development on the other team members except tidbits thrown in here and there...Yuri split from them and maybe next episode will be focused on his solo journey or maybe he will learn the importance of a pack and start relying on them. Maybe then they will show us more about the characters so we can learn along with Yuri.I hope they don\'t just abandon this...Also I still don\'t know what the Ark of Sirius is.8th episode was decent.That mad scientist Klarwein is getting annoying. I get the mad scientist thing but him being such a useless bootlicker up till now is seriously starting to get on my nerves.We are 8 episodes in and still don\'t know much about the team. They are shown in the OP as the main cast yet the only things we know about them is so little:Fallon is from Ireland. That\'s it.Dorothea is from Spain or Mexico. She is 2nd in command? See we don\'t know.Philip who is from London and his parents were killed by a druggie(?) sirius?Willard we got to know a little better but beside his archeology, we know nothing.If this show is moving towards a more plot focused direction and all those characters are simple pawns that we are not supposed to get too attached to, then I\'d understand their reasoning.Hence why there is a strong focus on Iba from the military plot and the reckless girl Ryouko plot.Means we focus mainly on Yuri and his brother Mikhail. Ok...Very alike Owari no Seraph where it was also a story about brothers in a vampire setting.. Also reminds me of Black Blood Brothers which was also about vampire brothers... I start seeing a pattern here..9th episode was pretty decent.I finally accepted that the question about the Ark won\'t be answered until the end.It\'s not like the One Piece that nobody knows about. I expected to get at least a relative description of what it is because right now it is no different from the Holy Grail or Akashic Records mythical artifacts.Ryouko and Iba ending up in the same town as Yuri and the Ark seems like yet another coincidence. They just had to converge all 3 stories somehow -.-Meanwhile the team of hunters is for whatever reason in the useless and destroyed Dogville village.10th episode was fine.We are getting closer to the end. All the useless players have been discarded. Much has been revealed.Interested to find out how it will all end. Heard it is a self contained story that does not require a second season. That\'s good. Good.I gave up on finding out about the Jaeger teams characters, the story did not just abandon that concept but never had it in its mind in the first place. Seems they are just secondary characters not important to the main story. Digging around in some tundra village while all the actions goes on in Karufato or whatever that cities name is, I don\'t remember.They found something crucial that will play a bigger role and help Yuri, really?That easy elementary grade puzzle was too hard for Yevgraf to solve? haha11th episode was fine.I just realized that it is not in the shounen genre. If people expect shounen-esque fighting and story-telling they will be surely disappointed.No wonder the top MAL sycophant reviews give this show a 3/6/6. Pretentious ""veterans"" of anime consumption. No different from wine snobs and beer alcoholics.This show did not invest into character development for the team from the start because it was not a character study or an in depth review of the vampire condition and the dangers and horrors it brings to others.This show is a simple action flick meant to entertain us. If you want what I described then you are better of watching ""Interview with a Vampire"" movie.The vampire sickness might seem like a cop out but in fact is the reason why the vampires seek the Ark.Finally the story of Iba and Ryouka fall off for the time being. Iba has seen enough to judge what to do with the Ark. Ryouka gave her sword to Yuri as his weapon was destroyed. Good good.Semi-final episode should never be judged as a stand alone. So I will reserve my opinion for after the finale.12th episode was good.This is not a power level over 9000 scale anime. They are not gods or anything superdupernatural. Humans and vampires killing each other in a self-contained little story.Good thing they ended it like that. Owari no Seraph bumbled down and ended it\'s second season on nothing. Basically a glorified commercial for the manga.That is what I like about original anime, they are not constrained like manga or novel works.Just remember Zankyu no Terror, FLCL, Ergo Proxy, Code Geass, Eden of the East, Anohana, Cowboy Bebop, Angel Beats, Gurren Lagann, 91 Days and that ugh Darling in the Franxx.I only wish they would have developed the vampire lore and made it their own, thus adding to the overall vampire myth. No matter how bad Twillight was, the fact they used glittering vampires taught us all not to repeat such cringe stupidity.Sirius did not transform the vampire myth. Well, at least they did not ruin it like twinkle jacob or whatever his name was, Edward I remembered I don\'t eve want to coreeact this sentenc se edit this sentence that\'s how much I don\'t care.The anime used the setting, used vampires, used the Jaeger team and used the reckless girl and military to tell a story about two brothers.From a different perspective they did not clutter the story with useless information and kept it simple which is good for an action flick.So after finishing it, I have realizing that not one episode has disappointed me, it was entertaining the whole way through.There was nothing to make me rage or cringe like Darling in the Frankfurtxx did. This was a very decent anime. Sure it was not Death Note levels of 10/10 but also not as shitty as Fairy Gone 3/10. ep2.2nd episode was decent.I expected to learn more about the characters but it seems not in this episode yet. The ending gave away more about Yuri.Speaking of which: the OP visuals were nice but song was generic forgettable J-pop.

Seems they are just secondary characters not important to the main story. Digging around in some tundra village while all the actions goes on in Karufato or whatever that cities name is, I don\'t remember.They found something crucial that will play a bigger role and help Yuri, really?That easy elementary grade puzzle was too hard for Yevgraf to solve? haha11th episode was fine.I just realized that it is not in the shounen genre. If people expect shounen-esque fighting and story-telling they will be surely disappointed.No wonder the top MAL sycophant reviews give this show a 3/6/6. Pretentious ""veterans"" of anime consumption. No different from wine snobs and beer alcoholics.This show did not invest into character development for the team from the start because it was not a character study or an in depth review of the vampire condition and the dangers and horrors it brings to others.This show is a simple action flick meant to entertain us. If you want what I described then you are better of watching ""Interview with a Vampire"" movie.The vampire sickness might seem like a cop out but in fact is the reason why the vampires seek the Ark.Finally the story of Iba and Ryouka fall off for the time being. Iba has seen enough to judge what to do with the Ark. Ryouka gave her sword to Yuri as his weapon was destroyed. Good good.Semi-final episode should never be judged as a stand alone. So I will reserve my opinion for after the finale.12th episode was good.This is not a power level over 9000 scale anime. They are not gods or anything superdupernatural. Humans and vampires killing each other in a self-contained little story.Good thing they ended it like that. Owari no Seraph bumbled down and ended it\'s second season on nothing. Basically a glorified commercial for the manga.That is what I like about original anime, they are not constrained like manga or novel works.Just remember Zankyu no Terror, FLCL, Ergo Proxy, Code Geass, Eden of the East, Anohana, Cowboy Bebop, Angel Beats, Gurren Lagann, 91 Days and that ugh Darling in the Franxx.I only wish they would have developed the vampire lore and made it their own, thus adding to the overall vampire myth. No matter how bad Twillight was, the fact they used glittering vampires taught us all not to repeat such cringe stupidity.Sirius did not transform the vampire myth. Well, at least they did not ruin it like twinkle jacob or whatever his name was, Edward I remembered I don\'t eve want to coreeact this sentenc se edit this sentence that\'s how much I don\'t care.The anime used the setting, used vampires, used the Jaeger team and used the reckless girl and military to tell a story about two brothers.From a different perspective they did not clutter the story with useless information and kept it simple which is good for an action flick.So after finishing it, I have realizing that not one episode has disappointed me, it was entertaining the whole way through.There was nothing to make me rage or cringe like Darling in the Frankfurtxx did. This was a very decent anime. Sure it was not Death Note levels of 10/10 but also not as shitty as Fairy Gone 3/10.', 'And I think we have a serious contender for the biggest letdown ever. Whole 12 episodes we\'ve been getting a serious buildup with revenge, characters developing, learning acceptance, adventuring, then seriously badass vampires. For what? The whole show just collectively farted in our face, laughed and went on as if by saying ""gotcha... tee hee"".Story felt like an elaborate scheme to trick us into watching it without us really having any desire to. For the most part everything was more than capable. Character development, world building, pacing, animation, sound design. Everything was decent if not better but it all amounted to absolutely nothing. Story someone...else has to tell some other time but on this occasion studio just wanted to get you warmed up.There\'s not even a witty comment I can come up with that will make this disappointment at least somewhat funny and bearable. Skip this one, it\'s an unfinished story without the sequel. else has to tell some other time but on this occasion studio just wanted to get you warmed up.There\'s not even a witty comment I can come up with that will make this disappointment at least somewhat funny and bearable.

"", ""To put it simply the word 'shallow' perfectly encapsulates the show.Story (4/10):The setting is fairly interesting (Imperial Japan) and so would seem the premise of the story itself but neither is explored much. The worldbuilding is at best lackluster - The show goes through a lot of events, multiple locations and features a fairly big cast all in just 12 episodes, no wonder it feels flat when it has spread itself so thin.There's basically no context for what is happening outside setting up the protagonist and the story is both too all-encompassing to be a proper journey of a person,...and too personal and restrained to be about the wider world Sirius the Jaeger is set in. Juggling so many things it just sort of ends up all over the place and feels rushed and aimless in the end.Characters (4/10):While the cast is mostly unexplored cliche archetypes (both personality and visual wise) they're mostly likeable; although quite a few side characters suffer from being completely disposable or useless story-wise on top of being flat like cardboard. In retrospect, it feels like there was a design quota which is most obvious with the gothic lolitas.The strongest point of writing is the few semi-explored relationships with the protagonist (Yuliy) but they don't dig deep enough and his characterization being flimsy/directionless weakens the overall story.Art (6/10):Nothing notable - fairly visually appealing with a modicum of clunky/lazy/derpy frames, the CGI is noticeable. Pretty generic overall in both style and execution.Have to note the weird editing? - there'd always be a clip of OP song (even if the actual OP just played) overlayed with a picture and then a few seconds of a still frame with no sound before the anime actually played each episode (just FYI this is what I got on Netflix).Sound (8/10):The soundtrack was beautiful and fitting. While I didn't particularly love the intro or outro I always ended up listening because of the instrumentals (vocals are decent but IMO kinda generic), I adored the unique sound of this series and wished it was more prominent in the songs (especially the intro).Enjoyment (7/10) /Overall:The show has nice themes of family, hope.Sirius The Jaeger does too little of too many things to be good at any of them but if you don't go in critically it's a fairly decent watch. and too personal and restrained to be about the wider world Sirius the Jaeger is set in.

In terms of genre it's somewhat similar to a less edgy Hellsing, Owari No Seraph, B the Beginning, with some Naruto thrown in it.*Minor Spoilers*Story:It's actually quite simple and straightforward, which isn't a bad thing at all. The problem is that for the sake of 'mystery' and misdirection the plot unfolds ridiculously slowly, for instance we don't find out the main villain's true intentions until episode 10. Some plots which seemed relevant in the first half of the series turn out to...be just a waste of time and you're left wondering why didn't they concentrate on the main storyline instead. Some overall themes in the story are quite engaging and touching, even if they're not offering anything new. Others, are just unimaginative. 6/10Art:The art if beautiful for the most part. Characters' designs are all interesting and intriguing. The fight scenes are mostly well animated, some of them are excellent. Unfortunately they don't keep this high standards of animation throughout the series, and the latter episodes have some pretty bad animation and underwhelming action. 7/10Characters:The only character that has some growth and development is MC. Some of the supporting characters are explored briefly and rather well and their relationships with each other can be quite poignant, however everyone else is underdeveloped.The villains, characters I consider an incredibly important part of the story, are played mostly as a straight baddie trope, which is boring. They have a tendency for maniacal laughs which genuinely made me giggle (and I don't think I was meant to react that way). At some point they attempt a redemption arc, but it's sloppy because that character is introduced too late in the story to have any emotional impact.Female characters get the worst end of the stick. The one character who gets the most focus is often clumsily forced into the story, 11 episodes in and I still don't really understand her purpose other than being the love interest, I guess. The other female characters are basically non-entities. 5/10Sound:Sound is great, OST is very good as well and compliments the aesthetic. All the VA are good, which is to be expected as most of them are very well known and experienced. 8/10Overall:I was by no means blown away. There's still one episode to go so that might change, but I doubt it. Mostly it had some good ideas and animation, but was poorly executed in many parts.

Despite the term being of German origin, the entirety of the show takes place in Japan and Russia, and there isn\'t anything remotely German about anything or anyone in it.The anime tries to combine several Gothic/Paranormal tropes and add an element of Steampunk into the mix. The result being that despite some very entertaining fight-scenes and good animation, the story fails to deliver on anything...even remotely Gothic or Steampunk.What IS given is a the classic Hero-Monomyth and a coming-of-age story for a naive brat. And to be honest, he doesn\'t age well. The \'Jaeger\' team of which our protagonist is a member consists of characters who are drawn and clothed in a manner that gives them an initial aura of intrigue and power, but as the show continues, we realize that their only real talent is being loyal to each other and knowing how to shoot guns. One character in particular makes a stellar contribution by merely throwing her sword. And she\'s present for almost every episode.All in all, it was rather a waste of time having to sit through this. The only reason I watched it fully is because by the time I realized that the show is bad, I had already put myself through 8 episodes. And if I was going to trash this show, I wanted to make sure that I trashed it after watching it completely. even remotely Gothic or Steampunk.What IS given is a the classic Hero-Monomyth and a coming-of-age story for a naive brat.

Supernatural The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8986/Supernatural_The_Animation,"[""I watched the first episode after following progress and being excited about an anime version of my favorite TV show for a very long time. I was not disappointed. Even though it starts off rather different from the show it still feels very similar. The first episode still gives us the basics of the plot, Mary Winchester was killed by the yellow eyed demon when Sam was only 6 months old. But this is seen as a dream by Sam in the Impala on their way to a case (later Sam also sees a dream of Jessica's death). The first episode is an adaptation of...the episode Skin (which is episode 6 in the original series). It keeps to the same basics as the original but with some minor changes and condensed (since the tv episodes are 40+ mins and this is only 20).The animation is really great and fits the show well. Sam and Dean look like Jared and Jensen. This really helps to get into the show very easily but the looks of all other characters is different so I don't know how I and other fans will feel about that in the long run. Because of no budget or reality concerns the appearance of the shapeshifter takes the show's concept and ramps up the freaky scale which is great. And I know that the lack of constraints is going to continue to allow the creatures to really look amazing.The Japanese voice actors do a great job and I won't mind listening to them but in the long run I will be eagerly awaiting the English release so I can hear Jared Padalecki voice Sam in all 22 episodes. Unfortunately Jensen only signed on for the last two episodes so I'm fearing who will be gotten to replace Jensen as Dean for the first 20 episodes and how much dissonance that will create hearing Sam as Jared but not Jensen as Dean. The ending song is an engrish version of the show's official unofficial theme song, Carry On My Wayward Son. Originally when I heard this version on the trailers I cringed but it's slowly starting to sound ok. The real gems in the ending are the artist sketches especially the first one which depicts a very familiar (very famous) scene for fans of the show.I think for fans of the show this anime is going to be a great new spin on the story. For those who haven't seen the original I think this is going to be a must see anime and it probably will make you interested in the original. the episode Skin (which is episode 6 in the original series).

I will put myself in the shoes of someone, who has never heard of Supernatural and evaluate its merits and faults from there.Story: 7/10The story is simple and easy to follow. It is about Sam and Dean, two brothers who hunt demons and evil spirits. Most of the episodes are following the “monster of the week” formula… but there is a general plotline that advances slowly throughout the series. There is also a main villain and the Winchester brothers have a...personal score to settle with him. Unfortunately, there are a few filler episodes with weak story and unoriginal enemies.Characters: 9/10The personalities and the interaction between the two brothers makes the difference between Supernatural and other similar TV and animated series. Sam and Dean are not perfect and flawless superheroes, they are normal persons. They can make mistakes, they can be paranoid, confused or angry and they always argue with each other. Because of that, they are a more realistic type of protagonists and the viewers can relate more to their problems and challenges.Sound and animation: 8/10The animation is decent, but not perfect. Some things bothered me, like the awkward looking faces… but if you deal with demons, your face will probably look strange too. There are also some good ideas, like the excessive use of black ink in every frame, which creates nice contrast and the camera movement during some of the action or driving sequences, which almost makes you feel the action. The music includes some nice and slow themes, which create mysterious atmosphere. The good sound effects (like the Impala’s engine) and the occasional scary noises enhance the whole experience and should also be praised.Enjoyment: 8/10Supernatural has interesting heroes (and villains) and manages to create a scary and tense atmosphere, through good use of sound effects and music. There are a few great and very dramatic episodes with some interesting plot twists. The ending is above the average. It leaves the story open, but also gives some sense of completion. What hurt the whole experience is the lower quality of the stories created especially for the anime. I also expected Supernatural to be a bit darker and scarier.Overall: 8/10If you are not familiar with the series, the flashbacks in the beginning would be confusing and meaningless. However, little by little the background story and the important details are explained. Basically, Supernatural feels more or less complete on its own and watching the TV series before starting the anime is not an absolute must. It may even have a negative effect, as some fans of the TV series hate the anime, because “it is not exactly the same”. You can be smart and ignore them.

How Mary Winchester died is still the same as it was in the original series, but it wasn\'t as detailed.  The flashbacks that Sam had near the beginning of episode 1 made me go ""What?"" once or twice, so I had to rewatch that scene a couple of times before I went ""Oh... Okay"".The anime desperately tries to have the same feel as the original series.  Honestly, it did have the same feel, but there was just something lacking.ART:  3The character designs are simply pathetic, it\'s too over-shaded, the characters seemed poorly planned out....Honestly, the background characters are more eye-catching than the two main characters.  Since Madhouse was in charge of the animation, I figured that it wouldn\'t be too bad, but I was sadly mistaken.  I put all this horrible art to a lack of a budget.  To say the least, I was shocked when the scenery was so beautiful.  The thing that should catch your eye are the characters NOT the scenery.All-in-all, they just needed more of a budget for art since it seemed like they didn\'t have enough money for it.SOUND:  6The sound is fine, but I just feel that they could\'ve used more fitting music.  The English voice actors did put emotion into their lines, so it wasn\'t dead.  I have not seen the Japanese dub, but I assume they\'re similar.  The sound effects seemed fitting for the anime, but sometimes the sound effects just didn\'t fitFor the English dub, the words don\'t exactly fit with the lip flaps.  The sentences don\'t go over, they go under the amount of flaps.  It wasn\'t enjoyable.The ending theme wasn\'t the greatest because it wasn\'t the original, but I suppose it worked.  I guess it\'s debatable depending on what you like for vocals.CHARACTER:  4Character designs left so much to be desired.  I understand that, no matter what, the animated characters won\'t look like the actual actors, but I just think they could\'ve planned out the designs more carefully.  Dean\'s design reminds me of someone who was put in jail for a crime.  I have nothing to say on Sam\'s design since it was alright.  The extras, as I said before, were better drawn.ENJOYMENT:  3I really do NOT care for this anime one bit.  I don\'t intend to watch another episode unless I\'m dreadfully bored and the only other option is banging my head against a wall or playing with matches... Even then I\'d probably play with matches.OVERALL:  4Even though the idea of turning Supernatural into an anime is good, I believe that it could\'ve been done better.   If they didn\'t jump into it because anime is the ""in thing"" right now, I honestly believe it would be better.  This is one of the worst animes I\'ve seen to date.

Having not seen the live-action show before, I don’t know if it does justice to the show or not but I have to say, I really like it any way and it does make me want to see the original show. The episodes all have to do with someone dying in a gruesome way, then the brothers’ end up being at the right place at the right time. Each show is its own storyline without many things to link them together. The story is slow, and not really action orientated. Many of the shows act more like detective shows where...something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end. There is a larger mystery that they have in this show about the brothers trying to find their Dad.The art style is rather interesting, almost a cross between anime and American comic book style. The characters are hard edged, and a lot of dark lines and heavy shadows that pretty much are black. Everything has a nice vintage feeling, sort of grimy in a good way. The characters look like the characters from the live-action as well which is what I would wish to see unlike some of them. Sadly, some of the images are pretty frozen, still images that feel like cop outs, especially when this was made in 2011.The English voices don’t feel up to par with the animation, and feels a bit forced and doesn’t match the lip sink most of the time. They talk when the mouths are closed and part of it might be to get information out since this is shorter then the actual show. Even then, it just feels rushed and makes it a little hard. I really love the ending song though. I never thought I would hear “Cary on my Wayward Son” by Naoki Takao fit so well.EDIT: I have now seen the live action show, I really like it as well. The show has the same creepy feeling and the same slowness that the animation has. The stories are altered slightly from the original but that’s partly because they were putting a 1 hour episode into a half a hour one. something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end.

Sure it sounds like it'd be good But with Jared Padalecki being the only one to reprise his role it was a disappointment. If Jensen Ackles (Who was only in the last two) and the rest of the cast had reprised their roles as well maybe I could have actually been able to stomach a full episode. Had they done this it could have made for something wonderful. But the animation for Sam was pretty much spot on. But Dean lacked a lot to be desired.Non fans wouldn't understand why fans would be confused...when the first ep makes you wonder what's happening with the murder, then you see Sam and Dean are already traveling searching for Dad. Unlike the series there is no build up, the only explanation of what happened 22 years ago is just in flashbacks. Then the last two eps correspond similar too but at the same time completely different from the Supernatural Season 2 Finale 'All Hell Breaks Loose 1-2'.Personally I found both Dean and Bobby's voice actors to be yeck! I couldn't get threw the first ep because Dean's voice was grating on my nerves. I did try to watch the final two since Jensen Ackles was doing it but it wasn't that good of a story for me personally. At least this time with the right voice it wasn't bad but still wasn't great. Jensen did a good job but for me it was too little too late to save the show. when the first ep makes you wonder what's happening with the murder, then you see Sam and Dean are already traveling searching for Dad.

But for the sake of a fair review, I'll try not to compare it (-much-I do compare it) with the original series.So, the story is definitely interesting. Two brothers hunting down all kinds of monsters thought to be just fictions of mythology and legends does sound appealing. The series includes remakes of the original episodes and anime-only episodes, too. As far as the latter is concerned, I believe they fitted with the original...series. But the 22 episodes just wasn't enough to explain the plot thoroughly. Many questions arise and, honestly, I am not sure if I would understand the story so well if I was not familiar with the live-action series.. Lastly found the ending fair enough, I repeat for someone who is not familiar with the original.The art was a real fit. I mean the intense black in the frames fitted well with the mysterious style of the story. And, the characters were decent. But, I cannot restrain from commenting on Bobby's appearance. Man, what did they do to him???? (sorry about that).I haven't watched it in Japanese so I'll comment on the dubbed version. Okay, the voice actors have risen huge complaints. Why Jensen Ackles is not in the show? What's wrong with the voice actors? And bla bla bla... Really, the voice actors were not that bad. They could have been better and having the original cast would be sweet but we should try being just a little objective. Also, the music and the sound effects created the mysterious-creepy atmosphere the series needs.What I found a bit disappointing were the characters. I can't be objective here because I know the potential of the characters. They are not as flat as the anime portrays them. They are more deep than that. Also, many characters and monsters had to be there. What about the guys from the Harvelle's Roadhouse and the shape-shifters? However, we cannot expect that much from a 22-episode series while the original is 10 seasons! If you are new to the supernatural world I think you will like them as they are. They are not some kind of heroes, they have flaws and make mistakes.If you like this kind of stuff -demons, vampires, werewolves, etc.- you will definitely like Supernatural. Even if you don't have a particular interest in those, I believe you will still enjoy it. It is a great anime and leave us, grumpy fans, complaint.

In the end of the animation, you can hear the song of Kansas- Carry on my wayward son, executed by an unknown and probably untalented artist.. he literally killed this wonderful song. I m a big fan of Supernatural and i think this animation serie is pointless.. It underestimates the tv serie Supernatural , and its horrible. Personally i will stick @ tv series Supernatural which i watch it for years... i reccomend you to do the same.. ', ""I quite enjoyed this anime adaptation of the Supernatural series. The series take place over the span of the first two seasons of the original show, including animated remakes of fan-favourite episodes as well as completely new episodes. There were some episodes, such as 'Moonlight' that I found didn't quite work as well, but this could be excused by the difference in episode length (the original series being 40 minute episodes compared with the animated 20 minute episodes).Jared was the voice of Sam for all 22 episodes of the series, however Jensen only voiced Dean in the final two episodes. Despite this, I found...the actor who voiced Dean for most of the English dub did a good job.The fact that the series was animated also allowed for the show to take some of the stories further. Some scenes packed in more extreme action, that the special effects of the live action series wouldn't have been able to achieve. The series could also make the creatures, such as the shapeshifter, look more disturbing.The style was very suited to the Supernatural vibe and atmosphere, and the animated Sam and Dean were accurate representations of their actor counterparts. However, other characters in the series looked very different from how they appeared in the live action series, such as Jessica who was blonde, but is a redhead in the animated series, as well as the brothers' mother who has long hair in the original series, but short hair in the animation. This, however, does not take from the overall enjoyment of the series. the actor who voiced Dean for most of the English dub did a good job.The fact that the series was animated also allowed for the show to take some of the stories further.

The Boogeyman does exist, there are things that go bump in the night, and yes, there probably was a monster living in your closet when you were a kid.  No worries though, for when the bumps in the night start to get a little louder (don\'t get out of the car you fool!), you\'ve got somebody watching your back to send the creatures of the night back to their holes in the ground.  Sam and Dean Winchester, brothers who...have faced it all: ghosts and vampires, werewolves and shapeshifters, witches and demons, even cannibalistic killers clowns (better watch you back IT).  Based on the (fairly) popular American television series, Supernatural: The Animation isn\'t the most exceptional anime out there, but it is a faithful adaptation and a solid addition to the genre of horror anime.Story:Traveling from town to town in their \'67 Chevy Impala, the brothers hunt what lives in the shadows while searching for their missing father and the yellow-eyed demon who killed their mother years before.  The anime takes plot points and even whole episodes from the television series\' first two seasons and arranges them into a 22 episode format.  While the story may be somewhat confusing at first for newer viewers, it does start to get stronger and more focused as the series goes on, eventually tying up the story where the second season of the TV series ends.  Anime-original episodes are also present and help to keep things fresh for older fans, even if they don\'t bring much new substance to the table.  Unfortunately, with half as many episodes as the seasons it is based off of, the anime is forced to lose or change around a lot of details, which, while not affecting a newer viewer\'s experience, may peeve fans of the show.  Overall however,  Supernatural: The Animation does a good job of getting it\'s foot in the door with newer viewers looking to see what the show is about, but for those looking for a richer experience in the world of Supernatural, I recommend watching the television series instead.Character:Our two main characters of course are Sam and Dean, who viewers follow throughout the entirety of the brothers\' hunt for both their father and the yellow-eyed demon.  Strong emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two and their development over the course of their journey.  Ultimately, although it may sound cliche\', the series ends up being less about killing monsters and the hunt for revenge, and more about how the bonds of family can get one through any sort of Hell they might face.  Side characters like Bobby, the boy\'s father, and of course the yellow-eyed demon also make the transition to 2-D, but don\'t get too much fleshing out.  Aside from that, characters are pretty much limited to one episode without much significance to the overall story.Art:Madhouse really delivers with this one.  The art style used with S:TA is unlike any other series I have seen, alternating between darker color palettes and bright, vibrant backgrounds with ease.  The animation is pretty clean and never really seems to drop off in quality.  Additionally, the character designs match the characters from the series well (although for some reason they decided to make Bobby look like a bloated frog) and have a certain feel of realism about them in spite of the fact that it is animated.  The creatures look just plain freaky and there is actually a surprising amount of well-done blood and gore in the series as well.Sound:While the anime unfortunately lacks the classic rock that really serves as the soul of the TV series, it does manage to snag the vocal talents of Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles who play Sam and Dean in the television series (the Japanese version also features the voice actors of Sam and Dean in the Japanese dub of Supernatural).  I watched the English dub and, while it certainly was by no means bad, it never really stood out either.  The best part of the sound section for this anime though is that the producers managed to snag Carry On Wayward Son, the series unofficial theme song, as the ending (Kansas haters will just have to deal with that).  In that aspect, it shows how big of fans the Japanese are of Supernatural, and for that much, I am thankful.Enjoyment:Despite having already seen the TV series, I still managed to enjoy the anime.  The change in format allowed for things not possible in a television series to come to life through art, and it also reminded me how much I loved the first two seasons of the series.In the end, despite the fact that my bias may be showing, Supernatural: The Animation gets an 7/10 from me.  Although it does lack the depth and length of the television series, older viewers still are met with a fairly fresh viewing experience while newer viewers can get a taste of what the television series is all about.  S:TA is a solid addition to the disappointingly small genre of horror anime, and in spite of not being perhaps ""jump in your seat"" scary, it does have some pulse-pounding moments and will please fans of well-done (not over-the-top) gore.Knowing that Sam and Dean are out there on the lookout, all I have left to say is this:""I ain\'t afraid of no ghosts!"" have faced it all: ghosts and vampires, werewolves and shapeshifters, witches and demons, even cannibalistic killers clowns (better watch you back IT).

I actually really liked it and I don't know how much of the show it actually covers but the animation is done really well and I was a little disappointed that there was only 22 episodes. I could easily watch the entirety of Supernatural in this format, I also watched it in the English Dub which I know at least Jared Padalecki voiced his character Sam. Although, if the series ever did continue I am well aware that having the original actors...for the character's voice them for the entirety of the anime would be unlikely as it would take up a lot of time so I'm glad that the episodes that were made were voiced by him. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I feel like it was still intense and enjoyable in this format.

I just finished Supernatural The Animation and felt like writing a review about it. It is from these kind of series that you can\'t say whether it is good or not from seeing only the first episode.STORY - 8 (Very Good)To begin with, I should say that the plot surprised me a little bit because I had heard about it from the original TV series and expected to see demons, monsters and bloody things everywhere (which does not bother me anyway). It was far better than this, though. But there is something...strange - if there are hell creatures (devils and demons), there should be some heavenly creatures to oppose them (gods and angels) or things like that.However, I really loved the other part of the plot. The two brothers who always tried to save each other no matter what. Their dad who pretended to be the tough guy or something. The stories of the people who had supernatural powers. I think each was unique and yet all had something in common. I really love this kind of plot: a character get to know other people who are in the same situation, have the same problems etc. That made me cry at times while watching the anime.ART - 8 (Very Good)To be honest, the art is not my type. And that was expected because this isn\'t exactly the Japanese\'s style but it is drawn well.Some scenes were really cold (though it may be normal for a horror) and kind of freezed (ahh.. I can not really describe it).But the bloody scenes can bit the crap out of you. Ever since I watched Another I got interested in horror anime because, you know, everything looks awesome and faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar more realistic than a feature film (though it sounds strange). So I loved that part! ^^Sound - 7,5 (Pretty Good) / 5,5 (Likeable)Uhmm.. I really couldn\'t believe they used Bethoven\'s ""Ode to Joy"" and in what scenes :D. That was one of the few things that made me laugh in these series. Anyway, if we are talking about the OSTs - they are not so bad it just lacks variety. By the way, I love the ending theme. Here - 5About the voice acting: I spend a month or two searching for Japanese dub and English sub (and that is why I stopped watching the anime for a while) because I really hate watching anime and hearing anything but Japanese language. Believe me, Japanese voice actors are the best (after Dante Basco... but that is another story). Here - 10 (if in Japanese dub) / 6 (in English)Character - 9 (Great)I think there is nothing special in the main chracters. Not only them did the Yellow-Eyed torment. On the other hand, it looks like these two brothers were to be the main chracters because of the tight bond between them. In these series I liked Dean the most. Also, I was happy that the anime did not turn on Sam and Dean only - eveybody had his story and the end of each character was different in its own way.Enjoyment - 10 (Outstanding)I really enjoyed this anime. It made me think about so many things. I even may give an eye to the TV series. It is no accident that the series are popular. Most of it is considered well. The relationship between Sam, Dean and their father really made me think over my life (huhhh.. I sound like a granny). I  liked that reality. It is great to have someone ready to do everything in order to keep you safe, isn’t it?Overall - 8,8 (Awesome)In conclusion, the best points of Supernatural The Animation are definitely the story full of unexpected situations and the bloody scenes. I was thrilled the most by the last episodes. Everything happens really fast then.This anime made me feel an otaku!

To anyone who loves dark fantasy/action/seinen anime but who’s nonetheless unfamiliar with the...live-action series, this anime series is right on his alley.◧ Probably the strongest aspect of the show was its character development, since the protagonists’ emotions, personal histories (both individual and joint), and thought processes were being shown clearly and consistently throughout the series.✘ Negative Aspects ✘◧ As far as the unfolding of the plot goes, this was a major bummer for me. I am not sure whether or not I was influenced by the live-action series, but throughout my viewing experience, I was feeling that the plot was being rushed somehow. Each episode seemed to be unfolding in an emotionally unexciting manner, that even though I had not re-watched the live-action series, and let alone the first 2 seasons, in 6 or 7 years. It somewhat picked up during the last 3 episodes, but even then the result was fairly muted.◧ On the sound department, there was not much to speak of, since I can barely recall anything besides Kansas’s ‘Cary on my Wayward Son’ in the ending scene.◧ The action scenes were pretty poorly done, in the sense of being executed within very few frames, escalating very quickly, and consequently, concluding very quickly, not allowing the viewer to take any pleasure in them.Overall: A very mediocre anime series that surely had excellent potential, an opinion which I am basing on the fact that this was produced when the live-action series was well into its 5th season but was adapted very poorly. live-action series, this anime series is right on his alley.◧ Probably the strongest aspect of the show was its character development, since the protagonists’ emotions, personal histories (both individual and joint), and thought processes were being shown clearly and consistently throughout the series.✘ Negative Aspects ✘◧ As far as the unfolding of the plot goes, this was a major bummer for me.

Wondering if you should watch it? Keep reading, I\'ll be sure to try and convince you!When trying to explain the story, it\'s tricky. ""It\'s a guy hunting monsters for food"" doesn\'t even come close. The best way to describe it is ""Monster Hunter without weapons, where they eat the monster afterwards!""This is so original. It\'s difficult to explain unless you watch it, so take it from me: every chapter is cooler than the last.The art here is amazing. The shading, colouring, action scenes and the...blood flowing: beautiful!The sound is good as well. There are three speaking roles, and all the voices sound believable. The music is good, it really fits the mood. Wether it\'s action, traveling or, naturally, eating.The characters are awesome. Especially Toriko. Everybody has their own part to play: not everybody can be strong and tough. Komatsu may come across as annoying at parts, but seeing as this is the first episode (here\'s hoping for more) you should give him time to develop.The enjoyment is very high. I can\'t explain it fully, but Toriko is amazing.

There are three speaking roles, and all the voices sound believable. The music is good, it really fits the mood. Wether it\'s action, traveling or, naturally, eating.The characters are awesome. Especially Toriko. Everybody has their own part to play: not everybody can be strong and tough.

The manga will begin here in the states this June and after reading the first three chapters through Shonen Jump Magazine, all I can say is that I'm really looking forward to reading more. Before the t.v. series begins, the pilot episode was shown at the Jump Super Anime Tour last Christmas and can be seen on youtube, and here's what I have to say about it.The plot is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga. The story of the pilot is about...a famous gourmet hunter named Toriko who has been hired by a timid head chef named Komatsu to obtain a creature known as a Garara Gator for an upcoming festival. Toriko accepts and he departs, with Komatsu coming along in an attempt to see how Toriko succeeds. As I said before this is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga so don't expect too much, but it atleast does a fine job setting up what to expect in the t.v. series. However I felt the manga did a better job explaining Toriko's mission than this pilot did.Once again, since this is on the first two chapters, so not many characters appear (though a few of the other main characters from the manga appear in the credits), so I'll just review the two main characters. Toriko as an excellent protagonist and is instantly likable from the start.  His carefree and courageous personality does make the character shine. Komatsu is your standard side kick character, but from what I've heard, he develops quite well throughout the course of the manga.The art and animation are pretty good. The coloring is great and the detail is excellent for a pilot.The voice acting, while little, is quite good. Takashi Kondo, who is best known for voices like Train from Black Cat and Faust from the Guilty Gear series suited Torko perfectly, and Daisuke Kishio also did an excellent job as Komatsu. Kenjiro Tsude (known for voices like Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh and Mifune from Soul Eater), who voices the boat man Tom also did a good performance despite what little dialogue he has. The music also captures the mood of each scene very well and the ending (which I can't find the name of) is jamming and very catchy.Overall I found the Toriko pilot to be quite good. It's an excellent way to get you interested in the series and it does a good job setting up for the upcoming t.v. series. Just make sure the video quality of your computer is good enough to see the fight scene. The Toriko pilot gets an 8 out of 10. a famous gourmet hunter named Toriko who has been hired by a timid head chef named Komatsu to obtain a creature known as a Garara Gator for an upcoming festival.

If you\'re already familiar with the concept of Toriko then there\'s no need to explain the premise as this review covers the differences in adaptations.The story basically covers chapter 1 & 2 of the Toriko manga which is the Garragator encounter & being the first ever animated work of the series. Key differences include the usage of blood & animation performed by UFO Table (Fate/Zero). Aside from changes in voice actors & music, this pilot is very similar to its manga...content.Pilots usually serve as a rough draft with what the anime should more or less be, however in this case there was no anime to come from it at least not within the following year. This pilot was made in 2009 & it wasn\'t until 2011 where Toei began to adapt the series. While the tone featured in the pilot was a lot closer to it\'s manga, many fans ask ""Why wasn\'t the anime done by UFO Table?"" or ""Why was the anime so watered down?""I can only speculate on these questions with no real evidence to back up my claims, however I believe there\'s a very simple answer as to why Toriko didn\'t get animated by UFO Table. For starters noticed how there\'s a gap in between the pilot & the anime debut being 3 years as opposed to other pilots such as Hunter X Hunter & One Piece who had animes within a year of their pilot debut. One of the reasons may have been UFO Table still being relatively small at the time but the more concrete answer would be the manga as I feel the pilot simply served as gateway into purchasing the graphic novels. The biggest reason why i believe in this, is the amount of content that the manga had. When the pilot debuted, the Toriko manga only had an estimated 50 chapters (till the end of the Regal Mammoth Arc), thus meaning not much would be adapted. If anything, Toriko may have been a 13 episode series or luckily 26 seeing how Toei covers those chapters within 17 episodes. Another guess is that no company was willing to take a risk into adapting a manga that\'s been published for a year. Seeing how it was 2009, most mangas didn\'t usually get immediate treatment as opposed to now in 2014.Overall, the pilot is okay feature where we see Toriko being gritty. Lastly,it\'s usually a common practice where animes aren\'t drawn by the same company who drew their pilots or contain various differences in the final product. Take HxH for example as the pilot was animated by Studio Pierrot while the anime is done Nippon Animation. content.Pilots usually serve as a rough draft with what the anime should more or less be, however in this case there was no anime to come from it at least not within the following year.

Satsuriku no Tenshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35994/Satsuriku_no_Tenshi,"['For over a decade now, the anime industry has been producing one series a season that deserves the highly appreciated title of ironic masterpiece. This time around it\'s a show about suicidal loli and a massmurderer who refuses to kill her. And it has everything. When I say everything, what I really mean is e v e r y t h i n g, and I have been laughing my butt sore since episode 1.Our story starts off in a spooky hospital where security cameras garnish the walls every 3 inches, doors close behind people\'s back like it is Ghost Hunt, and possessed typewriters...are the ones asking all the questions that matter since our characters don\'t even bother trying as they are too busy planning to kill themselves. It\'s bad? No, it\'s the peak of self-awareness.The actual events focus around some floor master shit fights because the entire series is based on a video game that was created with goddamn RPG Maker\'s free trial edition. Need a better prove of quality? That\'s what I thought. The entire story is real mysterious and apparently everything in it symbolizes some religious nonsense hence why all the 3 different English titles of the show have the word ""Angel"" in them. Essentially this is lot like Evangelion except fun to watch because the mc only has one mental illness and one of the characters has a pumpkin as a head.Our cast is beyond incredible. Rachel is surprisingly non-annoying for a 13 yo child who is in angst (even if her every 3rd line consist of the word ""kill"" and ""me""). Isaac Foster is the perfect representation of a generic horror psychopath from any horror game you play on easy and the murderer is an NPC. He also owns a cool scythe and I laugh similarly as he whenever he does anything. His laugh is real sick, reminds me of Orihara Izaya from Durararararara. +1 for seiyuu work. Daniel Dickens is the best character. I have had a blast using the phrase ""the plot Dickens"" when ever he does anything. MVP material right there.The art is also beyond incredible. Especially the tight and dark spaces really do add to the overall atmosphere. I mentioned Ghost Hunt earlier and that was favorite horror comedy before this one became a thing. The best arc from that anime takes place in a building highly similar to the architecture in which the entire story of Satsuriku no Tenshi takes part in except more floors this time around. Some of the floors really do offer that video game feeling where the series is its own thing and that manages to serve the immersion the work has to offer.To me, this Satsuriku no Tenshi offered genuine entertainment. Some of it can be seen to be silly, but I found all of that just add to the overall experience. For example, the dialogue and angst that is best shown in the repetition of the two lines ""kill me"" and ""no"" is nothing less than comedic gold, and such lousy cliches as memoryloss were taken exactly as seriouly with this series as they always should be dealt it. Meaning not seriously at all.J.C.Staff has been fixing their reputation their best since the Rie Kugumiya\'s loli tsundere era, and thus far, Satsuriku no Tenshi is yet another show from them that looks mediocre, but is everything but. Don\'t let the criticism ruin the fun as this is what entertainment truly means. are the ones asking all the questions that matter since our characters don\'t even bother trying as they are too busy planning to kill themselves.

Don\'t let the criticism ruin the fun as this is what entertainment truly means.', ""*I have only watched the anime, not the manga or game. Thus, this review will be based on the anime alone*After having completely finished the anime, I can safely say that Satsuriku no Tenshi is one of the most frustrating horror animes I’ve ever watched. From the very start of the show, there have been a myriad of flaws involving plot, dialogue, and character development, all resulting in a trainwreck of a show, which is really a shame because it had such an interesting premise.Plot (1/10): The plot to this anime is one of the worst I have ever seen and most of its issues...begin with it’s progression, or rather, the utter lack of it. Right from the beginning and up to halfway through the story, we can see this show following a typical formula: villian shows up -> zack does something stupid -> Rachel finds a solution -> more talking about killing and then not killing. The ‘mystery’ in the show is awfully boring, with the clues being vague and pretentious, constantly talking again and again about ‘sins’ and ‘god’ but adding nothing to the story. Actually that’s the perfect word to describe this shitty show. It’s vague. Really vague. It always felt like it wanted to impress the audience by being ‘intelligent’ so instead of slowly revealing things to the audience (like a good thriller should), it keeps on sprouting ambiguous and often nonsensical details. In my opinion, this show would do better if it was more straightforward so the viewer would get engrossed in the mystery and its progression.Another big problem I had with Angels of Death (and probably the most noticeable one) is its repetitive, boring, and edgy dialogue. Basically, it goes something like this:Rachel: I want to die. Can you kill me?Zack: Your expression is boring. I’ll kill you when we get outside.Rachel: Can you kill me?Zack: What the hell are you talking about? I said I don’t want to kill you.OMG. JUST KILL HER ALREADY!!(sorry that was me ranting) All of the dialogue in the story is basically 1) stuff that is really vague 2) stuff we already knew. It’s like it can’t even tell the intelligence of the audience. The whole thing feels like it's constantly going around in circles, with no meaning or wittiness. We KNOW Rachel wants to die. We KNOW the doc has a crazy eye fetish. Just tell us something important already!!Animation (7/10): For a J.C Staff show, the art is surprisingly pretty. It uses a nice color palette and Rachel’s character design was very attractive. Although Zack and the other villains character design do look somewhat generic, I’m willing to give this section a 7.Sound (5/10): This department is pretty subjective, but I felt the music in this show to be rather average. It’s not bad, but not very good either. I liked the voice actor for Rachel, but Zack’s voice was straight-up annoying and honestly, I felt like punching his stupid face everytime I hear that voice of his. The villains’ voices also felt extremely annoying, with their over-the-top laughter and eccentric attitudes.Character (2/10): Our female protagonist, Rachel, is the only one in the entire cast who didn’t manage to annoy me. That’s not to say she’s a good character though. In the entire anime she was bland and emotionless and lacked any type of character development. Overall, she’s the classic kuudere archetype but nothing to make her interesting. We learn nothing about her throughout the entire story, only that she wants to die. We don’t know why she wants to die, what was accountable for her 180 in the story, or even her backstory.The male protagonist Zack isn’t any better, if not worse. Loud, impulsive, and often temperamental, he’s basically your ‘all brawn no brain’ male archetype. He adds nothing to the story, is often very stupid, and is definitely one of the most annoying characters I’ve seen. Not to mention, his ‘tragic backstory’ is one I found to be very generic and a cheap way for viewers to pity him. Overall, it’s not enough to develop his character or make him into a more complex person. Nobody’s expecting an amazing and deep backstory like Kiritsugu’s or even Akashi’s but it’s like this show doesn’t even try.The villains were all badly made and were all ‘psychos’ with crazy laughs and no personality. They all want to kill the 2 mc’s but for no reason. They were also involved in some stupid plot twist which brought them back to life even though it was stated that they died.Enjoyment (5/10): I actually enjoyed some parts of the show but most of the time it just felt tedious and uninteresting. Unlike other bad thrillers like mirai nikki or kakegurui, this isn’t very entertaining and is not worth your time. begin with it’s progression, or rather, the utter lack of it.

However, this was one of the shows I enjoyed most during the Summer 2018 season, so I wanted to write a brief review on its behalf.A major contributing factor to these low scores is that people don’t know what to expect from this show. You wouldn’t know this from the...synopsis above, but Angels of Death isn’t really a horror series – it’s somewhere between a buddy comedy and an otome game, except that all of the suitors want to murder the lead rather than date her (Half of them do still want to date her though). It’s difficult to encapsulate the series in its entirety, but that absurdity is part of the fun.It might clear up some details if I talk about the source material that this anime is adapting. Although a manga exists, Angels of Death originally started as a freeware RPG Maker game. If you’ve ever played Yume Nikki or something like it (My personal favorite is Irisu Syndrome, which does have a free English translation), you know that these sorts of games can be surreal experiences, and this adaptation absolutely nails that tone while still poking fun at its genre conventions.  I haven’t played the game myself, but I’ve been told that the plot of the anime diverges, and I’m definitely interested enough to check it out.The strength of this series lays in the rapport established between its two leads, Rachel and Zack. The two are an odd couple, but they play off each other really well comically, and it was great to see their dynamic evolve over the course of the show. As they rise through the floors, they go from mutually using each other to actually caring about each other’s wellbeing, and this development is strangely endearing. There was one arc about halfway through the series in which the pair is separated, and those episodes felt empty, but they also made me realize how much I cared about their bond. Despite being a campy horror comedy, Angel of Death’s central relationship is a lot more developed than most anime romances, even if it is founded on murderous intent.Angels of Death definitely wasn’t the best show of the Summer 2018 season - its middle section dragged on, and it probably would have helped if it had been cut down to a standard 12 or 13 episodes – but there’s nothing else quite like it and I’m glad I watched it. There’s no other show where characters are as likely to get oddly sentimental about their blades as they are to conduct a trial that wouldn’t be out of place in the Ace Attorney franchise, and it was this emotional range that kept me coming back each week. If any of this mess sounds entertaining to you, then I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out. synopsis above, but Angels of Death isn’t really a horror series – it’s somewhere between a buddy comedy and an otome game, except that all of the suitors want to murder the lead rather than date her (Half of them do still want to date her though).

I already know the whole story and what to expect. To those who say the characters are two-dimensional... I can see why you'd think that. I disagree because there is a degree of character development that will become apparent if you stick around long enough. Know too that the story IS that predictable. However you think the story is going to turn out, you're probably going to be correct in at least one regarded aspect. Despite that, it's still fun. There's a certain level of early 2000's edginess in here. It's dark, bloody, gritty,...and full of psychotic laughter.Plot: A young girl named Rachel Gardner wakes up without any memories and finds herself trapped in a building with several floors. She meets the serial killer Isaac Foster who tries to kill her but fails. Later on Rachel no longer wishes to live and asks Isaac if he could kill her. He agrees to kill her as long as she helps him escape the building. So Isaac and Rachel has to try to “beat” all the different floors and find a way to escape.If you just simply love horror, this first episode was probably very entertaining and gave you hope for the series.But if you want dramatic horror with a good story and characters, this episode might have given you some doubts.For me it seemed very confusing at first, I had so many questions and it felt like the story wasn’t very well planned and was just supposed to be random and scary. However I was very wrong and I ended up liking the plot and the characters a lot more than I expected.But as I said, I was very confused in the beginning and had no hope for the story.Why are they trapped in a building? Who trapped them? Why does the girl want to die all of a sudden? Why do they have to beat these floors?Everything that seems confusing in the beginning is explained later and the plot is actually very interesting. It is not just a scary horror story. It is progressive and with time it gets more dramatic.Plus there’s a LOT of character development so I hope they keep it that way in the anime as well.Zack (Isaac Foster) the serial killer is not the average crazy aggressive killer who doesn’t care about anyone or anything. Well he is aggressive, crazy and very short tempered but he also becomes a very fun and interesting character which you’ll learn a lot about throughout the story. (He is my favourite character because of his character development)Ray (Rachel Gardner) was for me, a very confusing character since I didn’t know why she wanted to end her life so badly. But with time, she shows more of her personality and in the end you find out her story and why she desires death.The other characters has very unique personalities and what made me happy was that none of them felt unnecessary. It felt like each and every one of them were needed in some way for the story to be as good as it was.The ending was not disappointing and was actually one of my favourite endings of all the rpg maker horror games I’ve played. It left you satisfied and gave a lot of room for your own imagination as to what happens after the ending.So in conclusion: If you’re into dramatic psychological horror themes and want a good plot with interesting characters and a lot of character development, this should fit you very well.I hope this was helpful for anyone having doubts about watching this anime. I hope it turns out well! and full of psychotic laughter.Plot: A young girl named Rachel Gardner wakes up without any memories and finds herself trapped in a building with several floors.

It is progressive and with time it gets more dramatic.Plus there’s a LOT of character development so I hope they keep it that way in the anime as well.Zack (Isaac Foster) the serial killer is not the average crazy aggressive killer who doesn’t care about anyone or anything. Well he is aggressive, crazy and very short tempered but he also becomes a very fun and interesting character which you’ll learn a lot about throughout the story. (He is my favourite character because of his character development)Ray (Rachel Gardner) was for me, a very confusing character since I didn’t know why she wanted to end her life so badly. But with time, she shows more of her personality and in the end you find out her story and why she desires death.The other characters has very unique personalities and what made me happy was that none of them felt unnecessary. It felt like each and every one of them were needed in some way for the story to be as good as it was.The ending was not disappointing and was actually one of my favourite endings of all the rpg maker horror games I’ve played. It left you satisfied and gave a lot of room for your own imagination as to what happens after the ending.So in conclusion: If you’re into dramatic psychological horror themes and want a good plot with interesting characters and a lot of character development, this should fit you very well.I hope this was helpful for anyone having doubts about watching this anime. I hope it turns out well!"", ""Watching Satsuriku no Tensei (Angels of Death) gave me perhaps one of the strangest impressions of this year. Set in a mysterious building, we immediately meet main female protagonist Rachel Gardner as she is confused about her whereabouts. It doesn’t help that she has no memories except for her name. The show immediately drops viewers into this sort of storytelling out of nowhere and it’s hard to take everything in from the start. Make no mistake. Satsuriku no Tensei is one of those shows where I lost count how many times I rolled my eyes and asked myself just exactly what the hell is going...on.As the anime is based on a video game, it also does really feel much like playing one. Rachel meets a serial killer named Zack who nearly kills her in the beginning. The show begins to build on its suspenseful plot here onwards as we learn about both characters. An important element of the series is the psychological thriller style of storytelling. The plot can be rather confusing as it sells its ideas through the psychology of the show. With Rachel being in a confused state, she begins to wonder her purpose in the world.The main focus is Rachel and throughout the series, she wonders around the floors of this mysterious place with no memories. However, she isn’t too desperate to escape and seemingly has a death wish. She mentions many times throughout the show of her desire to be killed by Zack. In order to accomplish that, she hopes to survive long enough and not get killed by anyone else. The anime presents her personality as being a calm girl with a lack of understanding about morality. She finds it difficult to express human emotions and often says what’s on her mind. It’s also noticeable that Rachel believes in the existence of God. In one particular episode, she declared Zack as her “God”. A behavior like this is far from normal but the show emphasizes on her inhuman-like personality at every chance it gets. However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Her partner in crime Zack tunes abnormality up to the 11. Known by his full name as Issac “Zack” Foster, the series pushes the envelope to make him a serial killer. He has actually been involved in previous murder cases before and the show explores some of his past through flashbacks. If you’ve seen his personality, then Zack would definitely be someone you hope to never run into in some dark alleyway. For his personality, Zack is bluntly rude and often uses foul language. He isn’t very intelligent either and between the two, he is more of the muscle while Rachel has the brains. However, there’s no doubt that Zack is mentally unstable and has survivalist instincts. The cause of his mentality is not exactly known and this feels more like a flaw of the show. The creators wants the audience to basically accept Zack for who he is without really getting us to understand him. In essence, I see Zack as a monster despite his alliance with Rachel. He’s the type of guy that gets the thrill of killing without any true reason. However, Rachel does bring out some human-like emotions out of him when the duo are together. As odd as it seems, they are like two peas in a pod that are inseparable.The show features a variety of characters with Zack and Rachel finding that out the hard way as they navigate through various floors. It really does feel like a role playing RPG and the more I watched this series, the more I felt compelled to see what events await them. Unfortunately, I can’t really express satisfaction at the characters they encounter on their dark adventure. It seems the show tries to make its entire character as inhuman as possible. First, we got Daniel Dickens, an insane doctor who has an unhealthy obsession for Rachel’s eyes. Then, there’s Eddie, a boy who wears a mask and is in love with making graves. Cathy is introduced as a floor master and someone I’d describe as sadistic. She enjoys toying with others and inflict punishment for her own pleasure. Finally, there’s Gray, a religious priest who loves to pass judgement on others. His actions in the show should be condemned as sinful as he attempts to burn Rachel alive at a stake. It feels like the creator wanted the viewers to hate these characters as much as possible. And if that was the intention, it succeeded. These supporting characters also feel like video game bosses as they are the main obstacle for Rachel and Zack to overcome.So what now? Does Satsuriki no Tensei really work as an anime? Or does it fail like a half-polished video game filled with bugs that needs fixing? Honestly, I think it’s a bit of both for the main TV series. I mention this because there are still 4 episodes left to debut in home release format. With 12 episodes, the show is incomplete without a proper conclusion. I have not played the game before but there have been some games I’ve played that resembles this show. Games like The Evil Within reminds me of this series as it adheres to psychological horror and thriller. The downside is that I never did once get scared in this show because it’s hardly any scary. Instead, the more accurate representation is more of a psychological thriller. The anime explores the human psyche as we see how these characters behave in unusual circumstances.Adapted by J.C. Staff, you can easily tell that they were aiming for a dark and grimy setting. The uneasy feeling of the abandoned building and atmospheric feeling never leaves the show throughout the duration of its run. It paints the feeling of being trapped like a rat. Character designs in the series represent a creative style with our two main characters. First, there’s Rachel with her petite stature and blonde hair. She wears a stripped shirt with a white sweater complete with black boots. In many ways, she actually looks rather normal although her character expressions are often devoid of feelings. On the other hand, Zack has the look of a homicidal maniac. Compared to Rachel, he is much taller and wears a hoodie. His signature weapon is a scythe that almost represents him as a living reaper. His character expressions throughout the series is malicious and he is known to break out of insane laughter from time to time. The other characters in this series are decorated with abnormal traits such as Daniel’s freakish eyes, Eddie’s burlap mask, or Gray’s religious attire. The fact is, the creators definitely put their thought into making these characters distinctive as possible.As a psychological thriller, expect an eerie OST that’s often quiet to bring an unsettling mood. Indeed, the mood of the show is often eerie even during some of the action segments. There are many moments when the music really amps up to make viewers feel like as if they are with them. Similarly, the theme songs contain cryptic lyrics that ceases every moment to make the show as uncomfortable as possible. Finally, I have to give praise to the voice talent in this series. Characters like Rachel and Zack are able to bring their characters fully to life despite their complex personalities. It’s not easy to step into the shoes of an emotionless character like Rachel but I fully embraced her role if judging by her voice. Zack is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto who is well known for his role as Accelerator from the Index franchise. From this series, he displays his full talent to bring out Zack’s personality to a menacing degree.There’s a lot more to be said about Satsuriku no Tensei but for its TV airing, the show is more of a base game. I’d treat the reminding episode as DLC content to fully explore the story and give this anime a proper ending. Regardless, this show is not easily recommendable to anyone as the unusual style of storytelling will be difficult to get used to. It’s sometimes not faint for the heart either if you’re not comfortable with watching murder scenes. It almost feels like the creators are trying to get in our heads to see what we're thinking. I would say that giving this show is more suited for thrill seekers or those who watch this like playing a video game. on.As the anime is based on a video game, it also does really feel much like playing one.

But sadly, it just wasn\'t to be. Unlikable characters, predictable plot, lack of gore for something that\'s supposed to be scary, horrible dialogue and the worst jokes I\'ve ever seen in an anime all contribute towards making this piece of shit the piece of shit it is.These reasons all contribute towards my hate for this anime, but for me the most infuriating part about this...anime is how it treats it\'s viewers like retarded pieces of shit. WE DON\'T NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT RACHEL WANTS TO DIE! we knew that from the first episode, stop reminding us every 5 seconds. This is probably also the reason some people like it, since their brains can\'t really keep up with something more complicated than whatever a monkey with a typewriter can make.And now, we get a little more in depth with the anime (some spoilers i guess):Story:Pure shit. nothing more.The story itself is really simple, Rachel wakes up suffering from amnesia, she doesn\'t remember how she got there, and then suddenly encounters our great villain/secondary protagonist Zack. He chases her around for a bit, but once she regains her soulless eyes he suddenly doesn\'t want to kill her. Then our lovely characters go through an adventure through each floor, encountering other stereotypical villains on their way to escape. The dialogue during the 2nd episode was really bad, there was also a scene where Zack asks her why she doesn\'t kill herself and her reply is ""because god says it\'s bad""(god or religion will probably become really important later on, what a surprise). Then on the 3rd episode the murderous child offers to kill Rachel the soulless husk, but she denies because Zack swore to god that he\'ll kill her I guess?? Which makes me wonder, if she wants to die so much that she has withdrawal symptoms if she doesn\'t mention it every minute (during the 3rd episode she mentions or implies that she wants to die 8 fucking times), why didn\'t she take his offer?I basically skimmed through the 4th episode, so I can\'t really criticize anything.Art:Good. The best part about it.Sound:OK.I know some people find Zack\'s laugh annoying, but it doesn\'t really bother me and the voice acting is alright. If had any criticisms it would be the lack of atmospheric music. you sometimes need it.Characters:Absolute dog shit, we never have any reason behind any of the villains actions other than ""hurr durr I\'m evil"", Rachel is an unlikable soulless piece of shit and Zack is sorta alright I guess.Enjoyment:I only sorta enjoyed the first episode, the rest made my blood boil.Overall:It\'s shit, don\'t watch it. anime is how it treats it\'s viewers like retarded pieces of shit.

(is what I heard)Anyways beside that Angels of Death was really just okay. Doesn't really do anything special so it's just kinda average. Although I have my score as an 8 because really I did enjoy it.The show has revolves around Rachel and Zack trying to get out of this building they're in and leave. They start at the bottom floor and just work their way up battling floor masters along the way. Each floor master having their own...weird interest in Rachel which gets weird and annoying fast. Not the battle themselves I think the floor master battles are interesting for the most part but it's the over excessive importance and obsession with Rachel which just gets annoying but again another one of my personal problems with the show.I think if you're just looking for a fun, fighting, edgy, and crazy show to watch then this show may not be the best choice as they're way more better ones out their but this one is also good if you already seen the other type of shows like this.Overall honestly was fun I really only liked Zack and that dude with the peanut like mask but that's not to say the other characters were bad though.

And now, the arrival of the anime adaptation of both the game and the manga...and its overall quality couldn\'t be more justified than just following the narratives of the game, so much so that I went to play the game and it certainly holds that into regard.The story may just be your standard horror-adventure genre narration, but it has more substance than...that. We follow 13-year-old Rachel ""Ray"" Gardner in her quest as she was taken into a basement for a counselling from witnessing murder in the face, that she wasn\'t meant to be there in the first place, and now is looking for means to escape and find her parents. It is there that she meets Isaac ""Zack"" Foster, a grim-reaper-looking bandaged man who is as mad as a serialist mass-murderer with a scythe, and in the process, tries to escape Zack by escaping to Basement 5, but gets messed up with her counsellor Daniel ""Danny"" Dickens for trying to encapsulate her colourful eyes, before being slain by Zack, and now both labelled as violators of the ""escape game"" and together they make their way up, working their own solutions and helping one another to stay out of harm\'s way.So from the get-go, for people whom have either played the game or read the manga equivalent of the adaptation, I can say with certainty that you are definitely not disappointed with the exposition from the writing and pacing of the show. For anime-onlys however, this might be way too confusing to deal with at first, but the pacing progressively helps bring the core of the show along with it. It\'s tough but it\'s doable.Character-wise, Rachel and Isaac both are like horrors within themselves, with Rachel\'s constant wish for someone to kill her because of the nightmare that she went through, and now with the juxtaposition that her life has been one of dread and emotionless feels, so much so that she is displayed by her emotionless self, and Isaac being the M equivalent of a grim reaper feeling, that he cares for nothing but people\'s deaths upon his hands. And speaking of the VAs for both MCs, Rachel\'s VA might be a bit of an unknown (Haruga Chisuka, Akatsuki no Yona\'s Ki-ja, Owari no Seraph\'s Mikaela) but you sure as hell will know Isaac\'s VA (it\'s VERY obvious who he is but if you don\'t, it\'s HeroAca\'s Deku\'s buddy rival Bakugo), greatly love the emotions that both VAs bring towards their characters.Art-and-animation wise, of the J.C.Staff shows airing this season, this show has the best-looking and animation views of the surroundings, from the various floors of different expositions of the basement floor bosses personalities to the adventure-thriller-driven emotions of the characters. With that said, the quality unfortunately had to be cut out in certain spots (because it\'s public TV), but for the most part it holds and retains its source well.The music is one area where to me it is very divisive. For the most part, Massaki Endou\'s OP was somewhat strange because of the mostly-shounen feels (he has done YuGiOh and Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar), but I I don\'t see that being justifiable for me yet. On the other hand, I absolutely love and adore the ED by Rachel\'s VA, that it got me hooked and dropping tears with the game in mind, it evoked the right sense of foreboding and emotions that toy the feels, So overall, ED > OP.Overall, this is one of the good shows of the Summer season, and I know some people just couldn\'t be afforded with the copious amounts of horror-adventure that just feels laid down and such.

Heck, it\'s pilot even created a compelling storyline that I\'d hate to miss.Character: 7It sets the scene whereby the MC (I guess she\'s the MC) follows a progressive plot through, what I\'d refer to as levels -I say levels since her ""spawn point"" is a basement from which she must navigate to go up a floor.-This is affirmed by it\'s most recent episode.-Furthermore, it is a level because she has to escape what could potentially be her cause of death...But that\'s not what got me into it, rather -straight off the bar-...it had incorporated psychological elements that can only be further elaborated with each episode; this created the foundation for mental growth of the characters. But that\'s not all of what it would seem to be; whilst maintaining the theme of ""levels,"" it was quick to throw a wrench into the works and the dynamics of the anime had become growingly distorted -much of that distortion contributed to the already ambiguous storyline given... However this gave a sense of closure to the MCs story which made me think, ""seriously, you\'re gonna end it here!""I mean, it obviously didn\'t, but if they had allowed the protagonist to continue this devilish game allow for at least one and a half episodes would have more benefits to it than consequences; anyway, since it\'s only been three episode it\'s not done much harm either so... Meh.So, the reason why I rated the characters rather lowly in comparison to the other aspects of the anime is because they felt a bit lacklustre and fell flat in terms of depth... Due to its game-like progression, each character is given a specific role and does not display behaviour out of it\'s role; whilst I say this, there have been implications of dark secrets that each character carries -in my opinion, this is extremely suggestive of a more rounded character which we may learn of in future episodes.Story: 8So, for the story, it\'s built up quite nicely I would say; It gave us a good understanding of the story mechanics -or the mechanics that they want us to know (plot twists are fully welcome).Art: 9Art, I gotta hand it to JC, they know how to make it work and with this anime, no less. I\'ve not seen the source material so I\'ve nothing to compare it to, but considering other anime e.g. Shokugeki no souma etc. it seems to be fairly consistent.Sound: 8Keeping true to the psychological/thriller genre, the suspense music doesn\'t fail to deliver... It was captivating and had sucked me in; I had become wary of what was to come, and that had inevitably heightened my reactions, making me vulnerable to being startled.Moreover, we have bakugou\'s (Boku no hero academia) VA (okamoto nobuhiko) filling one of the characters positions, which to me, is a massive bonus as his voice has a tendency to act as a form of comic relief -and when considering the darker tropes this series seems to be adhering to, I feel that having such a voice actor will strike a balance to an anime akin to a seinen. But time will tell.Enjoyment: 8In conclusion, this anime had created an awesome opening guaranteed to pique the interest of further viewing for anyone that sits down to watch the beginning.Edit*I just found out that the source material is a game haha😂. An\' here I was goin\' on about levels... I guess Ima go play this game now (if possible😅).P.S.This review had been written during the pilot episode but is still relevant to all the aired episodes thus far. it had incorporated psychological elements that can only be further elaborated with each episode; this created the foundation for mental growth of the characters.

Due to its game-like progression, each character is given a specific role and does not display behaviour out of it\'s role; whilst I say this, there have been implications of dark secrets that each character carries -in my opinion, this is extremely suggestive of a more rounded character which we may learn of in future episodes.Story: 8So, for the story, it\'s built up quite nicely I would say; It gave us a good understanding of the story mechanics -or the mechanics that they want us to know (plot twists are fully welcome).Art: 9Art, I gotta hand it to JC, they know how to make it work and with this anime, no less. I\'ve not seen the source material so I\'ve nothing to compare it to, but considering other anime e.g. Shokugeki no souma etc. it seems to be fairly consistent.Sound: 8Keeping true to the psychological/thriller genre, the suspense music doesn\'t fail to deliver... It was captivating and had sucked me in; I had become wary of what was to come, and that had inevitably heightened my reactions, making me vulnerable to being startled.Moreover, we have bakugou\'s (Boku no hero academia) VA (okamoto nobuhiko) filling one of the characters positions, which to me, is a massive bonus as his voice has a tendency to act as a form of comic relief -and when considering the darker tropes this series seems to be adhering to, I feel that having such a voice actor will strike a balance to an anime akin to a seinen. But time will tell.Enjoyment: 8In conclusion, this anime had created an awesome opening guaranteed to pique the interest of further viewing for anyone that sits down to watch the beginning.Edit*I just found out that the source material is a game haha😂. An\' here I was goin\' on about levels... I guess Ima go play this game now (if possible😅).P.S.This review had been written during the pilot episode but is still relevant to all the aired episodes thus far.', 'Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.Satsuriku no Tenshi was a good animeIt\'s a good and honest adaptation of the game.Ok first, we gonna talk about the story (6):A young girl wakes up in a unknown basement and tries to escape it, the second floor\'s resident tries to kill her and she escapes from death. Finally, the murderer should ally with the protagonist, who wishes to die from him. They met other murderer and finally escapes the basement, with a lot of injuries. For...saving the protagonist\'s life and kill her later, the 2nd floor\'s murderer accept to go to jail. Satsuriku no Tenshi ends with a cliffhanger, the murderer escapes from his jail and kills the psychiatric doctor of the protagonist, they met and... Nothing. just a sentence, which is the name of the last episode ""Well stop crying and smile"".It\'s not really original, but i liked the idea of a giant and incognito basement and of the murderer who\'s too stupid to survive alone. Not original, but still cool. Some scenes aren\'t really pertinent in an anime, but we can easily see the prints of his video game inspiration.I was really disappointed by the final episode, and i was really angry afterview.Now, let\'s talk about the art (7):I liked how is designed Satsuriku no Tenshi. Well, yes, it has some bad points, but i liked the chara designs, i liked the backgrounds. It\'s only my mind, i don\'t think that you\'ll have the same.Third, the sounds (9):Oh god were can i begin.Vital (OP) is a good song, PraY (ED) too, and the OSTs gives us a lot of sensations. I really loved it, and i\'m really sad. Sad because i didn\'t find them on youtube or others plateforms.Now, the characters (7):Rachel Gardner (4) :She\'s an original kind of characters. Intelligent, unexpressive, i liked how she is. But we learn too late her past, and i think it\'s why i didn\'t really care about her.Isaac Foster (8):Well, i liked Zack. Is past with the old blind man was really touching, his conditions of murderer and honest guy make him a polyvalent character, and that\'s what\'s make him an excellent character.Eddie (3):He was just the little guy who loves Rachel and made a grave for her. His talent of furtivity in the darkness was kind of interesting, but that\'s all.Cathie (2):Just a sadistic character and that\'s all. She was stupid as hell.Danny (7):I didn\'t really know what to think about him, he\'s just crazy. But with his relation with Rachel, i tough he was pedophile. I don\'t know if he is, but he seems to be like that. From the last episodes, he had a good developement and that\'s why i give him 7.Gray (10):I know nothing about this priest, and that\'s why i love him. he\'s mysterious and isn\'t an enemy or an ally of Rachel. I\'m dissapointed about the fact that we don\'t know a thing about their relationship, but i have some hope for an OVA.And finally, my enjoyment (7)I liked the first episodes, but since the 9th, i started to be disappointed, even if i liked to see the evolution of the characters.Overall\'s personnal rate: 7Hope this review wasn\'t bad to read. saving the protagonist\'s life and kill her later, the 2nd floor\'s murderer accept to go to jail.

And also, it will get a lot better and those of you who're complaining about the lack of characterization... well, the amount of character development later on will overwhelm you to the point of suffocation.Story 7: The only reason I gave it a 7 is that the production team didn't include Eddie and Danny's backstory. If they did, I don't think so many people would be shitting on this anime at the moment. Also I feel that...the anime changed this part too much. Zack was supposed to be gritting his teeth refusing to scream out in the beginning but slowly losing his control the more electricity he went through. The way the anime made him scream the entire part starts to irritate me after a while. And certain parts are dragged out too much. Other than that, the anime's following the game/manga plotline perfectly. I'm truly excited to see certain scenes animated. This story is THE best love story I'd ever read. The character interaction later on in the plot actually brought a tear to my eyes. And if you think it's predictable now? Well, try and predict the later plot then. Pff.Art 8: Making a crappy RPG game character design into something this magnificent. How can you give it any less? Those who thinks Zack's design is stereotypical? He has his reasons. The only reason I didn't give it a ten was that I like the way Zack's face was drawn in the manga more than in the anime.Sound 8: Love the voice actors. Zack, Ray, Eddie, Cathy... suits them perfectly. Spot on. No complaints. BGM can't be more fitting.Character 7: It's a 7 cuz some character backstories are cut out, making them kind of bland (when theybreally aren't). Those who complains about shitty writing and lack of characterization for Ray? Keep watching. It'll prove you wrong. Ray is one of the deepest main character I've seen (partially because most of her characterization is related to religion and I'm an atheist so all those religion stuff she's saying is pretty confusing to me). And you'll understand later on why she wants to kill herself. Zack too isn't a one-dimensional psychopath wanting to kill. His story goes deeper than that.Enjoyment 8: the fact that I anticipate this anime more than my current number 1 fav My Hero Academia's update shows just how much I'm enjoying this series. Would enjoy it a lot more if it followed the manga down to a tee.Overall: 7 Cannot wait for the bang scene. And the bang bang bang in the end ;-) gamer you know what I'm talking about. the anime changed this part too much.

Thankfully, this nightmare (and not the scarey kind, ironically) isn't a person.The summary is a cookie cutout of a typical mystery archetype / story setting. The amnesiac in a strange place. Then there's the weird anime twists with a murder with a scythe who laughs like a popcorn machine with a fork in it. Anyways, nothing overtly special or any red flags in the summary. Except for maybe that stupid little bit about fate. Doubt fate locked you in a building. Moving on. Why it's bad.The mystery...as shown in the summary / template isn't anything inherently special. The story writer, the original author or whoever had most input in the anime clearly didn't do anything to improve on that lack of specialty. Nothing interesting or unpredictable happened. In fact it's was the exact opposite. Entirely predictable and boring. Something that kinda shouldn't happen in a mystery horror. The dialogue, events and motivations of characters are tragic. And not in the Romeo and Juliet sense. Mystery isn't an excuse for poor character building, and lack of background knowledge. The procedural, unchanging a repetitive events that last 2 - 4 episodes which only difference from the last arc is a new murderer on a new floor. The shoe horned, poorly thought out religious malformed mutations that embodies every stereotypical and unconvincing religious standpoint or assertion didn't help improve the series either. Lastly, the unsurprising, unoriginal and boring ending didn't improve upon any of the incredibly low bows this series set.Each floor's murder was uninteresting to say the least. Not ideal for a psychopathic killer in a building of psychopathic murderers. The only difference in their quality or interest to the main characters is due to their lack of presence in the overall story. Which ironically is a good thing. They were already glaringly hypocritical, illogical and or inconsistent. The lack of empathy, fear or genuine interest they inspired would only be compounded by a continued presence. If you switched the names, orders, faces, stories or anything you really want about them, it'd have essentially zero significant impact on the story. The only truly impactful side character is the priest, and his impact is just as rooted in illogical fallacy as are the actions and beliefs of Rachel, the moving doll who's only redeeming feature is she doesn't talk or make as much noise as Zack. The more I see of the dynamic duo of dipshits known as our main characters the more problems I have. Completely uninteresting, unoriginal, unchanging cookie cutter archetype side characters are better than completely uninteresting, unchanging, illogical and irritating main characters. Zack is irritating to say the least. He's exactly what'd you expect a teenager would imagine a teenage murderer to be. He, like all of the characters, is uninteresting and has little originality. Aside from his backstory, which is neither good nor exceptionally bad, he lacks depth and personality or change. It's like someone took Jason and animified him. Rachel on the other hand has literally had no personality. There was nothing interesting about her, her backstory or her actions. She's inconsistent and illogical. Wants to die, but suicide is wrong. Killing people? Eh whatever. Oh this psychopathic murderer will kill me if I help him? Perfect. No problems. This other psychopathic murderer will kill me? Nope. No good, the first one already promised god. Her fundamental perception and practice of religion is insulting even to me as a non believer, I can only imagine how irritating it'd be an actual respectable theologian, not that bad stereotype of a Messiah complex evil priest.I don't even need to say anything about the voice acting. Zack's voice and laughing makes me want to gouge out my ears with a pair of chopsticks. It's not intimidating or scary. If I heard that in the dark I wouldn't run for the hills. I'd tell the fucker to shut up and cut out his vocal cords if he tried to kill me with his gardening tools. Not exactly what a murderer's 'evil laugh' should inspire. Rachel's entire personality was nothing. Flat, emotionless and unchanging. Guess having no standards is one way to avoid criticism.I've seriously seen characters who don't talk AT ALL that have better voice acting than Rachel. High Score Girl's Oono is a perfect example. More emotion is conveyed in essentially coughs, grunts and literally no words than any and every word Rachel uttered. As for music. Everyone knows music is a key part of horror and suspense. Doesn't hurt mystery either. This anime lacked any suspense and the lack of good music certainly contributed to that lack of suspense. A pathetic and easy to avoid failure on this anime's part that would have greatly contributed to the overall story.It was entirely too hard for me to find any enjoyment in a story devoid of consistency or logic but with plenty of plot armor. Blood loss apparently doesn't exist in this world.The repetitive story, background and general events, lack of atmosphere and good music, and pathetic characters and character past & building. Then religion, an incredibly difficult topic to discuss seriously, being portrayed in such a laughable and contemptible manner compounded the irritating nature of the series and just stacked up on top of the other glaring issues of the series.This show is a fools idea of good mystery and a child's idea of a good horror anime. It's basically what you'd get if you asked for a fanfiction of Beauty and the Beast from a weaboo. There's not much to say. It's bad. I could go on and on, put in more effort, but this show is just so comically and unapologetically bad, I don't feel it deserves anymore effort. Unless you like everything from ebola to retardation in physical form, such as the Paul brothers, don't watch this. It's not worth the time, energy or brain cells. It's the worst show to air this season. Maybe even this year. The only happiness I got from this series is when I found out it was 12 episodes instead of 16. as shown in the summary / template isn't anything inherently special.

Other characters appear who are crazy or do not act at all normal with the aim of killing, or a peculiar definition of killing since everything revolves around death, these only serve as an obstacle, another reason to pay attention to those of the promise, that\'s their way of being within the psychological genre, with crazy people, good.Nobody can deny that ""promise"" of Rachel and Isaac is totally absurd, it makes sense until the part in which the two get what they want, but going back to the drastic change that arose in the protagonist, I thought that she was going to be the only thing that could be rescued from this anime, an exceptional principal but no, the best reaction he had was to become the lowest example of the Kuudere stereotype, only to be able to fit the context, perfect. So, up to this point the only moderately interesting thing to see is how the relationship between these two develops, I only want to know what excuse they are going to put so that in some way they empathize and end up all happy after so many misfits and whatever wait, although another less positive conclusion is equally possible but I always follow the basic prediction, I know it as the last resort; put romance because it always works to get attention.It seems that he tries with a doubtful effort to be what he is, an Anime of Horror, psychological, thriller, but I do not think he achieves it at all, it seems only an excuse to show blood and problems. The environment, the situation or the places are well worked although sometimes it has too much resemblance to the world of a videogame, with the armed scenarios and other things that can make it meaningless to be brought from the mechanics of a videogame.I never liked RPGs, most of those who have tried their game I guess they like this adaptation, but I think the correct thing is to see it as two different things and that none influence the other.I thought I would have more things to say about this, but the few things that this anime offered so far, added the disinterest and the little attention with which I saw the first five episodes left me saying obvious things and repeating ideas, I hope to see how continues this work, very unattractive, many stupid things that degrade the little that has quality, and a perfect opportunity to create fanarts of the alleged relationship and nothing, I just wanted to write about anime and just this had the wrapping.If you noticed a misspelling, a badly constructed sentence, or if the review seemed like trash, keep in mind that it was translated from Spanish to English with little grace, thanks for reading. situations with ridiculous backgrounds like the tests to which they are subjected, resources with Equally mediocre justifications, I have not seen works of this kind for a long time, so I can have sensations of amazement or who knows.The story is easy to follow because it shows what is just and necessary, and implies that there are things to explain at another time better known as narrative shortcuts, not because it is the beginning but much of what can be said about the story is in the premise, is based on a problem and knowing how to conclude this, by the characteristics the strong point should be inCharacters.Whether or not interesting, they are 100% junk, it starts with a girl, Rachel Gardner who is supposed to be a normal person in an abnormal situation and is confused, well, it seems logical, there is a pseudo-killer who ""tries"" kill her but it has a strange fetish with facial expressions or something I managed to understand and the disinterest in living that arises in Rachel makes them end up forming a duo with the plan to escape, well.

They could have just included the last episodes on a regular airing schedule, that splitting this up to a 2 part series.......But , enough of that, so what we have here were the last 4 episodes of the parent anime, and quite frankly, it...was good but not good enough when we see Danny the main antagonist  coming back to life after being killed by Zack in the 1st episode and other episodes that came with this ONA, in fact in the 1st episode of the parent anime he was SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!!!!!!! . I were the director and original creator of this series, I would have had 3 Danny's whom have the same level of mental insanity whom were just loitering around, as one danny get's killed another one takes his place or I could have had that Priest Abraham Gray be the next killer in the series that both Zack and Ray should have faced. Now storywise, the plot was simple as it is cu'z it simply involves 2 lesser killers whom were wanting to get outta the dungeon that was full of the most insane and over the top psycho killers that start with a mad doctor Danny, to a insane delinquent Mason Edwards  and last a crazy bitch Catherine Ward or at least on the 1st part of the anime . Cu'z it was just as crazy when the director Original creator and produces , decides to bring back Danny instead of making the 2 face off with the priest Abraham . What's crazy was how crazy did the original creator, Nazuka Kudan, conceptualize some shit like this of having Danny resurrected from the dead 3 times in a row . On the character category, was see Zack being this serial killer who was a combination of Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger , while Rachel Gardner was more like a damsel in distress that has a skeleton in her closet, but the turn off here was how the story plot rely on Danny in being this antagonist that keeps coming back and why they didn't utilize the priest to be the last antagonist. Well, anyways the anime has ended in a sour note when we're given an open ending that were left to use adudence  as how it ended, cu'z the scenario  as to what happened to Zack and Ray after they met again have a lotta holes and conflict, som how do I rate this??????Here's how:Story-Fair 6: Cu'z one part of me finds it good , but another part of me finds it annoying as to how this ended.Art-Mediocre 5: Since it was still connected to the parent anime.Sound- Mediocre 5:Since it was still connected to the parent anime.Character-Poor 3: I really hated as how how they keep on relying on Danny to be this ultimate antagonist , since he keep coming back from the dead, when HE's SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!!!!!!! And how Zack and Ray end came to an open and complicated ending.Enjoyment- poor 3: Cu'z for this to be 4 episode long was just too much of a waste of time, when  this could have been just 2 episodes short.Overall-Poor 3: Has a lotta complications and holes, original creator and director were a bunch of crazies and so as Studio JC Staff.BOOM!!!!!!! (Mic drop ) was good but not good enough when we see Danny the main antagonist  coming back to life after being killed by Zack in the 1st episode and other episodes that came with this ONA, in fact in the 1st episode of the parent anime he was SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!!!!!!! . I were the director and original creator of this series, I would have had 3 Danny's whom have the same level of mental insanity whom were just loitering around, as one danny get's killed another one takes his place or I could have had that Priest Abraham Gray be the next killer in the series that both Zack and Ray should have faced. Now storywise, the plot was simple as it is cu'z it simply involves 2 lesser killers whom were wanting to get outta the dungeon that was full of the most insane and over the top psycho killers that start with a mad doctor Danny, to a insane delinquent Mason Edwards  and last a crazy bitch Catherine Ward or at least on the 1st part of the anime . Cu'z it was just as crazy when the director Original creator and produces , decides to bring back Danny instead of making the 2 face off with the priest Abraham . What's crazy was how crazy did the original creator, Nazuka Kudan, conceptualize some shit like this of having Danny resurrected from the dead 3 times in a row .

(Mic drop )"", 'Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.Please note, this includes the series and the ONA.This horror anime month has been pretty middling in terms of the series we\'ve looked at. We\'ve seen some decent anime and some sub-par anime. We haven\'t seen anything great but we haven\'t seen anything terrible either. Maybe we\'ll be able to break up that pattern with a look at Satsuriko no Tenshi, an anime based off of a horror game. Now, your first thought when I mention anime based off of...a horror game might be my history with trite rubbish like Galerians or Corpse Party. But at least those two were entertaining in their incompetence. And we have reviewed some good anime based off of games. Maybe this will be one of those.Story:We open with our heroine, young Rachel Gardner, waking in a strange place where she\'s chosen as a sacrifice. She quickly discovers that she\'s going to have to go up through several floors of serial killers to escape the complex. Wanting to die, she approaches one, Isaac Foster, who agrees to kill her after she helps him escape.There are two fatal flaws with this narrative. The first is that the story makes very little sense when you think about it to even the slightest degree. First of all, how did the dude who set all this up find all these serial killers and how did he get them to actually agree to all live in this system and work together? Serial killers all have their own shtick. They have certain things they look for in their victims, specific ways they want to murder said victims and they generally don\'t work well together. How did he persuade them all to work together with rules about who gets what floor? How does he find ""sacrifices"" who work for all of them? And how did he manage to build this vast complex to house all these killers with no one noticing? This premise is objectively stupid.But let\'s put that aside for a moment. Let\'s pretend that either our brains don\'t quite work properly or we\'re really willing to stretch suspension of disbelief and let\'s talk about the second fatal flaw. Mainly, there\'s no possible tension to this scenario. One of our protagonists is openly and unapologetically a mass murderer with no redeeming qualities. There is no compelling reason for us to give the remotest shit what happens to him. Our other protagonist wants to die. You\'d think that would be easy in a complex full of serial killers, but she decides it has to be this one guy who does it for very insipid reasons. There\'s no reason for us to care about her survival because she doesn\'t even care about her own survival. Therefore, any dangerous scenario they find themselves in doesn\'t matter.And it is pretty stupid that she\'s in a complex of murderers and can\'t figure out how to get herself killed. That would be like going to a university frat party and not being able to figure out how to get laid.Characters:The characters in this do not help. Isaac is obnoxiously stupid. Rachel is an insipid nothing character. And the killers they encounter on each floor are just a bunch of stereotypes out off old, cheesy slasher films. Roger Corman\'s horror films had more menacing adversaries than these morons. It doesn\'t help that the interactions among the characters are really dumb.Art:There are moments where you can see how a floor\'s design might be a bit creepy, if the execution was very different. That\'s about the most positive thing I can say for the artwork. The character designs are pretty stupid looking. Isaac wears bandages all across his face, including over his mouth, but he somehow left enough of a hole that he can talk and open his mouth in spite of the bandages being clearly placed on his lips.The action sequences aren\'t very good either. They\'re a bit slow-paced and dull.Sound:The acting is not as bad as every other element in the series would lead you to believe. You can tell that Okamoto Nobuhiko, Sakurai Takahiro and some others have skill. The problem is that their performances in this range from stilted to not giving a shit. The music is fairly mediocre.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any in this series. The character dynamics are too boring to have romantic tension of any kind, really.Areas of Improvement:Have one serial killer who puts their victims at the bottom of a trap-riddled complex as their thing. If there was one mastermind and you barely saw them, it would have a much stronger, actually creepy atmosphere. As opposed to a bunch of one note idiots on different floors.Have a protagonist who has a personality and wants to live. It\'s much easier to care about a character with a personality and be invested when they themselves care. Honestly, I\'d have ten characters at the start and show them all going through the floors individually. IE, starting with the first floor and then showing the people who survive that going through the next and so on. The audience would always be curious as to which characters would make it through a particular floor.Have strong character designs. The characters in this are basically built around taking some horror monster/ slasher like a mummy, scarecrow, mad scientist, warden or priest and making them look really stupid. You would do better just having the antagonist be a somewhat sketchy looking person.Final Thoughts:Satsuriku no Tenshi\xa0is pretty awful. And not in an entertaining way like Corpse Party or Galerians. The narrative has massive holes. The characters are rubbish. The designs are stupid looking. It\'s just genuinely terrible. I\'m giving it a 2/10. a horror game might be my history with trite rubbish like Galerians or Corpse Party. But at least those two were entertaining in their incompetence.

I don\'t throw the word ""cringe"" often, but I couldn\'t even watch some parts without skipping through. It takes itself too seriously, all the ""horror"" and ""drama"" are rendered useless because of the stupidity of the rest of the anime.The animation is cheap, they were obviously cutting corners where they could.Music and sound is just ""generic anime sound/music"". Voice acting was pretty poor too, often not syncronised with the characters.The characters were downright boring. Emotionless mc and an obnoxious sidekick. Very original. The creators of the original indie game obviously were into creepypasta. Nice...""original character"". None of the villains stood out either, painfully generic to the T (mad scientist, sadistic pretty lady... really?). Maybe they were supposed to be generic on purpose, but I can\'t make myself watch more of this without heavy drinking.Overall, just don\'t bother. Just go watch a playthrough of the original indie game. At least then you can get some dubious enjoyment from knowing that the let\'s player is suffering alongside with you. ""original character"".

Angels of Death started off strong, and then just went downhill from there. The show gets edgier by the episode, to the point of being unbearable. The plot moves at an incredibly slow pace. Nothing seems to ever happen. Elevator scenes take minutes, and the main characters spend a good chunk of the episode time just repeating the same things over and over. The show attempts to create a compelling mystery, but fails miserably and ends up giving birth to a bloody mess. And just so you know, a certain character in this show has limitless amounts of blood stored in them....Highly disappointing.The only good part of the show is the ED.

Don\'t just SCREAM OUT A CHARACTERS ENTIRE ARC, BACKSTORY, AND PERSONALITY IN ONE EPISODE; IN ONE SCENE. Film is nothing more than an interesting way to convey information. Thats IT!!!! The rest is just extra stuff on the salad. If you need fried chicken strips to enjoy...your salad...well then eat a fricken chicken sandwich. Thats all this anime IS!!!! Bacon, and chicken strips sprinkled on it.

The development of rachel and zacks relationship is really well done. The set-up and story are unlike anything i have seen and it only gets more and more unique as it progresses. This anime has exagerrated violence (in certain scenes) but for the most part it keeps it realistic. This anime doesnt follow the typical tropes that would be expected. I truly think this is a criminally underrated show that more people should watch. At points this anime can get quite complex but personally i didnt find it confusing and understood the story...well. 10/10 would recommend to anybodybody who likes dark shows and horror themes. well. 10/10 would recommend to anybodybody who likes dark shows and horror themes.', ""Horror is a sparsely populated genre of anime, which is a shame. A good horror series can offer creative concepts, a gripping story, compelling drama and moments of high emotion. Unfortunately, Angels of Death offers none of these things. Instead, this anime presents a mind-numbing barely-plot featuring a cast of characters the audience never properly gets to know and that not even the series itself seems to care about, thinly varnished with superficial allusions to Christianity. This is a series that wants be perceived as cool and meaningful and perhaps even deep, but which puts in none of the required effort to actually be so.Angels...of Death is a series based on an RPG Maker game and it shows. The bulk of the anime consists of the lead characters, Rachel and Zack, ponderously navigating a nondescript murder house while being assailed by a procession of one-note psychopathic killers. While this premise naturally raises questions about the building's purpose or how the characters are connected, Angels of Death is content to brush those inquiries to one side for the majority of it's runtime, only begrudgingly sparing a sentence or two in its last act to deliver an unsatisfying barely-answer. Instead, the audience is subjected to episode after episode of two boring characters wandering around in a stark and utilitarian environment, interacting with the requisite puzzle elements found on each floor. This makes the show feel like a glorified walkthrough rather than anything worth watching.Speaking of the characters, Angels of Death has a very weak cast, with each member coming across as a human-shaped vessel for a collection of disconnected traits that fail to amount a coherent personality. From the first episode onward, Rachel is unemotive and vaguely defined as religious, while Zack is simple, temperamental and prone to violence. Neither are particularly inquisitive, most of their dialogue consisting of observations on and reactions to whatever situation they've been placed in, leaving very little time for character development outside of the few scattered intervals in which some tepid backstory is delivered via flashback, brining the story's events to an abrupt halt. Needless to say, this utter lack of character makes it extremely difficult to get invested in the lead characters, even ignoring the fact that Rachel's main goal in leaving the building is to be killed, meaning there's little point in rooting for her to survive. The show's antagonists are no less flat, each having one gimmick a piece. Danny is obsessed with eyes, Eddie is a possessive stalker that digs graves, Cathy is a sadistic prison warden and Reverend Gray is a judgemental priest that tests people.While Angels of Death is listed as a horror anime, a label that the gloomy art style and decently atmospheric soundtrack make a token effort to earn, in truth, the series' horror themes are only skin deep. With its motley character design, superficial religious imagery and semi-frequent indulgences in action, it's not hard to tell that the anime is trying harder to be cool than it is to be scary. One can always tell when the leads are or aren't in danger, undermining any potential for tension, and the series' attempts at dark imagery are few, brief and unimpressive. What little ambition Angels of Death has manifests in attempts to build ambiguity (it would be too generous to call it mystery) about the history and mental state of the protagonist, Rachel. Alas, even if the show gave this plot point the focus it deserved, it would still culminate in a series of unimpressive and sometimes laughably predictable twists that only undermine the viewer's investment further while saying nothing meaningful. In general, the show has very little to say, existing seemingly for its own sake while using its imagery as set dressing that contributes nothing to the story.To conclude, Angels of Death is an anime that fails at just about everything it tries. Its on-screen action is dull and tedious, its attempts at horror are non-existent, its story is a pointless slog, its characters are cardboard cut-outs and its imagery is piss-puddle shallow. At the time of writing, I genuinely cannot think of another anime that has bored me this much and I can think of no reason for a person to subject themselves to this series.

A promise between a pure murderer and a mysterious girl and their journey together, mixed with some self-discovery.I first took notice of this series in the Summer 2018 lineup. The synopsis intrigued me so much, I read the manga and watched a complete playthrough of the game. The anime adaption, so far, is faithful to the source. It draws primarily from the manga but the released episodes have taught me they’re ready to adapt little things to fit a big screen.Episode 1 was fast-paced and edgy while later episodes settle into a more relaxed...atmosphere. Our main characters reveal their true colours-- Zack is a goofy madman, while Rachel does a 180 and becomes a monotonous doll. The reason for her mood change was confusing (basically Rachel remembered something) so I felt the anime should have made it clearer. To be fair, it was never fully explained in the game nor in the manga, and it is difficult to explain without spoiling. One thing I noticed is that they skipped backstories for some characters (shame) but if it was a necessary sacrifice to adapt everything.I love the light sprinkling of humour. Some may find it off putting but it adds to the interesting relationship between Rachel and Zack. Some also find the constant repeating of ‘kill me’ and ‘swear to god’ annoying but trust me, it eases off over time and the characters (namely Zack) does comment on it.JC Staff did a good job on the anime because I really dig the aesthetics of the show. I also like the use of effects; it gives a polished, modern look. (wish they toned down the yellow filter/glow thing…) Character designs stay consistent and faithful to the original ones and did I mention how much I love their eyes? Eyes (‘peepers’ lol) were prominent in the original game: the heterochromia of both Zack and Danny, the light in Rachel’s eyes and the piercing blue of her eyes.I have no problem with the OP and ED. Opening ‘Vital’ is sung by Endoh Masaaki and written by Jin. Ending ‘Pray’ is sung by Chisuga Haruka (VA of Rachel) and written by DECO*27. Both are sung by accomplished singers and written by popular vocaloid producers (HYPE). I don’t know how to judge music but to my ears, both themes fit the anime well! The visuals are also impressive. I love the nod to the original chara designs at the beginning and the signboard holding at the end of the OP; whereas in the ED I love the footprints and the English words that correspond to the lyrics.Personally, I did not find the game particularly gripping or life-changing. It’s really not as amazing as people make it out to be >< Nonetheless, it is a breath of fresh air from recent anime. If the anime keeps the original spirit of the source, adapts parts of the game to better suit a anime and makes full use of its medium, it could well be considered anime of the season(barring certain popular sequels…)Please note that horror and puzzle-solving will not play a big part! I’ve seen many people classify it as a horror anime but the horror in here is tame. Be prepared to be disappointed if you were expecting a groundbreaking psychological thriller. To me, the main selling point of this series was that it was short and satisfying, with the right amount of edginess and completeness. There are way too many light novel/manga adaptations nowadays that adapt one tiny bit source leaving many loose ends but Angels of Death is sourced from a game, which means you can experience the whole story in one perfect 16-ep package.Should you watch Satsuriku no Tenshi? Yes, but I recommend playing the game/watching a walkthrough of the game first. (If you want to experience both game and manga, do game first. The quality of art between the two is astounding. Not that game art is bad. It's endearing. But I digress.) Satsuriku no Tenshi is a series that benefits from rewatching as it creates a better experience and clears up many confusions. So give Satsuriku no Tenshi a chance because ultimately it is worth watching♡ atmosphere. Our main characters reveal their true colours-- Zack is a goofy madman, while Rachel does a 180 and becomes a monotonous doll. The reason for her mood change was confusing (basically Rachel remembered something) so I felt the anime should have made it clearer. To be fair, it was never fully explained in the game nor in the manga, and it is difficult to explain without spoiling.

Also sorry for my crappy englishBut this anime was a very big disappointment for me. I expected so much more but it ended up being an edgy ""humorous"" mess I can only imagine 13 year olds can enjoy.So lets start of with our main character rachel gardner who just loves to remind the audience that she really wants to die BUT it can only be done by isaac becouse ""he swore it to god"" or some crap like that. This gets annoying very fast and I just couldnt help but think ""yeah...I get it now, you want to die"" every time she said how much she wanted to die, also the reason why it must be done by isaac is complete bull crap and is only there for convenience so the anime can exist for more than 3 episodes. Maybe there is a deeper reason for all this but I just cant bring my self to watch any more of this disaster of an anime. Also, what is up with the tone of this anime. It tries to be a horror anime but at the same time it tries to throw in ""funny"" jokes in moments that would other wise be quite intense. The animation is decent I guess it doesnt really have anything special or note worthy, except for the thousands of cgi doors that look really out of place and weird.The good things I can say about this anime is that its op and ending are pretty nice and the first episode also was pretty great.I know I probably should finish the anime and see if it gets better but I just cant bring my self to watch this mess of an anime any longer, and trust me I wanted to love this anime, I mean just look at isaacs design and the premise looked pretty neat. But it just fails so hard and I just cant help but feel disappointed about this anime. I qould give this anime an 4/10 becouse it does have some nice things in it but the bad just really outshines the good in this anime I get it now, you want to die"" every time she said how much she wanted to die, also the reason why it must be done by isaac is complete bull crap and is only there for convenience so the anime can exist for more than 3 episodes.

I qould give this anime an 4/10 becouse it does have some nice things in it but the bad just really outshines the good in this anime', 'Watching ""Angels of Death"" was quite a tumultuous journey, and I don\'t mean emotionally. Now, I won\'t go into massive detail about the plot, since the synopsis is right on the page; it would be redundant of me to make you read it twice. However, I will discuss the things I liked and the things I disliked about this anime.First, the things I disliked. For starters, the animation in the opening wasn\'t as fluid as I\'m used to. It was kind of snappy and abrupt, rather than flowy and smooth. However, I did get used to this rather quickly. Another thing that I didn\'t...like too much was the constant talk about God. Now, I am a Christian, so I do believe in God; however, I don\'t get offended when people don\'t believe. For me, the constant talk about ""be my God"" and ""there is no God"" and ""you swore to God"" just seemed...unnecessary to the story. Like, I realize why it was there, but it just came off as pseudo-deep. I rolled my eyes quite a few times, especially when it was talked about continuously throughout an episode. I also didn\'t like Rachel\'s character too much at first. I found her annoying. It got better, though. Finally, I won\'t give spoilers since it\'s a relatively new show, but the ending left me pretty disappointed.Now, on to the things I liked. For one thing, I really enjoyed the mystery surrounding Rachel\'s past. I was pretty satisfied with it when it was revealed. This goes for Zack\'s past, too, though his backstory was more emotional for me. This leads to my next point: the characters. Though not all of them were my favorite, there were two shining stars for me: Zack and Eddie. Zack was easily my favorite part of the anime. He was funny, cool, brash, and protective. He had a tough exterior, but like Rachel said near the end, ""He\'s not a monster. He\'s a human."" A human with a heart of gold, if you ask me. He was also pretty sexy, so that helped out a lot. Eddie, despite being a psychopath, was just really adorable and likable. I actually felt bad for him, despite how murderous he was. I also grew to like Rachel near the end, which is a good thing. Another thing I liked was the relationship between Rachel and Zack. Though initially involved in a Predator-Prey dynamic, their relationship evolved into something morbidly sweeter than that. I\'m not ashamed to admit that I cried during their exchange in Episode 15. The OP and the ED were both excellent, though the ED takes the cake for me. It was beautifully sung by the woman who voiced Rachel in the Sub. Rachel\'s theme was also very beautiful. The artwork was really nice, and the animation was actually pretty fluid in the show, unlike in the OP. Finally, I really enjoyed the character development that took place in Rachel and Zack.Overall, this anime was a rather frustrating watch for me. Though it was good, it waited until Zack\'s backstory episode and the second-to-last episode to really show some emotion. When it did, I loved it; other than that, it was just pretty good. The pretentious talk about God really brought the show down for me until Zack and Rachel had a heart-to-heart about it. Rachel was so annoying sometimes that I nearly quit watching. However, despite all of this, the good outweighs the bad. The mystery was fun, some of the characters were great, the character development was refreshing, the music was beautiful, and the relationship between the two main characters was great to witness. So, with all of this in mind, I had fun with this one, and I do recommend it if you can be patient with it. I\'m sure you\'ll find some enjoyment in it.Final Verdict: 7/10 like too much was the constant talk about God. Now, I am a Christian, so I do believe in God; however, I don\'t get offended when people don\'t believe. For me, the constant talk about ""be my God"" and ""there is no God"" and ""you swore to God"" just seemed...unnecessary to the story.

Kill me.""""Help me get outta here, and I\'ll kill you.""This is most certainly an underrated anime.Angels of Death is about a young girl named Rachel Gardener who finds herself lost in a building full of dangerous serial killers and meets Isaac Foster, a killer who wishes to leave the building but cannot find the way out. Upon learning of her parents death, Rachel wishes to die. Isaac Foster promises to kill her if she helps him flee the facility. The duo must visit every floor in the building and get past the serial killers on each floor.The anime is exciting and pretty...unpredictable. There aren\'t too many characters, which I believe is good for such a short anime. Fewer is better. No need for unnecessary characters. I hope they make another season... The ending had me a bit confused.Overall, a very good show! I recommend! unpredictable. There aren\'t too many characters, which I believe is good for such a short anime. Fewer is better. No need for unnecessary characters. I hope they make another season... The ending had me a bit confused.Overall, a very good show! I recommend!', 'You might think an anime that takes place in an orderly and contained environment that demands very simple and clear story goals with literally 6 characters and 16 full-length episodes to develop at least the main 2 protagonists would be pretty good or at least damn focused, but unfortunately you would be mistaken!I like the concept of an anime based on a RPG maker horror game with distinct levels that represent character struggles, because I like the limitations of a story like that. But despite a good set up that I thought was rife with opportunity to explore characters via personalized settings and challenges, Angels...of Death failed to be a compelling narrative, because the characters we explored were… well. Really only Zack and Rachel received narrative attention and they were bafflingly uninteresting and unrelatable, and the small cast of secondary characters who were opposing them were walking cliches that left no impact whatsoever and just weren’t explored, period.Far too much of the dialogue was repetition and reaffirmation of the narrative linchpin that doesn’t make sense (so we gotta reiterate it constantly so please just suspend your disbelief) – “You promised you would kill me when I get us out of this dungeon right? You’re definitely going to kill me? I can’t let you die because I need you to kill me.” “Yeah, heard you the first time, I’m definitely going to kill you, so be useful or I won’t kill you!”And so all of the characters talked a lot, but no one really said anything, and nothing tangibly changed in our protagonists. Rachel herself says when her character arc ended and she got over her hangup about God and being forgiven by Him: “It’s not as if I myself have really changed. I’ve just accepted who I am. And I don’t wish to be forgiven anymore - no one would forgive me. That is why I still want to die.” But she still has a hangup about her and Zack’s promise in general, it just has no relationship to God anymore, and she is still walking towards the exact same goal… her reasons why have shifted slightly to the left, but nothing drastically changed.As for Zack’s “development”… I don’t think he did develop so much as we just learned more things about his past overtime, all of which did nothing to make him remotely sympathetic or even particularly complex. Without spoiling much, near the finale Zack says: “What is the point of leaving here without Rachel?!” and that surprised me for about 2 seconds, because I thought Oh, he realized he cares about her? Had his dynamic with her had become more important to him than his ultimate goal of leaving this place? But then I realized the more likely answer is that he caught her Promise Hangup Disease and was panicking about not fulfilling his promise to kill her after 15 episodes of talking about said promise constantly all of the time literally every episode it was honestly 80% of what they talked about SERIOUSLY WE GET IT. So I don’t think we ever really moved from square one with him, either.So even if the characters may have SLIGHTLY changed how they think about the dumb linchpin of the story, they act on it in the same as they would have without having been challenged at all. So it comes off as pretty dissatisfying, because I was expecting that a story as character driven as this would have very dynamic protagonists, but alas…(It also goes without saying that a big reason I was never particularly committed to these characters in the first place was because the idea of a suicidal 13 year old girl having a deeply messed up relationship with an adult serial killer that hinges on their mutual promise of him definitely killing her later isn’t terribly appealing to me.)Basically: I can forgive the creepypasta-esque ridiculousness of this story, I can realize the characters look like they were conceived in a design contest on deviantart in 2009 and accept that, I can listen to Zack’s grating maniacal laughter layered over a rock music montage and Danny pronounce the name Rachel with 54894 extra syllables approximately 83478 times – but I can’t forgive having watched 16 full length episodes of an anime that is focused on just 2 characters, wherein they are never challenged quite enough to actually budge from the (completely irrational) beliefs they held from the start.5/10 for having clean, consistent artwork, decent animation and direction, some great tracks on the ost, and not being a particular chore of an anime to get through and Thank God Having No Romance Elements That I Could Parse – but ultimately feeling like a waste of time and potential. of Death failed to be a compelling narrative, because the characters we explored were… well.

It sets up the mood and suspence. The opening has a creepy aspect.The art is great because it fits the personality of the characters. From the looks you know what to expect from them.The characters are the best part of this anime because they seem real.Rachel is a smart child that is looking for her parents and is scared, she wants home up until the point she finds out that her parents are dead, then she starts wanting to die but cant...commit suicide because god forbids this kind of actions.Zack could be normal but he never ever was cared for. He was abused, alone, never loved. And he acts accordingly to this, meaning hating the happiness of others and killing them.The story is great IF you care to understand how the characters are developing and evolving from the episode 1 to 8-9 and so on.It is not some mindless story with violence and spookie action, it follows zack and rachel's relationship and it is well made.Overall is a great show and it surely deserves a 10 star rating. commit suicide because god forbids this kind of actions.Zack could be normal but he never ever was cared for.

Usually, the main character is supposed to overwhelm the show with emotion and relatable feelings (Kaneki, Goku, Luffy, Midoriya, etc), but in AoD, that\'s Zack\'s job.An unfeeling, emotion-lacking main character and a serial killer that refuses to kill people who aren\'t afraid of him, working together solving puzzles and defeating other serial killers to escape from a mysterious building.It\'s thrilling, it\'s creative...and most importantly:Zack best boy and most importantly:Zack best boy', 'Mod Edit: This review was originally written for the final 4 episodes which was previously a separate entry and was subsequently merged into Satsuriku no Tenshi.To the many negative, pessimistic and adverse comments that have described the portrayal of this anime, I would like to say I very much enjoyed Satsuriku no Tenshi and I would rewatch it again. I do agree that the story doesn\'t make much sense a lot of the times, Rachel as a character is one very dull girl to watch and all the other characters don\'t make much of an effort on sticking out. Yeah sounds like dog shit of...an anime already... BUT I very much loved watching it.What I loved about this anime is the development of Zack and Rachel\'s relationship from start to finish is how it provided me any sign of being keen each week.Anyone who has watched atleast the first 12 episodes can agree that this isn\'t the greatest constructed plot and can comment that it is ""shit"". There was some sort of hype for this show before it\'s release due to a freeware game made on RPG maker to becoming a full-on franchise is something to be highly inspiring. But there was many moments during the show that I would just go on my phone while the episode ran.The whole premise and message I got from the plot was the effortless journey of Rachel\'s promise of Zack killing her from beginning to end. This was how the whole story formed and the reason of how this anime will end also. A basic summary is Rachel Gardener, young girl wakes up in the basement of an abandoned building. Without any memories of what\'s happening she wanders around the multi-level building, which in return she encounters a scythe wielding murderer called Zack. Through the promise of pleading her death through Zack they form a strange bond together by wanting to escape this building filled with psychotic weirdos.Each level of the building is associated with a different character to which it forces the our 2 protagonists to work together to defeat the villain (?). This part of the story felt like a traditional RPG by solving puzzles within the game, which would eventually take you to the final boss.Eddie was the character that I didn\'t like and was killed off in a few episodes which I didn\'t really care about it at all.Cathy was alot more interesting due to her psychotic jigsaw type thinking and ultimately becoming crazy when she didn\'t get her way. Watching the final confrontation with Zack, Rachael and her was one of my favourite episodes. Toying with her victims endlessly through a maze that forced each other to complete tasks that forced pain physically and mentally to then result in a room where she enforced each character to kill each other. Great ending to that sub arc.Gray was your overseeing game master that was behind the scenes and the reason why everyone was in this one building. I would much more enjoyed it if he fucked with the characters more but I felt like he was just giving lectures half the time to Rachael.Danny is your typical obsessed rejected loser from a girl who would do anything for her love. It didn\'t make any sense how he died and then somehow came back alive to play round 3 of mind games. His obsession of Rachel did evolve his character to be the final villain of the story, as his slithering personality forced Zack to really hate how he affected his relationship with Rachael.But to me these 4 characters didn\'t excite me to continuing watching this anime, it was Rachael and Zack\'s development that made me want to review this. A monotone emotionless mediocre family issue girl and a 4th degree burnt murder obsessed illiterate guy become ship couple of the year to me. 2 very strange human beings with their own back stories come together wanting to kill and die. Episode 6 was the turning point that there was more then just an agreement of killing Rachael, it was the critical point that changed how I viewed their connection as something else.By overcoming his murderous intent he resisted killing Rachel for the soul reason that he couldn\'t stand lies and wanted to kill her with a smile. While this is no indication that this a love story but the fact that Zack as a person isn\'t just a killing machine and that this girl can calm him down just showed how he is a character. The ending of the episode was the first time Zack complimented, gave interest on why Rachel was here and smiled from his own happiness. I\'m pretty sure anyone can say Zack\'s smile was precious in this episode. From this episode onwards all I wanted was more Zack and Rachael moments together.SPOILER ALERT!!!I very much enjoyed the ending as it allowed for the audience to interpret it in different ways dependent on how they saw it. Once Zack was thrown into prison and Rachel was left counselling it created this barrier between the 2 characters as their curiosity of each other\'s well beings was the only thing on their minds. The only thing Zack wanted to know from the investigating police was if Rachel was alive and the only thing Rachel wanted to know from the counsellor was about Zack. The distance established between the 2 characters was a first for them both and you could see how much it affected Rachel knowing she couldn\'t sustain her promise with Zack.Seasons will go by for Rachel as you can see how trapped, lifeless and not giving a fuck what this counsellor has to say about wanting to feel better about her life. All she wanted to know was if Zack was still alive and if she could ever see him. The few words of hearing that Zack was sentenced to death, you could see in those few seconds Rachel\'s heart just shattering from just the smallest change in her eyes. The contradicting statement from the counsellor stating that ""I believe this will help you sleep in peace."" was absolute heartbreaking to watch.Up until this point anything could go in this anime and I was prepared for a depressing sad ending for the outcome for our 2 protagonist. Up until ***SLICE*** Zack comes to the rescue by breaking the window with his Scythe (which he got a new one or picked it up from the building again?). Referencing back to how boring he found her face to kill her, restating their promise and finally fulfilling it together as a final scene. The combination of my favourite theme on the OST with Zack and Ray jumping out the window, a close up shot of their faces fading between each scene with her saying ""Please... Kill me"". What a way to end the series.There was a few different interpretations of the ending from other viewers which I found interesting. Majority of people thought it could of ended with Zack and Ray jumping out the window to their deaths or 2 of them to escape and continue their neverending adventures. An interesting explanation I saw was that seeing Zack was just a hallucination which resulted in her suiciding as the post credit scene displayed blood stains and a knife on the floor. The ending could be interpreted in different ways but regardless of if they survived or died I was satisfied on how it finished the story.Overall anyone can agree that there is many flaws in this show but the development of these 2 fucked up maniacs can somewhat become inseparable from their commitment of murder and death of each other was very entertaining to watch. Would recommend!!! an anime already... BUT I very much loved watching it.What I loved about this anime is the development of Zack and Rachel\'s relationship from start to finish is how it provided me any sign of being keen each week.Anyone who has watched atleast the first 12 episodes can agree that this isn\'t the greatest constructed plot and can comment that it is ""shit"". There was some sort of hype for this show before it\'s release due to a freeware game made on RPG maker to becoming a full-on franchise is something to be highly inspiring. But there was many moments during the show that I would just go on my phone while the episode ran.The whole premise and message I got from the plot was the effortless journey of Rachel\'s promise of Zack killing her from beginning to end. This was how the whole story formed and the reason of how this anime will end also. A basic summary is Rachel Gardener, young girl wakes up in the basement of an abandoned building. Without any memories of what\'s happening she wanders around the multi-level building, which in return she encounters a scythe wielding murderer called Zack. Through the promise of pleading her death through Zack they form a strange bond together by wanting to escape this building filled with psychotic weirdos.Each level of the building is associated with a different character to which it forces the our 2 protagonists to work together to defeat the villain (?). This part of the story felt like a traditional RPG by solving puzzles within the game, which would eventually take you to the final boss.Eddie was the character that I didn\'t like and was killed off in a few episodes which I didn\'t really care about it at all.Cathy was alot more interesting due to her psychotic jigsaw type thinking and ultimately becoming crazy when she didn\'t get her way. Watching the final confrontation with Zack, Rachael and her was one of my favourite episodes. Toying with her victims endlessly through a maze that forced each other to complete tasks that forced pain physically and mentally to then result in a room where she enforced each character to kill each other. Great ending to that sub arc.Gray was your overseeing game master that was behind the scenes and the reason why everyone was in this one building. I would much more enjoyed it if he fucked with the characters more but I felt like he was just giving lectures half the time to Rachael.Danny is your typical obsessed rejected loser from a girl who would do anything for her love. It didn\'t make any sense how he died and then somehow came back alive to play round 3 of mind games. His obsession of Rachel did evolve his character to be the final villain of the story, as his slithering personality forced Zack to really hate how he affected his relationship with Rachael.But to me these 4 characters didn\'t excite me to continuing watching this anime, it was Rachael and Zack\'s development that made me want to review this. A monotone emotionless mediocre family issue girl and a 4th degree burnt murder obsessed illiterate guy become ship couple of the year to me. 2 very strange human beings with their own back stories come together wanting to kill and die. Episode 6 was the turning point that there was more then just an agreement of killing Rachael, it was the critical point that changed how I viewed their connection as something else.By overcoming his murderous intent he resisted killing Rachel for the soul reason that he couldn\'t stand lies and wanted to kill her with a smile. While this is no indication that this a love story but the fact that Zack as a person isn\'t just a killing machine and that this girl can calm him down just showed how he is a character. The ending of the episode was the first time Zack complimented, gave interest on why Rachel was here and smiled from his own happiness. I\'m pretty sure anyone can say Zack\'s smile was precious in this episode. From this episode onwards all I wanted was more Zack and Rachael moments together.SPOILER ALERT!!!I very much enjoyed the ending as it allowed for the audience to interpret it in different ways dependent on how they saw it. Once Zack was thrown into prison and Rachel was left counselling it created this barrier between the 2 characters as their curiosity of each other\'s well beings was the only thing on their minds. The only thing Zack wanted to know from the investigating police was if Rachel was alive and the only thing Rachel wanted to know from the counsellor was about Zack. The distance established between the 2 characters was a first for them both and you could see how much it affected Rachel knowing she couldn\'t sustain her promise with Zack.Seasons will go by for Rachel as you can see how trapped, lifeless and not giving a fuck what this counsellor has to say about wanting to feel better about her life. All she wanted to know was if Zack was still alive and if she could ever see him. The few words of hearing that Zack was sentenced to death, you could see in those few seconds Rachel\'s heart just shattering from just the smallest change in her eyes. The contradicting statement from the counsellor stating that ""I believe this will help you sleep in peace."" was absolute heartbreaking to watch.Up until this point anything could go in this anime and I was prepared for a depressing sad ending for the outcome for our 2 protagonist. Up until ***SLICE*** Zack comes to the rescue by breaking the window with his Scythe (which he got a new one or picked it up from the building again?). Referencing back to how boring he found her face to kill her, restating their promise and finally fulfilling it together as a final scene. The combination of my favourite theme on the OST with Zack and Ray jumping out the window, a close up shot of their faces fading between each scene with her saying ""Please... Kill me"".

Would recommend!!!', ""one word: underdeveloped.huge potential but the story is premature. with 16 episodes and two main characters we should know them through and through and evolve with them. this happens but really only in the last four episodes do we see substantial growth.loved zack, okamoto was great as his voice actor. he recieved the most backstory. ray isn't as developed and suffers for it as she felt lukewarm. dr. danny was consistently a nemesis, no backstory. the priest was unbuyable, he constructs this psychopathic lair of psychological experimentation and then grows a sliver of a heart toward the end. idk.eddie was a cute character....cathy was crazy and fun. all in all potentially two more characters we could connect with but zero backstory.ultimately the plot construction was unstable and i think the producers/writers should have taken more liberties to build the dialogue from the original game. at least the art was nice.story 4 art 8 sound 8 character 3 enjoyment 6 overall 5.sighing to myself because there was real potential here.oh well, i'll stop sighing and smile. glad to have taken the ride. cathy was crazy and fun. all in all potentially two more characters we could connect with but zero backstory.ultimately the plot construction was unstable and i think the producers/writers should have taken more liberties to build the dialogue from the original game. at least the art was nice.story 4 art 8 sound 8 character 3 enjoyment 6 overall 5.sighing to myself because there was real potential here.oh well, i'll stop sighing and smile. glad to have taken the ride."", 'I was definitely not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did so I watched all the 12 episodes and the additional 4 but this anime is surely not for everyone, basically you will probably like this if you enjoy (in a very strange way that makes you feel memorized and absorbed by the whole thing) dark and some what sad anime. Now, if you don\'t want to read too much just skip to the last paragraph that sums this all up quite well.In all honesty the story only had me interested around episode 4, though even after that it seemed rather plain but...i felt this strange, calm and absorbed feeling and it just kept me going.

You might think it could be a horror anime, but it\'s not particularly scary or anything. It just has a horror aesthetic.I thought it would be a little thrilling, but 3 episodes in you\'ve already got a spooooooky pumpkin-headed boy, an edgelord murderpsycho character that just wants to see Rachel smile (so he can ""kill"" her, obviously, and not because he\'s a softie), and A E S T H E T...I C GRAVESThe fourth episode was significant because it had a lot more funny moments, and Rachel\'s deadpan delivery was the cherry on top.I swear to god, my best friend in middleschool wrote edgy stories and fanfiction that played exactly like this. It would\'ve been a lot better if they didn\'t take it as seriously and played up the drama/absurdity to the max. But instead they tried to play it straight a lot of the time, so the flat delivery ends up being something akin to the dead look in Rachel\'s eyes.So yeah, it\'s not that great storywise and it won\'t keep you on the edge of your seat, but if you were an edgy girl as a kid, you\'ll probably enjoy it a bit. I\'m assuming that\'s the target demographic, at least (?) As a horror or mystery show, it fails. As a comedy, it\'s a little over passable.

Especially the way Rachel and Isaac play off each other, Isaac\'s outbursts, their contrasting personalities offered me a few chuckles here and there, and the majority of their interactions with other characters.The only reason I can\'t say this was brilliant or masterful, is because, at it\'s core, I personally found it confusing. The concepts and messages they were bringing up and having characters worry/motivate them were fascinating, but incredibly confusing the first time around and very quick to change from one episode to the next.This is another reason I enjoyed Isaac\'s character so much, because every now and then he would just blurt out exactly what I was thinking regarding these situations; ""What the hell are you talking about?"", ""What the hell does that mean?"", ""What are you getting at?"" and at times just straight up demanding someone explain wtf is going on. This shows me that the writers/creators are at least aware of the deep thinking bits in this story.I\'m sure if I watched this a few more times, with the knowledge I now have having finished it, some concepts could make more sense to me and I perhaps would be able to understand what characters are saying to each other.Regardless, I found the series incredibly tense, and from the aspects I definitely 100% understood it gave me satisfaction to arcs, answers to mysteries and questions they put forward and offered me an interesting perspective of relationship types that I thought worked remarkably well.Overall, what I can definitely praise are the lead characters, (for the cliches they portray very well), and honestly the ending is something I haven\'t seen or expected for a while.Would recommend, but warning, it can be a thinker! rushed, and plot/motivation is very unique, or at the very least not one that I\'ve seen before.My favorite part were the characters.

As I present to you the anime review of Satsuriku no Tenshi or by its English translation, Angels of Death. Lets begin.Story: 5.5/10The story follows a 13 year old girl by the name of Rachel Gardener who wakes up in a seamlessly abandoned building with no idea of how she got there. She then starts exploring the various basement floors until she runs into a scythe wielding serial killer by the name of Zack. Zack tries to kill Rachel at first but then certain circumstances causes to them to make a deal. If Rachel helps Zack get out of where they are, Zack promises to kill Rachel since Rachel has heard the news of her parent\'s fate, she wishes for death. From there they explore the different floors and slowly start to learn about where they are and about each other.First impressions were good for this series as it had a sense of isolation and fear of the unknown in its first couple of episodes that kept your attention and in suspense. But then the show started to trip up and the quality of the story was slipping and I can attribute this to the show\'s immediate change in tone after the first couple of episodes. It goes from slasher horror to mystery thriller without trying to balance the two together. When the show tires to continues to keep you in suspense and shock you, it fails. This is because there isn\'t an good emotional reaction or response. When Rachel discovers something disturbing or shocking, she keeps a blank face that shows that she does not care and shows no emotion. Or when Zack gets told something, he just shouts as he can\'t be arsed to think about it. And when these two are the main characters, there is no emotional investment in the story.Really, what kept me going was the overall mystery of the show. I wanted to keep watching to find out where the hell they were and why they are there in the first place. The show does give hints and clues through the environment and in the character\'s dialogue as to why they are here. It kept me thinking of what is this place that they are stuck in. Is it merely a building to f**k with people, or are they actually in hell and are going through the different circles of hell. It made me think and good on the show to get me interested on that aspect of the story.It\'s also kind of funny how literal the translation from the game to the anime was. Each floor acts like a level with an entrance and an exit with many obstacles in the way. There are multiple puzzles in each level and Rachel and Zack have to figure them out in order to advance while the caretaker of each level watches over them. But is this poor adaptation from adapting the game into an anime? Yes and no. In some aspects, yes because it does sometime fell very ""video gamey"" with some of the situations that our protagonist finds themselves in. But the anime enhances the drama of these aspects with close ups and different camera angles to give it a more cinematic feel to rack up the tension of that moment.Characters: 7/10So Rachel is one half of the main characters but is the character that the show like to focus on. She acts as a lost soul of sorts. Someone who is hoping that someone can put her to rest. So since she has little reason to go on, she wishes for death and wants Zack to do it because Zack promised to God. Good thing they added that there because it would have been off that she didn\'t ask anyone else to kill her. And trust me, she will keep reminding Zack and you, the viewer, that she wishes for death and Zack has promised, over and over again. It is kind of like the scene from Evabridged where Gendo keeps asking Ritsuko to have sex with him, except there is no end to it. It is unbearable at times to keep hearing her saying that she wants to die every 5 minutes and really brings down her character. Granted, it is nice to see she doesn\'t suffer from amnesia because in a situation like this, it would be easy to do so. It gives the impression that she is hiding some secrets that could explain why she is in this mysterious place to begin with.As for Zack, he is more defined than Rachel is. It is easy to see that he is serial killer with a traumatic past to explain why he became a serial killer in order to gain sympathy points. Through is brash attitude and impatience lies a man who actually has morals. He won\'t kill just anyone (hence why he never killed Rachel when they made their promises together) as he actually has some morals. Not a lot, but some. As time went on, we see a man that actually does somewhat care for Rachel when she it not terrified of him anymore and he is not someone who is just using her to get out of wherever the hell they are. I actually was invested more into Zack than Rachel because his character was more interesting than Rachel despite Rachel having the some mystery behind her.The rest of the cast is small but distinct. They each have their own personality and morality to explain why there here along with Rachel and Zack and act as floor guardians. Each floor reflecting their personality. Danny being a doctor has his floor be a hospital as well as a lab for his more deranged experiments as he is fascinated with human eyes. Eddie\'s floor focuses on a graveyard as he loves to bury the souls of the deceased and wants to help people guide them to their graves. With Catherine\'s floor being a prison as she has a dominatrix personality and likes to punish people. Then you have Abraham\'s floor be a church to reflect his personality of being righteous and him being the voice of god. It does help make each character more defined by their own environment as well as their own personality.Animation: 5/10The shows animation isn\'t really remarkable and is not something to write home about as it lacks detail and finesse. Rachel especially looks like her character has been just sketched onto the drawing board and they haven\'t worked on the details yet they needed to start animating immediately. I believe they could have been a bit more visceral with the violence to hammer in the psychotic tendencies of our characters, especially Zack. But outside one glorious scene from episode 1, it dissapoints. But the animation is not bad. It actually is good is small areas and the character designs are distinct from one another, but unremarkable everywhere else.Sound: 8.5/10The soundtrack in this show is varied. From single use instruments like pianos to the use of strings to using organs to enhance the religious factor of this show. It\'s varied and enjoyable to listen to. Each piece of music matches to the environment well and is appropriately used in that aspect. This is especially true with the organs as whenever I hear those, I know something bad is going to go down. In fact, I got more engaged with the OST than with the characters to enhance the scene.The opening is very skippable for me. Outside of some clever use of imagery, it doesn\'t grab my attention as it just prepares me for what\'s to come, once i\'ve seen it a couple of times, i\'ve seen enough. Rather I enjoyed the ending sequence more than I enjoyed the opening. ""Pray"" by Haruka Chisuga has some very eerie instrumentals that conflicts with the light hearted vocals to make the song as a whole a haunting experience. While the visuals aren\'t anything to write home about outside of a few spots, I still enjoyed listening and watching the ending sequence.ConclusionWhile writing this review, I realised that I enjoyed Angels of Death more than I thought. Sure I have huge gripes with this series that brought my experience down while watching it, but I do have positives for this show. It\'s characters besides Rachel are good and its overall mystery kept me watching. But it was that lack of emotional investment into this series and how much I dislike Rachel that brought this show down for me. It had a good start and I was getting invested in the final two to three episodes but it was that middle stretch of boredom and tedium that brought the quality of this show down for me. Now the show ain\'t finished as it ended on a cliffhanger. But it is the good kind of cliffhanger that makes you want to see what happens next. I did also get some answers to the mystery to make me satisfied but not too much to check out the 4 other episodes that for some reason are being streamed at another timeI am not entirely disappointing with this show, just some aspects. It has enough intrigue to get me engaged for more but not enough to leave a side of caution with this show. For now, I will say this. Angels of death is a show that has a good mystery and intrigue that is hampered down by a tedious middle section and a weak female lead.My personal enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall score: 6.5/10   Recommendation: Consider it fulfil.Sit back , relax and remember to be polite when someone answers your door and says ""Hello, would you like to talk about our Lord and Saviour Haruhi Suzumyia."" As I present to you the anime review of Satsuriku no Tenshi or by its English translation, Angels of Death. Lets begin.Story: 5.5/10The story follows a 13 year old girl by the name of Rachel Gardener who wakes up in a seamlessly abandoned building with no idea of how she got there. She then starts exploring the various basement floors until she runs into a scythe wielding serial killer by the name of Zack. Zack tries to kill Rachel at first but then certain circumstances causes to them to make a deal. If Rachel helps Zack get out of where they are, Zack promises to kill Rachel since Rachel has heard the news of her parent\'s fate, she wishes for death. From there they explore the different floors and slowly start to learn about where they are and about each other.First impressions were good for this series as it had a sense of isolation and fear of the unknown in its first couple of episodes that kept your attention and in suspense. But then the show started to trip up and the quality of the story was slipping and I can attribute this to the show\'s immediate change in tone after the first couple of episodes. It goes from slasher horror to mystery thriller without trying to balance the two together. When the show tires to continues to keep you in suspense and shock you, it fails. This is because there isn\'t an good emotional reaction or response. When Rachel discovers something disturbing or shocking, she keeps a blank face that shows that she does not care and shows no emotion. Or when Zack gets told something, he just shouts as he can\'t be arsed to think about it. And when these two are the main characters, there is no emotional investment in the story.Really, what kept me going was the overall mystery of the show. I wanted to keep watching to find out where the hell they were and why they are there in the first place. The show does give hints and clues through the environment and in the character\'s dialogue as to why they are here. It kept me thinking of what is this place that they are stuck in. Is it merely a building to f**k with people, or are they actually in hell and are going through the different circles of hell. It made me think and good on the show to get me interested on that aspect of the story.It\'s also kind of funny how literal the translation from the game to the anime was. Each floor acts like a level with an entrance and an exit with many obstacles in the way. There are multiple puzzles in each level and Rachel and Zack have to figure them out in order to advance while the caretaker of each level watches over them. But is this poor adaptation from adapting the game into an anime? Yes and no. In some aspects, yes because it does sometime fell very ""video gamey"" with some of the situations that our protagonist finds themselves in. But the anime enhances the drama of these aspects with close ups and different camera angles to give it a more cinematic feel to rack up the tension of that moment.Characters: 7/10So Rachel is one half of the main characters but is the character that the show like to focus on. She acts as a lost soul of sorts. Someone who is hoping that someone can put her to rest. So since she has little reason to go on, she wishes for death and wants Zack to do it because Zack promised to God. Good thing they added that there because it would have been off that she didn\'t ask anyone else to kill her. And trust me, she will keep reminding Zack and you, the viewer, that she wishes for death and Zack has promised, over and over again. It is kind of like the scene from Evabridged where Gendo keeps asking Ritsuko to have sex with him, except there is no end to it. It is unbearable at times to keep hearing her saying that she wants to die every 5 minutes and really brings down her character. Granted, it is nice to see she doesn\'t suffer from amnesia because in a situation like this, it would be easy to do so. It gives the impression that she is hiding some secrets that could explain why she is in this mysterious place to begin with.As for Zack, he is more defined than Rachel is. It is easy to see that he is serial killer with a traumatic past to explain why he became a serial killer in order to gain sympathy points. Through is brash attitude and impatience lies a man who actually has morals. He won\'t kill just anyone (hence why he never killed Rachel when they made their promises together) as he actually has some morals. Not a lot, but some.

The story arc over the series is basically nonsensical, but at least things flowed episode-to-episode. The ending theme is BOSS, and in general the music cues throughout did a good job of drawing me in.Things start off feeling like an anime version of a VN (too lazy to look up whether there is one or not) in the ""escape the room"" vein of 999 or (to a lesser extent) Danganronpa. The good news is I love that kind of thing. The bad news is,...an anime isn\'t interactive like either of the aforementioned games. But I was digging it, and its heavier slasher overtone.Then there\'s a weird religious element that crops up and I could never quite get a hold of what Angels of Death was saying. I mean, I suspect it\'s saying NOTHING--that the religious elements are narrative stylization more than actual moral core--but I might also be too stupid to really see what the writers are laying down here. And with the religious stuff being more or less meaningless, the series as a whole is a simple journey with a lot of flash-bang distractions. Which is a long way of saying that the series switches focus midway from a tangible and entertaining Point A to Point B journey, to an internal, intangible (and still somewhat entertaining, but also hollow) internal journey that lacks the thematic kick to feel meaningful.But I\'m very easy to please, and the basic concept was enough to carry me through the rougher second half. an anime isn\'t interactive like either of the aforementioned games.

He tries to be terror, tries to take action, tries to make a drama, tries to be suspense ... anyway just try more never get anywhere.The female protagonist is totally without charisma and well ... this is it. Already the masculine besides being annoying to a fucking passes the whole anime giving irritating screams and has a very stupid personality. He is generally more forced than the ecchi of fairy tail. For you to have an idea it is electrocuted several times, and the person who was behind this ""magnificent"" moment says...that any other human would die the first time, then take a heavy drug that makes hallucinate, takes two or three shots, has the bariga ripped and even then HE GOING RUNNING AND SCREAMING. He spends some time and he finally faints. Unsalted loli clogs his belly and gives some remedies and he magically recovers (????????).The plot twist is totally predictable, if you have two ninjas in the head there pro episode 6 you would have already pulled everything.

I'll be doing my best to take into account that there are differences, but will be talking about the game too, albeit briefly. So, THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS. Read at your own risk.While it has been beaten to death that Angels of Death is slow, I couldn't disagree more. At least, until I got to the later episodes that is. But more on that later. The story of a mentally ill girl and a crazed murderous forming a bond shouldn't be appealing, in fact it sounds more like a comedy...than a psychological horror, but that is indeed the relationship that we spend the most time with.Rachel and Zack are two very different people, brought together in a game of religion and horror. Playing the game first, I was unsure how the anime would be able to structure their relationship - the jarred first meeting, the unsure but curious fledgling of a friendship and then, unwavering loyalty. But the anime has done that and more, delving deeper into what makes Zack and Rachel special to one another. We spend more time in their past in the anime than in the game, and how their past interlinks them. Both have been pushed aside by people who were supposed to protect and love them, twisting them into the people they are. Zack reacts violently, lashing out to destroy. Rachel, on the other hand, acts only to preserve an image of purity and innocence. The difference between them is intoxicating.I also appreciated looking more into the other judges, like Cathy, Eddie, and Gray. Danny is just plain annoying, so kudo's to the anime for making him like that still, I guess. In the game I felt that the rest of the judges barely got any screen time, so it was nice for that to be included. I find them all rather interesting, but I wish that we'd have got to know more about their backstory. Still, it was nice to see more of 'the angels' of death.If there's one thing I can't deny it's that Angels of Death looks damn good. I enjoyed the visuals of the pixel game on Switch, but I'd be lying if I said that the anime was, by any means, bad. Great stuff.Now onto it dragging. At first, nope. I felt that they handled the episodes rather nicely, up until it got to episode 12 which is where I started to zone out. There's nothing wrong with adding more stuff like backstory and whatnot, but holy crap, two whole episodes dedicated to Zack and Rachel doing ONE specific thing?

I also won\'t be engaging in detailed feelings for character and story since much hasn\'t been revealed yet.I am aware of the game this anime originated from, however I have not watched nor played the original.BRIEF SYNOPSIS:  4~6Young woman (Rachel) wakes up in an unknown building and meets insane serial killer (Zack) and asks him to murder her. Zack refuses to...kill her unless she assists him in escaping the building they\'re both in. Each floor they move to is controlled by other mentally disturbed characters that they must fight/outwit in order to survive and escape.After two episodes and considering this came from a freeware game it\'s obvious that this is a deliberate combination of mystery/psychological horror. Even Rachel, who is by all means the most sane character in the anime, has her own specific issues. Neither her nor Zack\'s backgrounds are explained early, rather being hinted at/explicitly shown throughout the course of the story. Each antagonist\'s demented quirks vary from obsessive insanity, sadistic torture, and possessive delusion.So far, I can say one thing: edgy. That\'s probably the one thing you\'ll hear everywhere about this anime, and it\'s true. Considering the story and setting ""explanations"", adding an absurd amount of edge to make this anime work in-genre is practically a necessity. I can also say that whatever mystery they have in store for Rachel isn\'t explicitly obvious, which is a nice touch to keep people watching.A problem I can see for others is that this anime can be considered fairly slow, which is my original reasons for wanting to drop it. This anime doesn\'t center itself around fast-paced action that betrays the gore and craze of its trailer. Rather it focuses on detailed visuals, sound cues, character design, and atmosphere which I have to give it credit for.ART and SOUND: 7/6As said before I have my own share of praises for this anime. It presents both the background and characters spectacularly well, giving me high hopes for J.C. Staff\'s future works. Everything is detailed from the shine in Rachel\'s sweat to the rust on various tools. The added lighting in various scenes and shadows are spread perfectly to present each scene.As for the sound, there isn\'t too much in terms of ""epic"" such as Sawano Hiroyuki\'s works, but Noisycroak certainly knows what is necessary for such an anime. A mix of various scare chord-inspired works, eerie ambient sounds, and string-based discordant tracks works well in-universe. Nothing spectacular, just exactly what is needed. Opening theme is alright, but the Ending theme shines well.OVERALL: 6 (Above Average)I\'m pleasantly surprised by this anime. I came in with low expectations and have been given much higher expectations as I go through. So far the characters haven\'t been fleshed out enough for me to say any of them excel, and the story is fairly unique so far. This anime can improve as log as it continuously expands on the main characters and maybe even the villains while hopefully increasing its own pace towards the end. kill her unless she assists him in escaping the building they\'re both in.

The psychological aspects comes into play when it involves the main cast of Satsuriku no Tenshi, especially towards Zack and Rachel.Rachel and Zack as character do develop as outside their archetypes however they slow drip to you their backstories with Rachel\'s backstory being the most mysterious throughout the anime. Zack gets some backstory to how he became how he is but not much other than that as he doesn\'t exactly change from his hair triggered personality but at least he loosens up....a little, key word being ""little"". Rachel is pretty much the same, she\'s the typical stoic, silent type but has a deadpan voice to go along with it, yes we get glimpses of her backstory and how this affects the plot and the such but her backstory and revelation isn\'t brought up until the final episode. Nonetheless Rachel is also afflicted with having a backstory that doesn\'t change their personality in a ways but in comes the problem.....LA felt that both Zack and especially Rachel our MAIN NARRATIVE FOCUSED characters...were bland yeah who would had thought it?LA was more interested in the ""Angels of Death"" and how they factor into it, from the mad eye obsessed doctor, Daniel Dickens voiced by Takahiro Sakurai who ""knows"" Rachel, Edward Mason voiced by Natsumi Fujiwara, a little kid who specializes in making graves and tombstones who\'s in love with Rachel, Catherine Ward voiced by Mariya Ise, a sadomasochist warden that specializes in traps and was LA\'s favourite  Angel of Death by sheer merit of her insanely haughty personality and with Mariysa Ise backing this character up. Finally we have the blind priest Abraham Gray voiced by Houchuu Ootsuka who is more than you think. Really the Angels of Death made the anime a bit more interesting than our bland duo of Rachel and Zack even though they were intrinsically linked to both main characters but nonetheless, the Angels of Death and especially Catherine were a thrill to get to know even if they were ALSO stereotypical but the fact of them being villains and barring the main characters way and made the anime interesting.Satsuriku no Tenshi falls under the the chess-piece storytelling and for a video game to anime adaptation right down to every conversation, every action the characters do, well you CAN TELL from the dialogue alone this felt like a straight up retelling, though this isn\'t a bad thing, for newcomers and whatnot but some of the flaws LA had for Satsuriku no Tenshi is of the repetitive dialogue and conversations between Rachel and Zack, hammering it into you of ""this is important""...most times not but point being. Again with the aforementioned characters being stereotypically bland is a huge detriment to the anime and though we do learn at least Rachel and Zack\'s backstories, they just don\'t back enough enough for LA to be entirely invested (maybe Rachel near the end because of the focus is on her). Because this is an anime to video game adaptation and characters get into traps or a forced to do something for development or because of the game and everything it goes two ways, one it goes in line with the game and the fact the characters are in danger causes the events to happen, on the other hand it leads to chess piece story telling for this character do know what the audience now knew in advance, LA gets it it\'s a video game adaptation, but it doesn\'t have much freedom due it all...this IS a detriment but not to sole reasoning as to Satsuriku no Tenshi\'s downfall.The animation done by JC Staff was admirable to say the least, they kept with it\'s aesthetics as a psychological thriller and with how they portrayed the mental state of it\'s characters through the use of stylized coloring of it\'s flashbacks, state of being and mental states, the more horror aspects though it is bloody and gory it kept in a respectable amount which is odd considering how many character die in this anime but nonetheless. Character designs were vibrant and grungy at the same time, fitting considering what kind of setting Satsuriku no Tenshi is placed in and the backgrounding also applies to this as well. If there was anything LA would properly praise JC Staff would be it\'s psychological aesthetics and how they portrayed it.MVP for the voice cast just HAS to go to Mariya Ise, she just hammed it up and LA just loved every moment of her in screen to the point of her OUT HAMMING NOBUHIKO OKAMOTO...like seriously. Haruka Chigusa was decent but like Rachel herself, bland, though LA won\'t blame her considering it was her role as Rachel  and as for Nobuhiko Okamoto as Zack...well we have Accelerator accenting here...another words, psycho crazy but he loosens up after his introduction as Zack and instead goes Bakugo arrogant cadence through out the anime afterwards. Overall, voice cast was decent enough with Mariya Ise just easily taking LA\'s favourite seiyuu in this anime, at least she brought life to this deathly anime...Satsuriku no Tenshi as a whole falls under it\'s bland characters, the anime tries to give us backstories to our main characters but for the most part becoming almost worthless, especially when it pertains Zack\'s backstory, Rachel as a character is bland and both drives the plot forward but has an interesting backstory but is barred by her personality and though we as the audience found out why Rachel wants to die by the end of the anime...LA just felt...nothing, another words, LA wasn\'t invested in Rachel as a character as much they develop Rachel as a character and gave her vague glimpses into her backstory. Again, LA was more interested in the Angels of Death than Rachel, the main protagonist. Production wise, it was great, from the good aesthetics of the animation down to it\'s character designs, psychological aspect and backgrounding as well as it\'s decent voice cast, but Satsuriku no Tenshi\'s slow drip plot and uninteresting main characters was the last stake in the coffin.Oh, Satsuriku no Tenshi still under all this criticism is still ""fine"", but not great by any means if your interested in the game, it\'s still an ok but ""by the books"" video game to anime adaptation that buckles in making the anime interested in or care for it\'s characters that also leaves us off with a ""to be continued"" when the anime was only getting to it\'s climax (from what LA has gotten, the last 4 episodes will be released through online broadcast, still leaving the anime like that was such a tease to say the least).""Kill me please""...No, but LA is disappointed to the point of death... only kill Rachel once Zack is out of the building.Satsuriku no Tenshi on the outset looks like most horror animes, but Satsuriku no Tenshi by in large is more on the lines of psychological thriller than horror, yes gore and blood appear but not to the point of visceral intent that most horror goes through.

I KNOW THAT THE SHOW IS NOT OVER, AS THE SPECIALS ARE RELEASING SOON. THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE SHOW UP TO EPISODE 12, SO SOME SPOILERS ARE PRESENT.*Angels of Deaths is...strange. Not in a bad way, but this is one of those shows that truly is the definition of a mixed bag. It's not terrible, but at the same time, the series is just something I wouldn't go out of my way to watch a second time. And yet, it's a series I'll probably remember because of how bizarre it was.Story:...6/10The story of Angels of Death is fairly simple. Rachel Gardner find herself trapped inside of an abandoned building without any of her memories intact. Wandering around, she meets Zack, a man who's a bit off his rocker, who wields a sickle in hand. Together, they form a bond and try to find a way out of the building itself. Right off the bat, the concept alone is interesting. There are different floors that offer different, deadly challenges.And also, did I mention that they aren't the only ones in the building?The challenges themselves are conducted by murderers, one in charge of each floor. Rachel and Zack are put up to dangerous tasks, whether it's from a doctor who has an abnormal obsession with the human eye, or a woman who's sadistic mature makes killing seem like a game of punishment for people she deems 'sinners', the entire building is full of downright dangerous people.But despite all these interesting concepts and ideas, the execution comes off as just incredibly slow. The pacing can be fast at times, but it's most just dragging on as they try to find how to get out of each floor. If there were a set of episodes that I find reasonably paced, check out episodes 4-6. I'm not saying the entire show is slow though, it does pick up around episode 10. And while the end of the 'final' episode is pretty easy to latch onto, it's a good stopping point  to where the specials will pick up.Art: 8/10It may not look like it at first glance, but the animation and art in Angels of Death is pretty impressive. The art is simple, yet the color palette to me is dark, adding to the mysterious vibe the show is trying to give. The designs of each character are also pretty unique, a standout for me being Zack's design altogether. Each character stands out and looks different from one another, which is a huge positive. There are also many scenes where JC Staff clearly went all out, with scenes that absolutely stand out and look gorgeous as hell. In this aspect, Angels of Death clearly hits the mark.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack of Angels of Death can vary from being quite forgettable, to absolutely amazing. The opening song is nothing special, and in my personal opinion doesn't really fit the tone of the show at all. But, the ending song 'Pray' is one of the best I've heard in a long time. It's something very memorable, and Haruka Chisuga's (Who is actually the VA for Rachel) change from soft to powerful vocals are something to be admired. The OST for the show is is pretty great too, which I believe is from the game itself?I almost forgot to mention the voice acting here, which is great! Rachel's VA does a great job at capturing her character well, along with the VA's for each murderer. Similar to the character designs, the voice for each character is undeniably unique, even more so than the art itself. You can tell the VA's are having an absolute blast with their roles. But, the standout for me is Zack.Seriously, what is up with Zack being the total standout of this show? Nobuhiko Okamoto gives Zack the perfect amount of charm and crazy to just  make every man and woman nut to the far ends of the galaxy.Maybe it's because this man voiced Bakugo from MHA (which from listening closely, you can hear a tint of it in there.), but he really is a talented guy.(Imagine Bakugou having an eternal hissy fit over Izuku and then stabbed him twenty times, was put in a mental institution, and escaped. That's how I can summarize Zack.)Character: 4/10Now here's where things get rocky. The characters on their own have quirks that make them stand out, which is a good thing. But the big problem with the characters lies in development. Some characters, like Zack, get tons of characterization. But others don't really get that kind of treatment, like some of the murderers or a certain girl, but we'll get back to her. We got so much information on Zack, hell, I think there was an episode where most of it was just Zack backstory. Listen up JC Staff and Angels of Death staff, we all love Zack. But, he's taken up a bit TOO much of the development that others should've gotten. When it comes to the murderers, it varies. Some get lot of screentime, and don't get jack shit of development. Meanwhile, some are only there for not even one and a half episodes, and get so much more development than either of them. Y'all writers just can't figure out what to do, huh?But the one thing that really made em disappointed the most, was how they handled Rachel.Here's the thing. They didn't do Rachel a dirty, they gave her a fair share of development. But the problem is, there are so many things that are mentioned about Rachel and important plot points that are just....never brought up again.It's just sad to see it all be thrown away, but hey, the series ain't over yet. Gotta wait and see.Overall, the staff goofed the eff up.Enjoyment: 6/10Despite some of it's lingering issues, Angels of Death is fairly enjoyable, and I hope that it starts to pick up. 6/10The story of Angels of Death is fairly simple.

The character is quite interesting especially the man who always bring scythe. There are also plot twists. Tragedy, mystery, a bit of drama and bloody scenes. The Opening and Ending are amazing.

If I know there will not be any more episodes, I would RAGE QUIT! Update from me, a gamer of the game.Sadly, the adaption was quite alright. This is coming from someone who actually REALLY enjoyed the game. Personally, everything after episode 12 is the greatest highlight of the game, so this leave everything that build up until episode 12 wouldn't be entertaining to watch. It is just the introduction.If we follow the story graph from introduction, to rising action, to...climax, to falling action, to resolution, then the story is somewhere on the rising action as I speak here from episode 12. Ever heard of the Melancholy of Suzumiya? Yeah, these 12 episodes are kinda like that. Just a jumble mess that builds up the story for the movie, which was a masterpiece. I believe in the last 4 episodes would be amazing, and it will reach its climatic heights as all tension is only rising up to these last episodes.I am very sadden and disappointed at the repetition of that music playing every single episode. I just wish they start using more varieties of music use, instead of that constant piano piece. Though they did some really emotion music on some scene, I can only say that the music was the worst use in the anime.I really enjoyed it a lot mainly because I played the game, and knew what will happened. I am sadden to see many people disliking the anime for its pace, but you know what they say, patience sometimes lead to entertainment that you've never experience before. Be patient and watch ALL of the story to finally judge.Like I said, these last 4 episodes is the only greatest thing in the game. It carries the entire story to the end, and if you don't believe me, wait and witness for yourself the reward you will receive by the end.Thank you for reading my long review!

You can see from how the scenes are made and some interactions that it was made for and RPG Maker creation, I think that knowing that it was made from a game helps to watch...it.The art 10/10 :Astounding, that season there was a good of show with good art but this one definitely caught my attention more than the others by it’s beauty and care for details as little as they could be. There were some nice shots such as the one in the end or the judgment scene.The sound 9/10 :The piano was one of the main reasons this had a high score, the OST was at the top of it’s game. And other than that, the sounds effects weren’t too bad either, but one thing that annoyed me really hard at first was Zack’s scream every now and then.The characters 6/10 :Some are gonna say that the characters in this are awesome, which I agree to. But some characters were not as loved or interesting as Rachel, Zack, Danny or even Abraham. Catherine was just a very weird SM roleplay lover and for Edward he was just kinda there for me.The enjoyment 9/10 :There was always something to look forward to, another floor, another character, discovering a little bit more about who are the characters.

They always kept me going back for this anime every week, the only “Boring” part was with Edward.', ""This anime is the best example I've seen of the 'so bad it's good' concept in anime. Nearly everything about the show is a total trainwreck from the writing to the art to the sound (except the voice acting) to the animation is godawful and feels like it was made by a group of people who have exactly zero idea what they're doing. (Except for the first episode. The first episode is definitely the most solid episode of the whole show.) But, despite this, the show just somehow manages to click and be a fun thrill ride of a dumb edgy action show with one...or two really memorable characters and one hell of a ridiculous plot.Story: 4The story makes like literally zero sense when you think about it. Like within the narrative it makes sense but it's also just like really really dumb. It's a cool concept and an interesting idea to get two characters with such ridiculously contrasting personalities into a situation like this, but in the end it ends up raising a lot of questions. Like how has no one ever found this building? How did the police get there? How did Gray know this would happen? How did they know about Ray? How do they pick sacrifices? It's really never clarified. It's enough to keep the show running, but certainly not what makes it so fun to watch.Art: 3After some pretty impressive animation cuts (mostly Zack being Zack) in the first episode, I was shocked to find that almost the entire rest of the show flows like a cheaply produced A-1 Pictures show. The CG effects are atrocious and the shot composition verges on painful. This certainly provided a lot of laughs as I was watching the show, but this, again, is not what makes the show fun.Sound: 5The voice actors are (for the most part) clearly having an absolute blast as they scream and spout absolutely ridiculous edgy dialogue. I'd say Gray has the weakest performance, but Danny, Zack, and Cathy more than make up for any weaknesses in the other performances with their bombastic over-acting and hilarious dialogue.The actual sound design of the show is, like the animation, utterly atrocious and the music choices can often feel entirely mishandled. But this is more a source of unintentional hilarity than anything else. And the OP is freaking amazing. JIN FTW!!!Character: 8This is basically all because of Zack. Zack is the emotional center of the entire show. When he takes a few episodes off to spend dying in a hallway, the show isn't fun to watch anymore. His easy-going banter and fun chemistry with Ray is like half the reason any of the show works at all. The other half is Zack just being a bouncy, fun, lovable character to spend time with. And honestly, he provides any depth or heart the show has at all. I could probably write a full analysis about how Zack's characterization contrasts with that of Ray and how he's portrayed as a more genuine and kind person than her despite him being a serial killer and her just being a little girl. And how much they grow to care about each other over the course of the show is the real emotional core of the series.Overall: 6From an objective standpoint, Angels of Death is pretty terrible. But, from a purely subjective standpoint it's an absolutely hilarious romp full of heart and a really entertaining bandaged psycho that you should definetly watch with friends if you plan to watch it. or two really memorable characters and one hell of a ridiculous plot.Story: 4The story makes like literally zero sense when you think about it. Like within the narrative it makes sense but it's also just like really really dumb. It's a cool concept and an interesting idea to get two characters with such ridiculously contrasting personalities into a situation like this, but in the end it ends up raising a lot of questions. Like how has no one ever found this building? How did the police get there? How did Gray know this would happen? How did they know about Ray? How do they pick sacrifices? It's really never clarified. It's enough to keep the show running, but certainly not what makes it so fun to watch.Art: 3After some pretty impressive animation cuts (mostly Zack being Zack) in the first episode, I was shocked to find that almost the entire rest of the show flows like a cheaply produced A-1 Pictures show. The CG effects are atrocious and the shot composition verges on painful. This certainly provided a lot of laughs as I was watching the show, but this, again, is not what makes the show fun.Sound: 5The voice actors are (for the most part) clearly having an absolute blast as they scream and spout absolutely ridiculous edgy dialogue. I'd say Gray has the weakest performance, but Danny, Zack, and Cathy more than make up for any weaknesses in the other performances with their bombastic over-acting and hilarious dialogue.The actual sound design of the show is, like the animation, utterly atrocious and the music choices can often feel entirely mishandled. But this is more a source of unintentional hilarity than anything else. And the OP is freaking amazing. JIN FTW!!!Character: 8This is basically all because of Zack. Zack is the emotional center of the entire show. When he takes a few episodes off to spend dying in a hallway, the show isn't fun to watch anymore. His easy-going banter and fun chemistry with Ray is like half the reason any of the show works at all. The other half is Zack just being a bouncy, fun, lovable character to spend time with. And honestly, he provides any depth or heart the show has at all. I could probably write a full analysis about how Zack's characterization contrasts with that of Ray and how he's portrayed as a more genuine and kind person than her despite him being a serial killer and her just being a little girl. And how much they grow to care about each other over the course of the show is the real emotional core of the series.Overall: 6From an objective standpoint, Angels of Death is pretty terrible. But, from a purely subjective standpoint it's an absolutely hilarious romp full of heart and a really entertaining bandaged psycho that you should definetly watch with friends if you plan to watch it."", 'Angels of Death is a weak, poor and unnecessary adaptation of its video game counterpart. I didn’t actually play the game. In fact, I didn’t even know there was a game in the first place until I watched the first episode. So even if you’re diving into this show without any prior knowledge about it other than the actual synopsis, I feel almost obligated to warn you that it’s in fact terrible. Any game adaptation for that matter has been terrible, minus some extremely rare exceptions. Take a look at Corpse Party and the KanColle Collection.This anime is not inherently bad, in a sense that...the original game is bad. This anime is bad because it lacks any form of development, is full of inconsistencies and unlikable characters in a story that could have ended in 1 second but didn’t.So Rachel, our main protagonist wakes up in an eerie abandoned hospital. Having no recollection of her past and how she got here, she begins exploring the building before getting chased by Zack, a murderous psychopath who wants to kill her for no reason whatsoever. After miraculously escaping, something snaps in her head and she decides to die, still HAVING ZERO recollection of her memories. But hold on to your seat, because its gets even more absurd. She asks the very same psychopath to kill her, but to her surprise he doesn’t accept, simply because she’s “not making a good face”.And so the duo go on a suicidal adventure, casually defeating enemies on every floor, because how else are we supposed to move the story forward? Throughout the series, they continuously engage in a repetitive, flat and awkward dialogue that is repeated 20 times or even more. I don’t know at this point, I’ve lost count. Here’s a typical conversation between the two that you can almost certainly find every 5 minutes in a single episode:- “I want to die”- “I will kill you when we get out. Just make sure you make a good face and smile a bit”- “But you will kill me right? Because you promised God”- “Don’t get so serious you brat. You look too boring I don’t want to kill you”- “I want to be useful to you”Not only that, but every single villain in the story paraphrases the same thing over and over again, because how else are we supposed to fill 20 minutes of screen time? The villains are stereotypical, bland and forgettable since they are one-dimensionally evil and constantly remind everyone about their goal.The doctor reminds everyone about his eye fetish, and how he will literally pop Rachel’s eyes out because they’re beautiful. I’m not even joking about this. The kid reiterates about his obsession with graveyards and also Rachel. He loves her so much that he decides to kill her just to bury her in a nice looking grave. The sadomasochistic girl wants to torture the main characters just for the fun of it, as this wasn’t clear enough from her high-pitched crazy voice. And finally, the priest who complains about how bad religion is, by acting like any teenager in his rebellious phase. *hurr durr* God doesn’t exist, religion is bad, people are hypocrites.As for Rachel herself, she is an irritating, ambivalent and indecisive girl who wants to die at the hands of her psychopathic friend but at the same time doesn’t want to be killed by the villains. Because how else are we supposed to give her a clear and convincing motivation? If she’s that determined to die she can simply kill herself for crying out loud. But for some bullshit philosophical debate, she doesn’t feel like it because God will get mad. I mean, isn’t the act of asking someone else to finish you off the same as your decision of committing suicide in the first place? God will get mad in both cases anyway. The writer pretty much plot armors the very thing the protagonist can achieve in an instance by having said protagonist NOT WANTING to achieve it  in an instance, but rather waste her entire time fooling around a hospital with her friend, aimlessly defeating enemies every floor, before finally accepting to be killed after escaping the building. Then why exactly didn’t she kill herself in the first place and be done with it? Why waste your time that you clearly disregards for such absurd means? Because how else are we going to write a meaningless story with a crystal clear objective that could have been achieved in an instance?But the inconsistency doesn’t stop there. Her companion, Zack, genuinely wants to kill her. But doesn’t because he wants her help to escape, even though he can clearly do it by himself since the puzzles in the show are basically made for kindergartens, by kindergartens. Plus, she doesn’t really hold a unique ability, weapon, or a skillset that he can use to his advantage. Having an IQ greater than 0 for solving such puzzles doesn’t count. Halfway through the show, Zack slices his belly wide open with his scythe, loses 10 times the blood capacity of a normal human body but somehow survives after 2 whole episodes. And get this, Rachel spends her remaining time finding a medicine for a guy she doesn’t need nor care about since she can JUST kill herself or hell, ask another villain to do it in her place. Plus, why the hell should we care about Zack? He’s still a serial killer who brutally murdered countless innocent people because his parents treated him like a tool. You can show us flashbacks about his tragic past but this won’t magically make him a better person. He has to earn it. And so far, all he’s trying to do is resist the urge to kill Rachel. So I don’t see any progress.Giving each main character a tragic backstory is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. It’s not going to help redeem the characters because all they do is act irrationally, contradict themselves all the time, and have barely any resemblance to an actual human personality.As for the other scenes, they are indecipherable and a complete waste of time. Rachel basically gets teleported in and out of different scenes for no other reason than to fill screen time. And she finally gets back to where she was at the beginning of the episode, so there is absolutely no continuity. The story is basically a snake eating its own tail: it keeps running in circles until it finally breaks out from its loop by revealing a “plot twist” at the end. A plot twist that makes zero sense because it turns the two characters against each other by having them fight to death. Wait a second, wasn’t this the premise of the show?The art is clearly a step forward from the actual game and even the manga itself. The animation is most of the time captivating, but other times makes your head spin when special effects such as smokes, blood, weird writings and such are all applied at the same time. The music on the other hand is average and repetitive, especially the piano music which was spammed in almost every episode. The OP fits more a Slice of Life setting, seriously. The ED was a bit better though.To sum it up, Angels of Death is a badly written horror story of two sad protagonists who are thrown in an excuse of a plot that looks and plays exactly like in a RPG. You’ve got characters defeating a villain every level and finding a clue or a trigger before passing to the next stage. The only catch is the awkward and almost laughable relationship between the duo, where Rachel refuses to commit suicide since she prefers getting brutally killed by some serial killer she just met, and Zack who refuses to kill her because she’s not “making a good face”.

This back and forth ultimately led the show to its demise due to its own inconsistency.', ""“I want to die”, a statement that is presented a lot but never seems to amount to much. It’s a harrowing remark that tries to show the disdain for Racheal's own existence, one that ends up being a plight on the shows incoherent mess of a plot.The narrative starts out rather mysterious, with our two main characters being tied together in circumstances rather than by purpose. The theme of Racheal wanting to die starts here with a promise between the two. If they both get out then Zack promises to kill Racheal in return, plain and simple. There is some good initial exposition of...the start of the story and I was originally hopeful with what the premise could offer but soon after my excitement was dashed as every episode turned into a reiteration of the last as Racheal keeps repeating her request of dying to each villain only to have Zack recommit with killing her later. This level of repetition is increasing suffocating as nothing is added or changed for the characters to grow. To explain this discrepancy several philosophical purposes are purposed to why Racheal thinks this way. The first is initially that she wants to die for the sake of dying but is then reconciled with the belief that Zack was her god, and that somehow gives him reason to kill her. By having Zack be her god she believes that it will erase all her sins when she is killed and therefore grants her relief. The problem with the ideology is that it completely fails to bring reason to her constant complaint that she wants to die. If anything, this just makes her character even worse as she now has layers of ineffective characterization, bogging down and dialogue that comes up for the rest of the series. Zack is only slightly better than Racheal with is character is extremely simple and easy to understand. Not much in terms of depth but at least he is not held back by the many contradictions that the other characters in the show present. These two make up the bulk of the show's development and as you can see not much to go off of through the entire story. The other characters tend to have the same level of weird shallow contradictions with themselves. The ending was actually satisfying for me but that’s only with my personal preference in sentimental things and not that the ending was anything of quality.Along with the narrative, the animation was also really on the lower side of quality. For a show in 2018, I expect a certain level in key animation, movement, and background. JC staff did a great job in providing a standard quality for the show and there are hardly any flaws, but in return, the show doesn’t match the level of quality that I would expect from a show in 2018. Mediocre is best to describe the standard it has put out.The soundtrack was straight was bad and this comes from the complete ineptitude of the composer. There is even a track where the entire piece is him going up at one semitone at a time for no particular reason. Not to mention that even though the show is supposed to be horror, the soundtrack does nothing to create that atmosphere. It’s a rather kind of annoying ambiance that detracts from what is actually happening on screen. In the end, the soundtrack has nothing even remotely good about it and unfortunately ends up hurting the show in so many ways. I would like to add my thoughts on the voice acting as well and how terrible it can sound at times. Zack in the sub was particularly bad to the point where I couldn’t stand his screaming anymore and decided on the dub instead which had a much lower and raspy voice for Zack. Racheal's voice was decently done as her voice was already melancholy, to begin with, and the English version of it was more or less the same.In conclusion, I was really holding on at the end with my sense of disbelief. The show was wrapping its self-inside out with so many inconsistency's that I lost complete focus of it by the end of it. I haven't played the game but from what I can see the length of the game was not long enough to accommodate the length of the show. Which made the writers and director trying to stretch the show as long as possible to last for the entire season and in the end backfiring heavily against their own favor. Angels of death is available on Crunchyroll for the sub.

For the home release and dub, it's currently available through FUNimation."", 'NOTE:this review is so long that you might long for death.So be carefulAngels of death is about this girl, and this girl is in a place and with the help of Jeff the killer, she needs to escape and its super crazy.Anyway, watching this show was an absolute ride of emotions but most of them were not positive.This show is based off a game, but the adaptation will be reviewed alone, but the show does feel like a game and its so not subtle about it.Usually most of the time, the main girl, Rachel or another character says that they need to find something, and...i could just picture the objective sentence pop up on screen, but for the things i kinda enjoyed not ironically storywise,I like the first half of the first episode, everything else is absolutely repetitive and boring to such a point where i just didnt even bother taking this shit seriously anymore for how stupid it was.I\'ll break it down for you since I\'m a nice person.So, Rachel does this thing where since her parents died, she gets so depressed that she asks for Jeff the killer to kill her , but Jeff(I forgot his actual name because he has two of them ffs).wants to escape this building and since he\'s as dumb as a rabid dog, Rachel helps him, and she reminds him to kill her over and over and over and over and over to the point where I wanted to kill my own damn self, but besides that, most of the show is Rachel and Jeff talking to each other, getting into tame danger, talking some more, meeting with people, talking to them, and talking about religion for a long ass time.Religion as a theme is not a bad thing, but using it as a crutch to talk about it instead of focusing on the characters dealing with the dilemma themselves makes things more opinionated and uncomforting. Angels of Death kinda does both of those things, but it fails more than it succeeds,speaking of which.Religion in Angels of Death(*asterisks are around spoilers so watch out*)One thing that really kinda made me think about the show(and not in a good way"" was how religion was portrayed in the show.It puts religion on this weird spotlight and has this sort of message of religious people mostly use religion to fulfill their own corruptness or boost their own ego by having followers, which is very intriguing, but the way it\'s handled in this show is absolutely nonsensical,I mean it doesn\'t spend it\'s time trying to validate it, more of it\'s like this intangible and loose force that affects many people, but the majority of people in this show are psychopaths so their philosophies don\'t make a lot of sense.***For example, around the middle of series, Rachel just decides to make Jeff the killer a God despite him only being a human with no moral compass, or the other guy who pretends to be his own God in this weird building just because he wants to be the center of attention, but he kinda doesn\'t get the fact that the concept of a God is not to have the same natures of a human, so his whole experiment is kinda stupid.***i feel like the whole religious aspect was kinda thrown in just to gawk at religious people and look at them like spectacles when it\'s not really how it is in reality.For anyone who lives under  a rock,or resides on Reddit all the time, not all religious people are bad, you got some here and there who take it too far, but for the most part, they\'re just normal people trying to live a mentally healthy and happy life.Sure there was one promising scene where Rachel gets mad at Jeff the killer for saying that God doesn\'t exist, and she lashes out at him and that  actually expresses just how much religion really gave her hope, this would\'ve been able to balance out attitude of religion on individuals and make it less biased, but after that,any intention of cleverness never came back again and even then her caring about Jeff the killer,escaping,or anything for that matter  didn\'t make sense, because most of the time she just wanted to die..I\'m not arguing for or against religion, I\'m just stating the fact that the way it was handled in the show was kind of  nonsensical and convolutedAnyway, animation, JC staff made it, and as a studio, they\'re alright,I mean, they kinda had a rough ride after animating a sequel to a series that is infamous for having some of the best animations in modern 2d animation, (Thats One Punch Man if you didn\'t know)but honestly, the quality of the show is a spectrum that ranges top tier film budget quality to bland and boring, and it goes up and down that spectrum like a  carnival ride.First episode for example,includes some of the best animation I\'ve seen from them in literally forever, and there are some character animation that looks surprisingly good in other episodes, but for everything else, its kinda dull.The show does have some interesting shots and character designs,but all attempts of having a scary thriller atmosphere are kinda weak.Even during some of the show that takes place in a dark house seem kinda lifeless in terms of setting a tone, sure the house is super dark and blue but the bland cinematography kinda doesn\'t do anything for me.Alright, im not gonna sugar coat anything.All the characters are absolutely terrible, not one , not most, ALL OF THEM.There is not a single character that I liked, if one was just annoying and trying so hard to be an edge-lord, another one was just either stupid.contradicting, or had no depth at all.Starting down the list, we have Rachel, the girl who gets super depressed and wants to die, but at the SAME time tries way too hard to make an impression on her husbando Jeff the Killer(I think his real name is like Zeke or something IDK)but as i said before Rachel repeats the same thing over and over that I wanted to jump into the screen and slap that girl so hard that she died and this show could end. But at other times she is either so deadpan in the most dire situations that its kinda funny to not see any emotion out of her, trust me its not intentional most of the time.Not to mention her contradicting her own religious beliefs such as deciding not to commit suicide because God said it was a nono but later in the show she actively tries to murder someone else. Also around the middle of the series when religion plays a heavy ass role, she starts to become dumber by the episode.Not like she sticks out because everyone else is just as bad, but i think JEFF THE KILLER IS THE WORST IN THIS ENTIRE SHOW,besides his annoying screaming,(which is ear grating in both the english and japanese dub) he is just stupid and loud and edgy and rude and he curses and OP at such a level where he can survive electrical chairs, poisonous venoms, and hes alright until suddenly hes not alright and now hes in danger of dying uhoh.Yeah, thats literally all about his character, he does start to grow on to Rachel and at the end its like he was actually an angel(get it because dats the tittle of thje show) but, his entire caring personality is just a dumb facade, he says this thing to Rachel where he is like “DONT DIE ON ME CUZ I WANNA KILL YA’(yes the caps were needed thats actually how he talks) but i dont see why people actually pity the guy and act like he was developed as a character when he wasnt really, he still wanted to kill the girl,so i dont see why hes so protective of her, is it a love thing??Also, the show actually put in the effort to explain the backstory of Jeff the Killer that is very accurate to the actual story of the actual Jeff the Killer, in which people be mean to Jeff, jeff snaps and kills them and (unlike other backstories that dive into the mind of the person on why they continue these horrible acts)he just kills even more random people because he’s super edgy and tumblr users can romanticise and make fanart of him as an anime fxxkboy(i mean, he even has the rude personality and the hooded jacket to go with it.).All the other characters are interesting, but that\'s the biggest overstatement ever,because they have at the most three different emotions and have no backstory or depth to really make them interesting.Except that stupid preist guy who needs to go back to preist school or whatever.The sound of the show is fine, the actual use of scary music makes things so overdramatic and its so damn loud.The only good sounding music was the ending song which was somber, depressing, catchy, and gave me the emotion that the show tried to give but failed.For a show that has this many bad qualities, I still kinda enjoyed it.Jeff the killer and Rachel were awful characters ,but they had some sort of chemistry that worked. Rachels and Jeff’s overly edgy backstories are ironically enjoyable because this story feels like it was made by a child who watched Erased and thought domestic violence automatically made a story good,.Also the “creepy characters” are just laughably goofy, and the actual dive into mental processing was not bad, but everything else was not that good and at one time the show actually predicted my experience when the first episode ended with one phrase”:...............kill me…...please”Overall-5If anyone out there is dealing with depression or thoughts of dying, please talk to someone, and don\'t talk to Jeff the Killer . i could just picture the objective sentence pop up on screen, but for the things i kinda enjoyed not ironically storywise,I like the first half of the first episode, everything else is absolutely repetitive and boring to such a point where i just didnt even bother taking this shit seriously anymore for how stupid it was.I\'ll break it down for you since I\'m a nice person.So, Rachel does this thing where since her parents died, she gets so depressed that she asks for Jeff the killer to kill her , but Jeff(I forgot his actual name because he has two of them ffs).wants to escape this building and since he\'s as dumb as a rabid dog, Rachel helps him, and she reminds him to kill her over and over and over and over and over to the point where I wanted to kill my own damn self, but besides that, most of the show is Rachel and Jeff talking to each other, getting into tame danger, talking some more, meeting with people, talking to them, and talking about religion for a long ass time.Religion as a theme is not a bad thing, but using it as a crutch to talk about it instead of focusing on the characters dealing with the dilemma themselves makes things more opinionated and uncomforting. Angels of Death kinda does both of those things, but it fails more than it succeeds,speaking of which.Religion in Angels of Death(*asterisks are around spoilers so watch out*)One thing that really kinda made me think about the show(and not in a good way"" was how religion was portrayed in the show.It puts religion on this weird spotlight and has this sort of message of religious people mostly use religion to fulfill their own corruptness or boost their own ego by having followers, which is very intriguing, but the way it\'s handled in this show is absolutely nonsensical,I mean it doesn\'t spend it\'s time trying to validate it, more of it\'s like this intangible and loose force that affects many people, but the majority of people in this show are psychopaths so their philosophies don\'t make a lot of sense.***For example, around the middle of series, Rachel just decides to make Jeff the killer a God despite him only being a human with no moral compass, or the other guy who pretends to be his own God in this weird building just because he wants to be the center of attention, but he kinda doesn\'t get the fact that the concept of a God is not to have the same natures of a human, so his whole experiment is kinda stupid.***i feel like the whole religious aspect was kinda thrown in just to gawk at religious people and look at them like spectacles when it\'s not really how it is in reality.For anyone who lives under  a rock,or resides on Reddit all the time, not all religious people are bad, you got some here and there who take it too far, but for the most part, they\'re just normal people trying to live a mentally healthy and happy life.Sure there was one promising scene where Rachel gets mad at Jeff the killer for saying that God doesn\'t exist, and she lashes out at him and that  actually expresses just how much religion really gave her hope, this would\'ve been able to balance out attitude of religion on individuals and make it less biased, but after that,any intention of cleverness never came back again and even then her caring about Jeff the killer,escaping,or anything for that matter  didn\'t make sense, because most of the time she just wanted to die..I\'m not arguing for or against religion, I\'m just stating the fact that the way it was handled in the show was kind of  nonsensical and convolutedAnyway, animation, JC staff made it, and as a studio, they\'re alright,I mean, they kinda had a rough ride after animating a sequel to a series that is infamous for having some of the best animations in modern 2d animation, (Thats One Punch Man if you didn\'t know)but honestly, the quality of the show is a spectrum that ranges top tier film budget quality to bland and boring, and it goes up and down that spectrum like a  carnival ride.First episode for example,includes some of the best animation I\'ve seen from them in literally forever, and there are some character animation that looks surprisingly good in other episodes, but for everything else, its kinda dull.The show does have some interesting shots and character designs,but all attempts of having a scary thriller atmosphere are kinda weak.Even during some of the show that takes place in a dark house seem kinda lifeless in terms of setting a tone, sure the house is super dark and blue but the bland cinematography kinda doesn\'t do anything for me.Alright, im not gonna sugar coat anything.All the characters are absolutely terrible, not one , not most, ALL OF THEM.There is not a single character that I liked, if one was just annoying and trying so hard to be an edge-lord, another one was just either stupid.contradicting, or had no depth at all.Starting down the list, we have Rachel, the girl who gets super depressed and wants to die, but at the SAME time tries way too hard to make an impression on her husbando Jeff the Killer(I think his real name is like Zeke or something IDK)but as i said before Rachel repeats the same thing over and over that I wanted to jump into the screen and slap that girl so hard that she died and this show could end. But at other times she is either so deadpan in the most dire situations that its kinda funny to not see any emotion out of her, trust me its not intentional most of the time.Not to mention her contradicting her own religious beliefs such as deciding not to commit suicide because God said it was a nono but later in the show she actively tries to murder someone else.

Wow, big surprise, I know. The MC wakes up being chased by a scythe-wielding maniac who she then asks to kill her, but he turns her down, saying he'll only kill her once they escape from the building they are in, where each floor houses its own killer and dangers. Episodes vary between physical confrontation, exploration, and insightful discussions.It's pretty great in terms of art but the plot is a bit lacking. The characters are a bit strange but that's part of the appeal, as the vast majority are murdering psychopaths. The plot does actually have...some twists but there is only so much plot possible in what can be boiled down killer escape rooms.If you like psychopaths, ethically dubious protags, or killing games then this is probably something you will like.

In the first few episodes it may feel nothing special and frustating but NO DEAR every episode has its meaning, you will understand when you keep watching.

You may also feel that Zach's bad because he is a serial killer, but he has a true soul without emotions, he kills people who smile and are hppy but doesn't know why.

Especially when Rachel was in the purple smoke.Sound: 9/10: Opening and closing theme songs were great. The piano rift with the ending theme reminded me a lot of Angel Beats. Both songs were catchy.Character 9/10: You immediately love Zack and Eddie, even though you know they are the bad guys. Zack was the foul mouthed, comedic relief to break some of the dark and horror aspects of the show. Rachel was a little getting use to, mainly because of her deadpan, monotone expressions. But she get\'s better as the show came to its final episodes, where she starts to show emotions and you begin to feel sorry for her. I love that there was a lot of character background information on everyone, development, somewhat, with Zack. The priest still gives me the creeps too.Enjoyment 10/10: How can you not?Overall 10/10: I loved it.

I really loved the characters after all , you found out why she wants to die when they got to her ...you'll find out , I m not giving any spoilers.Rachel will seem to be the typical  kuudere but as the episodes go by you will start to notice some emotions ,...in the end you will see an explosion of feelings.Story : 8Why? they could add more details , everything was so cryptic that sometimes left me a little confuse ( lucky , everything stars to have sens in the last 4 episodes  ) oh and the fact that we see the same conversations sometimes .The God thing? I still don't get some things about her obsession, some things  are clarified some not.Art 10:I LOVED IT . I really enjoyed it. Rachel was stunning and I loved how they added to her eyes the most details to make them as unique as possible .The floors arrangements represented the characters personality , it helps a lot in finding out more about who they are if you pay more attention on it.Sound 7:They could do better , but it was ok.Characters 8:8 because they really did a nice job with Rachel for me , from a sweet , scared girl with amnesia to a criminal it s a long way. Her looks as I said at art , it was stunning.About the other protagonist ,I loved  Zack from the beginning actually . Yes , he's not something special , the typical villain , the bad boy with a f***d up past but he was ok for me , the one thing that makes him more...unique it s the story about the  bandages that he s cover up with. What really I liked about him is not his appearance , his way of showing that he cares about her , a prove that in every evil is something good. At the beginning he can be annoying for some but you will like him , trust me , give the guy a chance , he s more than he shows in the first episodes.The other ones?I hate Daniel , we got that he has some ugly eyes , his obsession for pretty eyes and the mother thing.Eddie was a sweetheart , I liked him . His home really represented him and his actions that we found about shows his true self.The pink hair lady?Didn't like her , neither her laugh.The priest it s nice actually ', he s not a crazy psiho like the other characters.Enjoyment 9: not 10 because of some things that will annoy every human that will watch the anime .I don t have much to say about it , just give the anime a chance , you will  not regret it.Overall:8:They could do  better ,they could work more on this but it s alright like this too. is not for everyone this anime but give it a try and if you like something about it finish watching all the episodes.Have a nice day(night for some ) <3UPDATE: I just finished the anime.

Rachel, the protagonist, doesn\'t fully get rid of the dead look in her eyes. But she was slowly, ""Looking more human,"" as Zack even stated himself.

Smile.""I just found it so interesting how a serial killer, whose only thoughts are murder, is somehow warming up to a monotone little girl who begs him to kill her.

As the plot progresses, you can see how he changed his response from: ""When you don\'t make a boring face then I\'ll kill you"" to ""Smile and then I\'ll kill you.""', 'this is my first time writing a review for an anime so bear with me.at first i was very hesitant to watch this anime because it had quite a few bad reviews, but in the end, i\'m really glad that  i watched it.""Angels of Death"" or ""Satsuriko no Tenshi"" is categorized as ""psychological horror"" but i personally didn\'t think it was too scary. however, this anime is definitely not for vulnerable people. it covers a lot of extremely disturbing and intense themes and it takes quite a mental toll on you. mental illness is a big theme along with suicide and just death...in general.the main, and i\'d say only, problem i had while watching ""Angels of Death"" was how religion was constantly pushed down my throat. while the concept of God did play quite a big part in the story, i don\'t think it needed to be mentioned as often as it was. i myself am not religious, but i\'m sure that religious people watching this anime would find certain aspects quite offensive. it\'s a bit difficult to explain because a detailed explanation would include spoilers so i won\'t say anything more.contrary to other people who have written reviews, i actually believe ""Angels of Death"" was a rather fast-paced show that didn\'t drag the plot along.now if you\'re looking for an anime with a satisfying ending, you might like ""Angels of Death"". the ending of this show is EXTREMELY sad but also perfect. because of the plot of the show, i think its ending is the most proper one possible.and also, if you enjoyed the game ""Your Turn to Die"", you will most likely enjoy ""Angels of Death"", and vice versa.anyways, i doubt anyone will actually read this but i hope i explained everything considerably well.i hope you cherish this show as much as i do. enjoy :))[EDIT: i also forgot to mention that this show didn\'t unnecessarily sexualize characters, so that\'s good too lmao] in general.the main, and i\'d say only, problem i had while watching ""Angels of Death"" was how religion was constantly pushed down my throat. while the concept of God did play quite a big part in the story, i don\'t think it needed to be mentioned as often as it was. i myself am not religious, but i\'m sure that religious people watching this anime would find certain aspects quite offensive. it\'s a bit difficult to explain because a detailed explanation would include spoilers so i won\'t say anything more.contrary to other people who have written reviews, i actually believe ""Angels of Death"" was a rather fast-paced show that didn\'t drag the plot along.now if you\'re looking for an anime with a satisfying ending, you might like ""Angels of Death"". the ending of this show is EXTREMELY sad but also perfect. because of the plot of the show, i think its ending is the most proper one possible.and also, if you enjoyed the game ""Your Turn to Die"", you will most likely enjoy ""Angels of Death"", and vice versa.anyways, i doubt anyone will actually read this but i hope i explained everything considerably well.i hope you cherish this show as much as i do. enjoy :))[EDIT: i also forgot to mention that this show didn\'t unnecessarily sexualize characters, so that\'s good too lmao]', ""Satsuriku no Tenshi or Angels of Death is a very unique anime in my eyes. By no means was this an anime that blows anything out of the water, but the story line that is portrayed and the character development that happens along the way are very one off and unique to what you typically see in anime.Satsuriku no Tenshi houses a nitty gritty art style, with violence, gore & pretty dark graphics that could be enough to thoroughly bother people if you're new to those kinds of things. Personally, I feel as if they executed these graphics very well and while there are...definitely flaws, they made a pretty solid delivery of the messages and story they were trying to build and get across.While I feel the ending is left a little unsatisfying, I don't really think there was much more that could have been changed as this was not an anime that was meaning to have a happy ending, nor should it be one of those. I try and make my reviews without any spoilers in them so that anyone can read these, so I will let you learn for yourself what I mean by that. While the characters are loveable and you grow with them, you very quickly realize that there will not and should not be a happy ending for any of them.7/10 was the best that I could give for the anime as the flaws of it does drag it down a little bit, but between characters and story line, I don't by any means think that this series is not worth watching.

In fact, I can't even say what the plot is, because in my opinion I don't think it has one. It gives me the impression that this anime was made just for fighting and to show the audience what well-made characters it has. ART is a decent one .... nothing impressive .... moreover in some situations even quite stupid. I can't complain about the sound, but it's not one of the best.In short, I do not recommend this anime .... you can try the first few...episodes, but in my opinion it is a waste of time. episodes, but in my opinion it is a waste of time."", ""It's honestly kind of hard to get into it, but watching the show as a whole was totally worth it; you'll be in for a roller coaster of emotion. I'm a sucker for character development, symbolism, themes; nerdy literature stuff like that, and this anime is chock full of it. There are so many small details that they sprinkle into the show, and they're surprising details in hindsight.I also really love the character designs, I love the emotions and ESPECIALLY the voice acting. So much drama, many chills.I'm still in shock after just finishing the show. All I can say is that it's...definitely one of my all-time favourites. definitely one of my all-time favourites."", ""Absolutely incredible. I have watched this with my family and they agreed that it was quiet entertaining for them. Although all the characters have that same'psychotic'  personality they all executed their floors different ways. The religious approach it took was a bit uncomfortable to watch but I enjoyed it none the less. Its plot leaving you with so many questions is incredible ( in my opinion ). Every episode left me wanting to get to the next as quickly as I possibly could. One thing that I wasn't a fan of is the way screen time was distributed. It gave quite a big...of screen time to Zack, and Ray, which is understandable since they are the main characters, but seeing the backstory and motives for characters like Eddie would have been amazing. I was a bit dissapointed that they didnt go into depth bout the other residents of the floors, since they were decent characters.

However I read a few reviews, and I\'m sure I didn\'t watch the same show as most of you. For me this wasn\'t a comedy. I didn\'t feel the urge to laugh at all, yet I do think this is a quite good anime. It was oddly sad, despite the craziness going on. I can\'t say for sure there is a meaning in this show. Does it matter at all? I do not think so. All that matters is what the show has given you. It is pretty vauge, and it evoked a lot of thought in me.So...what is my interpretation of this ""on paper"" comedy?I do think most people doesn\'t have the neccessary experiences in their life to be able to see behind these characters, hence they just see them as comic relief. In reality though they are just empty shells of a human being. They are the depiction of the freigthening loneliness, and the deep desire to be important to somebody.This series is all about childhood trauma, depression and hopelessness. It depicts how remorse (/guilt) and the past shackles the characters (arguably it is better though). How they wish to be dead just to escape the emptiness. How they try to connect to somebody. This show depicts their own personal hell.It tells a story about how two empty husk who found each other fills each with life again. How the mutual understanding and desire gives at least some meaning to their life. How this helps to face their own deepest fears, and finally how they reach their salvation. Is this romantic or beautiful? No, it is really twisted and disturbing. The last hope of their shattered minds to cling to something.For me this show was all about the atmoshpere. The characters are not too complex, and the dialoges were quite repetative. However I think they were fine, since they were just manifestation of a certain feelings. The depiction of the emptiness and the atmosphere were excellent. In my interpretation the ""building"" is the ""inner self"", and it is a quite good analogy, since those feelings are desolate, yet violent even if it surfaces only as a lifeless eye. So all in all I would say it is quite good choice.I don\'t really know how is this funny though. Probably it is something wrong with me, if I don\'t laugh on other\'s despair and misery. Despite I have quite dark sense of humour, it looks like this is the line where I doesn\'t find something funny anymore. what is my interpretation of this ""on paper"" comedy?I do think most people doesn\'t have the neccessary experiences in their life to be able to see behind these characters, hence they just see them as comic relief.

I can see why a lot of people might not enjoy it since it (imo) contains a lot of symbolism and inference however that kinda thing I love because it's so fun to figure out. If you want something straightforward then this isn't the anime for you at all. Spoilers ahead as I'm gonna go in depth about my thoughts on the plot and my own theories so stop here if you haven't seen it yet.The plot is perfect. It's the kind of show that tells you how it's gonna end at the start and tbh if Rachel wasn't killed by...Issac I would've hated it. Throughout the show Rachel keeps asking Zack to kill her when they get outside which I found kind of annoying the first few episodes but over the course of the show it became more than that. It was reassurance of the promise they made at the start and the only concrete information there was. Despite all the twists or secrets Zack would kill Rachel and that was that.That philosophy of things being simple was shown a lot too. Rachel tries to justify her actions with any explanation she can and she tries to give reassurance of the promise by giving it greater meaning but at the end of the day that was one of her biggest flaws. Everything was just as it was with no particular deeper meaning to it. Her actions were her own and both she and Zack were killers nothing more or less yet she lies to herself to escape the truth of what she's done.Having said that there is no deeper meaning to them, the priest mentions that he thought Zack had invisible wings like a fallen angel which I somewhat agree with too in a way. He is the angel of death. From his character design that reflects the grim reaper (black colours, hood, hidden face/body, scythe) to his seemingly impossible actions (not dying, cutting iron/rocks, escaping prison, floating with Rachel at the end) he represents an angel of death in every sense especially in his intentions. Due to his background he sees his killings kind of justice. That happy people have blood on their hands and so don't deserve happiness and the sense of bringing justice is exactly how God is even if Zack doesn't think that much into it lmao. His way of killing is kinda changed by Rachel though. She isn't happy or scared and has suffered a ton but he still kills her and keeps his promise despite it not fitting in with how he usually kills. She is lifeless and shows no emotion, the exact opposite of Zacks victims but he still kills her.Rachel also breaks her own ideas by stopping her perfectionism. After her secrets are revealed she stops trying to get everything right which even Zack notices when she trips and he says she seems more 'real'. She places her trust in Zack despite Danny saying she doesn't trust anyone and I think it's because he sees her for who she is. She is constantly idolised by Danny and Ed, Cathy and the public both see her as somewhat innocent (Cathy never refers to Rachel as a monster and clearly sees her resolve as weak until she shoots her) and the Priest sees her as a witch. Zack is the only one who assumes nothing about her innocence or guilt. He breaks down her contradictions and ideology in a way that no one else could since they had preconceptions or predicted how she would act.The religious references are insane. From the doves where she sews one together at the start representing how she has twisted the idea of God into how she wants it to be to the smashing of the stained glass to escape physically showing how both of them shattered their own beliefs on the way and changed to the two doves flying away when they escape as if God was watching them or like both of their own ideas are flying away. It's amazingI've gone on a bit now but there's so much to say about the show it's insane the depth you can go into with all the philosophy, religious imagery, symbolism etc. I could go on forever about it all to be honest and I'm probably looking too much into it but I don't care XD Basically I loved it lmao which is why it's a 10 from me Issac I would've hated it.

However, they made it more than obvious with this anime adaptation. I\'ll come back to that later.And I have to make one thing clear right away. If you are an experienced horror/mystery/thriller fan and have even the ""slightest"" expectations, please be so good and save your time. There is nothing here that should be seen.I don\'t want to throw any prejudices at all, possibly the ""game"" is interesting. But what you get here as an...""anime adaptation"" is almost record-breaking. And it fascinates me why hardly anyone talks about it. Angels of Death"" is one of the worst and slowest anime adaptations you can find. And that even though horror/mystery were the focus here, these 2 genres that could create a decent atmosphere when played together.On a positive note, I liked the concept of the anime. Trapped in a building, unknowingly why and piece by piece the truth is revealed. I\'m honestly interested in whether the creator of the game has been a fan of -The Evil Within- and ""Saw"", because you could see clear parallels here. Which had pleased me all the more.The second good point about the anime is the protagonist. Good in the sense that she had at least some content until the end, even if it is very minimal.Well, now I come to that, whereby the anime failed miserably and in some areas could even be a record holder.The pacing - How do you manage to drag out scenes and dialogue to the point where you get to your 20 minutes? Quite simply, by showing characters going around for several minutes producing the same sentence on a continuous loop. The anime could have easily been completed in 12 episodes.The dialogue - And this hits me the hardest.  How and I mean really, ""HOW?!"" do you manage to have characters have the same conversations 2-3 times per episode and use the phrase ""Kill me"" ""You have to kill me"" ""You promised you\'d kill me"" and several other variations of it about 300 times in one anime? As soon as Rachel and Zack start talking to each other. You know what the theme is.  Even with episode 4, I thought they talked about it an impressive amount. But the fact that it stayed that way until the end stunned me.[Story 3]Aside from the amateurish execution, the actual plot is pretty standard for a mystery. This is naturally ruined by the poor characters, slow pacing, and lack of creativity. But it was at least present. Unfortunately, it lacked quite a bit of charisma. All the backgrounds, motivations, none of it is original in any way and everything is completely forced. Most of the backgrounds didn\'t even really possess a point of view. And I hardly want to talk about the ""story blocker"" arc ""The Priest"" - From this, you can see again brilliantly that it is originally a game. What is a game without the story blocker?In that sense, I come back to the ""game aspect"". The protagonist constantly interacted with the texts on the wall and with objects. Subsequently, she also tried to explain what it was about by talking to herself. In a game -ok-. In an anime adaptation -A Complete No Go-.You wake up in a room that is unknown to you. And what do you do first? Yes, you interact with a window and describe the big blue moon\', as a big blue moon. And then you start having a conversation with ghostly typewriters and reading all kinds of texts. There could be no greater torture for the viewer than something like that. It makes the characters feel like any NPC all the more.The 2/10 points are sole because of Rachel and the game from episode 5 that Zack was confronted with. Which caused an interesting reaction in him. Without Rachel\'s background at the end and Zack\'s confrontation with the dollhouse, I would have given the anime the lowest score.All of the antagonists are flat and lacking in content. The doctor? He only has 2 dialogues and possessed little relevance to the plot.Eddy? He also only possessed 2 different dialogues that he repeated over 2+ episodes.The psycho aunt? She escaped from some Danganronpa game and spent 80% of her screentime just laughing. And she had the most screentime of any antagonist.The priest? Storyblocker. He adds nothing to the plot except being the true antagonist and freezing the plot with his abilities. I wish I knew what it was like back in the game to see a comparison.Zack. He laughs, he screams, he doesn\'t know how to open doors, and he has about 30 times the blood that a grown man has. You could supply several hospitals with a blood donation with this guy.Rachel probably has the worst dialogue I\'ve heard in ages.  In the beginning, she was kind of likable, but this ended completely from episode 3/4 on.  From then on she was just torture for my eyes.And this is not even the worst. The ""side characters"" from the backgrounds have reached the highest point. What are they?Are they some parody of ""Disney"" villains? I\'m at least glad they didn\'t start singing. Seriously, they sit on a couch, drink wine and talk about how evil they are and how good they are at making bodies disappear. And when they\'re not, they\'re all just laughing madly and not saying a word. Especially Zack\'s background with the bandages. I don\'t know if I should laugh there, it was almost impressive. How motivations can just be replaced with ""maniacal laughter"". Well, eyes also say many words.[Animations 5]Mainly satisfying animations at the beginning, especially with the color scheme and underlining the gloomy atmosphere. In the Priest\'s arc, the animations slackened and later improved. I get the feeling that the producers didn\'t like this arc themselves. They barely bothered with his face, while characters like ""Danny"" constantly HD psycho gestures.[Music 6]The intro is average but showed some aspects of later episodes, so it possessed more content than expected.The osts have been relatively decent and definitely would have received more attention in another mystery/thriller. Here, unfortunately, they were left hanging as there was little to be saved.ConclusionWhoever thought it would be good to make this game an anime was wrong. There would be much better games that deserved an anime adaptation. Especially where you could still make something out of it.Here you can see once again that brutality and below-average twists simply can not achieve quality.Waste of my time and by far the worst mystery thriller I\'ve ever seen.

But a record is a record.Enjoyment - 1', ""(Spoilers)Satsuriku no Tenshi is a good anime that I watched, their some bits that have some flukes but this anime was decent.Story 7/10- (Spoilers) The story was ok as it was about a girl named Rachel whos wants to die by Zack's hands also known as Isaac who has killed many people and both of them with others were sent to an underground place where other psychos are there. Zack wants to leave this area so he promises to Rachel that if they get out he will kill her. So both of them go through each floor and reaches to the top until Zack was...taken by the police and Rachal was sent to a place to help her forgot about Zack but in the end, Zack comes back from prison, smashes through the window where Rachal is he grabs her jumping out the window and it ends there. (End) This is a nice story with a killer and a kind girl trying escape and then for her to choose to die and it is a nice way to end the anime as it might lead to how if they are alive or not but it was a beautiful way for it to end kind of how 91 days end their anime which was really good.Art and Sound 7/10- They were nothing bad about art as it had clean look to it and the opening was fine and I liked to listen to is every episode and sound effects and the soundtracks within really suit that gloomy, bloody moments in the anime.Character 9/10- The anime had really unique characters even though there weren't a lot it was good as all of them were psycho but in their own way and Zack is now one of my favourite characters from this anime due how psychotic and evil he as he had a lot of fun killing even though he was an idiot when it came to solving or doing things that made him think.Enjoyment 8/10- The anime was enjoyable, it had some funny moments within it. The action was good as Zack used a scythe to kill or slice through anything. Zack and Rachel had to find a way to leave the place they were in which was ok.Overall 7/10- I enjoyed this anime a lot with the characters and the story was ok and I enjoyed some of the moments within this anime. taken by the police and Rachal was sent to a place to help her forgot about Zack but in the end, Zack comes back from prison, smashes through the window where Rachal is he grabs her jumping out the window and it ends there. (End) This is a nice story with a killer and a kind girl trying escape and then for her to choose to die and it is a nice way to end the anime as it might lead to how if they are alive or not but it was a beautiful way for it to end kind of how 91 days end their anime which was really good.Art and Sound 7/10- They were nothing bad about art as it had clean look to it and the opening was fine and I liked to listen to is every episode and sound effects and the soundtracks within really suit that gloomy, bloody moments in the anime.Character 9/10- The anime had really unique characters even though there weren't a lot it was good as all of them were psycho but in their own way and Zack is now one of my favourite characters from this anime due how psychotic and evil he as he had a lot of fun killing even though he was an idiot when it came to solving or doing things that made him think.Enjoyment 8/10- The anime was enjoyable, it had some funny moments within it. The action was good as Zack used a scythe to kill or slice through anything.

The idea of God and promises holds strong throughout all of this, and it certainly didn't take any turns in the story that I thought it would take. I really could feel the cold emptiness of the main girl as she had truly just given up on life at that point. And then to watch the main guy get so turned off by her little desire to live. To see someone get so shut down emotionally and mentally....It happens to so many people in real life, and therefore it was extremely relatable. I think this was a good show with a good story and good ending. I think I might like this genre.Music:I would have to rate the music higher than most anything else in the anime because the sound was always on point with making every scene sound so creepy from your typical killer soundtrack to the religious piano music in the background. I thought it was all great. My favorite thing about the music was the outro music. It was so different and it just really stuck to me.Character:I thought it was interesting to see how all these characters had their own mental problems and dilemmas. The progression of the two main characters was very good and I thought that they were a great fit for each other. It was extremely relatable to watch the main girl go through dealing with hard times by just shutting down. To see how every single one of the people on each floor were affected by the girl and her attitude on life.Story:The anime story was rather intriguing and I loved how it all revolved around psychology and the human mind and heart of emotions. This was kind of like watching an anime of a Stephen King novel, where its rather deep in the aspects of the mind of every character. To watch them each break down in lust/love in one way or another, and to see how strong a desire can truly be. I felt like the show progressed at a good rate, and the ending was good. It certainly closed out the show with someone that could be called closure. It happens to so many people in real life, and therefore it was extremely relatable.

It was a unique anime, which I liked. It wasn't like anything I have watched before.

It isn\'t particularly amazing, but I was excited to see a TV adaptation of one of my favorite games.The game was much better, but that\'s not anything new. Anime adaptations of games usually tend to be lackluster. Steins;Gate is an exception.The thing is, this anime is meant to be super dark, deep, and terrifying. But it kind of fails at that. It doesn\'t do much to your emotions at all. What\'s supposed to be dark and scary is at most mildly frightening. It...doesn\'t leave any lasting impression. Even the tearful ending was lacking. The game does a much better job toying with your emotions.The animation is not astounding, but it does a decent job portraying what is happening. The art is also nothing special, but I like how they portrayed the characters. They adapted the original character designs well despite using a different art style.The opening animation is not the best I\'ve seen, but the music is pretty good. The ending theme is superb and does an amazing job at portraying the emotions that you\'re SUPPOSED to feel while watching the show. The OSTs are mediocre, and do occasionally add depth to the scene.The characters are lacking some of the personality that the game gave them. For example, Rachel\'s been adapted as a girl that wants to die. That\'s all. Just ""Please kill me."" It gets tiring after hearing it 500 times per episode. Zack is much better, and his seiyuu totally nailed it. His actual personality is not that complicated, but his seiyuu gave him much more personality just with his voice. In fact, all of the voice actors did an amazing job. It was one of the main reasons I watched it all.The anime changed a few plot points that were in the game, but they did it well. The altered parts flow well and do not take away anything from the story.Overall, the anime was decent, but its source is superior when it comes to characters and emotions.

I wasn't sure why it seemed more like a strange walkthrough of a video game, until I read that it was based on a video game shortly after episode 2 and that's when it all made sense. You totally feel like you're watching someone play a video game. I really dislike how the main character just loses all of her emotions after episode 1. Doesn't seem like its her character to do that under those circumstances (trying to be as vague as I can here to not spoil...anything). It's just really boring, and feels forced. anything). It's just really boring, and feels forced."", ""I felt like I was being thrown back into my early teens when watching this show. I can tell that it's really going for that 13-year-old girl with a crush on a long-dead serial killer fanbase. I saw some people in the comments saying that this was their first anime, and I am very sorry that this was their first impression of anime because it gets so much better than this. I guess everyone has to have their cringe first anime obsession though. I also feel obliged to mention that other people in the comments were talking about shipping Zack and Racheal and that is...just so wrong in so many ways. I can just see the disgusting fanfiction warping the impressionable minds of these children now.In my point of view, however, this show is just some low-tier horror garbage. Maybe the video game is better but I've never played it so I'm just going to talk about the anime. The story is pretty nonsensical and is never really fleshed out.  How did they get down there? It kind of seemed like Racheal lived there the whole time but also not? did they never eat or anything or drink? How long were they down there? Who did it and why? None of these things are ever explained. It seemed like they could have used the last episode to explain some of these things but the building is rarely mentioned. It seems like the weird religious stuff was supposed to feel really deep, but that kind of stuff rarely works unless you do it really well. I think a lot of shows will just throw Christian symbolism into their plots to make it feel more interesting and profound. When in reality it's just bullshit that covers up how boring and meaningless the show actually is.The characters ranged from boring and forgettable to completely nonsensical. A lot of them were just one-off villains who had very little screen time and I never really cared about. I also never really felt like Zack or Racheal were ever in any real danger from them. Zack was portrayed as almost superhuman and was constantly losing huge amounts of blood without any real consequences. And I knew Racheal wasn't going to die until possibly at the end because of the promise. Every time Danny appeared on screen I simultaneously wanted to laugh and cry because the fact that he was still alive was absolutely ridiculous every single time. He was really just being used to drive the plot along and force Racheal and Zack to go to different places to drag out the show. It really didn't need sixteen episodes at all. The message of the show also confused me. It portrayed these serial killer characters as these pure fallen angels who just happened to kill people. Not once does the series actually tell us this is a bad thing. We're just supposed to root for them anyway. I think you can like characters that kill people, but I don't think offing random dudes in an alleyway is supposed to be a positive personality trait.Overall I think that this show is not worth watching unless you're going to cringe watch it with some friends. just so wrong in so many ways.

From the looks of it, this anime is a true adaptation and very loyal one at that, to the original game. That being said, it is still garbage because you can't just have a loyal adaption to make a great horror anime."", ""Story - 5If I were playing the game, the story movement would probably be enthralling but as an anime, they didn't do enough to connect the pieces. The Protagonist and her companion move through each floor with several complications that are solved in a far too mundane manner.And as a horror... this is very lacking. I should feel the thrill or fear (especially as someone who doesn't like to watch scary stuff #scaredycat) but build up and execution is a continual failure.Art - 7I do quite enjoy the character designs and the dark aesthetics meshed into this anime.Sound - 5To me, there...seems to be something lacking with the soundtrack and some of the voice actors execution of their creepy characters.

The characters stick tightly to their character which is perfect! I almost thought they were going to push for unneeded romance between the duo but it seems they've stuck with they've presented.Enjoyment - 7I continue watching mainly because I've played games like the one this is based off before and that keeps me on the edge of my seat to see the hidden outcome by the end. seems to be something lacking with the soundtrack and some of the voice actors execution of their creepy characters.

And for the first episodes, it did help satisfy the audience, but overtime, the story decayed to a rather mediocre story led by weak characters, barely keeping the anime from collapsing into chaos.J.C. Staff did a great job with introducing Satsuriku no Tenshi, cleverly setting up the protagonists Zack and Rachel as well as a horror/mystery atmosphere. Many questions such as who Rachel and Zack were, where they were trapped in, and why they were trapped in the strange building were all well introduced in the first episode. If J.C....Staff had continued this quality of production, this show would have been amazing.Except they didn\'t.Just from the 2nd episode much of the atmosphere that J.C. Staff so nicely set up was almost nonexistent, as if it was completely ignored or wasn\'t even there in the first place. The horror feeling is gone, and the mystery just felt so lackluster. But it was only the second episode, and there was still a lot of hope remaining. Sadly, the story never picked up from this devastating injury; overtime almost everyone that was set up from the first episode is gone, no horror or mystery, as if it was entirely a new anime.Now Satsuriku no Tenshi tried to compensate for its poor plot with good characters which can work, but in order for this to work there needs to be great character development, background or backstory, and depth.Except there really wasn\'t.J.C. Staff tried very hard to create 2 great characters, Zack and Rachel, as they worked together to defeat the floor ""bosses"" and reach the top. And they both developed overtime, but the reasons why were very confusing. There was not really much to explain about the reasons behind their developments, their absolute loyalty to each other(other than their oath), and who they truly were as characters. It was very confusing, being thrown Rachel\'s ideals of God and Zack\'s backstory of why he became such a murderous man. J.C. Staff introduced these factors thinking we\'d understand or relate to the characters, but it only made things worse.The art is one of the only redeeming factors of the show, it nicely fits the ""supposed"" atmosphere of the anime and can be considered pretty high quality. The soundtrack is also pretty good, especially the ending song.I cannot stress enough how important characters or plot or both are to the overall story. Art and soundtrack are nice, they enhance the experience but they alone are barely enough to keep a show together. Art and sound are rather benefits, and to fully enjoy a series, there needs to be either good characters or good plot, or if possible, both. Satsuriku no Tenshi could not continue with their great set up in the first episode, and when they tried to compensate with better characters but failing to do so too, it ultimately just fell and became one of the season\'s greatest letdowns.

If you know that, you\'ll see many elements that are very common in such games – edginess, cryptic puzzles, travelling through levels with a new theme and an antagonist for every one of them... It\'s all very gamey and feels strange in anime form. All the characters are pretty much caricatures, someone loses 30 litres of blood without dying – everything is just comically exaggerated and over the top, like if the scale and tone of things from a top-down, pixelart game...was directly moved to the anime format. Sometimes to the point of being obnoxious – the ""warden"" lady was pretty much insufferable and it would take a much more gruesome death to make up for putting up with her for two episodes.So, is there anything to enjoy here? I\'d say yes. The bizarre climate and details of the whole thing make it very different from your usual horror anime and I definitely enjoyed the fresh take on the formula, even if it was quite ridiculous. The plot, as shallow and ridiculous as it generally is, has a bit of mystery and enjoyable quirkiness to it.The animation and voice acting are... Serviceable – it\'s not a high-budget show and you can clearly feel that, but it never goes in the way. In the end, it\'s not a particularly good anime, but something that feels different and enjoyable regardless – I\'m willing to recommend it just because it tried something very unusual and didn\'t fail in any major way. Whether that\'s enough of a recommendation for you... Well, you have to decide for yourself. was directly moved to the anime format.

Therefore, I will leave my final review on the ONA section of the show.Realize that some of the reviews have been given based on the first 4 episodes which i can firmly say was a totally different situation compared to where the show has taken us so far.Story: 8As for someone that have already done a total of 2 whole gameplay of the rpg, it might have heavily impacted on my overall judgement of the anime it is based off of. However,...what i can say about the pace of the story is that it is fairly steady and well in sync with the actual game. they don't seem to hastily breezes through the story and manages to hit almost if not all the key points on the game as well. I do look forward to whether they will continue with the game's story line all the way to the end or if they will implement an anime alternative ending for this game.Art: 8To be honest, there are a lot of shows out there right now with miraculous and amazing animations and unique art styles. However, the art style I would say make a huge improvement to the original game while being able to hold similarities with the art style and textures present in the game. As for character design, I found the characters to be drawn accurately based on each character's personality without losing reference to the game.Sound: 8I'd say that the ed fits this type of anime well better than the op but both have been executed well to the point that I feel satisfied. I would've given sound a 9 if they were to use some of the original ost from the rpg but the background music used delivers the same effect as the original ost so no complaints here.Characters: 8i think we can agree that compared to episode 1, the characters begin to show development in characterization especially for rachel and zack.Enjoyment: 8I tend to enjoy shows especially those that are based off of video games. Most of my enjoyment can be coming from nostalgia from my first play through of the game. However, I can firmly say as this point of the anime that even without the experience from the rpg, I would still enjoy this show as much as anyone else would.Overall: 8If you don't want to have the anime spoiled then I'd say hold off the game that does exist for this anime for now.

Rachel seemed like a sweet innocent girl and towards the end you find out her truth. I enjoyed the mystery in that and anticipating what her background was. That did not disappoint, but I did get my hopes up too high on the relationship between Rachel and Zack. I was kind of hoping for a deeper sort of relationship between them.Spoiler:I was kind of hoping they were going to end up together as in become killers together or at least have seen what she wanted him to do to her, especially since...it's all she talked about throughout the entire show. But neither happened. So I was fairly disappointed and it kind of ruined the entire experience because I was not able to get full satisfaction so if you are like me then you won't really like the show unless you prepare yourself and just enjoy the show for what it is.The anime was fine but I can't say I recommend it. it's all she talked about throughout the entire show.

Now i have not played the game, this is solely my review on the anime.Story: The story, without any spoilers, but enough to give you a sense of what angel of death is about is basically, there\'s a girl named Rachel gardner. She suddenly wakes up in this room where she has no memlry of how she got there. The whole ""plot"" is for her to escape this place. She must overcome other people in this building, that ""surprisingly"" enough are trying to kill her.Art: Nothing special here, but nothing...awful. Was a pretty mediocre art style.Sound: I fell in love with the ending soundtrack, it\'s honestly beautiful, but a shame that it\'s in this anime. But a good thing at the same time because if it weren\'t, j wouldn\'t have found the END soundtrack. Would suggest giving it a listen. Opening is just fine imo.Sound in the actual anime is okay, not bad neither outstanding.Characters:Rachel gardner: oh boy, the dread awful characters. Rachel is a quite, and quite BORING character that you don\'t even want to root for. And you\'re supposed to since she\'s trying to escape. I understand that they were trying to make her a emotionless character, but viewing 6 episodes, and not until ep 7 does she show little growth is plain awful.Zack: it is later revealed why he acts the way he does, but it\'s done so poorly. To sum him up short he\'s a serial killer, who has an obnoxious laugh throughout the anime.Other supporting characters: They just want to kill them causs they want to... weak characters for sureEnjoyment: Do you love a whole episode being a cliffhanger?

After certain events, they agree to absurd terms where he promises to...kill her once they escape.*SPOILERS HERE*it turns out she killed her parents, the main antagonist is some dude that tries to figure out how religion works and is on the second to last floor.*SPOILERS END*Art style is ok, it isnt amazing, but it isnt bad or eye hurting generic.

Sometimes they acted in a realistic manner and sometimes they were refusing to accept such thing as physics and logic.Both main characters were edgy ""traumatic background"" sad cliche personas.Didnt enjoy them, their enemies lacked proper background and motivations (they had some but they were bland and didnt really protrude).*SPOILERS AHEAD*Enjoyment my overall opinion:So lets get to the core, my main issue and the thing I find interesting to talk about is the fact that the whole anime seems so ironic and self aware.It seems that some illogical facts during the anime are pointed outs by characters, making it either very clever or an accident because of the fact that rest of the show seems very serious.So thats the main thing that struck me positively.But I do consider this anime to be a serious show and not some kind of deliberate caricature of cliched series.And thats the problem, it\'s trying to be edgy, but ends up being cringy with vague nonsensical and cliched characters (loli blue eyed blond quiet yet caring character with emotional problems, a middeschooler edgelord dream girl, a tall bandaged guy being all about killing and trauma, in a hoodie with a giant scythe, grotesque ""psycho"" yet ""loveable"" (cough cough) characters)they all seem like the target are introvertic edgy kids, making it quite a cringy experience.The show doesn\'t really explain motivations, Our character Rachel on one hand is emotionless, on the other she\'s cliched triggered by certain words or actions, which makes her ""unique"" for everyone in the building for some reason different for everyone (the eye motive is bad and lets all admit it), she contradicts herself by shooting the judge, yet refuses to commit suicide.There are many more problems with her character and the story but lets move on to the nextZack kills because of some trauma (doesn\'t really explain this kind of urge and sympathy towards main protagonist, its either vague or doesnt have sense, as if writers thought that we would take it for granted and move on... also the blind nice old guy cliche was such a bloody cheap move), Eddie who\'s main trait is that he likes graves, we don\'t know how come he\'s inhumanly agile and supposedly can become invisible (ye ye, he\'s great at hidding, but the anime straight up shows that he dissapears and his agility doesnt make it easier to explain.An obsessive doctor who is very very fond of eyes (I never really heard why exactly apart from the fact that he has a bad eyesight)A Sadistic judge (cant remember her name), she enjoys giving ""justice"" in her own twisted sense of justice (looks like a character from Danganronpa and is just as irritating as Zack with her laugh)A priest that tries to create his own religion (which is literally like catholism, so much it makes our protagonist think that way till the very end, just until he doesnt explain it; also witch and inquisition cliche)He\'s similar to other villains who\'s causes are ""motiveted"" by something bigger.

So far, it has taken some unexpected but not totally amazing twists and turns. Rachel is a bit confusing of a character, and the male MC seems a bit out of touch with his own feelings., While we get a glimpse into who he is, Rachel still remains a bit of a mystery. I will add, and...this isn't a spoiler, that the first episode seems to be crucial to the plot. So far this anime seems to be the kind that ends up all falling together in the end so I believe (and am hoping for) a conclusion that will unveil a deeper meaning.Anyways, that being said. If you are intersted in a show that has a bit of a danganropa (spelled it wrong and I know it, sorry) feel, a bit of some gore (but not anything too crazy), and a dash of puzzle and mystery this will prove to be an interesting watch! this isn't a spoiler, that the first episode seems to be crucial to the plot.

After watching all of the episodes however, I change my mind.Plot: 2/10There's so many plot holes. Who create such game? Who is the mastermind behind all these chaos? What exactly makes Rachel Gardner so special? None of my many questions were answered even after I have watched the entire episodes. The plot is ridiculously unrealistic in terms on how the characters react to different situations. What is the goal of this anime? I can't see it.Gore elements? None. Sure there's blood...here and there but it's nothing gory, nothing worth gasping or chilling over.Characters: 2/10Holy, I hate Rachel's character the most. Her character is boring, typically cold, mysterious main character who has no goal in life and is so overly obsessed with the concept of dying in the name of God. Which is ridiculous considering she is one of the sinners.Isaac's character is shallow though kind of interesting. With the amount of blood he loses between episode 8 to 11, I think he probably should've died.The priest's character is not explained well it got me confused. All in all, I couldn't love even one single character in this anime.Over all: 2/10I felt like I wasted so many times watching all episodes of this anime. I keep on waiting and waiting for it to surprise me, to entertain me, even just a little, I keep on giving this anime a chance. But it's... just so disappointing.Not recommended at all. here and there but it's nothing gory, nothing worth gasping or chilling over.Characters: 2/10Holy, I hate Rachel's character the most.

Despite all the shows I have seen, it has been ages since an anime that would actually move me so much. This one is really great, with all it's great aspects and flaws. Zack's voice actor actually did a splendid job for voicing him! Loved every bit of it. Keep in mind I only watched the anime.To begin with, the story is rather complex since we have a psychological genre. The two main characters are Ray and Zack. I must admit I loved watching their relationship throughout the whole story. At times I...would think the guy would do something incredibly cringe, opposite of what I wish he did at the time (in my mind), yet he does what I imagined in the first place and with a unique twist on it. I just couldn't believe how I loved being deceived and fulfilled all at a time. This isn't your typical 6+ score anime - it actually will move you, make you laugh, make you sad, make you desperate for certain things to happen. You will witness good character development and weird interactions, but you will (maybe) get it because it is a rather odd and deep show. The art is actually stunning! I couldn't find a single flaw in it which means it is actually very polished. There were literally only small little details that nobody would notice such as some birds being animated averagely.All things considered, it is great, but taste played the major role here. If you got a different taste, you will most likely will not like it. I myself believe this to be what captures a good show from the rest - I would definitely place this among the better ones in my list, however, it is only my own opinion, so I hope it helps if you decide to watch it! It is a good watch, a good experience, and a good lesson altogether.

It is a good watch, a good experience, and a good lesson altogether. Have fun!"", 'Story:The story was interesting enough to follow it in spite of its flaws--there were some very specific plot points that were alluded to from the very first episode... And while I love a nice, good dose of foreshadowing, in this case, it just felt... forced. They were constantly throwing back in our face that we do not understand the characters we are seeing before us, to the point where when it came time for the plot twists at the end... (this applies to the end of the 12th episode, mind)... there was no element of surprise left to be had. You were approaching the...episode from a standpoint of ""Okay, so we know there\'s something fishy here, but what is it?"" From a viewer perspective, that sort of anticipation only propels an audience to continue watching if it\'s done subtly. The sort of exasperated anticipation just leaves a feeling of ""Okay, this better be good, or else I just wasted a few hours of my life I ain\'t ever getting back."" And frankly, the plot twist was not good enough for that to be an effective mechanism. Most of the ""twist"" was just stuff we either knew or easily could have guessed from early on.There\'s also an overwhelming sense with the pacing that... you can just tell it was based off of a video game, even if you\'ve never heard of the aforementioned game. Certain scenes make sense when you consider how they would be used in your standard indie horror game, but when you apply them to real life, or even to an anime... It just doesn\'t seem like it should work quite like that. I have had zero exposure to the game, so I cannot comment any further on that, but I do believe that when making a series about a video game, a viewer should not watch it and within the first episode think ""...am I watching an anime or a video game?""I will say, however, that I did appreciate how even though the beginning of each episode started with the last few seconds to a minute of the prior episode, there was usually something new added before the opening sequence, so it didn\'t feel overly repetitive. It was more like ""We showed you this already, but here\'s more details."" I liked that because I don\'t want to waste my time on something I\'ve already seen. This sort of gentle reminder as to where the last episode left off plus fleshing it out more to lead into the current episode? Good storytelling. Works for both people who had to step away from the series for a period of time and for people watching everything close to the same time.Most of my other qualms with the plot revolve more extensively around the characters than the plot itself, but I will reiterate: The show\'s foreshadowing was not exactly the most agreeable and the plot twists were far too obvious to have any element of surprise. The show was too predictable, but the story somehow managed to keep me hooked in spite of that, so I\'ll give it a solid 6.Art:Okay, the visuals for this anime? Better than most I\'ve seen. You can see not just the expressions of the eyes but also the highlights in the eyes reflecting characters\' emotions, when a character is injured it doesn\'t just magically fade away in the next episode, you can tell on the characters\' clothes which stains are older and which are newer (a lot of shows forget about holes and stains from one episode to the next), and camera positioning as well as choreography are both used very nicely to convey characters\' emotions.I cannot say enough: I love the choreography for this show. From episode 1 to episode 12 (or episode 16 if you stuck with it until the ""real"" ending), you can clearly see body language of the characters being used very expressively, to the point where you can clearly connect it to how a real actor would portray that scene. There aren\'t a lot of static frames/segments, and where they do exist, they\'re used to create tension.The designs of the characters were very simple (which I assume is due to faithfulness to the original game?), but the art style for the anime allows enough detail for them to feel lifelike in spite of their simplicity, and the art and visual cues are used to reflect each character\'s personality, and I repeat, the choreography also helps this.The backgrounds are well-done and set the scene for each location, and visual symbolism is used throughout the series to reflect each character and each plot point\'s implications.I would rate the visuals at a solid 10. The visuals played a significant role in my continuing to watch this series through to the end.Sound:Due to the nature of this anime as a horror-based show, music and sound effects can make or break any scene... and I would say that in terms of music and sound effects, this show nailed it. You can tell the weight of objects and the materials of things based on the sound effects, and music is used to create tension--and most importantly, it succeeds in doing so. The music is just subtle enough to not tell you anything the anime isn\'t already throwing in your face.The voice actors also definitely fit the characters. They were all skilled in such a way that they managed to portray their characters and convey the personalities of their characters very well. With the exception of some of the laughing sounding off to me, I can\'t say the VAs were bad--at least, not the Japanese ones.The opening and ending were also both very nice and pleasing to the ear, even though I personally skipped the ending sequence a lot because I don\'t listen to slower songs particularly often. The opening, however, was a good song that I didn\'t skip a single time because I liked it that much.Unfortunately, while I do remember that the music was used well to strengthen the pacing and the emotions evoked by a scene... all I can remember of the music from episode-to-episode is that it wasn\'t bad. I know it did well at what it did, but... Ultimately, everything besides the opening was... pretty forgettable. For that reason, I\'ll give it a 7.Character:Onto the biggest complaints I have about the series as a whole is the characters. They were all enjoyable to watch. Unique enough to be memorable in spite of their flaws.But.Throughout the plot, most all of the characters were portrayed in a light that highlighted one specific trait they were ""known"" for, and while those traits were usually explained, there wasn\'t... depth to the characters beyond that. You don\'t see multi-faceted characters with intricate personalities... You see single- or maybe double-sided characters (though that\'s... debatable), but you don\'t really see complex emotions and while it\'s highly implied, if not directly stated, that some of the characters have some form of psychosis, the story does nothing to understand the actual effects and treatment of psychosis (or any potential mental illnesses, for that matter). They\'re just given a side of crazy to make the plot more creepy.That said, the characters were interesting enough to keep me watching in spite of this... The characters were likable enough for me to sit through 12 episodes with them and there was character development, however minuscule, to make me want to see how they would continue to grow as the plot continued. For portraying these sorts of one-track characters in an interesting enough fashion for me to see it through to the end, I\'ll give it a 6.Enjoyment:For all its faults, I will say that I personally found this show greatly entertaining for what it was, and I have a lingering attachment to some of the characters, even if I think they could have been written better. The ending (note: referring to the ending of episode 16) fit the characters perfectly and was a perfect resolution to the storyline. Everything we needed to know for that story was revealed and none of the plot points were left as holes.It\'s one of those shows that mostly appeals to people who like horror themes with an emphasis on psychosis, but as someone who eats that stuff up, I found myself going back and rewatching it. I highly enjoyed this... but I have to doc points off for it being annoyingly transparent and some of the character arcs just... not being interesting to me from a personal standpoint. I\'d recommend this anime to people who enjoy horror, suspense, and a focus on psychological themes in horror and suspense and who don\'t mind religious undertones, but ultimately, it\'s not something I would recommend to just anyone. I would rate it as a 7.Overall:Overall, it has an intriguing story and an interesting enough plot to sit through 16 full episodes. As an experience, there were plot twists that caught me off guard, and the first episode was compelling and confusing enough to pique my curiosity. While the pacing of the story is a bit awkward and the story is very transparent, the visuals and music help to make up for where it is lacking, and the choreography is very expressive and well-thought out. The suspense elements were just strong enough to make up for the predictability of the plot and the simplicity of the characters. For what it is, I\'ll give it a 7, but if it had been a little less obvious as an anime based off of a game, I might have given it an 8 or even a 9. episode from a standpoint of ""Okay, so we know there\'s something fishy here, but what is it?""

I\'ll start out being saying the sound and art are alright, but that should be a given for all anime. Pretty much everything else is an absolute drag. It is easy to imagine the type of audience for this kind of anime/manga/game because it hits perfectly on all the sappy love story notes. The thing with this anime is that all the ""romance"" aspects were spun into a really contrived psycho-horror semantic word game. Like everyone is talking about ""being together forever"" and ""not wanting to be alone"" and all that stuff but under the pretense of murder....It just has me sitting here thinking, ""ya know, what\'s the point in any of this?"" In any other context, it\'s a generic adventure-romance story with two protagonists who are so very obviously going to get together in the end, but because Rachel says it like, ""I only want Zack to kill me. He promised."" and Zack being like, ""I never lie"" then the crowd goes wild? And speaking of the dialogue, the verbal tap dancing in Satsuriku no Tenshi is just dreadful. I was so tired of hearing Rachel repeat herself over and over that even Zack had enough after the first few times. I understand that Rachel is cute (and boy, is she cute), but that\'s no excuse for this writing that sounds like it came from a middle schooler who just started writing romance novels. So many ideas could\'ve been conveyed in a fashion that wasn\'t so hamfisted; it felt like this anime was force feeding me the whole time. Something that would\'ve improved this anime was more humor, because it doesn\'t really take itself that seriously either. I was expecting there to be humor similar to that of Gugure! Kokkuri-san where there is some seriousness there, but it\'s deflated using well-timed jokes and slapstick comedy. Instead, the forced dread piles up like a stock market bubble and the few quirky moments sprinkled in between don\'t really add depth to any of the characters. They\'re all crazy, loud, mysterious, or drab or a random combination of these qualities. Satsuriku no Tenshi is a circular, verbose, tedious, and just straight-up boring anime, but if you\'re a damaged person or a hopeless romantic, and are slightly demented, you might find this pulling on your heartstrings.

Like, heck, why did they change one of Catherine\'s obstacles into a fricking dollhouse... it was originally an abyss with several narrow columns spaced far away from one another as their only support to cross to the other side... that or a rope so thin it could break... not to mention that at random moments guns would shoot them and potentially lose their balance and fall into their deaths. That, and they went on their separate ways because Zack can\'t cross using the rope and Rachel can\'t jump too far between the columns......I\'m getting off-track, back to the anime itselfYes, I can understand why people could hate the anime without knowing the original source first... because it was originally a game, hence the puzzle-solving aspects and the each-floor-is-a-new-challenger-kinda thing. And that I felt that each of the ""villains"" was not given enough ""tension"" and their resolve and character was not properly adapted (in my humble opinion), that\'s why anime-watchers only didn\'t connect enough with them and didn\'t feel their presence enough to be intimidating (like, if they made this with two seasons with 24 episodes total, they could have expanded and put up each of the villain\'s back story, which was available in the manga adaptation... *shrugs*)But then, sure it was quite disappointing but like I said at the beginning, I loved the game because of Zack and Ray, and that really, it was said at the summary of the anime that this is about the two of them and their strange promise at one another and their obstacles that they face in each floor. And the floor bosses actually served each of their purpose... to put up a psychological damper in both Zack and Ray.Edward Mason, his resolve in putting Rachel in eternal rest due to him knowing Ray\'s past was because his past (I won\'t spoil them here, read the manga instead) shaped him into a character that turns those that he kills and buries into his treasures and that became his form of love... thus his desire to end Ray\'s misery.Catherine Ward, with her strong belief and prejudice that knows no bounds (her backstory in the manga just emphasized that), and that she truly believes in her own power of condemning those she hails as criminals... no exceptions. But it was her observing nature and beforehand knowledge that makes her a threat to Zack and Rachel\'s relationship. I like to think of her as a prosecutor that explains her reasons and views... before mercilessly killing those she found guilty.Danny Dickens... as his name implies, he\'s a d***...lol sorry got carried away there, He deserves to be the main antagonist of this series due to his connections with Rachel and his past. I absolutely loved his character development the most and I thank the anime for actually fleshing out his resolve and desires... (ep. 16... ""...mother!""... seriously, I don\'t remember him saying that in the game but it made his character closure so much better!).And lastly, Gray (lol I just searched the character list and apparently, his last name is Abraham haha good to know). He is the most mysterious character out of all of them since we don\'t know much about him. All we know is that he\'s the ""god"" of the building that our protagonists are trapped in and that he\'s the one leaving those cryptic messages that Rachel sometimes find in some of the floors. Yes, he does attempts to kill Rachel at one point but that is after evaluating her and giving her trials and tests that would let him assess her morals. I would spoil if I keep on talking about him so watch the anime instead.I think the reason why people didn\'t like the anime because they thought since this has a boss-per-floor thing, the action scenes will be the focus.

Not here.The main obstacles are not the ones that are physically present (strength of the enemy), but rather, it was the situations that is presented by each of the villains that is the real threat to our protagonists.It was a battle... a clash of ideals.With our two protagonists right at the center, their decisions and inner workings of their minds shaping the series. They adapted Zack\'s and Ray\'s relationship with each other so well that I actually teared up in one of the later episodes due to how good it was.Okay, I talked enough.As a fan of the original source, I\'m happy with how they adapted this anime.(*whispers* EPISODE 16 IS EVERY GAME/MANGA/LN \'S DREAM COME TRUE)As a fan of the game, I watched it for Zack and Rachel. I am more than satisfied.9/10 (-1 because despite it being a great adaptation of the game, It lacked some charm that the game had. But then, they overwhelmed me with the anime ending so all is good <3) As a fan of the game, there are ups and downs on how they did the anime. Like, heck, why did they change one of Catherine\'s obstacles into a fricking dollhouse... it was originally an abyss with several narrow columns spaced far away from one another as their only support to cross to the other side... that or a rope so thin it could break... not to mention that at random moments guns would shoot them and potentially lose their balance and fall into their deaths. That, and they went on their separate ways because Zack can\'t cross using the rope and Rachel can\'t jump too far between the columns......I\'m getting off-track, back to the anime itselfYes, I can understand why people could hate the anime without knowing the original source first... because it was originally a game, hence the puzzle-solving aspects and the each-floor-is-a-new-challenger-kinda thing. And that I felt that each of the ""villains"" was not given enough ""tension"" and their resolve and character was not properly adapted (in my humble opinion), that\'s why anime-watchers only didn\'t connect enough with them and didn\'t feel their presence enough to be intimidating (like, if they made this with two seasons with 24 episodes total, they could have expanded and put up each of the villain\'s back story, which was available in the manga adaptation... *shrugs*)But then, sure it was quite disappointing but like I said at the beginning, I loved the game because of Zack and Ray, and that really, it was said at the summary of the anime that this is about the two of them and their strange promise at one another and their obstacles that they face in each floor. And the floor bosses actually served each of their purpose... to put up a psychological damper in both Zack and Ray.Edward Mason, his resolve in putting Rachel in eternal rest due to him knowing Ray\'s past was because his past (I won\'t spoil them here, read the manga instead) shaped him into a character that turns those that he kills and buries into his treasures and that became his form of love... thus his desire to end Ray\'s misery.Catherine Ward, with her strong belief and prejudice that knows no bounds (her backstory in the manga just emphasized that), and that she truly believes in her own power of condemning those she hails as criminals... no exceptions. But it was her observing nature and beforehand knowledge that makes her a threat to Zack and Rachel\'s relationship. I like to think of her as a prosecutor that explains her reasons and views... before mercilessly killing those she found guilty.Danny Dickens... as his name implies, he\'s a d***...lol sorry got carried away there, He deserves to be the main antagonist of this series due to his connections with Rachel and his past. I absolutely loved his character development the most and I thank the anime for actually fleshing out his resolve and desires... (ep. 16... ""...mother!""... seriously, I don\'t remember him saying that in the game but it made his character closure so much better!).And lastly, Gray (lol I just searched the character list and apparently, his last name is Abraham haha good to know). He is the most mysterious character out of all of them since we don\'t know much about him. All we know is that he\'s the ""god"" of the building that our protagonists are trapped in and that he\'s the one leaving those cryptic messages that Rachel sometimes find in some of the floors. Yes, he does attempts to kill Rachel at one point but that is after evaluating her and giving her trials and tests that would let him assess her morals. I would spoil if I keep on talking about him so watch the anime instead.I think the reason why people didn\'t like the anime because they thought since this has a boss-per-floor thing, the action scenes will be the focus.

But without further adieu let's head to the story floor (you'll get it if you watch the show).Story: We start of with young Rachel Gardner who wakes up in a room...with no memories of her recent events believing she is in the hospital after a gruesome accident involving her parents. When she finds out she's not in a hospital she gets on the elevator which takes her one floor up where she runs into a scythe wielding maniac who's determined to kill her. She manages to avoid capture and reach floor 3 where she meets a familiar face, Doctor Nutjob (not really his name), or Eddie who seems to have a huge fascination with blue eyes and wants to extract Rachels, but Scythey McSythey wants to contiue the chase and heads to floor 3, after spoiler type things happen Rachel finally remembers that tragic memory about her parents and asks Scythey Mcscythe to kill her, he loses interest and offers to do the deed if she helps him get out of the crazy floor maze because he's dumb as a brick  and she wholeheartedly agrees and while they ascend they learn more about each other, for better or for worse. To mean thats a solid 9/10 story.Characters: Let's start with Rachel Gardner (sense you'll hear this name CONSTANTLY throughout the show), She's not your typical little girl, after she remembers somethings important, her eyes are cold and lifeless and she becomes the extremely dependent on Zach and his Scythe attack (brain and braun type thing) and has a strange fascination with god. Throughout the show you'll she her making decisions that ultimately are to her own personal benefit and that will be confronted later on.Now let's move on to Zach attack who absolutely hates Rachel's new face and wants her to smile throughout the show so he head actually get up the nerve to kill her when hes finally out. Zach is abrasive, loud and can't read (which is somewhat important), he's always covered in bandages and is practically invincible when hit with normal attacks. He becomes less chaotic as they continue but still is a murderer at heart.As for the other characters i don't want to spoil everything about them so lets just give them nicknames, First Doctor Eyelove, Second Happy Happy Grave Boy, Third Ms. Drunk on Punishment, and Forth Mr. Narcissist (who overall had the most corny-stupid and best lines of all the side characters IMO).With our interdasting cast of freaky friends i'd give them a all a 8/10.Art: The art style wasn't bad but wasn't like timeless either, I really enjoyed the faces in this show and the grim atmospheric colors but besides that it was standard so 7/10.Sound: Most of the time i rate this based off the opening or songs in the show, but the background music helped set the tone of the show so i can't complain about that, 8/10.Enjoyment: I waited to binge watch out to episode 10 or 9 and it really got me in the psychological mode, i'd say its weakest point was i believe episode 11 but overall i can overlook it and with its (to be continued) message at the end perhaps they got approval for a sequel, of which if its true i would enjoy to see how things go in the next season so i'd say it was a solid 8/10 in terms of my enjoyment factor.Overall: i give this show the overall rating of 8/10, it would have been 9/10 if not for the 11th episode, a cop out situation (i won't say for spoilers), and the to extreme attitude adjustment of Zach. (which is also why it's not a 10/10) I recommend that people go watch this cause its worth your time if you like Psychological type stuff.Let me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I’m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own “anime records” so to speak, so if you see this and don’t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for my record than anything in the long run. with no memories of her recent events believing she is in the hospital after a gruesome accident involving her parents.

Not all were answered, but nonetheless, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than expected.First of all, the story is solid, though a little open-ended. There's a lot of room for interpretation in every part, where you could take it as a metaphor for something else, for example. They make heavy use of symbolism, which may be off-putting to some, and really interesting to others. I thought it was good food for thought, so it made it all the more enjoyable for me.Its often very obvious that...it was once an RPG, as characters have voice lines that feel a little out of place within the anime, but would make perfect sense if you were playing as Rachel. Just something to keep in mind, as it could break immersion.I loved the art. It's got a clean, easy on the eyes feel that feels just right. Where needed, it reflects the atmosphere well, and portrays gorgeous, dynamic scenes. No complaints here.The soundtrack was very reminiscent of classic pixel horrors for the most part, with certain themes repeating a lot more than expected. Ending wasn't very memorable, but the opening was stuck in my head for a day or two. Tldr; did its job.The characters are probably my favourite part of the anime, though not all are created equal.I have a soft spot for problematic, sadistic characters, so the shows efforts to make the viewer sympathetic to a literal serial killer worked wonders on me. I thought Zack was fun and cathartic to watch, though his constant shouting did get on my nerves at times (watched the dub, maybe this is different for the sub). I know many people would find him a little one-dimensional, but I applaud the show's efforts to make us feel this uncomfortable sympathy towards him.Rachel I find a little more uninteresting. She's a classic kuudere, which I don't necessarily mind, but she keeps spouting the same lines over and over. At least there's some clear growth throughout the anime, and you see her (very slowly) peek out of her shell. The dynamic between her and Zack makes it all worth it.The supporting cast is surprisingly enjoyable. I thought a lot of them would just have their episode and be cast aside shortly after, but that wasn't the case. They offer much needed diversity, but sadly, aren't much more than that (except for two, who offer a surprising twist/clear up what the viewer might not have understood of the story).I just really, really enjoyed this. Made me feel unexpected feels. If you're feeling like a bit of an edgy, but also comedic series might be what you need, I wholeheartedly recommend. it was once an RPG, as characters have voice lines that feel a little out of place within the anime, but would make perfect sense if you were playing as Rachel.

I thought Zack was fun and cathartic to watch, though his constant shouting did get on my nerves at times (watched the dub, maybe this is different for the sub). I know many people would find him a little one-dimensional, but I applaud the show's efforts to make us feel this uncomfortable sympathy towards him.Rachel I find a little more uninteresting. She's a classic kuudere, which I don't necessarily mind, but she keeps spouting the same lines over and over. At least there's some clear growth throughout the anime, and you see her (very slowly) peek out of her shell. The dynamic between her and Zack makes it all worth it.The supporting cast is surprisingly enjoyable. I thought a lot of them would just have their episode and be cast aside shortly after, but that wasn't the case. They offer much needed diversity, but sadly, aren't much more than that (except for two, who offer a surprising twist/clear up what the viewer might not have understood of the story).I just really, really enjoyed this. Made me feel unexpected feels. If you're feeling like a bit of an edgy, but also comedic series might be what you need, I wholeheartedly recommend."", ""I appreciate the anime's story, message, and plot. However, it's not executed well. The initial episodes grabbed my attention, where Rachel Gardner was stuck in a deadly building. I enjoyed the mystery/thriller theme. However, the rest of the show was just her wishing she were dead after witnessing a gruesome murder. She doesn't want to keep living, and she makes that known when she meets Zack and asks him to kill her. Her negative attitude draws Zack's attention to her, and he becomes interested. The anime sometimes seems like it might become predictable or pointless, but the characters' attitudes never change from start to finish....Rachel always wants to die, and Zack always wants to kill. Zack needs Rachel's intelligence to escape the dungeon. Even though Rachel may want to die, she is responsible for Zack's escape.The show's main theme is to change the perspective of someone who has lost the desire to live and help them find purpose. This differs from most anime, making it a unique and darker concept. It had a deep meaning behind the story. However, The show lacked uniqueness regarding the backstories, conversations, interactions, character development, and action scenes. The story felt repetitive as it followed the pattern of one psychopath after another being defeated by Rachel and Zack. The conversations can also get boring at times. However, the show's deeper meaning got me thinking after I finished watching it. The ending was interesting. It was a big surprise, and I really appreciated the added suspense.I thought the opening and ending songs were good. The animation quality was also good.

Also, you play the game for the gameplay, maybe to get scared, you often insert yourself into the role of the protagonist. But then would directly taking the plot of any game make a convincing and compelling movie? Of course not. It's not so simple.

I can say that this anime faithfully adapts most of the iconic tropes in the genre. Firstly, it manipulates the viewer’s perceptions and emotions so the whole picture is mostly invisible until the story calls for it. Secondly, it introduces us to monstrous, creepy, and morally questionable characters, and then makes us...empathize with them on some level. Finally, it gives us an ending that is shocking, revolting, and with a bad aftertaste. This isn’t supposed to be a happy story, you know.What did I like the best? Layered mystery with all its twists and turns. Seeing adapted types of puzzles I grew to know and like.What did I like the least? The repeating explanations of one’s actions (Zack, please kill her already, don’t make excuses).

I know some people would criticize this as repetitive, and in the long run it is, but c\'mon this show was literally derived from a game, of course it\'ll be repetitive given that there\'ll be a contending opponent waiting in each floor. And honestly, plots like this are one of my favorites. I love how there\'s always a riddle to solve or characters to defeat in every stage. The first couple of episodes really...got me hooked, but somehow the momentum died as it reached towards the end. The ending was just utterly bittersweet. It was open-ended, which I dread these type of endings, and left me a bit unsatisfied. Still, the tandem between Zack and Rachel had good chemistry and definitely gave the show more thrill.Art: (6/10)The art style was great at captivating the eeriness and unsettling tone of the anime. It\'s not exactly high-quality, but animation remains fluid. Loved the character design of Zack and Rachel tho!Sound: (9/10)The voice actors really outdid themselves in this one, but the crown definitely goes to my all-time favorite VA Okamoto Nobuhiko, who voiced Isaac Foster (Zack). He has this sexy raspy sound when he speaks and yet a creepy maniacal laugh that brings sheer terror. It\'s no wonder the man had a strain in his throat and needed to undergo surgery. I also love Rachel\'s VA since it kind of reminds of Violet from Violet Evergarden. Coincidentally, both of them portray emotionless characters.Character: (7/10)Oh how I wish Rachel ain\'t 13 but a little bit older, but then again the audience won\'t empathize as much if the character wasn\'t a kid.

I also loved how Zack was first introduced as a homicidal maniac who goes on a killing spree to a selfless guardian with a lil\' tsundere attitude. Despite the eerie laugh whenever he goes berserk, he\'s still a likable character whom we can\'t bring to hate. I also liked Rachel, or more like the ""emotionless"" Rachel. Not gonna lie, I was expecting that the girl would be annoyingly helpless and depend on Zack most of the show. Much to my surprise, it turned out to be the other way around. I know she\'s somewhat psychologically damaged, but I loved how she literally slayed every challenge without a hint of tear. She was cool and independent all throughout other than her part of the story. I guess the only thing I find her irritating was when she makes reference to her religion or repeatedly begs Zack to kill her. But it\'s all part of the story so it\'s understandable.Enjoyment: (6/10)It was utterly thrilling. I could no longer count how many times this show has made my heart throb nonstop. I loved the mysteries of every stage as well as discovering the character\'s tragic past that led them the way they are now. The dynamic relationship between Zack and Rachel was definitely interesting to watch as they used to start out unattached who only worked together for a compliant agreement, then slowly developed a soft spot for each other and created a bond that the only they could understand. Unfortunately, the ending left an underwhelming open-ended conclusion. It may be an interesting touch for some, but personally, it left me unsettled. The finale portrayed two possible endings with subtle hints that make the audience decide what happens. Some say that the author confirmed which was the ending, but it still hasn\'t been confirmed.Overall: (6/10)I\'m not an amid fan of horror/thriller related flicks because basically I\'m a scaredy cat.

The anime has a pretty interesting premise and it starts off on a rather strong note. However, as you get further into this 16 episode anime, the flaws become more glaring. Despite its simple premise, the plot slowly unravels as the motivation of our emo (I\'m not kidding when I say this, she quite literally is) heroine, Rachel Gardner, begins to fly in the face of basic reason and logic. Essentially, Rachel wants to die and she wants our other mc, Isaac ""Zack"" Foster, to be the one...to kill her because of a promise they make. Okay, fair enough. Why does she want to die? Because she killed her abusive dad...in an act of blatant self-defense....yeah... Since this act of killing is a sin in Rachel\'s eyes, the only way she can properly atone for it is for someone to take her own life. She can\'t commit suicide, because that would be a sin too. The logic here is faulty and quite frankly stupid. I understand that she\'s a mentally unstable character, but this is lackluster writing at work here. Once her reasoning for her motivation is finally fully explained, it just thoroughly confused me.To top it all off: they decided to end the anime on a rather ambiguous note which was immensely disappointing in the face of a story that had lost all its steam by that point. The ending was this anime\'s last chance to save itself and it opted to dig its own grave further. It might just be me, but if you base your story on one character dying, you\'d want to show said character\'s death in all its glory, right? Angels of Death opted to end the story in the worst and most unsatisfyingly way possible. It\'s honestly a shame. While it can certainly be assumed that Zack killed Rachel and granted her wish, her death (if it even happens) is never shown and nobody is ever found so you can never know for sure. The final shot is quite literally a splatter of blood on the windowsill (presumably from when Zack broke into Rachel\'s room) and Zack\'s (bloodless) knife on the floor. Though he did have his scythe so he presumably would\'ve used that if he even did kill Rachel.The one thing that was consistently good about this anime was its production value. The animation, art style and character design were all solid. The anime would also change up its art style sometimes for comedic effect, such as in one scene where they convert Zack and Rachel into chibis which was adorable to see. The English VAs did a fine job and were good fits for their characters. The intro, ""Vital"" was alright. I didn\'t find it to be a particularly memorable song but it did the job it needed to and the visuals were cool as it showed off all the characters. However, I really enjoyed the outro, ""Pray"", as it mostly centers around Rachel and the religious theme that surrounds the anime. It also takes us through all the locations in the facility where the story takes place which was cool to see. The song had a really catchy beat and had a fitting somber tone to it. I still listen to this song on occasion, so I at least got something out of this anime! I also did find it ironic that each episode is named after a piece of dialogue that gets spoken in the episode, I found that very fitting as well!The plot for Angels of Death starts off strong but loses steam the longer you watch. The story begins as we\'re introduced to the main protagonist, Rachel Gardner, a 13 year old girl who is sent to a hospital after ""witnessing"" a murder for counseling. She is brought under the care of Dr. Danny Dickens who is supposed to help her psychologically recover from the experience. Rachel then wakes up in an unfamiliar area that looks like an abandoned city with no memory of how she got there. Over an intercom it\'s decreed that she\'s some sort of ""sacrifice"". She tries to search for a way out but is suddenly ambushed by a crazed man in bandages wielding a scythe. Rachel narrowly avoids death and escapes via elevator and seems to get back to the hospital. She reunites with Danny, and it becomes clear that he\'s an eye-fetish creep. Once Rachel picks up on Danny being another insane psychopath, she tries to escape but is cornered. Danny makes a comment about reuniting her with her parents in hell, which seems to trigger some lost memories for her. Just when it seems like she\'s a goner, the bandage guy from earlier busts into the room and stabs Danny, seemingly killing him. He then goes to kill Rachel, but ends up losing his bloodlust over the fact that she\'s apparently not afraid to die. Danny tries to get back down to where he comes from but is unable to. The mysterious intercom voices then declares bandage man as a new sacrifice as he apparently broke some rule that he wasn\'t supposed to leave his floor. He then resolves to leave the whole building as he tries to force the elevator open, Rachel timidly approaches him and asks him if he could kill her (...wut?).The bandage man then introduces himself as Zack. The two strike up an agreement: if Rachel (who is far smarter than Zack, who is a self-proclaimed idiot), can help the two of them escape the building, he will kill her provided that she ""makes a face worth killing"". To seal the deal, Rachel makes Zack swear to God that he will be the one to kill her. Thus a type of ""my brains and your brawns"" duo is formed. The duo advances to the next floor which is a graveyard kind of floor. Eerily, they find Rachel\'s name written on one of the tombstones. They split up to look for clues and Rachel comes across a secret room containing a mysterious letter in which the writer claims to know her ""true wish"". She also finds out Zack is a serial killer, which doesn\'t seem to bother her. Zack destroys the tombstones out of boredom which accidentally opens up a passageway into the next room. Rachel tells Zack that she knows about his past, and simply reiterates her desire to be killed by his hand when he presses her on the subject. They are then confronted by a boy wearing a pumpkin for a head: Eddy Mason. Eddy reveals that he has fallen in love with Rachel at first sight (aww how wholesome!) and wants to kill her and bury her so they could be together forever (uh...I guess that\'s wholesome?). Rachel repeats her desire that Zack kills him, and after a lengthy chase and battle, Zack kills Eddie and buries him in the grave intended for Rachel (how poetic). The duo then advance to the next floor which resembles a prison.Zack and Rachel then meet the floor\'s boss: Catherine ""Cathy"" Ward, who gives off some Junko from Danganronpa type vibes. She subjects the pair to a variety of sick and twisted games and booby traps, involving an electric chair (which Zack idiotically sits in to rest), gas rooms and a miniature house puzzle that mimics Zack\'s abusive upbringing, but the duo manage to survive by working together. It\'s here where we learn about Zack\'s tragic backstory in this little arc certainly makes me have some sympathy for the guy. He certainly didn\'t have it easy growing up (being abandoned by his mother after her lover had lit him on fire, forcing him to wear bandages to hide the burns) and then being turned over to abusive foster parents where he eventually snapped and started his serial killer career by murdering the foster parents. The final obstacle before confronting Cathy is a classic ""guess the poison"" type scenario in which one drug is harmless and the other is dangerously hallucinatory. Zack decides to take both. He succumbs to the effects of the drug as he is forced to relive his past and is about to kill Rachel but she manages to reason with him after reminding him of their promise. However this only works temporarily and Zack ends up chasing Rachel into the room where Cathy is. Cathy tries to goad Rachel into killing Zack, but refuses. Zack then stabs himself in an effort to control his murderous impulses brought on by the drugs after Rachel\'s speech saying it\'s everyone\'s choice to be kill or be killed, but it turns out the gun was unloaded. Cathy comes out from her safe room and threatens to kill her and torture Zack, but she pulls out a gun and vibe checks Cathy in what was a pretty badass scene. Zack then collects himself and strikes down Cathy. Rachel tells Zack why she was brought here in the first place and he passes out from his wounds.With Zack slowly bleeding to death, Rachel is forced to strike out on her own to find help for Zack. She finds herself in a church room and meets the floor master: Abraham Gray. Rachel asks Abraham for help but is told that the only medical supplies here are back down on Danny\'s floor. The two then make a deal that he will lead her back to Danny\'s floor to get the medical supplies for Zack in exchange for Abraham subjecting her to tests of her character. Zack also additionally requests that Rachel retrieves his knife. Abraham instructs Rachel to power on the elevator and they backtrack to Cathy\'s floor, where she encounters zombies but dispatches them using Cathy\'s traps. Rachel then finds Cathy\'s body missing and she begins trolling her from the grave calling her a sinner (like she has room to talk). Rachel and Abraham then make it back onto Eddy\'s floor where she crushes a bunch of hands that pop out from the graves. Rachel also finds Eddy\'s body missing as his ghost haunts her asking her about her supposed lack of compassion. They finally make it back onto Danny\'s floor and Rachel goes 3 for 3 on missing bodies, and even better, the medicine is missing too. Meanwhile, we got more backstory on Zack where he is taken in by a kindly blind old man after he murders a woman for accidentally splashing him with her car. The old man shows genuine care for Zack and provides him food and a safe place to rest. Zack kills another random person to strike fear into the old man, but he\'s unphased for some reason. However, he later learns that he was mugged and killed. Zack then realizes he has a fetish for crushing happiness after he avenged the old man by killing his murderers. Danny, somehow alive, then pulls up to an unconscious Zack and debates killing him.Zack wakes up and finds Danny alive, who survived because of literal plot armor. He offers Zack the medicine he needs in exchange for gouging out Rachel\'s eyes, but he refuses and Danny leaves him to die. Rachel visits Zack\'s place and finds the sorry state that he lives in, retrieving his knife and realizes that she doesn\'t really know that much about him. As they journey back up, Grey questions Rachel\'s motives and somehow gets the conclusion that she\'s a selfish witch and questions her belief in God, causing her to have a mental breakdown as she runs off to try to find Zack. Zack then fights off a giant snake which leaves him even worse for wear. Rachel reunites with Zack and he lets her keep the knife as she goes to track down Danny. Rachel runs into Abraham who reveals that he has the medicine that Zack needs, but decides to subject her to the Salem Witch Trials in order to try to figure out who she is. The witnesses against Rachel are Eddy, Cathy and Danny, all who quite literally tried to kill her for no reason and could hardly be seen as fair judges of character and has no witnesses in her corner. It\'s hardly a fair trial. Honestly, was she not supposed to kill them or defend herself in any way? I honestly don\'t get what the anime is trying to tell me here and it was around this point where the plot starts to unravel because of sheer stupidity. Anyways Rachel gets sentenced to be burned at the stake for some reason and as she prepares to be burnt at the stake, she reflects on her relationship with Zack and decides that he\'s her God (...wut?). She cuts herself free and returns to the present after deducting this was all a drug induced hallucination. She confronts Abraham and forces him to surrender the medicine.Rachel reunites with Zack and patches him, declaring to him that he is her God (and even Zack is like: lol wut?). The pair advance to the final floor in the building which begins to look all too familiar to Rachel. She begins to grow hysterical and begs Zack to kill her as he investigates the floor further. Rachel ends up fainting from her hysteria and Danny arrives to lock Zack out of the room, only offering to unlock the door should he learn everything about Rachel\'s past. Zack begrudgingly complies and does his best to avoid as many death traps as possible, but ends up falling into a spike pit only to be saved in the nick of time by Abraham who reveals that he controls the entire building and he\'s essentially running a giant social experiment to observe those who claim to believe in God. ""Sacrifices"" are sent to each floor to endure the floor\'s various trials that are overseen by the ""Angels"" of that floor. Abraham helps Zack along and he finds a newspaper and later Danny\'s interview of Rachel recounting the details of Rachel\'s parents\' deaths. Rachel\'s parents had a toxic relationship to say the least and they hated her just as much as they hated each other, so she was made EMO long before the events of the show it would seem. Rachel\'s dad one day snapped and stabbed Rachel\'s mother to death, and went to kill Rachel herself before she shot and killed him in self-defense. Rachel, completely broken by this point, then stitched her parent\'s bodies together in order to create ""the perfect family"" and left it like that for a week before the police arrived. He also learns of some of the other messed up things she did, let\'s just say she really likes stitching. Danny then goes into his own messed up backstory and how he got his eye-fetish, in which his mother committed suicide because he was born without an eye. He became obsessed with Rachel\'s because her mother also had blue eyes like her. Zack then pieces together that Rachel is the ""angel"" of this floor (which was a well pulled off twist). Danny confirms this and reveals Rachel wanted to subject herself to this trial after she had found renewed faith in God after reading the bible.Realizing that Rachel had lied to him (and it was established early on that he *HATES* liars, even serial killers have standards I guess), he calls off the deal and declares that he isn\'t her God. Rachel becomes distraught and tries to shoot Zack but misses. Zack then chases Rachel, dodging the various traps and finally cornering her, asking her if she intends to kill him (ah the hunter becomes the hunted!). However, Danny ends up cornering both of them and Rachel shoots him instead. Rachel affirms her commitment to die by Zack\'s hand for the 100th time, but is conflicted because she has once more lost her faith in God and that in her warped mind, there was nobody left to forgive her for her crimes (the sewing up bit, she might\'ve gone too far for sure. But killing her father? Girl that was self-defense! Unless if that doesn\'t exist in this anime.) Zack brings Rachel back to her senses and the two renew their partnership. They go back to Abraham\'s floor where they encounter him yet again. Abraham asks her once more about her identity and intentions, with Rachel telling him she has finally accepted herself and will take responsibility for her own choices. Abraham accepts her answer and not so subtly points out where the escape route is. Danny\'s body goes missing again and Rachel\'s gun is destroyed. After bashing through the stained glass, the building\'s self-destruction sequence activates.The building begins to burn down, and Zack briefly panics because of his PTSD from being burned. But he bashes through the steel bars blocking their path and the remaining obstacles, but breaks his trusty scythe in the process. They finally reach the final floor. Rachel asks Zach if he still wants to kill her, and he re-affirms his promise for the 100th time. Danny, who refuses to die, pulls up on his OPS and shoots Rachel in the back. Danny reveals that he\'s the one who activated the self-destruct sequence and intends to kill everyone in the building, trying to taunt Zack that he won\'t be the one to kill her. Zack then takes a principled stand saying he doesn\'t care if it doesn\'t end up being fulfilled or not, just that a vow was made and he\'s doing his best to honor it because if he didn\'t he\'d be a liar (and become the very thing he swore to destroy!). Jealous by Rachel simping over Zack, he shoots her again and prepares to kill Zack, but is dropped by Abraham with a good ol\' fashioned crossbow to the back. Abraham allows Zack to escape with Rachel as he prevents Danny from stopping them from escaping. Abraham has a final conversation with Danny in which he reveals that he\'s fascinated by the Zack\'s and Rachel\'s relationship in how they supposedly changed each other. Danny and Abraham then presumably die as the building collapses around them.Zack escapes with Rachel just in the nick of time and surrenders to the police and hands Rachel over to paramedics. Rachel is brought to a mental care facility where it becomes clear to the audience she\'s faking her progress and longs for Zack to kill her. As it turns out Zack is on death throw for all the murders he committed. The anime ends when Rachel is laying in her room and Zack breaks in to fulfill his promise. With the police having surrounded the building and closing in, Zack drags Rachel out the window with him. Rachel tearfully and graciously thanks Zack for honoring his promise, and Zack tells her to shut up and smile. The final shot is of the broken glass and blood stain on the windowsill, with Zack\'s bloodless knife on the floor. (Yeah I thought it was unsatisfying too).Now for the characters!Rachel: I never really understood her reason for wanting to die. At first I thought it was because she wanted to be reunited with her parents, but once we find out about her backstory, it seems that she never really cared for them (I mean she did kill her dad). Then I thought it was because she had simply given up on living (which is kind of the case as far as I can decipher), but it\'s through some misplaced belief that she committed a sin by defending herself from her father *WHO WAS LITERALLY ABOUT TO KILL HER* and thus the only way she can be absolved for it is through her life being taken. She can\'t kill herself though because that\'d be a sin, which seems redundant and pointless. If you think you deserve to die because you committed a sin, then there\'s not really much point in committing another sin since you\'re already condemned to die. Now granted Rachel did some other messed up things like stitching a dog up and stitching her parent\'s corpses together, but she makes the sin out to be killing her father. It\'d be a sin if it was outright cold-blooded murder and maybe that\'s how she sees it through her interpretation of the bible but that\'s not reality. I don\'t know, Rachel has some pretty weird logic and it\'s hard to follow it. She\'s clearly a person who is in great need of mental help given all the trauma she\'s experienced. She\'s not a sane character and perhaps the best way to analyze her is to take the logic out of it. Aside from that, I thought she was an interesting and intriguing character. I did like the twist they did in which she was ""the angel"" of the final floor and the revelation that she was responsible for her parent\'s deaths (both of which I kinda saw coming but its nice to be proven right!). Overall her backstory was fine, but it got ruined by her weird motivation and reasoning.  She has great chemistry with Zack and they undoubtedly grow closer, and their interactions did make for some comedy at times. It feels like they have a sort of sibling relationship but it sort of felt like there was a romantic undertone to their relationship, which uh...wouldn\'t necessarily be a good thing! She also had some great moments in the show, particularly when she dropped Cathy and Danny, those were well done scenes.Zack: He was a fun and simple character. He had a lot of great moments and he was a character. He had great chemistry with Rachel, who had a relatively wholesome, maybe somewhat creepily romantic undertone, kind of relationship with her. He truly got the most laughs out of me and was just always an enjoyable character on screen. Like Rachel, he had a rather simple motivation, but at least the story didn\'t ruin his reasoning for doing what he did or his motivations. He had a good, tragic backstory that genuinely made me feel sorry for him. Honestly, I think he was as perfect a character as you could\'ve gotten in a show like this.Eddy: We didn\'t see too much of him. He was quite literally the first boss and went down pretty easily. I did find it funny that he wore a pumpkin on his head. His obsession with Rachel was kind of weird and felt forced. I get that it was a ""young puppy kind of love"" (as a lot of love at first sight stuff is) but I feel like they could\'ve done something better. His backstory isn\'t really covered in the anime so there\'s not a whole lot of reason to particularly care for him as a character or feel strongly about him one way or the other.Cathy: I got Junko from Danganronpa vibes from her (which is a good thing!) She was clever, cruel and sadistic and I really enjoyed the little arc that they were on her floor. It definitely kept the show interesting. She definitely had the coolest death in the anime when Rachel and Zack double teamed her. She wasn\'t in the anime for that long and her backstory isn\'t really covered either, but she did her job in being a ""mid level boss"".Danny: Dude was weird. He made for a good and creepy antagonist but he survived way too many times. I can forgive him surviving once, maybe twice, but afterwards it was getting ridiculous with the amount of times either Zack and Rachel would drop him. Even Abraham couldn\'t kill him and he shot him twice! I get that he\'s a doctor but he\'s not immortal (as far as we know at least, and we know for sure Eddy and Cathy are dead as they physically don\'t show up again after their deaths, even if their bodies have vanished). He\'s a character that had literal plot armor.Abraham: He was cool, but also weird. He wasn\'t quite an antagonist, but more so just a neutral observing party (aside from him manipulating Rachel). While it\'s revealed that he is the one who controls the whole building and that he brings in to test people who consider themselves ""devoted to God"", it\'s never explained why he does this and his backstory is never explained either. It seemed to me like he was running one giant social experiment for the hell of it.Angels of Death was a weird anime that started off well enough, but had a disappointing ending. It had an intriguing premise: two characters who were polar opposites (at least in their demeanor) making a peculiar pact to escape a house of horrors and murder? It sounded promising to me!It had a lot of cool and enjoyable moments in the story but they did not handle Rachel\'s story in the best way. As I was watching, I figured that the direction they would\'ve gone in was that Rachel felt like she needed to die for some reason or was just tired of living, and that when her and Zack finally busted out of wherever they were at, she would finally appreciate the meaning of life after working so hard to stay alive through some pretty brutal obstacles, and maybe Zack somehow gets rehabilitated through this experience and they live happily ever after or something. Instead the anime chose to double down on its story and ended in an open-ended way which brings the story to a dissatisfying and underwhelming conclusion. If they wanted to have Rachel die (which in fairness the anime practically spells out that she\'s going to die ever since the first episode), they could\'ve shown ZacK killing her and bringing the story to a close or go off in a completely different direction. Additionally, a lot of the finer plot points are never really explained and glossed over, and there\'s just a lot of things that quite frankly don\'t make sense or are either stupid. For what it\'s worth, I assume Rachel is actually dead, given that the anime aired 5 years ago now and there\'s never been any mention of additional content as far as I know, but they could perhaps do more content if they wanted to given the nature of the open ending.Typically, shows want you to have some kind of moral or takeaway after watching it. I honestly couldn\'t tell you what the moral or takeaway is for Angels of Death. It has a lot of religious and philosophical elements, but it didn\'t feel like it was trying to push anything on to you or tell you anything particular about it. The best thing that I can come up with is that perhaps it\'s a commentary on how blinded a person can be by their beliefs and maybe it\'s some kind of warning to not let your beliefs get to you like that? At the same time it doesn\'t feel like the anime is trying to warn you against anything like that either, perhaps it\'s just presenting? I still haven\'t been able to figure it out, and it might be from the poor execution of the story.In the end, I was disappointed by Angels of Death. It wasn\'t a total dumpster fire, but I\'ve seen far better storytelling. I get that this is also adapted from an RPG game, and apparently they choose to stay faithful to the ending in which I\'m not sure if they should\'ve. Unfortunately, I can\'t recommend this anime. For me, it has far more points against it than for it. to kill her because of a promise they make. Okay, fair enough. Why does she want to die? Because she killed her abusive dad...in an act of blatant self-defense....yeah... Since this act of killing is a sin in Rachel\'s eyes, the only way she can properly atone for it is for someone to take her own life. She can\'t commit suicide, because that would be a sin too. The logic here is faulty and quite frankly stupid. I understand that she\'s a mentally unstable character, but this is lackluster writing at work here. Once her reasoning for her motivation is finally fully explained, it just thoroughly confused me.To top it all off: they decided to end the anime on a rather ambiguous note which was immensely disappointing in the face of a story that had lost all its steam by that point. The ending was this anime\'s last chance to save itself and it opted to dig its own grave further. It might just be me, but if you base your story on one character dying, you\'d want to show said character\'s death in all its glory, right? Angels of Death opted to end the story in the worst and most unsatisfyingly way possible. It\'s honestly a shame. While it can certainly be assumed that Zack killed Rachel and granted her wish, her death (if it even happens) is never shown and nobody is ever found so you can never know for sure. The final shot is quite literally a splatter of blood on the windowsill (presumably from when Zack broke into Rachel\'s room) and Zack\'s (bloodless) knife on the floor. Though he did have his scythe so he presumably would\'ve used that if he even did kill Rachel.The one thing that was consistently good about this anime was its production value. The animation, art style and character design were all solid. The anime would also change up its art style sometimes for comedic effect, such as in one scene where they convert Zack and Rachel into chibis which was adorable to see. The English VAs did a fine job and were good fits for their characters. The intro, ""Vital"" was alright. I didn\'t find it to be a particularly memorable song but it did the job it needed to and the visuals were cool as it showed off all the characters. However, I really enjoyed the outro, ""Pray"", as it mostly centers around Rachel and the religious theme that surrounds the anime. It also takes us through all the locations in the facility where the story takes place which was cool to see. The song had a really catchy beat and had a fitting somber tone to it. I still listen to this song on occasion, so I at least got something out of this anime! I also did find it ironic that each episode is named after a piece of dialogue that gets spoken in the episode, I found that very fitting as well!The plot for Angels of Death starts off strong but loses steam the longer you watch. The story begins as we\'re introduced to the main protagonist, Rachel Gardner, a 13 year old girl who is sent to a hospital after ""witnessing"" a murder for counseling. She is brought under the care of Dr. Danny Dickens who is supposed to help her psychologically recover from the experience. Rachel then wakes up in an unfamiliar area that looks like an abandoned city with no memory of how she got there. Over an intercom it\'s decreed that she\'s some sort of ""sacrifice"". She tries to search for a way out but is suddenly ambushed by a crazed man in bandages wielding a scythe. Rachel narrowly avoids death and escapes via elevator and seems to get back to the hospital. She reunites with Danny, and it becomes clear that he\'s an eye-fetish creep. Once Rachel picks up on Danny being another insane psychopath, she tries to escape but is cornered. Danny makes a comment about reuniting her with her parents in hell, which seems to trigger some lost memories for her. Just when it seems like she\'s a goner, the bandage guy from earlier busts into the room and stabs Danny, seemingly killing him. He then goes to kill Rachel, but ends up losing his bloodlust over the fact that she\'s apparently not afraid to die. Danny tries to get back down to where he comes from but is unable to. The mysterious intercom voices then declares bandage man as a new sacrifice as he apparently broke some rule that he wasn\'t supposed to leave his floor. He then resolves to leave the whole building as he tries to force the elevator open, Rachel timidly approaches him and asks him if he could kill her (...wut?).The bandage man then introduces himself as Zack. The two strike up an agreement: if Rachel (who is far smarter than Zack, who is a self-proclaimed idiot), can help the two of them escape the building, he will kill her provided that she ""makes a face worth killing"". To seal the deal, Rachel makes Zack swear to God that he will be the one to kill her. Thus a type of ""my brains and your brawns"" duo is formed. The duo advances to the next floor which is a graveyard kind of floor. Eerily, they find Rachel\'s name written on one of the tombstones. They split up to look for clues and Rachel comes across a secret room containing a mysterious letter in which the writer claims to know her ""true wish"". She also finds out Zack is a serial killer, which doesn\'t seem to bother her. Zack destroys the tombstones out of boredom which accidentally opens up a passageway into the next room. Rachel tells Zack that she knows about his past, and simply reiterates her desire to be killed by his hand when he presses her on the subject. They are then confronted by a boy wearing a pumpkin for a head: Eddy Mason. Eddy reveals that he has fallen in love with Rachel at first sight (aww how wholesome!) and wants to kill her and bury her so they could be together forever (uh...I guess that\'s wholesome?). Rachel repeats her desire that Zack kills him, and after a lengthy chase and battle, Zack kills Eddie and buries him in the grave intended for Rachel (how poetic). The duo then advance to the next floor which resembles a prison.Zack and Rachel then meet the floor\'s boss: Catherine ""Cathy"" Ward, who gives off some Junko from Danganronpa type vibes. She subjects the pair to a variety of sick and twisted games and booby traps, involving an electric chair (which Zack idiotically sits in to rest), gas rooms and a miniature house puzzle that mimics Zack\'s abusive upbringing, but the duo manage to survive by working together. It\'s here where we learn about Zack\'s tragic backstory in this little arc certainly makes me have some sympathy for the guy. He certainly didn\'t have it easy growing up (being abandoned by his mother after her lover had lit him on fire, forcing him to wear bandages to hide the burns) and then being turned over to abusive foster parents where he eventually snapped and started his serial killer career by murdering the foster parents. The final obstacle before confronting Cathy is a classic ""guess the poison"" type scenario in which one drug is harmless and the other is dangerously hallucinatory. Zack decides to take both. He succumbs to the effects of the drug as he is forced to relive his past and is about to kill Rachel but she manages to reason with him after reminding him of their promise. However this only works temporarily and Zack ends up chasing Rachel into the room where Cathy is. Cathy tries to goad Rachel into killing Zack, but refuses. Zack then stabs himself in an effort to control his murderous impulses brought on by the drugs after Rachel\'s speech saying it\'s everyone\'s choice to be kill or be killed, but it turns out the gun was unloaded. Cathy comes out from her safe room and threatens to kill her and torture Zack, but she pulls out a gun and vibe checks Cathy in what was a pretty badass scene. Zack then collects himself and strikes down Cathy. Rachel tells Zack why she was brought here in the first place and he passes out from his wounds.With Zack slowly bleeding to death, Rachel is forced to strike out on her own to find help for Zack. She finds herself in a church room and meets the floor master: Abraham Gray. Rachel asks Abraham for help but is told that the only medical supplies here are back down on Danny\'s floor. The two then make a deal that he will lead her back to Danny\'s floor to get the medical supplies for Zack in exchange for Abraham subjecting her to tests of her character. Zack also additionally requests that Rachel retrieves his knife. Abraham instructs Rachel to power on the elevator and they backtrack to Cathy\'s floor, where she encounters zombies but dispatches them using Cathy\'s traps. Rachel then finds Cathy\'s body missing and she begins trolling her from the grave calling her a sinner (like she has room to talk). Rachel and Abraham then make it back onto Eddy\'s floor where she crushes a bunch of hands that pop out from the graves. Rachel also finds Eddy\'s body missing as his ghost haunts her asking her about her supposed lack of compassion. They finally make it back onto Danny\'s floor and Rachel goes 3 for 3 on missing bodies, and even better, the medicine is missing too. Meanwhile, we got more backstory on Zack where he is taken in by a kindly blind old man after he murders a woman for accidentally splashing him with her car. The old man shows genuine care for Zack and provides him food and a safe place to rest. Zack kills another random person to strike fear into the old man, but he\'s unphased for some reason. However, he later learns that he was mugged and killed. Zack then realizes he has a fetish for crushing happiness after he avenged the old man by killing his murderers. Danny, somehow alive, then pulls up to an unconscious Zack and debates killing him.Zack wakes up and finds Danny alive, who survived because of literal plot armor.

Zack then fights off a giant snake which leaves him even worse for wear. Rachel reunites with Zack and he lets her keep the knife as she goes to track down Danny. Rachel runs into Abraham who reveals that he has the medicine that Zack needs, but decides to subject her to the Salem Witch Trials in order to try to figure out who she is. The witnesses against Rachel are Eddy, Cathy and Danny, all who quite literally tried to kill her for no reason and could hardly be seen as fair judges of character and has no witnesses in her corner. It\'s hardly a fair trial. Honestly, was she not supposed to kill them or defend herself in any way?

Overall her backstory was fine, but it got ruined by her weird motivation and reasoning.  She has great chemistry with Zack and they undoubtedly grow closer, and their interactions did make for some comedy at times. It feels like they have a sort of sibling relationship but it sort of felt like there was a romantic undertone to their relationship, which uh...wouldn\'t necessarily be a good thing! She also had some great moments in the show, particularly when she dropped Cathy and Danny, those were well done scenes.Zack: He was a fun and simple character. He had a lot of great moments and he was a character. He had great chemistry with Rachel, who had a relatively wholesome, maybe somewhat creepily romantic undertone, kind of relationship with her. He truly got the most laughs out of me and was just always an enjoyable character on screen. Like Rachel, he had a rather simple motivation, but at least the story didn\'t ruin his reasoning for doing what he did or his motivations. He had a good, tragic backstory that genuinely made me feel sorry for him. Honestly, I think he was as perfect a character as you could\'ve gotten in a show like this.Eddy: We didn\'t see too much of him. He was quite literally the first boss and went down pretty easily. I did find it funny that he wore a pumpkin on his head. His obsession with Rachel was kind of weird and felt forced. I get that it was a ""young puppy kind of love"" (as a lot of love at first sight stuff is) but I feel like they could\'ve done something better. His backstory isn\'t really covered in the anime so there\'s not a whole lot of reason to particularly care for him as a character or feel strongly about him one way or the other.Cathy: I got Junko from Danganronpa vibes from her (which is a good thing!) She was clever, cruel and sadistic and I really enjoyed the little arc that they were on her floor. It definitely kept the show interesting. She definitely had the coolest death in the anime when Rachel and Zack double teamed her. She wasn\'t in the anime for that long and her backstory isn\'t really covered either, but she did her job in being a ""mid level boss"".Danny: Dude was weird. He made for a good and creepy antagonist but he survived way too many times. I can forgive him surviving once, maybe twice, but afterwards it was getting ridiculous with the amount of times either Zack and Rachel would drop him. Even Abraham couldn\'t kill him and he shot him twice! I get that he\'s a doctor but he\'s not immortal (as far as we know at least, and we know for sure Eddy and Cathy are dead as they physically don\'t show up again after their deaths, even if their bodies have vanished). He\'s a character that had literal plot armor.Abraham: He was cool, but also weird. He wasn\'t quite an antagonist, but more so just a neutral observing party (aside from him manipulating Rachel). While it\'s revealed that he is the one who controls the whole building and that he brings in to test people who consider themselves ""devoted to God"", it\'s never explained why he does this and his backstory is never explained either. It seemed to me like he was running one giant social experiment for the hell of it.Angels of Death was a weird anime that started off well enough, but had a disappointing ending. It had an intriguing premise: two characters who were polar opposites (at least in their demeanor) making a peculiar pact to escape a house of horrors and murder? It sounded promising to me!It had a lot of cool and enjoyable moments in the story but they did not handle Rachel\'s story in the best way. As I was watching, I figured that the direction they would\'ve gone in was that Rachel felt like she needed to die for some reason or was just tired of living, and that when her and Zack finally busted out of wherever they were at, she would finally appreciate the meaning of life after working so hard to stay alive through some pretty brutal obstacles, and maybe Zack somehow gets rehabilitated through this experience and they live happily ever after or something. Instead the anime chose to double down on its story and ended in an open-ended way which brings the story to a dissatisfying and underwhelming conclusion. If they wanted to have Rachel die (which in fairness the anime practically spells out that she\'s going to die ever since the first episode), they could\'ve shown ZacK killing her and bringing the story to a close or go off in a completely different direction. Additionally, a lot of the finer plot points are never really explained and glossed over, and there\'s just a lot of things that quite frankly don\'t make sense or are either stupid. For what it\'s worth, I assume Rachel is actually dead, given that the anime aired 5 years ago now and there\'s never been any mention of additional content as far as I know, but they could perhaps do more content if they wanted to given the nature of the open ending.Typically, shows want you to have some kind of moral or takeaway after watching it. I honestly couldn\'t tell you what the moral or takeaway is for Angels of Death. It has a lot of religious and philosophical elements, but it didn\'t feel like it was trying to push anything on to you or tell you anything particular about it. The best thing that I can come up with is that perhaps it\'s a commentary on how blinded a person can be by their beliefs and maybe it\'s some kind of warning to not let your beliefs get to you like that? At the same time it doesn\'t feel like the anime is trying to warn you against anything like that either, perhaps it\'s just presenting? I still haven\'t been able to figure it out, and it might be from the poor execution of the story.In the end, I was disappointed by Angels of Death. It wasn\'t a total dumpster fire, but I\'ve seen far better storytelling. I get that this is also adapted from an RPG game, and apparently they choose to stay faithful to the ending in which I\'m not sure if they should\'ve. Unfortunately, I can\'t recommend this anime. For me, it has far more points against it than for it.', ""!! I have only watched the anime, nothing else related to this !!So, I watched this anime with my friend, and at first, we were able to get into it.

Is it the best?  No, still not better than my favorites in my opinion, but I don’t mind it at all.Let me first say thatI have not watched a let’s play of the original game nor have I played it myself.  I was just as blind coming in as someone not reading the manga before an anime.So,let’s dicuss it.  There is character development, specifically with Zack.  It may not be evident, but it...is there, even if you refuse to acknowledge it.  The sound is amazing (even the English dub is really good, I just know that Zack’s English VA had a really fun time voicing him).  The art is beautiful, which is always a breath of fresh air even though it has become very commonplace for the art to be at least decent.No, this isn’t a unique anime.  No, it’s not groundbreaking (the plot is predictable as hell).  However, the jokes land, the characters are fun (even the MC’s suicidal rants are interesting characterizations), the art is nice, and the music is good.  If I wasn’t picky, I’d probably rate this higher than 7/10, however, even 7/10 is higher than the usual rating I give anime so I’d say this is an enjoyable show to watch in an afternoon (or evening, if you’re like me and have insomnia so you end up watching anime at 1 am when you’re supposed to be asleep due to school).Overall, I’d say this is a fun anime, slightly bloody, and fine to watch with friends or by yourself, I meanI watched half of this with my 10 year old cousin while babysitting her.  So, I do suggest a watch, but watch past the 5 episode mark before saying that the characters are 1 dimensional.To be honest, just don’t pay attention to the ratings of MAL, most of us are pretentious assholes who think our opinion is superior and after a while, we become too critical of the anime industry.  Sometimes we just need a simple plot line and without many extra layers, and that’s okay.So yeah, fun anime, only 16 episodes, just watch it and formulate your own opinion. is there, even if you refuse to acknowledge it.

I hated this anime. Sixteen episodes was way too many. The first like, two were semi decent. I was intrigued by the concept and the mystery behind the tower, but it quickly grew boring and then unbearable. I ended up switching to dub about five episodes in because I didn\'t feel like putting it the effort of reading the subtitles.The art was pretty good, it was very clean and appealing to the eye. I don\'t remember anything specific about the soundtrack or effects, but as for the voice acting, Zack\'s laughter grated on my nerves like nothing...else. The characters are extremely flat and boring. The plot itself is nonsensical, especially after episode 12. From what I\'ve read, the last four episodes are an entirely different story? Don\'t quote me on that, I\'m not sure.Our mc Rachel was so boring. Her entire purpose is to solve each floor\'s puzzles and beg Zack to kill her. That\'s it. She\'s a suicidal, emotionless 13 year old that we\'re somehow meant to root for. Her entire character makes no sense. She\'s put in multiple life or death situations, but despite begging Zack to kill her every fucking episode, she never takes the opportunity to die. Her reasoning? Zack ""swore to God"" that he would kill her, so now only he gets the privilege of doing so. It\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve ever seen, and an incredibly weak excuse to keep Rachel alive for so long. Because she\'s an emotionless husk and her only desire is to die, we the viewer have no reason to be invested in her. If Zack is going to kill her by the end of the show, why bother getting invested. It\'s a stupid desire to give your character.As for Zack, he was just as bad as Rachel. He\'s a moronic serial killer who wants to leave the tower and then kill Rachel. Why does he want to leave the tower? Your guess is as good as mine. Despite there being clear rules set in place in the tower (and we never learn who set those rules and why, or the entire purpose of the tower, the location, and how no one has ever discovered it, or even how Zack\'s previous victims were placed there), Zack breaks it by chasing Rachel to Dr. Danny\'s floor and killing the Doctor. Why does he chase her there when he knows he\'s not supposed to leave his floor? I don\'t know. He just does.And that is the root of the problem with this anime. The characters are so underdeveloped, their actions and reactions are only there to move the plot along. Do not bother watching this show.

It does have some addictive qualities purely for the thrill and drama of the mystery, but it doesn't live up to what it sets itself up for and is mostly a let down in terms of story, especially for such an interesting premise.The animation is pretty average, although I did enjoy the character designs a lot - Zack and Eddie were my favorites. The sound is also pretty average and even felt kind of repetitive at times. Moodbuilding was alright but sometimes the sound effects and music were so dramatic and noticeable during very...pivotal scenes and it made me feel awkward while watching.Speaking of repetition, holy cow. The dialogue DRAGS on. At the end of the show you kind of understand why Rachel is so insistent upon establishing the deal between her and Zack but it really stilts the pacing and development of both the show and the characters. The story definitely has an interesting setup but just kind of falls apart after a while.I can totally see that this was originally a video game - I actually thought so during the first episode and then googled to confirm my suspicions. I think that it really should've been kept to video game format, though - the characters are just so much better suited to that format thanks to the protagonists' rather uninteresting personalities. While Zack is pretty entertaining, he also feels very 2D with a basic sob backstory that is meant to get you to quickly sympathize with him. Maybe the writers could've spent a little more time actually turning the video game protags into real characters for the show, although there have been plenty of video game protags with interesting personalities beforehand, so I don't really understand why this was such a challenge. Sticking to canon? Idk, the game seemed popular but not that popular, so I really couldn't say.In the end, can't really recommend that anyone else watches this. The youth of Rachel and Eddie also made this feel like some kind of a weird violent fantasy on the behalf of the director or something.

As someone who never read the manga or played the video game, and never plans to, I see a similarity between these shows that are directly based off of video games. They feel so structured that they end up stiff to the viewer. It just felt very similar to Danganronpa, a show that's very popular but I never could get into. I disliked Danganronpa so much I gave it a 4, but I like this a lot better. The music, atmosphere, and dub voice actors are far superior in my opinion....However, I see a lot of the online community shipping Rachel (aged 13) with Isaac (aged 20).

Rachel is begging him to kill her throughout the show, and then when he is close to death, she decides to idolize him, calling him her God. The relationship is uncomfortable.

But, no, this won\'t be a diamond in the rough for most.Story (7)So, I honestly hate analyzing fictional stories (especially in English class), but when it\'s in your face, I\'m not mad at it...since it\'s something that can be figured out.Note, this show has a lot of religious (Christian) themes and S I N S, which as an atheist who has no clue of the Christianity lore, I really didn\'t understand anything. I understood only the most basic part---their names and how they use their names. I found this part interesting, with the idea of (what I assume) morality. It had an interesting plot when it comes to that, but the more the show went on, the lower the score is for me.Art (8)I mean, since it\'s based on a game and has otome game like characters, yes, the art is well done. No complaints there. Backgrounds are very well done.Sound (7)I honestly don\'t remember the sounds themselves, but I remember thinking that they were well timed. The OP and ED are fine if that\'s your standard for good sound. The voice acting well good, but I felt bad for our character named Isaac/Zac since his screams, although somewhat well done, I can\'t help but imagine someone recording themself screaming for hours.Character (6)With the introduction of our main character, I was like ""aah, this is our normal female character in a thriller video game..."" but then at the end of the episode, I was like ""hah?"" Watching the show, I understand, but it\'s still so strange. For the other characters, fitting as they\'re bosses, they\'re good at being evil and eccentric. Isaac, the most interesting to me, had an interesting story though his motives were kind of whack (as well as his relationship with the protagonist). To cut it short, you\'ll only care about what happens to Isaac and everyone else is literally more messed up with him.Well, after I watched the ending, I was ""meh"" on it since it wasn\'t the ending I was looking for, but it suited what the whole show was about. Although someone with more interest in the bible will understand the dark undertones, anyone can kind of understand the surface/major meaning of the show. I wouldn\'t recommend this show for a new watcher of anime or a major anime critic who has high expectations for everything. I would say if you enjoyed 91 Days, this is a show that can\'t be as good as that, but probably gives the same amount of fulfillment as it (you know what will happen in the end, but you keep on watching and is still unsatisfied with the ending).So, if you watch it, it\'s because you\'re bored, not looking for a good show.

I was like hmmm interesting title, this sounds like a cool anime. Honestly after watching the first episode i will say the first thing that really attracted me to it was the art style. Its a very beautiful anime, very well made in that sense. Though after watching the first episode I wasn\\t sure how i felt about this anime. Though i decided to continue and im content that i did. I wont go down and say that this anime is ground breaking or amazing cause that would...be a lie. I really enjoyed the supporting characters i felt that they brought more to the main characters. Especially considering Rachel Gardener didn\'t really draw you in as a likeable character. I found myself very intrigued by Zacks character wanting to know more and more. I felt though even in the end they didn\'t explain enough. Its a decent watch but, there was just something missing in a lot of the story. It was a good anime that will have you wanting to watch more but at the end you may just be feeling like well what?"" I would suggest this to people who like animes with lots of twists and turns but i wouldn\'t say this is the show thats really going to make you feel changed.

Rachel is boring, zack is funny and semi enjoyable until ep 10 then he becomes like everyone else. everyone but Rachel and zack is FORGETTABLE!!i don\'t like the weird talks about god, and how Rachel worshipped zack like god at a point, i really hate how ""P3d0-y"" their...relationship was, really uncomfortable.i really think only people 10-14 would enjoy this. relationship was, really uncomfortable.i really think only people 10-14 would enjoy this.', ""I feel like the plot was forced throughout the show and it just did not feel real.

Set in an abandoned building with a reoccurring theme of escape. I wasn't personally a huge fan of the anime itself for the lack of gore for the genre. When you watch a horror anime, you expect the gore to be equal to it's rating. Which it doesn't really hold a candle to it. The only enjoyable part about the entire anime is some of the conversations which take place between characters. If it wasn't for how the plot was laid out, I may have rated it higher. The plot was lacking a lot....There wasn't really much development throughout the 16 episodes and it sort of felt rushed towards the end. Overall, the anime doesn't hold water to it's synopsis. Reading the synopsis, one would think it was promising and had potential. But what was written doesn't exactly equate with what played out.

I was curious to see what it was about after briefly skimming some reviews on MAL (avoided any that had blatant spoilers) and was surprised. In a good way.In all honesty, the story and plot itself is a little... eh. A solid 6 at best. At least for me. It started to lose me along the way, and after a couple episodes, the need to keep watching started dying down. It wasn\'t a chore to finish it the entire way through though, I was genuinely curious to see how it would pan out. So there was...no need for me to force myself to finish it (besides, it\'s only 16 episodes).If you\'re looking for a somewhat realistic psychological anime that makes sense, Angels of Death might not be (it\'s very hit or miss). There were many moments that had me thinking ""this is not possible"". And I know it\'s an anime, and its aim is to explore different themes and it\'s psychological blah blah, but it\'s set in the ""real world"". Meaning no superpowers or super-human strength. Some things just shouldn\'t have been possible, but it was a plot device. Because if the anime was constrained by laws of nature, then... it would\'ve been very boring (and I will happily acknowledge that).One thing that never got boring for me though was the MC - Isaac Foster. I can\'t really tell whether it\'s Isaac Foster or Rachel, but MAL lists him first so... yes. If there\'s one thing this anime does really well, it\'s develop the relationship between the two MC\'s. And also, I enjoyed Zack as a character overall (even though he has MANY flaws going for him). Every single time he was on screen (which is virtually 90% of the time, maybe even more) my eyes were glued to him. Rachel was interesting too, I wish the anime had delved a little deeper into her, but it ended in a way that doesn\'t require another season.Curiosity kept me going the entire way, and the relationship between the two MC\'s and themselves as characters kept my attention long enough to get through.

Angels of death! *Menacing* Angels of Death is about a 13 year old quiet blond girl named Rachel, who wakes up without any memories in some basement of an abandoned building. She wakes up and walks around for a bit and runs into this one interesting character. Some guy wrapped in bandages wielding a scythe named Zack. He tries to kill her, but after a series of spoilerly events they reconcile and decide to work together to escape the building they are trapped in. They are held together by 2 promises. The promise that Zack will do everything...he can to help get them out of there, and that when they finally get out, Zach will kill Rachel.This is sort of confusing, because this is Rachel’s wish. Yes, she wants to die. We can check that motive off the list of edgy anime. But no, wait a minute, she only wants to die by Zack’s hands though. This is because Zack made a mindless comment on how he “swears to god” that he’ll kill her, and due to her devout belief, she takes that as a promise that she must help him keep. She's the smart one. The brains.As most of these pairs go, Zack is the muscle of the duo. But not so much muscle as a violent, unstoppable, borderline supernatural force. He’s pretty stupid and relies on Rachel to give him orders a lot of the time. Well, it's not as much as relies on her, its just that he takes what she tells him to do, and takes it as a suggestion instead of something that will get them out of there faster, easier, and without harm. From what I can see, his only motivation is killing. He’s only helping Rachel because 1. He wants to kill her, and 2. He wants to get out to kill some more. All of this is in a character design which looks like a 12 year old child of divorce would create. Bandages covering his body entire, black hoodie, bloodstains all over his body, and one of his most prominent features, his huge fucking scythe he just carries around with him for the entire show. I called him a supernatural force earlier because this fucker just won't die. Over the course of the show, he’s been stabbed, blogdended, ripped open, poisoned, fucking took the electric chair multiple times, and walked away with minimal injuries. To end it off, Zack’s voice is awful and makes ME want to take the electric chair when he laughs.Enough about him, let’s get into the wondrous story they give us in Angels of Death. As stated earlier, they’re trapped in a mysterious building, and they’re working to get out of there. They work together to solve puzzles, defeat villains, and get to higher and higher floors. On every floor there’s a villain trying to kill them and who they have to defeat to get to the next floor. These are the characters you’ll see in the poster art. These characters aren’t really notable and are just as edgy as the main characters. Mainly in the sense where they just want to kill without little motivation to do so except they like to. The protagonist also find clues to learn more about themselves and their pasts in the process.You may have read back in the previous paragraph and squinted your eyes just a little bit when I said that they solve puzzles to get out. Maybe you thought it was just some bad wording on my part, but, in fact, they are puzzles. Now you see, Angels of Death was originally a game. Not only a game, an rpg maker game. You can find and play it on steam right now. I don’t know how accurately the anime follows the game, but the fact that there are scenes in the anime that directly reference to what I assume were real puzzles in the game. At one point, with no sense or irony at all, they find a switch to open a door hidden underneath a pot. If that doesn’t scream game adaptation, I don’t know what is. The anime also has a fuck ton of these long corridors for these characters slowly walk down, which is very game like. With these unnecessarily perfect adaptations of the game, you gotta wonder what creative liberties they took with the anime in the first place. If I would’ve watched a lets play on the game, would I have the same experience as I had while watching the anime? I mean, as a game, it has a pretty interesting concept. The protagonist teams up with the first floor boss and goes through the game and watches the 2 bosses duke it out. But it just doesn’t transfer to anime I feel.The thing about the animation, is that it sucks most of the time. But, for some reason, I don’t know what, the blood splatters that come out of the body looks really good. I the art makes an impression I guess. I mean, its not pretty at all. But it mainly having to do with lots of fun and unique character designs, despite everything being edgy, they look good I must admit. They really represent their character.One more thing about this show which, in my eyes, is despicable. At the end of the anime, it's a cliffhanger, you know? Pretty shitty, but the thing is that all the rest will be revealed in the specials revealed in the blu ray release. This is incredibly scummy to me. Having the rest of the story in the specials, means that nobody will be able to finish the story without buying the actual blu ray disk. Legally at least. I guess you could buy the game, but anime onlies are going to be very angry.I give Angels of Death, a 2 out of 10. I recommend to whoever just wants to watch an terrible edgy show for the lolz.

I started liking it in the middle and once they started talking about the main characters's pasts I was hooked. So that's it.

We follow them on their quest to escape from a certain hospital which also doubles as a hunting ground for sociopaths who kill the unfortunate souls that enter the damned building. Each floor of the building is occupied by one of these psychopaths who will kill anyone who enters their “level”.One of our main...characters, Isaac is in charge of the bottom-most level where he tries to kill Rachael but fails to do so. Rachael, then remembers some stuff that happened to her in her past and comes to the very obvious conclusion - that she needs to die; but she doesn’t want to commit suicide because “God will not forgive her, for suicide is a sin”.  So, she does what any sane person would do, she asks for Isaac to kill her to which he gives her the stupendous reply that he won’t kill her because her face doesn’t look good. So they decide to team up and escape the building together and thus starts the abomination that is Angels of Death.You might think that a premise like this must provide some sort of entertainment to the viewer, and it does, which is immediately ruined by the introduction of some cardboard cutout character who wants to kill Zack and Rachael. The characters that occupy the floors of the building try to kill them because how else will we progress our non-existent and a sorry excuse for a plot?Let’s talk about Rachael. She wants to die but won’t let anyone kill her and neither will she kill herself. This state of ambivalence is never clearly explained. You could argue that she promised Isaac that she would help emancipate him, but why the hell does she care when she just wants to go to the afterlife? Also she doesn’t speak much and is brooding all the time for some equivocal reason.

Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Fukkatsu-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7144/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato__Fukkatsu-hen,"[""-This review may contain spoilers from the movie and from the original series-When talking about anime classics, there are not many series that rank higher than Uchuu Senkan Yamato, and with good reason, as Yamato is one of the greatest space operas out there.This movie takes place in the year 2220, 21 years after the original series (which also has a remake now), and it's a direct sequel, where Kodai will again be the main character and will be in charge of leading an inmigration fleet to an other planet because a black hole is approaching Earth, and the days of the blue planet are...counted.This completely remade story shows us how CGI can actually be an incredible tool in animation when used well (and when having good budget). Yamato's animation, which uses CGI A LOT, is really mindblowing. Throughout the whole movie, there is always consistent great animation, with very well made battles between spaceships. Yamato is second to none in this.Music also plays a big factor in this movie, which uses a lot of beautiful classical music such as Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave, Chopin's Nocturne #1 or Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Besides that, there's always the classical Yamato theme played in grand fashion and in various ways and a very nice ending to close the movie.The story started good, but it did get worse by the second half. Still, thanks to great animation, sound and action, the movie never ceased to entertain one bit. The first half of the movie was pretty good story-wise. Kodai had a clear mission, we got to meet a great enemy general and, while not very complex, things were very good. Things got a little worse when we suddenly got a rather plain villain, making the series almost a simple evil vs good thing. Still action didn't drop one bit, and the Space Battleship Yamato proved to be as awesome as ever, showing its upgraded power to the fullest. The movie put the ship in some dire situations, which resulted in some of the best space action I've ever seen.Besides Kodai, who enters the movie as a memorable character already, there isn't really any character that stood out much to me. They fullfilled their role well, but they were definitely not as good as the original Yamato crew.Another slight problem is that for flashback scenes, they actually really just used things from the 1983 movie, which of course, looked very out of place in this 2010 movie. Still, that was just at a very specific moment of the anime, so it's not something that will really hinder the experience in any way. You can actually be positive and use the moment to see how anime has evolved in the last 30 years.You will notice that some major events happened between the original series and this movie... that'd be Kanketsu-hen, which hasn't been remade. While it's impossible not to notice, and while having watched Kanketsu-hen before would make the experience better, you don't really need to watch it. Just with the original series you should be fine.This movie's definitely not as good as the original series, but it's still a very nice sequel, and some of the main strong points of Yamato are kept intact. It is something very nice how Kodai has matured as a person between the original series and this movie, as you can see how, little by little, he's becoming more like the legendary Juzo Okita.And even if its not as good as the original series, if you enjoyed that one, Uchuu Senkan Yamato: Fukkatsu-hen should be one hell of a ride. But again, watching the original series is a must in this case. counted.This completely remade story shows us how CGI can actually be an incredible tool in animation when used well (and when having good budget).

Whereas the likes of Farewell Yamato suffered from extremely truncated plotting despite being upwards of 2h30 long, Resurrection skillfully weaves many plot threads together into something that ultimately satisfies. Yes, the film could still perhaps have stood to be slightly...longer in order to add a little more weight to certain key scenes (and honestly they probably had enough material here to produce a full 24 episode TV series if they had really wanted to), but I will readily accept a film which surges relentlessly forward, as this does, over one which crawls along at a snail's pace.The story itself is classic Yamato, filled with heroism, sacrifice, and themes of duty, honor and earned respect. This time the sci-fi elements fall slightly more within the realms of reality than the lovably ludicrous premises of previous entries, though it probably goes without saying that this is still fairly cartoonish stuff. The imminent destruction of the Earth due to an encroaching black hole establishes the familiar atmosphere of impending doom for the franchise, but this time the humanoid threat is more complex, and the politics more developed, with an enemy faction made up of many races who are not necessarily comfortable alongside each other. This all provides the backdrop for scenes of valorous deeds and desperate gambits as the Yamato, under command of the now older and more authoritative Kodai, struggles to defend the vulnerable emigrant fleet carrying humanity to a new world. While the main plot is fully wrapped-up, there are some prominent side threads left hanging, presumably for a sequel which sadly never materialized.Production-wise, Resurrection is superb, with top rate visuals and audio. The ships of course are now CG but they look impressively detailed and thankfully there is no simulated-low-framerate nonsense being employed in the rendering. The characters on the other hand are traditionally animated and move with the high degree of fluidity and expressiveness that you might find in something like Gundam Unicorn or another similarly lavish work. Perhaps the biggest highlight of the film's presentation though is its music - suitably epic reworkings of classic Yamato themes now sit alongside pieces from the classical repertoire, which are all beautifully matched to the scenes in which they appear; the frenetic third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata being used as the backdrop to a space dogfight is particularly electrifying.Overall the biggest disappointment with this film is simply that, as previously mentioned, more weren't made. From what I can gather, sequels were planned but scrapped in favor of Yamato 2199, which released three years later. It's difficult to find solid info on this so I can't say for sure how that outcome was reached, but I might guess that its connection to the previous Yamato installments of the 70s and 80s made Resurrection seem inaccessible to younger audiences in a way that the full-on reboot of 2199 wasn't. While it's true that familiarity with these characters will make the film more impactful, I think this could be enjoyed as a standalone experience by anyone who craves a well-crafted space opera anime. Certainly, fans of Yamato should not make the same mistake I did by overlooking this for years, it's great. longer in order to add a little more weight to certain key scenes (and honestly they probably had enough material here to produce a full 24 episode TV series if they had really wanted to), but I will readily accept a film which surges relentlessly forward, as this does, over one which crawls along at a snail's pace.The story itself is classic Yamato, filled with heroism, sacrifice, and themes of duty, honor and earned respect.

Umisea,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49860/Umisea,"['Work that will only appeal to those who are already Hololive fans, and not thanks to its quality but just by featuring the Hololive characters – main enticement being the collaboration between the JP and EN branch.The content consists of the four girls having their short sea/island adventure, mostly of the comedy kind. That said, the comedy is unfortunately tamer and far from the more interesting style of Holo no Graffiti. Being just few minutes long and still mostly episodic format, don’t expect much more from the story being a canvas for the jokes and tee-tee.While it’s nice to see Hololive content with a traditional...2D animation, the quality is unfortunately dangerously close to being a picture drama. I wish for us to someday get more animated content with the quality of Hololive Alternative instead.Concerning the sound, a choice has been made to let the JP members speak in Japanese and EN members speak in English. While that makes sense on paper, I think it would be better to just have the EN members speak in Japanese too, as they are both capable of doing that. Additionally, as much as I like Ina, her voice acting when reading from paper is a bit too stiff and different from her natural speaking during streams, so speaking Japanese could muffle this defect a bit.Overall, there is no need to watch this if you don’t like Hololive as if that’s the case you won’t like this. And even if you are, don’t set your expectations too high, just enjoy this as a small side project. 2D animation, the quality is unfortunately dangerously close to being a picture drama.

I really like it, it might not be the most detailed but its simple to look at. Also the voice acting was done well, you could almost believe the marine is a real pirate.Even though theres a language barrier between the jp and en girls, they somehow still overcome it and make it funny and the translation are good...for non japanese speaking people.#Umiseaforever for non japanese speaking people.#Umiseaforever', ""Umisea was kind of a letdown, to be honest (´･･)... While the idea of a shark vtuber and a squid vtuber going on adventures in the ocean sounds cool, the show just didn't deliver for me. The characters were (¬_¬) kind of bland and lacked depth, and the story was predictable and (´-ω-) unexciting. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it just never did (¯_(ツ)/¯).The animation and production values of Umisea were also disappointing. The animation was simplistic and lacked the detail and fluidity that you would expect from a modern animated series (╯︵╰,). The sound design was also nothing to write...home about (¯―¯٥). The music was forgettable and the voice acting was just okay.That being said, there were some parts of the show that I did enjoy (＾◡＾). The character designs were cute and colorful, and there were some entertaining moments when the characters interacted with each other or encountered new creatures in the ocean. However, these moments were few and far between, and overall, the show just didn't hold my interest.In conclusion, Umisea is a mediocre show that falls short in many areas. While it has some cute character designs and entertaining moments, the lack of depth in the characters and story, as well as the underwhelming animation and sound design, make it a forgettable experience. If you're a big fan of virtual YouTubers, you might find some enjoyment in it, but for me, it just didn't cut it (ಥ_ಥ). home about (¯―¯٥).
