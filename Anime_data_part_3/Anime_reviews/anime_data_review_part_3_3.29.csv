Sora wo Miageru Shoujo no Hitomi ni Utsuru Sekai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5702/Sora_wo_Miageru_Shoujo_no_Hitomi_ni_Utsuru_Sekai,"[""I was already a fan of the Munto series before this series was released so I was quite interested in seeing the conclusion.  While I was originally very excited Kyoto Animation was giving Munto a TV adaptation, I was a bit disappointed to learn that it would contain a remake of the original material already released before.  Still all Munto fans should not miss this series.As mentioned this is a retelling of the original series with new footage.  So the first 6 episodes are pretty much entirely identical to the two original OVA.  There may have been a few new scenes...intermingled in but there are basically no changes.  This also means that it is not necessary for anyone to have any prior knowledge of the series in order to start this.  The original series has been at times hard to find so if you have been curious about this show then you can dive right into this version without worry.Overall I found the plot to be interesting and enjoyable but it does have some annoying flaws.  Namely being that it seems to jump around to much and leaves you feeling a bit confused as to what’s going on.  Things tend to be adequately explained eventually but there were quite a few head scratching moments for me.  Exacerbating this is the schizophrenic way the story jumps from action packed battle scenes back to slow paced school life.  In addition the dialogue at times is incredibly silly and pompous.  Its possible translator did a poor job with it but I feel it probably sounded just as bad to someone fluent in Japanese.The story, while it feels like it’s over still doesn’t feel done.  I am not going to rant and rave about yet another piss poor anime conclusion because this isn’t one.  However there are several key plot elements that are left intentionally vague, whether to either set the stage for a future series or just to avoid having to explain things the plot didn’t tell adequately in the first place.Munto's main protagonist Yumemi was an interesting character.  We get to delve into her personality rather deeply and most of the story is told through her perspective.  I think she will be a relatable heroine to viewers as she struggles with just normal teenage girl issues and with her special ability to see the sky in a way nobody else is able to.  She grows up a lot as well and discovers things about herself and learns to be more confident.Munto himself has his own back story and motivations well fleshed out in a series of flashbacks.  Though even with this I never really felt that I really got to know him all that well.  Most of his screen time seems to involve him grunting and yelling, blowing stuff up in spectacular magical attacks, or pleading with Yumemi to help save the world.  I can’t really say I cared much for him.The only other character with any real depth is Ichiko.  She is Yumemi's best friend and struggles to understand her and protect her from all the mysterious things happening around them.  I got the feeling that she felt love for Yumemi in more than a friend kind of way but this was never pursued nor did I feel that this love was returned in kind from Yumemi, other than her own deep feelings of friendship.The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable.  Mostly because there are just too damn many of them.  Many of them take up way too much story time that should have been focused on the main characters.  Other than Suzume your unlikely to even remember the names of any of the others.  The series would have been a lot better with half as many.  Even the villains are weak and don’t have much depth.  If you don’t know the bad guys name or why he is fighting against the hero then how can you care about anything they do?  It basically breaks down to, I’m bad so I fight you or I’m a pompous ass who thinks only I have all the answers.KyoAni is well known and respected for their exceptional animation work.  With Munto it’s a bit of a mixed bag.  They took the original OVA material and basically just touched it up but the quality of the animation as a whole feels very inconsistent.  However the last few episodes which were mostly new material looked quite stunning.  So even though I didn’t find it quite lived up to the high standards they have set for themselves it was still pretty good.The music and acting are solid.  Though there was a lot of screaming dialogue and a couple annoying characters who grated on my nerves.  The music was good and both the OP/EN sequences were beautifully performed.I ended up enjoying Munto quite a bit though despite my complaints.  As a fantasy-adventure story it makes for an entertaining experience.  While it won’t go down as a classic, I think it will be mostly liked by those who view it. intermingled in but there are basically no changes.

Before you wtf and ask yourself wtf happens to the animation throughout the anime please take into consideration that most of the series consists of the recycled original OVAs that were produced a couple of years ago already.Story: The story revolves around Yumemi, a normal girl who has a secret power in her which allows her to see the world of the magical beings who live in the sky. In that world Munto, the King of the Magical Kingdom, is in a...constant struggle in order to save his people from various different crisis who mostly revolves around the world\'s energy source, the Akuto. Munto seeks Yumemi for help to save both worlds who are in danger. The premise of the story is an interesting one, however lazy writing and a constant problem of leaving plot holes unexplained can leave the viewer confused and disappointed in the story. It is a shame since the story could\'ve felt so much more complete if better explained, and why is it only 9 episodes? extra episodes could\'ve helped get your story pieced together better. Despite all that the story is still rather enjoyable and is definitely not the worst you\'ll see.Art: This one is tricky to judge. As previously said the first couple of episodes consists of pretty much copy/pasting scenes from their original OVAs and then just giving it a color adjustment. This is a real letdown since this creates big inconsistencies in the animation as the show progresses. The first 3 episodes are OVA 1, which was produced 6 years ago, which if compared to today\'s animation it will certainly look inferior. The next 3 episodes are OVA 2, which where made 4 years ago, the animation is greatly improved from the first 3 episodes but the sudden change in styles may not get on people\'s good sides. The final 3 episodes are completely brand new Kyoto Animation animations and as expected it looks great with very fluid motion, however the sudden changes in art style might not please some people. The end result however was not a bad one and I really did enjoy the visuals for most of the show.Sound: Something the original OVAs lacked greatly was a good OST, and this anime gives you a rather awesome one. A lot of the scores in the anime sound very impressive and gives a sense of epicness to some of the great action that this anime brings. I was really pleased with this soundtrack and it really made the show much more enjoyable.Character: Another one of the animes rather weak points were the characters. Aside from Yumemi and Munto the anime just kinda throws characters at you whose roles end up being insignificant in the end. The main villain of the show was not that interesting, and was rather unimpressive to say the least.Enjoyment: Despite having some issues, I really enjoyed this show, it was quite an interesting thing to see KyoAni tackle a more action oriented show and I was not disappointed by the end result. However it does feel like the production got lazy for reusing 6 year old animation instead of just remaking it from scratch in the beginning.Overall: Munto TV was a pretty enjoyable show. If you like seeing great action accompanied with good music in a magical/fantasy setting. Then I recommend you check it out. constant struggle in order to save his people from various different crisis who mostly revolves around the world\'s energy source, the Akuto.

Friends trusting each other seems to be a recurring theme in the plot. It\'s not your standard fantasy story with demons and rescuing a maiden though! The story requires you to pay attention. Not all concepts were explained properly, but that was okay with me since it didn\'t stand in the way of fun.I didn\'t really have any big issues with the story. One of the characters, Suzume, gets her own little side-story early on which I thought had no relevance to the main plot....The only reason I can see why is because she would have had no depth at all otherwise.Art:You\'ve probably seen by now that this is made by Kyoto Animation who also animated Suzumiya Haruhi, Clannad, K-On! and several other extremely popular shows. The animation may not be state of the art, but it\'s still pleasing to the eye and very colorful. I didn\'t notice any scenes where the characters looked awkward if there were any. Definitely be on the lookout for small little details you might have missed on your first time watching if you\'re watching it a second time like I did.Sound:Not much to complain about here. The opening song is by Eufonius, best known for remixing Mag Mell for the first Clannad season. The ending song is by Ceui, who also made the ending song for the anime ""sola"". Personally, I liked both songs. The background music throughout the show helps set the mood and raise the tension where needed.Character:Yumemi, the main character, has great character development throughout the show. It\'s a nice change to see a girl character who isn\'t a total doormat for once. She is actually the one who saves the day instead of being saved every time. Her friends are there to support her which makes me like them and Yumemi more.The other main character, Munto, who the series is named after also gets some good back-story and development. He starts out rather impatient but slowly learns to trust Yumemi. His back-story was understandable but it could\'ve gotten more attention in my opinion.The rest of the characters are not so developed but that\'s understandable due to the shortness of the series. One thing that bugs me is that they could\'ve explained the motivation behind the main bad guy better.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime even more the second time I watched it. What I enjoyed the most is how I got sucked into the Munto universe for awhile (no pun intended). It\'s original fantasy fun.Overall:This show is a mix of several genres like fantasy, romance, action and slice of life all put into a short nine episode show. If you like any of those then why not try it? I wish there were more episodes. The only reason I can see why is because she would have had no depth at all otherwise.Art:You\'ve probably seen by now that this is made by Kyoto Animation who also animated Suzumiya Haruhi, Clannad, K-On! and several other extremely popular shows.

I\'m probably going to end up comparing (i.e. contrasting) this more than I really should with Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, which is (was?) my current benchmark in bad fantasy anime.Story: 3/10Munto TV is a rerelease and continuation of two OVAs from KyoAni in 2003 and 2005, if I recall correctly.  The story itself (go check the synopsis) is fairly generic, although that\'s not a problem if the storytelling is excellent.  Of course, therein lies the rub; Munto TV\'s...storytelling is anything but excellent.  When I say ""rerelease,"" I mean it almost literally; Munto TV feels like it\'s cobbled together, lacking a proper flow between OVA segments.  Additionally, it turns out that not a whole lot actually happens.  It doesn\'t even have a melodramatic and focused (although still cliched as hell) finale, unlike in Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora.Art: 9/10What can I say?  KyoAni is good.  Really good.  If you want high production values, they\'ll give \'em to you.  The art is crystal clear, and the animation is fluid.  Backgrounds are detailed, designs are fitting, both for the environments and for characters.  I can dock one point only for the fact that they\'re not animating very many really awesome sequences, therefore wasting the extraordinary fluidity.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack is decent, although it doesn\'t always manage to create the perfect mood, unlike Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora.  That series wasn\'t salvageable either, unsurprisingly, as it\'s from the fantasy genre too.  Instrumentation seems to be of high quality.  OP and ED are disposable, as usual.Character: 6/10Munto TV had a neat thing going with Yumemi as a realistically reluctant and skeptical heroine, but this was wrecked by sudden character shifts required by the OVA timeframe.  Lord Munto was pretty cool, but he was also affected by the timeframe.  Suzune got way more characterization than she should have, given the timeframe, although I understand that her section of the story was metaphoric.  Ichiko was...meh.  All other characters might as well not have had names or faces.  Really, Yumemi from the first third of the series netted an extra 2 points.Enjoyment: 4/10It was honestly painful to watch this.  This was mainly due to my hopes shattering, with the shards subsequently working their way deeper and deeper into my skin.  Maybe that\'s unfair, but that\'s the only basis I have for a rating of enjoyment.  Episode eight made me want to stop watching, but I was so close to the end that I just sucked it up.  It didn\'t even give me the satisfaction of terribly amusing (and amusingly terrible) screenshots, unlike Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora.Overall: 4/10Go watch Vision of Escaflowne if you want good fantasy anime.  Or go play a fantasy adventure RPG.  You really have better things to do with your time than watch this.  KyoAni needs to stick to adapting pre-existing material if this is the pinnacle of its story-writing ability. storytelling is anything but excellent.

I'd say it's a bit slicy-of-life convined with a bit of fantasy and a growing themed-anime, with a lot of tenderness and loyalty involved.Art: The art is quite enjoyable, the characters are very cartoony, but fit with the fantasy story very well. The only thing is..., well, the art by itself seems...to change through the anime, not sure if I missed the explanation, but Munto seems to change constantly =PSound: Most of the music was too pop for me, but I must say I'll give it a 10 just for this sole song:  Hikari to Yami to Toki no Hate, that has this fantasy/medieval feeling and has great lyrics that cover perfectly the feelings of this anime.Enjoyment: As it is a very short anime is hard to get bored, although it might be a bit slow for action lovers, fights are not the main focus here.Overal: If you enjoy stories that leave you with a bittersweet after taste and are willing to deal with the fact that the plot will develop quite fast without much explanation as long animes, I think you'll enjoy it. to change through the anime, not sure if I missed the explanation, but Munto seems to change constantly =PSound: Most of the music was too pop for me, but I must say I'll give it a 10 just for this sole song:  Hikari to Yami to Toki no Hate, that has this fantasy/medieval feeling and has great lyrics that cover perfectly the feelings of this anime.Enjoyment: As it is a very short anime is hard to get bored, although it might be a bit slow for action lovers, fights are not the main focus here.Overal: If you enjoy stories that leave you with a bittersweet after taste and are willing to deal with the fact that the plot will develop quite fast without much explanation as long animes, I think you'll enjoy it."", ""Sora wo Miageru Shoujo no Hitomi ni Utsuru Sekai or Munto TV is basically an adaptation of the two original OAVs, although adaption is used loosley as they didn't exactly adapt it but rather just used what was there and added a bit at the end. It is a story of a magical world that is being destroyed and the King of said world goes down to the human world to find the girl seen in the visions to hold a tremendous amount of power (Akuto) that is enough to save both worlds from iminent destruction.There are two worlds, the human world is well just...normal but does suther a few after effects like earthquakes, the magical world floats above and is quite a stereotypical fantasy world with people having pointy ears and lots of greenery and opening settings.This isn't a comedy its a straight up fantasy adventure but it does include a few little scene such as Ichikos father in episode 5 to add a little light heartedness into the mix. I feel as a TV series it fails, it basically copy and pasted the OAVs without even adding everything, i do feel they added and subtracted a little but nothing major which is a cop out on their part as this could have been a lot better, you can tell episodes seven through nine had better artwork and was more enjoyable for it.The art and animation were ok, nothing great but it did an ok job but for a fantasy series you want huge scenes with gorgeous scenery and smooth animation. The biggest disapointement as i have already stated is the fact that they used the old art and never remade it so its like watching a 2009 series made in 2003. There are a few nicely animated scenes and cool smoke and explosion effects. The backgrounds could have been better for a fantasy series but they were acceptable and helped create a difference between the greeness of one world and the concreteness of the other.Voice actors all seemed ok, a couple characters had annoying high pitched voices as the enhance their characters cuteness or a childish nature compared to other characters but they all did a decent job and was only let down by a few poorly written lines. The opening is an unoriginal J-Pop song but is still a fairly nice song and enjoyable to listen to. Background music always fitted the mood of each scene but never stood out and make you say wow. Ending theme song is a slow calming song that is beutiful but again is nothing new that we haven;t heard before.Yumemi the girl that is destined to save the worlds and is the only human who can see the magical world and was often teased as a child. she starts the first half of the show rather reluctant to jump inot things and start believing all this nonsense she's being told which is a nice change from the usually power to save everyone type series. Munto is the King of the magical world and throughout the series seemed to hold as much power as the plot needed, whether it was just transversing worlds, destroying multiple enemies at once or biding time by holding the world together, whatever was needed he was capable of doing. Yumemi has two close friends; Suzume and Ichiko, Suzume is a rather childish naive girl who is dating a slightly older guy and does have a moment with him in an early episode just so the series doesn't focus everything on one point. Ichiko is a tomboyish girl who seems to have more of an impact with Yumemi as she is constantly trying to be there for her and protect her but because she can't see the magical world is constantly in pain over not being able to fully help. Gntarl is the main bad guy but to behonest he isn't much of a threat as he is a dick head, he shares the same goal as everyone else, to save the heavens but can he cooperate? No, can he trust Munto? No, he is never developed so you don't know why he is like that.As a short fantasy series it is a decent watch, its only nine episodes long and could have been better had there been more character development for some characters.

Why does the world think this is perfectly normal like the government should be freaking out. This was a sad waste of time. *sigh* But the animation art was worth it."", 'Recommendation: An incoherent mess that wastes an interesting premise.  Skip it.Story: The plot of this series follows a middle school girl named Yumemi who sees floating islands in the skies and eventually a godlike figure named Munto who tells her that he needs her help to save both her world and his.  This is because the flow of ""Akuto"", a sort of magical resource or energy made from the hopes and dreams of humans that Munto\'s people (known as the Heavenly Beings) need to live and use magic, has dried up after an eternity of wasteful overuse by Heavenly Beings drunk on their...own power.  Yumemi is the only one who can restore the flow of Akuto, but any questions about how or why she can do this are simply ignored. Yumemi can do it because she\'s The Chosen One and that\'s that.  You will never get a more satisfying explanation than that.The plot itself is a disaster.  This series was a near shot-for-shot remake and continuation of a 2 part OVA series and they didn\'t bother trying to change the structure for a 9 episode series as opposed to 2 movies.  The result is horrendous pacing, irrelevant subplots that are dropped cold when that particular movie\'s arc is finished, and an awkward break in the series after episode 3 (where the 1st movie ends) where it looks like everything has been resolved, only to suddenly pick back up and keep going for 6 more episodes.  The romance parts feel like they were tacked on as an afterthought, and the ""you can do anything if you believe in your dreams"" ending was corny and far too vague.  In general, the story relies far too much on characters overcoming their struggles purely through the power of self-belief, which allows them to simply do whatever they want with magic to achieve the desired result.  It\'s almost childish in a way how the show explicitly rejects (through a Yumemi monologue late in the series) the idea that you would ever need to make tradeoffs or sacrifice something to achieve a goal.  The overall message of the show seems to be that you just need to believe in yourself and you\'ll magically achieve the perfect outcome every time.Audio/Visual: Can best be described as ""inconsistent"".  The voice acting is just okay, some of the VAs have the annoyingly high pitched child voice going, and Yumemi\'s VA occasionally has problems where she slips into a normal woman\'s speaking voice instead of her usual helium-filled schoolgirl voice.  But for the most part, it\'s fine.  Likewise with the visuals.  They look fine, if a bit dated to my eyes in 2021, but it varies widely throughout the course of an episode.  The backgrounds look gorgeous and the fight scenes bring out the style and visual creativity that you\'d expect from Kyoto Animation, but other parts look shockingly unfinished, especially characters that aren\'t in the foreground of a shot.  Character design can also be an issue at times.  Most of the characters suffer from Code Geass syndrome and are far too long and skinny, especially the Heavenly Beings.  The worst offender is Munto\'s character design, looking like a red-haired Goku that\'s 6\'+ tall and maybe 90 pounds at mostCharacters: In writing this part of the review, I am trying to think of a single interesting or good character in this show, and Ichiko might be the only one.  Yumemi and Munto, despite being the main characters of the series, have very little in the way of interior lives and zero romantic chemistry with each other.  Yumemi\'s friend Ichiko has the most compelling storyline of the human characters, struggling to support Yumemi as she deals with something Ichiko can\'t see or understand.  Suzume gets the worst of it, shoved into a deeply uncomfortable and completely irrelevant romance subplot where she, a 13 year old girl who looks and acts only slightly older than a toddler, gets married to a college student named Kazuya, and this is presented as a heartwarming story of how her innocence and support healed him, rather than child grooming.  Fortunately this subplot is dropped and barely even referenced again after episode 3, but it never should have been included in the first place.  Part way through the series, they attempt to shoehorn a male character named Takashi into the group of 3 girls and act like he was always one of their group, but he too doesn\'t matter even a little bit to the story, and has even less personality than the others.  Outsider Gass has a compelling story and personality, but the series leaves it entirely up to you to figure it out on your own rather than delving into the actually interesting questions about why he sacrificed his status as Outsider.  As a whole, the characters are mostly uninteresting, and the few that have potential are mostly sidelined with their stories left untold.Overall, this is a series with an interesting concept and very poor execution, badly marred by terrible pacing, dead-end subplots, and boring characters.  You could probably reassemble the pieces here to tell a really good story, but what they actually released is a total trainwreck.  Don\'t waste your time with this series. own power.

Ryuusei no Rockman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1835/Ryuusei_no_Rockman,"[""megaman starforce is an a very underappreciated, and often criticized, series among megaman fans. many call it a battle network clone, or state that it has a poor plot/development as a whole.however, i respectfully disagree - moreover, i'm going to review the anime adaptation of the first game. although i have a different approach to this series, being an avid fan of its characters, i really do suggest playing the game before watching the anime. the game is far more enjoyable.but with that out of the way, here's my initial take on the starforce anime:character: as far as character development goes, the anime...adaption is fairly poor. the main character, subaru, is still given his respective treatment of depression after the loss of his father - however, his trauma is a bit downplayed in comparison to the game, making it less realistic and more so annoying at times. his companion, the class president luna shirogane, is terribly stereotyped - in the games, luna has an obvious crush on subaru, but this does not define her. whereas in the anime, she is almost ALWAYS trying to win over 'megaman's' affection, she even creates a rivalry with harp note/misora hibiki, someone she respects and BEFRIENDS in the games.as for the side characters, nothing really changes, since there not as important to begin with. however, misora hibiki, the popular pop-idol and roll/zero/protoman mix of the series, is drastically changed. although shes still enjoyable in the anime, her backstory is heavily toned down. (spoilers: her original reasons for becoming an idol deal with the loss of her mother. whereas the anime states that she just wanted to sing. which is fine on its own, but my point remains). however, like in the games, misora has more of a independent streak to her - she's able to hold her ground pretty well, and is willing to join the fight whenever she can. despite her slight flaws and somewhat forced romantic interest with subaru, shes still a good character.story: the adaption is rather... lacking in this aspect, but keep in mind that this is a kids anime primarily used by capcom to promote their new product/game. in essence, the story is changed completely from the game. subaru still has to fight the FM-ians, space beings that threaten to destroy earth, but instead of defeating them once, he faces them multiple times. in addition, the final antagonist is changed to (spoilers) gemini spark, an EM being that has taken control of tsukasa futaba, a young boy who befriends subaru.it should be noted that in the games, tsukasa is a FAR more complex character, as he suffers from multiple personality disorder. this is never mentioned in the anime, but is a major plot point in the games. tsukasa is also manipulated by gemini spark, but still has his own will, whereas the anime version has made him one being with a lack of empathy.in the end, its obvious that subaru, AKA megaman, saves the day - its your typical episodic kids show with a handful of filler episodes in-between, but in a way, it does develop characters such as the FM-ians. the game has never really provided these characters with personalities (exceptions obviously being warrock, subaru's partner, and harp, misora's partner, and gemini spark). its interesting to see characters interact in different settings, especially if these characters interested you while playing the game.art and sound: the art is, well, mediocre. its nothing impressive at all, and at times, looks rather bland. however, shingo adachi, one of the character designers for megaman battle network and sword art online, has animated or created the story-board work for some scenes. so you can look for some high-quality animation/art in between all of the basic animation. if you're a fan of the games, its something cool to see.as for the music? the openings are catchy as hell, albeit short. the music in the anime itself is also very good, but nothing too memorable. there's a few tracks i'd love to get a hold of, but sadly an OST CD was never released. (due to the show being so low in ratings).verdict: megaman starforce is a gem for its fans, but its nothing outstanding. while there are major differences from the core material, it is still enjoyable to watch as it expands on the personalities of its minor characters. the art isnt top notch, but you can REALLY tell when some of the animators pour their hearts out into some of the scenes.this series isn't for everyone, but its worth a try - each episode is about 9 minutes each, and if you're looking for some megaman action, its a pretty cute show with interesting designs. and, as a bonus, the second season has a lot of beautiful fighting scenes.6.5 or 7/10 adaption is fairly poor. the main character, subaru, is still given his respective treatment of depression after the loss of his father - however, his trauma is a bit downplayed in comparison to the game, making it less realistic and more so annoying at times. his companion, the class president luna shirogane, is terribly stereotyped - in the games, luna has an obvious crush on subaru, but this does not define her. whereas in the anime, she is almost ALWAYS trying to win over 'megaman's' affection, she even creates a rivalry with harp note/misora hibiki, someone she respects and BEFRIENDS in the games.as for the side characters, nothing really changes, since there not as important to begin with. however, misora hibiki, the popular pop-idol and roll/zero/protoman mix of the series, is drastically changed. although shes still enjoyable in the anime, her backstory is heavily toned down.

Review will be edited... eventually!*I can clearly remember, when someone older than me, and actual native english speaker - not like me - once described this movie, as a \'Silent Hill for children\'. Linkara, was that you? Anyway, I can fully agree with him, because despite being about pokemon, this movie is dark. And sweet... like a salty liquorice!What I especially love about this movie, is that the setting for the story itself is actually in this time made... well, smaller, and thus more personal, than the first two movies. The first two movies - while still quite good...- where all about saving the world, with rather bizzare messages and morals like, ""the war is wrong, even though our entire franchise kinda sorta supports it"", and ""the power of one may sometimes be all that\'s needed... even if that one is kinda sorta pokegod"" and so on, but this movie took it to the whole new direction.What if the stakes, and motives, where actually personal, rather than universal?Like say, a little girl is in mourning over her lost family, literaly whishing herself a new one, and thus endangering all around her, consuming anything and everything that stands between her and her illusions?Now that\'s... rather good idea, I\'d say!It\'s all and good, if the heroe saves he world, or something, that is important to everybody, but what if he has to save something, that only he actually cares, and only he can loose - his mother! This plotpoint alone would have made this movie an awesome on it\'s own, but this is not actually the main focus, no! It\'s about a little girl, and her passion to life forever in this magical personal dreamland, where everyhting is beautiful and peaceful, everything she wishes or desires will happen and become true, and no one can never just come, then go, and leave you forever.While the first pokemon movie was all about accepting one\'s birth as it is, and the second was... well, saving the world, this movie is about acepting the emotional pain of isolation and loneliness, loss of the loved ones, and how to let go of something that you love and treasure the most... which is for Molly, her family. That\'s a real pickle, even for some of us adults to handle, but for a little girl...damn!The music, and the art in this movie, are both just breathtakingly beautiful, and precise. The music fits perfectly for every scene, and in every picture, packing every frame with absolute emotion, that I can only adore. When you want to cry, you cry. When you want to feel the adrenaline, you will feel it! ""If that is what you wish"" is still one of my favourite pieces of musical soundtracks, even on this very day! The action - a.k.a the actual battles - are also finaly done right, right from the opening credits! The battles themselves aren\'t overly done, or even on the majority of the runningtime, but substaine both entertainment, and focus to the plot, without feeling forced. The main characters are the very same nuckleheads that we pokemaniacs know and love - gotta love that ol\' Brock - and even the ever so obnoxious Team Rocket gets a fairly decent amount screentime and some laughs in, and even some of their most heroic moments are captured in. Nice!The story itself... well, it\'s good and all, but it can be mayde little bit too cheesy or horned in sometimes - remember, we have to sell this movie outside of Japan, so we can\'t be too subtle, now can we - and the lessons a bit corny as well for my taste, but hey... it\'s a 90\'s anime series for ya, so what did you expect, really? Also, if you didn\'t like the desings of the little critters, after the first genertion, then you may not like all these new little monsters you see here either - Aipom is actually kinda creepy!As a child, I didn\'t really love this movie, because of the story - I just liked the Entei, music, and the awesome battles... just like any stupid child would. Also, I never really liked that Casey-dude, so I was more than thrilled, that they left him to rot somewhere, after the second movie! Now, as an adult, I can see the themes, the personal stakes, threat of the situatuon, and the contradictions of the morals of grief, loss and sadness, and now, I love this movie even more! This is everyhting, that pokemon is to me, when done right, and I would recommend this to anyone, who at least knows, what the pokemon is!If you still like pokemon, you are not too old to enjoy this movie, and you should... if for nothing else, but for nostalgia.Story: 10Art: 9Sound: 9Characters: 8Enjoyment: 9Overall: 9 - where all about saving the world, with rather bizzare messages and morals like, ""the war is wrong, even though our entire franchise kinda sorta supports it"", and ""the power of one may sometimes be all that\'s needed... even if that one is kinda sorta pokegod"" and so on, but this movie took it to the whole new direction.What if the stakes, and motives, where actually personal, rather than universal?Like say, a little girl is in mourning over her lost family, literaly whishing herself a new one, and thus endangering all around her, consuming anything and everything that stands between her and her illusions?Now that\'s... rather good idea, I\'d say!It\'s all and good, if the heroe saves he world, or something, that is important to everybody, but what if he has to save something, that only he actually cares, and only he can loose - his mother!

I'm talking about the English dub here, I can't promise the subs capture that The Room essence of so bad it's good, and who knows, maybe in the original Japanese they are actually good lines (Who am I kidding?).It also has a plot that just gets more messed up the more you think about it. It's like the Evangelion of pokemon movies. I see a lot of people calling it heartwarming,...and yeah, it kinda is but if you actually stop and think about it, it's really not at all.Anyway. You should watch it, I'm not even entirely joking when I say this is a great movie. It's terrible of course, it's a pokemon movie, but it's also kinda good.

(It's actually the lenght of a normal TV episode, about 20mins, so no wonder it felt so long!) While that one was okay, it was a bit childish, not to mention felt a bit drawn out.The actual movie itself was better than the second Pokémon movie. The plot was calmer and more detailed, the art was beautiful, and I liked it quite a lot.Sometimes the events did get a bit repetitive, and when the plot had a few crucial turns near the end, I wasn't sure...how exactly certain things happened: a Pokémon called Unown is able to create a world from a little girl's imagination, and whatever she wants to happen, they make happen. From that imagination is also spurred Entei, a legendary Pokémon, who represents to the little girl her missing father. And when the little girl decides she wants everything to go back to normal, the Entei suddenly acts as if it is completely separate from the Unown...Either way, the story was quite good. It just sucks that certain things that could have been explained in the movie were shown only in the ending titles.Also, there were once again characters in this film that didn't really contribute to the plot itself, but hung around for the action. how exactly certain things happened: a Pokémon called Unown is able to create a world from a little girl's imagination, and whatever she wants to happen, they make happen.

I think this was mainly because I didn't fully understand the storyline.Now, I think that this movie is amazing! The story is amazing and it was very mysterious. I was literally glued to the screen watching this.I have been watching the entire Pokemon Anime in order and this movie slits into season 3 of the anime which is where I am up to, it is a perfect accompaniment ot the anime.I would highly recommend this movie, the music is also...very good. I loved the rendition of the season 3 theme tune! very good. I loved the rendition of the season 3 theme tune!"", ""It's time to look at the Pokemon franchise yet again. From back before they traded a good portion of their Pokemon for Galar's mostly shit ones. Yes, I'm still a bit salty about the Dexit fiasco. In any case, I've talked about the first two Pokemon films already. And it's time to look at the third.Story:We open with a young girl named Mii. Her father is a researcher studying Unown. He's at the ruins when he vanishes. Mii receives a box with Unown tiles which she uses to accidentally summon the Unown to her home. They quickly go to work granting her wishes which results...in them sealing her off, crystallising the area around her and giving her an illusory Entei. Satoshi, his companions, his mum and Professor Ookido all arrive on the scene. Illusory Entei captures Satoshi's mum to take on the role of Mii's mother. While Entei plays the role of Mii's Papa... At least Entei can't have eggs so Satoshi doesn't have to worry about any half siblings. Putting that detail aside, Satoshi and his friends have to break into the crystalline area to save his mum.There are a couple huge problems with this film. The first is that it makes this huge deal about being Entei-focused, but we don't even get a real Entei. We get the illusion of Entei created by Unown. Which eventually turns against the Unown even though they created it and are, theoretically, sustaining it. Why don't they just blink it out of existence the moment it goes against them?Another big issue is that the antagonists are Unown. Yes, it's expected that the Pokemon anime doesn't follow the game mechanics. But it still doesn't work when you have a Pokemon that everyone recognises as incredibly weak in the role of the big bad. It would be like having a Caterpie, Weedle or Magikarp in that role. Unown literally learns one relatively weak move and that's it.It doesn't help that the plot is basically stolen from Star Trek Next Generation's The Bonding. Wherein an alien life form decides to take the role of the mother of a child who lost his mum during an away mission. Except that episode had much stronger execution and the main characters appealed to the aliens offering the illusion rather than to the child taking comfort in the illusion.Aside from that, the plot is... tolerable. It's very sanitised, basic and not all that interesting. It's all about going out and making connections because sitting in an enclosed room with illusory Entei just isn't the same as having real friends.Characters:The usual cast is in play. Satoshi, Takeshi, Kasumi and Team Rocket all make their appearances and have their usual, bland personalities. Mii is just a lonely kid. The Unown have no apparent motive behind their actions. They take her father because.... they needed him to get a pokemon to baton pass them some nasty plots and agilities to make them viable. They show up at her house because.... Code of Hero is the best Transformers episode.Art:The artwork is pretty well done. The Pokemon look good. The under-stated CG effects used with the Unown give them an otherworldly feel without making them look out of place. The action sequences look pretty nice. About the worst you can say is that the crystalline backgrounds are a bit boring.Sound:You can't really fault the acting in the Pokemon franchise. Iizuka Mayumi, Matsumoto Rica, Ueda Yjui, Hayashibara Megumi, Miki Shinichiro, they're all very talented professionals. Even if this won't be listed as one of their best performances, it's certainly one where they're all performing well. The music is pretty nicely done too.Ho-yay:There isn't any. The closest thing we get to romance is Satoshi's mum playing house with Illusory Entei.Areas of Improvement:If you're going to make a group of Unown the antagonists, give them some personality and motivation.If you're going to focus your advertising on Entei, make it a real one instead of Illusory.If you're going to lift your plot from Next Generation, at least do it right. Put in some stuff about dealing with loss and have Mii have to move on like Jeremy had to.Final Thoughts:I'll be honest, this is the worst Pokemon film so far. The first one was okay. The second was mediocre but basically passable. This one is a bit shit. Not horrendously so, but a bit.

I liked the fact that in this case the characters has a relationship with our protagonist although was really shame that didnt delve more than an mere mention here and there, the duration wasnt really an problem but i think was wasted in a way focusing in the cclasics pacing that we are used to in this movies it could be nice delving more in the unown, the story of snowdown mii and her mother (that only appears in the last couple minutes without any kind of explanation), or a little glimpse in the relation between ash and mii rather than the two only photos we can see, getting a view a little bigger of Greenfield and their surroundings.I think that many of the movies of pokemon even thourgh are pretty simple and have a clear message i find it frequently (sadly) that somethimes presents ideas interestings but just touch it really superficially and make me furious i mean not because most of your audience are children has to have such formulatic and served in silver plate per say the story and characters, even then i can percive those little touches from time to time adding a litlte more of  spice and interest although never are really carried until the end and end up like just mere wasted potentials,  movies like  the one of celebi (time travels) ,deoxys (the pokemon itselft as well as the city where happen everything has so much interest to delv into) or lucario (with the war between kingdom that was bassicly wasted ) and many others more.One thing that i find beautiful in this movie are the backgrounds and i mean are mesmerizing, like many anime of begginings of 2000 the animation in general looked so much better (at least in my opinion) this just make me fall in love with eveything about it, was clean ,crisp and with so vivids colors.RESUMEAs i mentioned above this movie is of the few that were pretty nice in the overall scheme of what is pokemon, it has his problems (like every single pokemon movie) but still i think i could appreciate many things of it. If you like pokemon or at least have some interest to watch something related i could reccomend it , just dont expect anything crazy about the story or characters, i like to delv in the little details that are portrayed in the movies(not only of pokemon but others anime too) and pay attention to the settings and little ideas that are propose (but never are really exploited hehe).I give it an 8 based in the other movies that i could see of pokemon this one at least deserve an try to watch once and see if you like it. not put it at the lv of others series that doesnt have anyhting to do not only for the genere but the general goal of it.The plot of the movie its pretty simple and sure it might not be the most epic in comparasion with mewtwo or lugia but i think it was one of the good litters of installments that had before it started to actually burn out the same formula over and over again, even more when this one had an approaching kinda refreshing in how they wanted to take the story rather more simple without too many flashing lights and fancy things (if you know what im mean).

I used to watch the DVD over and over again when I was younger.So, I decided to rewatch it and... it wasn't as good as I remember.Don't get me wrong, it was still a solid movie and made me remember that excitement from a kid. It's corny and some of the voice acting is kind of iffy, mainly with Spencer Hale. However, most of the VAs did a great job, so they should get full credit.Most of all, I really enjoyed the background music, especially the opening Johto song.

Not as good as the epic story of Movie 2000, or the deep one of the first, but still a strong one, and the conflict was pretty dark, thanks to it being much more personal, and the lack of a clear villain, the conflict instead centered around an innocent young girl who lost her parents, if anything made it more interesting.The comic relief was very good once again, with some nice jokes, and there was quite a few very cute/sweet family moments. But once again, above all...was the action, animation, and direction. The animation was super lovely, pretty much every scene had beautiful animation, and the direction was top-notch. All the fight scenes were great, and the climactic scenes were absolutely jaw-dropping.As a whole, another great Pokemon movie, one i'd recommend to any fan. was the action, animation, and direction.

I never watched it as a kid; Clips I found on Youtube, while I was still under 12 (I\'m now 18), didn\'t interest me; Etc.So, take it as you will when I say that this is EASILY the best movie that Pokémon has to offer.The art and animation are both great (nothing groundbreaking or anything but still remarkable in their own right); The sound design does its job well enough; The soundtrack is surprisingly captivating, and the way it\'s used during scenes really helps elevate the emotions within them;BUTThe place where the...movie truly shines... Is in its writing. Not only does it bring us a pretty interesting look at how someone uses fantasy as a means of escapism, as it also brings us two great characters along with it. Said characters being the intimidating Legendary Dog, Entei (I mean, it kind of is him, I guess), and the poor lonely thing in a dire need of a hug, Molly (Mii, if you\'re japanese).To summarize, the 5 year old Molly Hale loses her dad when he goes on a work trip to study the mythical Pokemon ""Unown"" (leaving her alone, with neither a mom or a dad to care for her. Well, she still has buttlers in her mansion, but you know what I mean). When she finally receives the news of her dads disappearence, along with it come some strange items product of his research that can be used to summon the aforementioned ""Unown"", which Molly ends up doing, accidentaly bringing forth a rather bizarre ocurrence. Now, her house, along with its surrounding areas, has been turned into crystal, and whatever she wishes for, inside this ""fantasy land"", ends up coming true, as long as it doesn\'t exceed Unown\'s capabilities. She then proceeds to recall how she once compared her dad to the Legendary Dog Pokémon, Entei, leading a fake version of one to appear right in front of her and become her ""papa"", as she calls him.This all goes unbeknownst to Ash and his friends who were already on their way to that area, and are absolutely dumbfounded at what they see.Also, for reasons unecessary to be stated in this review, Ash\'s mom ends up there as well, and when Molly begins longing to complete her family and get herself a ""mama"", Entei kidnaps her, so she can play the part.Thanks to all this we now have ourselves:A. A pretty interesting villain with an arquetype we\'re not used to seeing.B. A nice dealve into the concepts of ""escapism"" and how one deals with grief.C. A senseful reason for Ash to jump into action. (FINALLY!)What about the movies shortcomings?- You might be asking- Does it have any?Well... Sadly, yes. Its pacing and structure. The movie is at its best when it\'s focusing on Entei and Molly and everytime the movie switches between them and the main cast, everything starts to drag. This problem stops around the 40 minute mark when the confrontations truly begin, but before we get there, there\'s already been a lot of ""meh-iness"" coming from Ash and his team that we\'ve had to deal with.There are also some ""twists""—and I use that term lightly—that almost ruin the struggles resolution a bit. But it\'s nothing too bad and it isn\'t as if they weren\'t hinted at during the movie.That\'s why, my final rating for this movie... Is a 7 out of 10. The pacing almost brings it down to a six but, thankfully, everything else is just too good.If you\'re a Pokémon fan, this is a must watch.If you\'re a fan of Satoshi Kon\'s works and miss seeing similar concepts being portrayed, this has my recomendation.Even if you don\'t fit into any of those categories, I\'d still recommend you to go and give it a watch.

All the backgrounds/pokemon appearing are the results of her...manifesting her thoughts and dreams, giving them solid form, which created interesting settings and lighting effects throughout the movie. Furthermore, the movie did a great job at handling the movement of physical elements and fluids, such as the fire or water, with great timing and exaggeration making a visually stunning impact.Even though some elements were left shrouded in darkness, such as the origin of the Unown or the true nature of Entei (maybe it was her real father all along?), this third movie showed great creativity and took full advantage of elements of the Pokemon universe to develop a simple yet interesting storyline.

This film is part of a Pokemon film rewatch series I am doing with some friends.We decided to thrown this film into our movie night because ""hey lets get that really awful 3rd film in now so we say we watched it"". This film is...hard to call a film. Its visual quality is on-par with a tv episode, the soundtrack/score for the film is quite simply awful, and the plot is extremely boring. The Unknown Pokemon are inherently interesting but they are used in such a way that trivializes their uniqueness.Overall this is...a hard pass in my opinion. The Pokemon films worth watching, to this day, in my opinion, are the first film, maybe the second, all of the ""Advanced"" generation films (the ones with May essentially) MINUS Jirachi the Wish Maker, and The Power of Us. Literally everything else is either very borderline average or just flat out awful. Pokemon The Movie 3 belongs with the latter.Enjoyment: 1.5/10Overall: 1.5/10 a hard pass in my opinion.

Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata: Ai to Seishun no Service-kai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29317/Saenai_Heroine_no_Sodatekata__Ai_to_Seishun_no_Service-kai,"[""Whatever about the actual series, this is entirely skippable unless you're big into fanservice. With the 4th wall broken immediately (concurrent with a bathing scene) it comes off as smug and self-aware in the worst way. It pretends to parody excessive fanservice and harem tropes as an excuse to regurgitate same for 20 minutes. I highly recommend you don't bother. "", ""Before deciding whether or not you want to watch Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, you need to realize that this episode is a parody. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. I mean the title of the episode is Fan Service of Youth and Love, there's no point in complaining about the excessive amount of fan service. You shouldn't believe that the series is going to be like this, the writers were very well aware of their actions. They wanted to make a parody and that's what they did. Do not factor in the fan service in your consideration of whether or not you want to...watch the show. On the other hand, the plot, the sound, the art, and the characters are fair game.Basically, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is a story about an otaku named Aki, Tomoya who managed to convince 4 girls to join his doujin circle and create a dating sim. It's not completely unique, but it has promise. If the ecchi tag does carry on to the series, then it will lose a lot of it's potential, but for now, I'll presume it's not going to be that excessive. The fan service of this episode wasn't utter trash though. Seeing as how that's what they were going for, the fan service was certainly pleasing to the eyes.As a whole, it might not be as light-hearted as this prologue depicts it to be, which would definitely make it more interesting. I'm not saying it's light-hearted atmosphere is bad though. The comedy was indeed pleasant. I'm a sucker for parodies, so I found the characters' comments about the anime industry to be hilarious.In short, the plot isn't crazy unique and interesting, but it's enough to hold my attention. As for the episode, I had a good time. I know they wanted as much fan service as possible, so I took it for what it was and enjoyed it rather than bashing on the abundance of it. Also it's self aware comedy was humorous and the romantic hints served as a nice way to show how big romance is going to be in the show.The art has its moments where there's a drop in quality, but besides that, the art is stunning. The character designs are neat, the backgrounds are beautiful, and minor things such as laptops are detailed.The opening and ending are good. I like the voices too. The only problem with the sound that I see people having, is the voice of the protagonist. It's minuscule, but I know many people are tired of hearing Kirito's voice. His voice is basically the same for most of his roles, so I could see people being rather annoyed. I doubt his voice would have a big effect on how you feel about the show though. I just felt the need to point it out.The characters are a hit or miss. Personally, I didn't mind them, but you might. We have your typical harem protagonist, the cool beauty, the tsundere childhood friend, the tomboy, and the shy girl. As you can see, they're pretty standard. I think you'll either like them or feel indifferent. Yeah, they don't really offer anything new, but as of right now, I don't think any of them are annoying enough to make you not want to watch the rest of the series. Who knows? One of them just might become one of your favorite characters.All in all, this was a good prologue. We know now the plot has its merits, both, the art and sound are good, and the characters don't entirely rub you in the wrong way. There was a ton of fan service, but the real series might just have little to no fan service and it was delightful considering that the episode is again, a parody. As for the self aware and parody aspect of the show, it's something I hope to see more of.I'd just like to say one last time that please don't let the events of this episode take total control of your decision to watch to this show. I doubt the actual thing will be as ecchi as this. Just please think about the story, the art, the sound, & the characters, and disregard the fan service. watch the show.

A lot of it has to do with whether:A) You have read the manga and are familiar with most of the characters and their personalities. In which case, you probably made more sense of this episode than those who didn't. You probably thought it was a decent watch.B) You haven't read the manga/light novel and don't really understand the context of this episode (I don't blame you). All you can see are fan-service filled scenes with no real plot or story introduced. Probably just another cookie cutter harem. That's totally fine...because for what its worth, that's really what this whole episode was about. What you shouldn't do though, is think that the rest of this series will follow this trend. Here's why you should consider watching at least a couple more episodes:Assuming that the anime follows the plot of the manga/light novel, I can safely assure you guys that this will probably be the last time that fanservice of this magnitude is shown. There's definitely a lot more to this series than tits. Whether you take that as a good or bad thing is up to you. In other words, DO NOT LET THIS EPISODE REFLECT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WATCH THE REST OF THE SERIES.At this point, it really is impossible to give the series a fair score for story, it's only been one episode. It's obviously lacking in that department and probably not reflective of the main plot like I mentioned earlier. That aside, everything else seems to be decent. The art, while seemingly higher in quality when compared to other generic harems, hides its flaws better than most. Lots of consistency issues as well as a messload of still-frames (although they were nicely done) make it hard to fully enjoy the character art, which wasn't bad at all.Sound was decent for the most part as well. VA performance was good overall bar Eriri's seiyuu, who didn't have a particularly strong showing this time around. Furthermore, there's the fucking king of harems Matsuoka voicing the MC, what more do you need? Not to mention the OP and ED are super fucking catchy.Character-wise, there's not much to be said. They're nothing special. The only character that may have slightly deviated from your typical harem character archetypes was Katou. She literally gives 0 fucks about everything. The manga depicts these characters slightly differently compared to what we've seen thus far in the anime, so hopefully A1 can redeem themselves in the upcoming episodes.I'm giving this review a 6 as an objective score for THIS EPISODE ONLY. This does NOT reflect how I feel towards the series as a whole. This is mostly because we don't know how the actual series will play out but also from what I have read in the manga, Saekano has a lot more to offer that hasn't been shown yet. If you're a fan of romcoms, I highly recommend staying tuned for at least the next 3 episodes. because for what its worth, that's really what this whole episode was about.

Nevertheless, anime as a whole suffers the worst of the brunt because -barring the occasional film release – the output from that field is updated only once every three months and thus if something sucks in January, chances are it’s going to suck the next month and even worse the month after that. And that still remains true in regards to Winter Anime 2014, which admittedly is in the pre-Death Parade stage so I’m not ready to write it off just yet, because Christ, it’s like most of the premieres...that have been coming out aren’t even trying to create an interesting hook. Hell, I doubt they even know what the definition is.But with all that said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a worse and more agonizingly painful hook to a show than Saenai Heroine, A-1 Picture’s newest contribution to the noitamina timeslot which goes out of its way to provide further proof that not only are they an incompetent studio run by lobotomized monkeys, but that Japan as a whole has been looking at the section of pop culture that Joss Whedon has popularized and going “gotta get me some of that”. Or to put it in more simpler terms, “the first episode wasn’t very good”.It should be noted before I begin talking about this thing that if you look up Saenai Heroine on Crunchyroll at the time of this writing, you’ll notice that the number of the episode currently out is “0”, which makes the name for the episode’s MAL thread kinda hilarious. That’s because this episode is a prologue – or to be more accurate, a flash-forward of what’s to come because it occurs after all the characters are introduced. Oh, did I say characters? I meant “agonizingly boring cardboard cutouts whose sole existence is to spout ‘witty insights about the anime industry and pop culture that quite frankly make me want to dial Whedon’s number just so he can save me”. It’s like watching Eroge! H mo Game mo Kaihatsu Zanmai except without the pleasure of watching a girl wearing a gimp suit whilst (censored because you don’t want to know).Not helping at all is the fact that airs on the same day as PA Works’ own show regarding the same subject matter. I can only fear the “probably fatal” tonal backlash caused by watching this atrocity within the same timespan, because whilst I have problems with telling me basic facts about the animation industry like you’re an even unfunnier version of the first season of Parks and Rec, there should be a law against dishing out criticisms that I’m already aware of whilst you’re indulging in the very thing you’re criticizing. Not only does every single joke consist of doing a bad fanservice cliche and pointing out you’re doing said cliche, but the entire plot revolves around that joke to the point that it’s impossible to ignore.The main male character is a loser male nerd that exists solely to do the things male anime nerds whilst saying “look at him doing nerd things”. The female characters are the same in regards to harem stereotypes complete with a voyeuristic unseen cameraman perving on their naked bodies in the hot spring whilst they talk about how awful harem shows are. Funny how these bad anime cliches made it into this bad anime, and yet for all your self-aware nature, you don’t seem to be aware of what’s happening in your own show, isn’t it, Saenai Heroine. Let me guess, Sunset Overdrive was the writer’s favorite game of the year?And before people point out that it’s supposed to be a parody of bad fanservice-y light novel adaptations and such, let me point you to the existence of Epic Movie as a prime example that just because you’re taking the piss out of something doesn’t mean you can’t do it poorly. From what I’ve been told, parodies are supposed to be clever. They’re supposed to highlight it subject matter in a way you didn’t realize before. And for good measure, parodies are supposed to be funny.Being purposefully bad in order to tribute/criticize a genre, as well as to personally get me to laugh, only works if you’re self-referential whilst toeing the line in regards to being completely serious, and Saenai Heroine won’t even give me a chance to believe that theory. Not only does it refuse to take itself seriously, it blatantly stated that fact out before the first minute was up and shockingly continue to increase said blatancy as it was going on, which is kind of impressive in a way. Combine that with the fact that the animation is lifelessly flat to the point that it’s boring to look at, and you’d have better luck trying to convince me that Fractale was post-modern. It wasn’t, because what it was taking seriously was unimaginative as hell, but it’s a start.I didn’t finish Saenai Heroine: Episode 0 because in addition to being insulting, aggressively dull, and consistent in finding a way to increase those traits with every single frame, the anime decided to pull that old “rape is funny as long as it’s female on male” trope and have the main dude narrate the entire premise despite the fact that the visuals and actual events had very little to do with the monologue at the same time a little into the second half after a game of ping pong that was so lifeless it made me want to watch, well, Ping Pong again. I’m sorry, but if you’re not even going to present your terrible show properly then what exactly am I watching you for? Oh, you’re going to insult me for it now, Saenai Heroine? I’m ashamed enough to even be watching you in the first place!I did skip ahead to the ending to see how the prologue would end, and it was basically the final straw in declaring this piece of trash one of the most worthless anime I’ve seen in my life. Without giving anything way, let’s just say that of all the things it plays straight with an honest face, it has to be that bullshit “we’re all friends in the end” ending. So basically, the show couldn’t even fully commit to its shameless ways. What good is it then? that have been coming out aren’t even trying to create an interesting hook. Hell, I doubt they even know what the definition is.But with all that said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a worse and more agonizingly painful hook to a show than Saenai Heroine, A-1 Picture’s newest contribution to the noitamina timeslot which goes out of its way to provide further proof that not only are they an incompetent studio run by lobotomized monkeys, but that Japan as a whole has been looking at the section of pop culture that Joss Whedon has popularized and going “gotta get me some of that”.

I think this OVA does an okay job portraying the feelings that the characters have for each other.

The male lead and center of the harem is frustrated as he pushes his face against the wall, angered that his is missing out... on the anime discussion. Funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed this segment. I appreciate how the show pokes fun at harems and the character introduction was silly as well.The MC is voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, whom you may know as Sora from...NGNL, Kantoku from Denki Gai or Kirito from SAO. I love this voice actor, and he definitely suits the otaku MC. I don\'t know much about the other voice actresses, but I have yet to watch a non-enjoyable anime featuring Matsuoka-san, so this was another green light for this series.SPOILERS AHEADDespite the silly initial plot and character introductions, the biggest turn off for me was the rape scene. I don\'t care what any of you say about it because, like it or not, that was rape. The MC repeatedly says ""no"" and ""stop"" as one of the girls touches him and begins to sexually assault him. This triggered me and I immediately had an anxiety attack. They brush it off in the next scene as the ""main heroine"" is said to have ""rescued"" him, trivializing the issue. He is not traumatized and it is swept under the rug as just a comedic result of the girls\' desire for him as the center of the harem. There is no retaliation, punishment or confrontation with the rapist. This is not something that should have been included in the show, let alone dismissed as comedy. Many people have not been educated on the issue that no means no, and, unfortunately, I am fearful that the dismissal of the incident in the show could actually influence people (to some extent) to think that going along after someone says no is somehow more okay. YES, I KNOW NOT EVERYTHING IN ANIME/MEDIA IS REALISTIC OR SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, BUT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT. Rape is a very serious issue, and it made me highly uncomfortable that it is taken so lightly in this show.Needless to say, I will not continue to watch this series due to the disturbing content that was put in as harmless fun when it is actually reducing a more serious issue to a gimmick.

A typical harem anime where all the female casts are attracted to the male protagonist.Definitely recommended for the Harem...Lovers, as well as those who wants to get an idea how the Doujin circle works.

Sousei no Aquarion,https://myanimelist.net/anime/478/Sousei_no_Aquarion,"[""Aquarion is an homage to older mecha series, and that is easily seen when you watch it. Personally, I haven't watched a lot of older mecha series, so I can't exactly spout out examples of it copying them. But I've talked with people who are experienced with them, and the one mecha from the 90s which I've watched (NGE) is enough to prove my example of how similar it is.The setting is - not surprisingly - a futuristic world, where a form of higher beings - in this case Shadow Angels - show themselves for the first time in thousands of years. There is only...one organization - in this case DEAVA - who can fight against them, due to their possession of mecha robots - in this case the Vectors/Aquarions.The male protagonist (Apollo) is a reincarnation of a fallen Shadow Angel, Apollonius, who betrayed the other Shadow Angels a long time ago. Also known as the Wings of the Sun, he is very important to the Shadow Angels, so they go after him. The female (Silvia) protagonist is the reincarnation of Apollonius' lover. That's it for the setting. Maybe you've now decided on whether to watch it or not?Anyway, the story isn't that really great. It's episodic, and stays that way until the last couple of episodes. Those episodes are actually so independent of each other that, aside the first episode, you could probably watch them in any order. The development in Silvia and Apollo's relationship is all but prominent, and whil I could nearly imagine them kissing after one episode, that didn't seem so likely after the next. Still, that development is pretty much the only thing that ties the episodes together. The inconsistency of other characters' development also helps to drag a bit down.The animation quality is actually one of the stronger parts of the show - not that it is a very positive statement. And that is if you count out all the CGI. The character designs and backgrounds are all decent, but there's just something dull about the coloring, and good lighting effects are rare, but good when there. Special effects are okay, but not something outstanding.And then there's the CGI... I'm not a big fan of CGI in anime series, and especially not when it's so blatantly executed as the CGI in Aquarion. It just ruined the quality and my viewing experience. If you like or don't mind lots of CGI, you'll have no trouybles with this, but if you're not a fan of CGI like me, it can ruin your enjoyment of the series. However, the series deserve a plus for the best-looking male villain ever (Toma).The soundtrack is the strongest part of the show. This time around it []is a positive statement. AKINO did an outstanding job on the OP and ED themes, and most of them are in the upper tier of my favorite OP/ED theme list. The BGM is okay too; it does the job it's supposed to do, but it stops there. VAs are good; I like the characters' voices and they're played pretty good. Sound effects are okay too, and they do their job like they should.The characters are not that good. They're mostly unoriginal (at least from my experiences). I mean, Apollo is the stupid, rash character you've seen a lot of times, Silvia is the female protagonist who doesn't like the male protagonist at first, but warms up to him. Sirius is the arrogant-kinda type (he actually reminds me of Byakuya from Bleach), Pierre is the guy who's always going after the ladies, and so on. There's low amounts of character development, which also drags a bit down. You get a little on Apollo and Silvia as we gradually explore their past lives and they warm up to each other, but that's about it. A plus is Gen, though. I love most of his lines.All in all, Aquarion is what you'd expect of an homage of older series - unoriginal. But they still executed it poorly; it had potential to be great, but it never became that. It's not an anime I'm gonna remember.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) one organization - in this case DEAVA - who can fight against them, due to their possession of mecha robots - in this case the Vectors/Aquarions.The male protagonist (Apollo) is a reincarnation of a fallen Shadow Angel, Apollonius, who betrayed the other Shadow Angels a long time ago.

Art is knowing which ones to keep. »—\tScott Adams.This is my very first review so understand that it may not be as rational and objective as it presumptively should, but for me anime is a form of art, and art isn’t supposed to be rational. With this statement made, let the show begin.First of all, Sousei no Aquarion was an anime that draw my attention from its presentation poster. I know it sounds stupid or a little ignorant from me judging a book for its cover, but I admit that most animes that I watch are normally chose...that way, and I rarely go wrong with the choices I make within my own anime taste.Aquarion wasn’t different. Despite of being a mecha, and I’m not quite fond of mecha animes, it managed to surprise me in a different yet good way. For fans of the genre, I truly recommend it, not only because you’ll like it, but because it’s an anime worth watching.Story: 8I found the plot, unlike other opinions I saw around here, good or I would dare and say that it was a very good one. It has a beautiful love story behind it, and it deserves some credit for being able to mix mecha with prophecies, reincarnations and angels – also known as Da Tenshi in Aquarion’s world – with some originality.  The flaw is precisely in not being capable of taking that plot and doing a different well done thing out of it. There were so many aspects that could be well explored and they weren’t, aspects which I consider that were quite interesting and a pity that producers couldn’t know how to seize them.Instead of seizing it, the potential of the anime, which was high, fell down for a more normal baseline. So, they decided to create those so famous main-stream episodes, pretending they were exploring the main characters with parallel stories that had a not-very-consistent script. These episodes run away from the original route of the story, sometimes not making sense at all.Once again I repeat myself, it’s a shame that they couldn’t take the amazing plot and came out with something different and well done.Art: 7As regards to the art of Aquarion I found it, how to put it, approachable. There some animation parts that are very decent. The battles are well animated and the “vectors” are regularly well animated too. The general effects are as good too although there were some minimal flaws, nothing to much important. The characters are well draw, so the final balance is a good one concerning the art/style. And if we count with the art that appears in the ending, that was even better.But then we have episode 19… which was a total disgrace. The episode begins, and we start to notice that something is different, like very different. The art changed radically and the animation is a disaster. The guys that run this business should be sleeping at the time when they finished this episode. I mean, it’s really, really terrible.People look like they are inflatable dolls. It’s true that the episode plot itself it’s supposed to happen in a world where things get that semi-abstract form, but the scenes which weren’t supposed to happen in that world have the same art and measuring the two arts the original was way better. It’s not a consistent matter, and I think producers should have been more aware of this serious flaws that give away some of the beauty of the series.Sound: 9As they say, every dog has his day. The sound is the ‘ex libris’ of this anime, is as good as it gets. We have some beautiful music playing during some big moments. Each one of the two openings are very good, and for me, the ending is the highlight of this show. The music is ‘Omna Magni’ from Yui Makino, and it’s simply a piece of art. It reminds me of an ancient story, lost in the course of time, and all this together with the art presented, it’s phenomenal, no doubt about it.Character: 5While the sound is extraordinary, the characters leave much to be desired. The evolution of each character is poor in content. As they come to be presented to the viewer, we get the sensation that we already have seen them before, somewhere in other anime. They bring nothing new to us, they are the type of characters that we are used to, and it’s definitely a major flaw when they have nothing new to bring. To me, the big highlight was Toma, a Da Tenshi. I really loved the main antagonist of the story, in fact, I loved both Toma and Otoha, the main ‘antagonists’. They were a sort of a breath of fresh air in the whole story, because they were different from everyone else. They had purpose, they had personality, thing that didn’t happen with the others. They weren’t immediately recognizable characters, which was a very enjoyable thing to watch.But don’t get me wrong, I didn’t dislike any of the characters. I cared about all of them, I laugh with some and I pitied others. I think that they should get each one of them with a real personality and not set a ‘chip’ with some of the most usual ‘codes’ in them. They should had evolve trough the series which didn’t happen too.Enjoyment: 7In accordance of entertainment, I was amused. There were some parts that disappointed me, but other that could conquer me by the positive side because it was a mecha anime with a real good and catchy plot.Some parts were a disillusion, parts that were already mentioned, and some parallel stories seemed to me that they were there just to fill some space and make the anime have 26 episodes, instead of being in the few twenties.However, it keep me stuck to the screen in some good episodes, which I wasn’t expecting at all. There were some amazing humor moments that made me laugh hard.Overall: 7In general, it was good. With some serious flaws, but with some important qualities that make up for the flaws.Because in the end, what counts in anime is the capacity to entertain. The capacity to make us let our emotions flow, to have a catharsis. If I cared, if I laughed, and if I cried… mission accomplished and nothing else matters.Sousei no Aquarion entertained… and for that the job is done. that way, and I rarely go wrong with the choices I make within my own anime taste.Aquarion wasn’t different.

The episode begins, and we start to notice that something is different, like very different. The art changed radically and the animation is a disaster. The guys that run this business should be sleeping at the time when they finished this episode. I mean, it’s really, really terrible.People look like they are inflatable dolls. It’s true that the episode plot itself it’s supposed to happen in a world where things get that semi-abstract form, but the scenes which weren’t supposed to happen in that world have the same art and measuring the two arts the original was way better. It’s not a consistent matter, and I think producers should have been more aware of this serious flaws that give away some of the beauty of the series.Sound: 9As they say, every dog has his day. The sound is the ‘ex libris’ of this anime, is as good as it gets. We have some beautiful music playing during some big moments. Each one of the two openings are very good, and for me, the ending is the highlight of this show. The music is ‘Omna Magni’ from Yui Makino, and it’s simply a piece of art. It reminds me of an ancient story, lost in the course of time, and all this together with the art presented, it’s phenomenal, no doubt about it.Character: 5While the sound is extraordinary, the characters leave much to be desired. The evolution of each character is poor in content. As they come to be presented to the viewer, we get the sensation that we already have seen them before, somewhere in other anime. They bring nothing new to us, they are the type of characters that we are used to, and it’s definitely a major flaw when they have nothing new to bring. To me, the big highlight was Toma, a Da Tenshi. I really loved the main antagonist of the story, in fact, I loved both Toma and Otoha, the main ‘antagonists’. They were a sort of a breath of fresh air in the whole story, because they were different from everyone else. They had purpose, they had personality, thing that didn’t happen with the others. They weren’t immediately recognizable characters, which was a very enjoyable thing to watch.But don’t get me wrong, I didn’t dislike any of the characters. I cared about all of them, I laugh with some and I pitied others. I think that they should get each one of them with a real personality and not set a ‘chip’ with some of the most usual ‘codes’ in them. They should had evolve trough the series which didn’t happen too.Enjoyment: 7In accordance of entertainment, I was amused. There were some parts that disappointed me, but other that could conquer me by the positive side because it was a mecha anime with a real good and catchy plot.Some parts were a disillusion, parts that were already mentioned, and some parallel stories seemed to me that they were there just to fill some space and make the anime have 26 episodes, instead of being in the few twenties.However, it keep me stuck to the screen in some good episodes, which I wasn’t expecting at all. There were some amazing humor moments that made me laugh hard.Overall: 7In general, it was good. With some serious flaws, but with some important qualities that make up for the flaws.Because in the end, what counts in anime is the capacity to entertain. The capacity to make us let our emotions flow, to have a catharsis. If I cared, if I laughed, and if I cried… mission accomplished and nothing else matters.Sousei no Aquarion entertained… and for that the job is done.', 'Sousei no Aquarion is a mecha anime that is similar to Evagelion and RahXephon. Just another anime about humans fighting against a form of higher being, in this case, the Shadow Angels.Story: The plot is pretty slow. It may seem the plot throws you right into action, which it does, but it does not move the plot much until the last few episodes. It follows a pretty generic line with very few twists here and there. The whole show seems pretty episodic save the finale.Art: The art is unique in its own way. The characters have unique designs to them and the mecha are pretty...unique as well. The backgrounds are nice but sometimes feel as if they were sloppily painted on. The character designs and mecha are pretty much the saving grace of the artwork.Sound: The musical score is pretty much the highlight of the show. The music produced by Yoko Kanno, known for her works in Ghost in the Shell and Macross. The musical score makes good use of orchestrated works and the insert songs found throughout several episodes are good.Characters: The characters have their own interesting personalities. You have Apollo, the homeless turned Daeva pilot who is short tempered to Silvia, who has a serious case of a brother complex. The characters have their own distinct way of doing things in the anime and it shows in their battles against the enemy.Enjoyment/Overall: I was expecting more out of this anime but it reduces its plot to a drag. The battles are decent and the music is good. Other than though, it just seems like another Evagelion ripoff. unique as well.

Sounds familiar right? We all have our share of EVA, Raxhephon, Zeorymer, TTGL, etc. experiences and yet they are still popular despite mecha fanatics'  swooning over GARness and teamwork blah blah.Art:8/10Sunrise did a pretty good job in animating this with...artistic European backdrops, beautiful setting sun effects and dazzling flashes of light on transformation scenes and others. Character art ain't too bad too but it did get a bit confusing (I think the graphic change was part of the story) on one episode with that of stick art doodles. :DSound:9/10Beautiful orchestral score in their BGM throughout the series. OP themes are a bit catchy and the ED is hauntingly good to listen at.Character:7/10As most super and real robot series, characters must be unique in every way to distinguish their different traits.

What kind of amuses me is Apollonius' character with that of a wild beast and Reika, with her negative and emo way of thinking. The siblings are also good in their character as well as the Shadow Angels especially Toma. ^_^Enjoyment:8/10Most mecha fans would come to conclusion that the series itself is just chunks or bits and pieces of other mecha series that are put together.

Unique in how it surpasses anything else I've seen at being uninspired, generic, and boring. I am truly proud that I finished this show because it was one of the more difficult things I've done involving anime.Story - 1:Extremely generic. Sousei no Aquarion is about a young male who is unknowingly the reincarnation of some great hero. He must rise up and prove his naysayers wrong by defeat the arrogant enemy while proving that humanity is not inferior.Now, being generic isn't a bad thing. There are plenty of shows that take a generic plot and refine it or expand upon it....Not Sousei no Aquarion. It will stick to this proven formula. Although this isn't the making of a great show, it would be passable if other aspects of the show were much more impressive.Art - 4Sound - 7:Commenting on art and sound are not my strong points. I am very lenient when it comes to animation and I don't unusually notice music unless it is extremely impressive or totally absent. That being said, I do feel that art and sound were the shows strong points.I never felt anything overly negative toward the art. Given what was being drawn, I don't see what else could have been done with it. Keep in mind however, while the show's art has no glaring problems in my mind, it also has nothing outstanding. Nearly every show I have watched has something that catches my eye - Sousei no Aquarion's most impressive visual is probably its generic mecha.The only place that I give this show good marks is on sound. I generally enjoyed the music throughout the show, but my rating is primarily based on loving the first intro. I don't know that I could have finished the show without it.Character - 1:With few exceptions, my opinion of a show depends on the balance of the characters and the plot. Generic characters can work if the plot has something going for it, and a basic plot can suffice if the characters are endearing. Sadly, Sousei no Aquarion's characters fared even worse than the story did.Ignoring that the majority of the cast is entirely one dimensional, the main characters are terribly unrounded and develop as quickly and drastically as an eroding rock. One is the rebel, the other is the arrogant jerk, the last is obsessive incestuous fangirl. During the course of the show, these develop into the rebel hero, the guy who still manages to be an arrogant jerk despite losing, and the obsessive incestuous fangirl who is remotely considering a legal life partner.I could go into more detail, but any detailing of Silvia could provoke me to murder.Enjoyment - 2:When things are wrapped up, the value given to Sousei no Aquarion is directly valued to how valuable you consider your time to be. If you are as bored as I was when I watched this show, the quick episodic pace will, at the very least,  keep you distracted. If you are like most people and you have limited time to devote to twenty six episode shows, steer clear.There are plenty of shows that have similar plots and characters done well - there is no good reason to watch these standards executed so poorly.

This might be quite a broad judgment to make, but here’s to hoping that you read this review before consuming 26 episodes, which, like fast-food, may seem appealing but ultimately is both unsatisfying and terrible for you. If you’ve already forced yourself through the ordeal that is Aquarion, I can only hope that you take solace in the fact that there are other people who aren’t afraid to express how truly mediocre it is.STORY: Aquarion’s story is overwrought with unnecessary narrative structure. Old shows that...followed a similar formula (Mazinger, GoGaiGar, Gundam) simply opened a world to their audiences which the combat is justified and there’s an overarching goal to the conflict. In Aquarion, things like exposition are simply not included for the sake of more episodic shenanigans. The first episode establishes group called Shadow Angels harvesting humans for some nefarious reason, but it’s okay because there’s one oversized mech called Aquarion that was used 12,000 years ago to battle the Shadow Angels and now people that have supernatural powers can get into the various ships that fuse into the Aquarion and Apollo is one of the people who, despite being a savage, of course, is destined to pilot this ship because he’s (maybe) the reincarnation of a Shadow Angel named Apollonius who rebelled 12,000 years ago due to loving a human, who is reincarnated as a tsundere with a brother complex. If this doesn’t seem like an absolutely hamfisted and convoluted plot to introduce the show with, don’t worry. They don’t ever explain why. For most of the series, the audience is disregarded as the writers perform a rhetorical masturbation, only compounding the already absurd and senseless narrative with every character having an unrequited love for another character, a powerful wizard who’s only purpose is to deliver laughably cliché motivational lines, and other equally non-sequitur plot lines. This is a show that will introduce a 12,000 year old villain, establish that, despite his age, he’s still a kid, have him do nothing but murder and toy with humanity for his own amusement, kill him off 3 episodes later, and have everyone sulk about how significant his death is. The show is a culmination of nuanced single-episode arcs that introduce a conflict and have it resolved at the end of the episode so that the character who was experiencing said crisis can pilot the multi-colored super-mech and destroy the monster of the week. There’s never a sense of urgency, as Aquarion pretty much always beats up the bad guys and the bad guys always have more humans to harvest. Logic seems to be lost on this show, and rather than being an absolute embrace of the inane in order to make it into a narrative a la Gainax, Aquarion stagnates and never delivers. Sure, it’s cool when the Aquarion does the infinite punch. Then it does it every other episode, until it becomes just another boring move. That’s right, Aquarion is a show in which a giant mech infinitely expanding his fist to punch an enemy off the planet becomes boring.ART: The animation quality here is laughably bad for a series animated in 2005. Characters just float around the scene, lips flapping. Story is told to you via men floating around upside down rather than shown visually, and it only ever comes off as pretentious. Where the series really becomes terrible, however, is the 3-D mecha. The majority of the enemy designs are so reused that you hardly ever even care about who they are fighting. Every attack seems to be ‘shoot energy at Aquarion’. Aquarion itself is a particularly laughable robot as well, as its mismatched color scheme is reminiscent of a Power Rangers fusion. The ‘unique’ fusions of the Aquarion boil down to palette-swaps and a different head, and, of course, a different weapon. However, this usually just comes down to if Aquarion’s going to shoot an arrow or if it’ll punch a guy, or maybe have a sword. The different forms really don’t evoke that much of a difference in the mech. Perhaps you could say that I’m expecting too much and that this is a mecha anime. Certainly, it is, and the story only exists to facilitate endless mecha fights. However, these fights are often in the same boring terrain and usually boil down to disgustingly rendered 3-D mechs flailing around until the intro theme plays and they shoot their ultimate attack at the enemy. The show isn’t afraid to re-use frame and it often does, although the animators can’t seem to agree on how some characters faces should even look most of the time. There’s one episode that toys with the notion of the animation in an interesting way, so you’ve got to give Aquarion that, at the very least.SOUND: Where all else fails, Aquarion does manage to have an enjoyable soundtrack. Loud overtures will ring out in mecha fights and it’s pretty enjoyable to, at the least, listen to. The usual music that plays during social scenes isn’t that noteworthy or scene-setting, and, often, there is no track to accompany the dialogue. The series has an incredibly ill-placed ending theme considering the content of the series, but the introduction is just about as much of an ear-worm as you can find anywhere else. However, it seems like Aquarion is aware of this, and, of course, plays the intro theme every time the main characters are about to win a fight. The voice acting is done well enough, and, so, overall, the sound is solid, with a few memorable tracks.CHARACTER: If you didn’t catch this from my diatribe on the narrative of the show, then I should say it now. All of the characters are terribly written. This isn’t to say they aren’t enjoyable. While every single character seems to only have one level of depth to them (Sirius is obsessed with being elegant, Pierre plays soccer and like women, Silvia has a brother complex, Apollo is a savage who has to fight the Shadow Angels because BARON, Rena is blind and just says cryptic lines, Reika is misfortunate) and a love interest that will go nowhere (trust me, this is worse than mainstay shonen), they can be fun and enjoyable from time to time. Sure, it’s poorly written, and don’t you expect any character development whatsoever, but you’ve got to enjoy Pierre fantasizing about women and kicking soccer balls or Commander Fudou shaking his fist and saying something about how the main characters have to be like three separate unbreakable arrows in order to defeat all foes. The show understands how inane the cast is, and there is even an episode where the character types are called into question and made fun of. If anything, Aquarion is aware of how one-dimensional of a cast it has, but it just doesn’t care. It’s literally that kid who fails every test he takes and laughs about the consequences, saying it doesn’t matter to him. Ultimately, the characters and their conflicts are laughable, and even Aquarion knows it.ENJOYMENT: Despite the narrative pitfalls of Aquarion and its poorly choreographed battles, there is a charm to how pathetic and absurd it is. While you’ve got to wonder why the Shadow Angels even want to prolong their 12,000 years of sitting around in nebulous space, or how they didn’t just kill all the humans with their endless, unbeatable army of mecha and microscopic food-eating demons, these questions usually take a back seat when you come to understand that Aquarion just doesn’t care. The show constantly comes up with new gimmicks for the titular mech to perform, or more absurd episodic plot lines that are dropped and forgotten just as quickly as they become relevant. If you can’t enjoy characters performing a giant-mecha flaming soccer kick, or obviously pretentious characters spouting nonsensical rhetoric, then you just won’t enjoy the show. However, there’s fun to be found in the madness, even if there isn’t any significance to it all.OVERALL: Aquarion is terrible. It knows it is terrible. It has in-show commentary on how terrible it is. As a Mecha, it falls flat on its face due to too many similar, boring fights. As a story, it bumbles along with an episodic pace, poorly written characters, and an absurd premise that doesn’t care to explain itself to the audience. As an anime, it brings nothing new to the medium. It is like a steamy fart—absolutely disgusting—but, perhaps, there’s something immature within you that’ll have you giggling at the act. It can be enjoyed, but you shouldn’t forget how much of it is absolute filth. followed a similar formula (Mazinger, GoGaiGar, Gundam) simply opened a world to their audiences which the combat is justified and there’s an overarching goal to the conflict.

I thoroughly enjoyed this season for the most part. The music was great, scenes were touching, the whole shabang. But like every show, it had it\'s cons.In this case I couldn\'t stand the fact that it took 24 episodes for Apollo + Silvia to embrace each other and show any sort of outward feelings for each other. We are talking 7/8 of the series deep into the story and now they start saying how much the other means to them...(and not even deep stuff either, this is like a 10 sec thing). The fact that they were forbidden lovers in the past and the fact that they both acknowledged the fact that they were lovers in their former lives AND they both have the memories of their former lives really irked me. They are destined to fall in love over and over again yet nothing of the sort actually transpired throughout the series.Not only did the lack of ""romance"" when everything has been laid out on the table for them BUT this chick has the nerve to reject her brothers invite to join him in his quest for a better world saying how she wants to protect those dearest to her... don\'t get me wrong, I thought this moment was the moment when the panties were coming off and apollo + silvia were gonna get all lovey dovey... no... of course things dont work out that way for me... ever... literally 3 min later this chick is depressed in a corner smelling her brothers picture frame saying oniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... do you know how annoying that was? for 26 episodes 90% of what came out of her mouth was ""onisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" over and over... and over again...oh well enough ranting.Story: I felt like it was a great story. Forbidden lovers in the past reunited 12000 years later destined to love each other again. A gay dude that wants his gay partner back... mechas... good shit right? well no... please if you didnt read the rant above go read it. Pretty much sums up why story isn\'t a 10/10.Art: This was like 2004-2005 when this show was out so it\'s not as good as EVOL (it\'s successor) but I still enjoyed the artwork. It was nice. Kinda reminded me of Macross Frontier. Also the episode where they get trapped in some fantasy world or whatever scared me shitless. Since that episode had a new OP I thought the artwork had changed and I was like ""fuck this show... this artwork blows"", but I was wrong thank goodness.Sound: Pretty good.Dunno bout the OP ED but the melodies they play for the ""important"" important scenes were powerful. Really brought out the flavor of the moment.Characters: I liked Apollo. He had a good personality. Strong Brave Doesn\'t give a fuck... etc etc. I couldn\'t stand Tsugumi (especially during her 20 min cry session... yes she literally spends 20 of the 23 min of the episode crying like a bitch when everyone is going to perish because she feels like a little bitch) and uhhh the brother. Clearly he is no Taiyou No Tsubasa, not even a hint of it but he has to be big shot sexy rich boy and pretend like hes hot shit.Enjoyment: good show. I personally prefer the sequel since Zessica Wong is da shiet but they\'re bother strong pieces.Hope you enjoyed my review. It\'s a bit late so my review is a little juvenile if you couldn\'t tell but it\'s all my personal beliefs. I just hope my colorful language doesn\'t offend any 10 year old readers who have journeyed onto MAL looking for hentai reviews.:3 good day (and not even deep stuff either, this is like a 10 sec thing). The fact that they were forbidden lovers in the past and the fact that they both acknowledged the fact that they were lovers in their former lives AND they both have the memories of their former lives really irked me. They are destined to fall in love over and over again yet nothing of the sort actually transpired throughout the series.Not only did the lack of ""romance"" when everything has been laid out on the table for them BUT this chick has the nerve to reject her brothers invite to join him in his quest for a better world saying how she wants to protect those dearest to her... don\'t get me wrong, I thought this moment was the moment when the panties were coming off and apollo + silvia were gonna get all lovey dovey... no... of course things dont work out that way for me... ever... literally 3 min later this chick is depressed in a corner smelling her brothers picture frame saying oniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... do you know how annoying that was? for 26 episodes 90% of what came out of her mouth was ""onisamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" over and over... and over again...oh well enough ranting.Story: I felt like it was a great story. Forbidden lovers in the past reunited 12000 years later destined to love each other again.

I found it to be hilarious...even when not intentioned.  (I wouldve given this show a 3 but the humor gave it a bump up.)  This really should be filed under comedy only.  Its such a bad mash up of cliched scenarios and stereotypical characters under the mecha genre umbrella, how can you not laugh?  In addition, the intentioned humor was amusing to almost compensate for its shortcomings...almost....But all in all, it was a waste of time...if u need a good laugh there are a few episodes that had me rofling ( eps 3 and 18)Story:Unoriginal and flat premise of a post apocalyptic world destroyed by Shadow Angles ( humanity\'s biggest enemies)  So the logical solution calls for mecha fighting machines and teenage pilots to save the world right?  Of course!  The strangest thing about this show is....well when the 3 mechs merge into one mega mech...the pilots experience euphoria/ orgasm-ish experiences together... seriously...im not making this up lol....its a lame attempt to be taboo...and i think its meant to be comical....it could be funny but is very disturbing.....Anyway,  the series starts out with pilot training and then full circle to real combat...so predictable.  But the real problems arise when there are no explanations regarding the enemies....in fact the whole show is about defeating these aliens when in fact they tell us nothing about them.  There is no alien leader, or real motives for attacks....They also attempt at a lame love story but its not even worth going into that... and everything falls apart more so with the ""reincarnation"" story line involving the characters and some prophecy which makes the ending horrible.  The ending is so bad, it makes the rest of the series look genius.Art:Pretty decent, with an array of bright colors and typical cgi-ish mechs for action scenesSound:I cant remember anything remarkable but it was pleasantCharacter:So you have your typical characters with no development at allApollo:the main character who is an unsophisticated tarzan with so much talent he doesnt even realize it yet....and all he needs to do is follow directions to focus...yawn...they tried having a back story for him but the writers failed in so many waysSilvia de Alisia:The typical miss goody two shoes and know-it-all....the foil of Apollo however, ironically she is subconsciously drawn to him...hence lame love story of opposites attract...blah blahSirius de Alisia:Silivia\'s older brother who is the model student and fighter...mr sophisticated with all the right answers yet he lacks the passion Apollo has, which causes frustration....and side note, his relationship with his sister was somewhat creepy...apparently the awful ending was supposed to make sense of this but failed....Pierre Vieira:They should\'ve called him the Latin Lover.  He is the typical soccer loving, sexually frustrated foreigner who brought tons of humor to the show!Enjoyment:Surprisingly i kept on watching this train wreck mainly b/c it was funny.  The lame story lines did make me roll my eyes at times but  i did not take this show seriously to begin with.  Just let the sillyness wash over you...the ending however was so awful, the laugh factor was not compensating anymore.....Overall:Im not sure if anyone took this show seriously....im not sure the creators even did...in conclusion, if its on tv and u have nothing else going on and want to be mildly amused and chuckle, watch it...if not, dont waste ur time!  I hope this was helpful :) But all in all, it was a waste of time...if u need a good laugh there are a few episodes that had me rofling ( eps 3 and 18)Story:Unoriginal and flat premise of a post apocalyptic world destroyed by Shadow Angles ( humanity\'s biggest enemies)  So the logical solution calls for mecha fighting machines and teenage pilots to save the world right?

I hope this was helpful :)', ""Here is my abbreviated review for this series using it's three major components: the Look factor, the Sound factor and it's Story factor. By looking at things this way, it's more apparent that Genesis Aquarion is not really all that great of an anime.-The Look gets a mediocre score due to its promisings of beautiful character and set designs that gets wiped out and overshadowed by overuse of CGI and excessive scene looping.-The Sound is excellent and worth 5 stars all on it's own merit.-The Story,which is scattered, illogical and incomplete is the shows weakest link and receives the lowest score.*Story*I don't think there's any...real plot or point to this anime except maybe for marketing purposes, kinda like the Hasbro cartoons of the 80's like G.I. Joe, He-Man or Jem which were basically created as a marketing tool to promote and sell their toys. Aquarion being a mecha-anime, I'm sure has a bunch of toys or at least a couple of model kits on the market but whether or not the anime was created exclusively for that purpose...I don't know for sure, I just get the feeling that there may be some connection there and the reason I feel this way, is because the show focuses squarely on the battle mecha, Aquarion and gives little attention given to anything else.I also think they did a poor job on character development not enough history is given as to their backgrounds, how they got enlisted and WHY they are fighting...not to mention, what's the story with the Captain??? Overall the story just doesn't seem properly formed or focused except to vanquish the bad guys by the end of each episode.In all actuality, I could have stopped watching this series in the middle and not miss much because the show fails to move forwards or even give us a reason to watch the next episode....the only reason I did finish it was because I have a compulsion to finish things I start.*Art*Honestly speaking, I wasn't impressed since I'm not a fan of CG art....and this show contains a lot of it. I don't like CG art because even though it offers more 3-D realism to images as well as a greater and much smoother range of movement....even though it offers that I don't like it because it's unable to create the illusion of flexibility, elasticity nor can it successfully bring an impression of warmth to an object which is why when they do any type of CG animation of people, those characters appear &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or just look like a computerized version of the animated dead with bodies [and sometime even their hair] that move as if they are connected by metal hinges....no flexibility, no suppleness and no warmth [the only exception to this rule is if they sink an obscene amount of money into specific CGI development projects such as the bigger video game franchises or big budget films like Final Fantasy: Advent Children or Beowulf].Anyway fortunately when it comes to animes, along with this series Genesis Aquarion, the CGI is more or less relegated to just the mecha which is fine except that when they do stuff like that....when they do introduce CG elements into an anime, then the anime seems to become all about the CG element and all attention is then allotted to only this aspect divesting all the creative energy away from the rest of the project's art and animation. And sometimes such as with this series, you can see plainly where the art and animation has faltered by having these moments of substandard drawings along with excessive looping the same scenes.Another flaw I see with the art for this anime is the missed opportunity of taking advantage of it's Ancient Mythology themes and really get in there to create some wonderful scenic art for the various settings. The potential was there to truly bring out the beauty and splendor in the artwork by focusing more on the details...but they chose to prioritize on the CG work and let the opportunity lapse. Which is a shame because I know that there were some really good artists on the project and so they could have done a better job with the art if they wanted to&mdash;just look how beautiful the illustrations were for the &ldquo;Omnia Magni&rdquo; closing credits.Anywho..., what I'm trying to say is that the art is really nice and pretty in some parts but they failed to maximize their potential.*Sound*The musical score for this show gets a ten...hands down! If the visual arts people were lost in the water, at least the musical arts people stepped up their game to make up for it. Genesis Aquarion offers one of the more unique collections of some really great and original sounding music out there on the anime market.The first OP theme song &quot;Sousei no Aquarion&quot; was actually pretty good, it carried a very upbeat and positive vibe with it's light yet contemporary melodies and since it was the main title song it made sense from them play it [kind of a lot] during the mecha battle scenes of show as well.Now...the 1st ED theme song &ldquo;Omnia Magni&rdquo; was nothing short a masterpiece! I haven't heard such wondrous and imaginative music come from an anime in quite a while. Most animes will just stick with either J-POP, J-ROCK or a nice contemporary ballad leaving only a handful of animes that will go above and beyond to play something different, original or experimental. While not they're not the first anime to play lullaby type music or songs sung in latin, Aquarion still gets points for including this hauntingly beautiful and cryptic lullaby to their soundtrack.My second favorite song is for the 2nd OP &quot;go Tight!&quot; which is like J-POP fused with an up tempo jazz beat.*Character*As I said earlier, a great majority of the characters had no development and no real history. One curious thing of note about the characters I'd like to mention was the weird pan-sexual I was getting from everyone....it was like everyone kinda had this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; or a crush or flirted with everyone else, the pairings didn't matter since there was a bit of every combination thrown in there: girl/boy, boy/boy, girl/girl and even a brother/sister complex!*Enjoyment Value*Very little.

This was something I was so hyped on watch for the longest time and when the time came I was let down by it.Story 4/10I was not very impressed by it story. It starts off pretty good but after like the 2nd Episode the rest of the series becomes filler. The pacing was very slow and the climax of the story just made me say ""Finally its done."" It was very predictable in every way. Honestly with all the filler this series was they...could have taken the series and made it a 6 episode OVA and told the same events. The filler it brought wasn\'t even that special. They tried adding in so many elements that made me feel like this wasn\'t really about Aquarion anymore. [like the vampire episode].Art 8/10This was the best thing about this anime by far. it has a darker tone in the anime and as such the anime\'s scenery is very replicating of it. But its not always like that, there are its brighter moments which fit very nicely in the anime. The CGI also fit in with the anime very nicely. However if one thing about its art didn\'t please me it was its character designs. They kinda felt generic and I probably wouldn\'t remember them if I was asked about it in the future.Sound 5/10The music for the anime wasn\'t very ground breaking to me. The OP was very catchy and I fell like i can recite it if asked to.  Other than that I did not really enjoy the sound track at all. I don\'t know it just wasn\'t my cup of tea when it comes to these kind of songs.Character 4/10Most of the characters other than our MC, Apollo, were very generic when it comes to development and story.  Most of them just feel so generic by all means. Apollo on the other hand is something that caught me by surprise. He is quite literally an animal by nature and personality which made this anime a little easier to watch. He\'s not your dense headed prick or generic manly man in the anime he\'s just an animal and that\'s what was enjoyable about him.Overall 4/10This was not a favorite of mine nor will it ever be. It was so generic in most every way and because it had me asleep multiple times. If you have seen at least a few animes this won\'t be something you\'ll probably enjoy just because of its mediocreness. Though I am not saying this is a bad anime at all I just think this could have been executed better. Don\'t take my overall score too deeply in consideration when going to watch this anime, you may find something you like. could have taken the series and made it a 6 episode OVA and told the same events.

There I did it, I could end this review right now and proudly say that I left nothing out but id rather keep going.Story: This is about a bunch of teens/young adults piloting robots as they fight the shadow angels of atlantia. Heres the thing, the robots have to ""merge"" and at the end of the ""merging"" process the three (yeah it just became a 3-way) pilots all seem to end up having simoltanius orgasms. Just whatever happenned to...waiting to merge until marriage!? Back to buisness and all jokes aside. They fight the shadow angels because the shadow angels are basically farming the humans to maintain their own lives, and humanity aint having it so how better to fight back then by building some robots and making a mecha series about your struggles.To be completely honest, I was expecting nothing out of the mecha side of this show, which is to say that as a mecha series I wasnt expecting much out of the show period. I was surprised though, the story was pretty good and kept me interested all the way through. There was also a fun bit of comedy, granted the funniest bits to me were just what the characters said as they were, uh, well, merging...Art: Holy crap, I was blown away by the art, the fight scenes were depicted soooo well. They were so cleanly done I was impressed.Characters: This show has a character for everyone: the wild one, the snotty high-society duo, the geeky kids, sports jock, emo chick; it has it all!As such, as is always the case with such a vast group of characters there are sometimes problems getting so we as viewers know their back grounds but I feel like they did a good job explaining them to us.Enjoyment: Like I said, I didnt expect anything out of this show, but It frickin rocked. A few viewers might have been turned off by the sugistivness of the merges but its okay, just so long as you know whats coming (ha ha anybody catch that, thats punny) but yeah I liked it, and I hope that you will too. waiting to merge until marriage!?

Thus I have to wonder if it’s a good show, even if I don’t think the individual parts are good.The story of Aquarion isn’t that much different from most of the other giant robot shows you may have seen over the years.  Humans are being harvested by a race of...beings called the Shadow Angels, and the only method they have to fight back are three ships called Vectors, which have to be piloted by Elementals, and can join together to create the giant robot Aquarion.  The show doesn’t stray far from convention at this point, as it’s very similar to other shows like Voltron and the likes, where you have individual fighters who join to create one giant robot.  Outside of the giant robot portion, you have the character interactions, which focus on the elementals and their personal baggage, as well as a 12,000 year old love story due to reincarnation.  The story isn’t terrible, but it misses a few steps along the way.  The reincarnation angle could have worked great, if more than 2 characters had memories from their past lives.  But since only the 2 seem important, the rest of the characters simply make up side-story elements, and thus never have the weight behind them that the main characters do.  Beyond that, the Shadow Angels, while interesting for villains, don’t really hit the cord to make you despise them, and thus the show lacks a lot of punch.  In the end, the story is sound for creating a giant robot show, but it’s certainly not a selling point, and truly falls short of better shows in the genre such as RahXephon and NGE.When it comes to the characters themselves in Aquarion, I find myself rather torn.  One the one hand, the interaction between them is generally fun, and adds a lot to the show.  The problem is that the characters themselves are often entirely unlikable.  The main character, Apollo, is shown throughout the entire show being bestial and nasty, due to the fact that he had to live a hard life as a child.  That’s all well and good, but you’d like the character to evolve beyond that at some point, and become better all around.  You see hints that such evolution is happening, but then they throw that all away by having him pick his nose, or do something else childish and disgusting at every opportunity.  Sadly, he’s still more likable than the female protagonist Silvia, who spends most of the show having to get past her brother issues and the fact that she’s a spoiled princess.  Other side characters range from the strangely out of place soccer player (who still wears his uniform) to the rather cliché mopey, I have only bad luck but everyone loves me, to the I’m cute but helpless moe type character.  Despite all the flaws of the characters, their interactions are still fun and enjoyable, and they do make the show better.  I think despite their flaws, these are rather charming characters that I just couldn’t make myself dislike.The animation of Aquarion is pretty much all over the place.  Generally, the animation is pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it’s fairly sharp.  There are a handful of episodes that just aren’t as good, but they normally don’t stray too far into the terrible territory, unless they do it on purpose.  My problem is again with the implementation of the CG, such as the robots.  I just never enjoyed the CG aspect, and I didn’t particularly care for the design of the Aquarion, which left all of the giant robot fight scenes particularly displeasing from an aesthetic reason.  When it comes to the artistic design, I found the humans to be relatively bland.  They look like any other gathering of humans that you’d find in any other giant robot show.  Where the show ventures off and becomes creative is the Shadow Angels, and I found their artistic design to be quite enjoyable.  The character Otoha, with wing like arms and multiple eyes was truly interesting from an artistic perspective.  The end result is a mishmash of animation, that is sometimes striking and fascinating, other time conventional and fine, mixed with bad CG that drains away a lot of that credibility.If there’s one area that Aquarion caught me completely by surprise, it’s the music of the show.  This is a truly hidden little gem of a sound track, but in retrospect, that comes as no surprise.  I didn’t know the composer when I was watching the show, but I found myself enjoying a lot of the rather catchy lyrical songs, as well as truly loving the classical pieces, particularly when the piano was used.  It came as no surprise to me when I learned that this was another soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno, so my natural love for the music made immediate sense.  Truly, this is the high point of the show, and I always found that the use of music here made things have more emotional impact than they should have, but that’s a power that Ms. Kanno has always had.Beyond all the parts of Aquarion, the show is quirky and that both works for it and detracts from it.  I don’t understand the reasoning behind the women experiencing orgasmic feelings when they powered up the Aquarion.  That always felt weird and out of place in this show.  Also, this is a truly “Rinse and Repeat” show if I’ve ever seen one.  About 80% of the episodes of this show can be broken down into the following steps:1. The show starts with a little character interaction, usually setting up which character will have the breakthrough moment in the fight this episode.2. The enemy will attack, and three elementals will be sent out to fight them.3. The good guys will get overconfident and have to confront some new enemy attack that they don’t know how to beat; 1-2 of the elementals will likely get knocked out at this point.4. The character from the earlier interaction will realize they have some special talent or insight into this particularly enemy.5. Cue catchy Yoko Kanno victory music6. The good guys beat said enemy7. There might be a little post fight character interaction, and then the episode ends.That’s pretty much the way almost every single episode goes, with the exception of the first and last couple of episodes where they move things along quicker for storyline purposes.  Beyond that, some of the episodes are incredibly random for a giant robot type of show.  There are episodes about dreams, vampires, dieting and awful animation (I swear they were on serious drugs for episode 17).When you look at any particular area of Aquarion, with the exception of the music, each aspect of the show seems horribly flawed, and one would think it’s a terrible show.  But somehow when you pull together all these flawed parts, this show has a great amount of charm and I couldn’t help myself, I found that I liked the show.  It’s not great, and it doesn’t stand up against the better shows in the genre, but if you have the time and you can overlook those flaws, Aquarion might just be able to win you over with its charm as well. beings called the Shadow Angels, and the only method they have to fight back are three ships called Vectors, which have to be piloted by Elementals, and can join together to create the giant robot Aquarion.  The show doesn’t stray far from convention at this point, as it’s very similar to other shows like Voltron and the likes, where you have individual fighters who join to create one giant robot.  Outside of the giant robot portion, you have the character interactions, which focus on the elementals and their personal baggage, as well as a 12,000 year old love story due to reincarnation.  The story isn’t terrible, but it misses a few steps along the way.  The reincarnation angle could have worked great, if more than 2 characters had memories from their past lives.  But since only the 2 seem important, the rest of the characters simply make up side-story elements, and thus never have the weight behind them that the main characters do.  Beyond that, the Shadow Angels, while interesting for villains, don’t really hit the cord to make you despise them, and thus the show lacks a lot of punch.  In the end, the story is sound for creating a giant robot show, but it’s certainly not a selling point, and truly falls short of better shows in the genre such as RahXephon and NGE.When it comes to the characters themselves in Aquarion, I find myself rather torn.  One the one hand, the interaction between them is generally fun, and adds a lot to the show.  The problem is that the characters themselves are often entirely unlikable.  The main character, Apollo, is shown throughout the entire show being bestial and nasty, due to the fact that he had to live a hard life as a child.  That’s all well and good, but you’d like the character to evolve beyond that at some point, and become better all around.  You see hints that such evolution is happening, but then they throw that all away by having him pick his nose, or do something else childish and disgusting at every opportunity.  Sadly, he’s still more likable than the female protagonist Silvia, who spends most of the show having to get past her brother issues and the fact that she’s a spoiled princess.  Other side characters range from the strangely out of place soccer player (who still wears his uniform) to the rather cliché mopey, I have only bad luck but everyone loves me, to the I’m cute but helpless moe type character.  Despite all the flaws of the characters, their interactions are still fun and enjoyable, and they do make the show better.  I think despite their flaws, these are rather charming characters that I just couldn’t make myself dislike.The animation of Aquarion is pretty much all over the place.  Generally, the animation is pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it’s fairly sharp.  There are a handful of episodes that just aren’t as good, but they normally don’t stray too far into the terrible territory, unless they do it on purpose.  My problem is again with the implementation of the CG, such as the robots.  I just never enjoyed the CG aspect, and I didn’t particularly care for the design of the Aquarion, which left all of the giant robot fight scenes particularly displeasing from an aesthetic reason.  When it comes to the artistic design, I found the humans to be relatively bland.  They look like any other gathering of humans that you’d find in any other giant robot show.  Where the show ventures off and becomes creative is the Shadow Angels, and I found their artistic design to be quite enjoyable.  The character Otoha, with wing like arms and multiple eyes was truly interesting from an artistic perspective.  The end result is a mishmash of animation, that is sometimes striking and fascinating, other time conventional and fine, mixed with bad CG that drains away a lot of that credibility.If there’s one area that Aquarion caught me completely by surprise, it’s the music of the show.

Along with the destruction came beings called Shadow Angels who have been asleep for thousands of years, and begin to harvest humans and extract their life force.  Ordinary human weapons are ineffective against the Shadow Angels, that's where the organization called Deava comes in creating machines to fight against the Dark Angels called Vectors.  The Vectors can also combine to form a giant robot.  The story takes off years later and follows Apollo who might be a reborn hero from...thousands of years ago.I'm going to begin with the things I didn't like about the show than to the things I did like.1.  This show just seemed to blend RahXephon, Eureka Seven and Evangelion together and this is what came out.

This was the part that brought down the series for me, maybe if I hadn't seen the shows above I might have enjoyed it more.2.  The other thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack which didn't add anything to the series.Onto the good.1.  The best part of the series were the characters.  I'll focus mainly on Apollo who was a great main character.  He was enjoyable to watch and you will just plain like him.  You will like him more as the series goes on and watch him develop.  There were other good characters in Silvia, Hong Lihua who I found very interesting, Pierre, and the rest.  Each brought something to the series.2.  The other thing that I liked was the animation done by I think Satelight, I could be wrong.  Anyway I thought it was very good, and added to the series.Overall a decent series that recycles themes from other disaster anime.  I think it's worth checking out I'd imagine most people would give it between a 5-8.  I don't think it merits anything lower or higher. thousands of years ago.I'm going to begin with the things I didn't like about the show than to the things I did like.1.

I don't think it merits anything lower or higher."", ""Sousei no Aquarion is a mecha anime written by Kawamori Shoji, best known for his work on the Macross series and Escaflowne. Is Aquarion going to be on par with his other works? Let's take a look and find out.The story is pretty basic, there are beings called shadow angels who have emerged for the first time in twelve thousand years to harvest energy from humans. The events of the two time periods are connected but I can't explain exactly how without giving spoilers. Most of the episodes have very little to do with the overarching story. The events of most episodes follow a...basic pattern. Agents of the shadow angels appear, this leads to a giant robot fight in which Aquarion randomly develops a technique to gain victory and said technique is never used again. Honestly, it's like they're just making things up as they go with Aquarion's techniques. On a positive note, there are some funny moments throughout the series, but they're few in number. In some ways it does remind me of Bakuretsu Tenshi since it also had episodes that barely connected to the main plot. The big difference is that the episodes in Bakuretsu Tenshi had a lot more variety as to the type of events and episode structures. Still, Bakuretsu Tenshi had a pretty weak story, like Aquarion, but was saved by awesome characters.Let's take a look at Aquarion's characters to see if the comparison with Bakuretsu Tenshi continues, if Aquarion is another anime where awesome characters carry the series in spite of a weak story. That isn't the case. Whereas Bakuretsu Tenshi's characters develop strong relationships with one another and grow as characters, Aquarion's cast has very minor developments, all of which are very predictable. You might argue that this is a result of having more characters to work with, but this doesn't just hold true with the supporting characters, it's also the case with the major characters and frankly, they could've easily had some character development if they'd spent less time with pointless action sequences. Some of the characters could've been interesting but they don't develop enough to reach that point.The art is decent, but it's nothing particularly special. The action sequences are pretty creative and intense but there's not a whole lot that differentiates between Aquarion's style and the art style of dozens of other anime. The only thing that really catches the eye about Aquarion's art are the shadow angels since they have some nice, unique looks but the other characters all look vaguely familiar, as though I've seen them elsewhere.Let's move on to the voice acting. In spite of having some really strong voice actors, Paku Romi, Sugita Tomokazu and Kobayashi Sanae being three obvious examples, the voice acting in Aquarion isn't anything special. This isn't to say that it's poorly done or that anyone errs. It's competent but it doesn't stand out. The music is decent.The yuri factor is a 3/10. Tsugumi and Reika are pretty homo-erotic but the series never goes anywhere with it except for one throwaway line.My final rating for Sousei no Aquarion is a 5/10. It's a mediocre series. There are some interesting ideas and there's a lot of potential, for both story and characters, but they never do anything with it and it ends up going to waste. If you're a major fan of Macross and other old mecha series you'll probably get some warm nostalgic sensations from it, but otherwise it's probably not going to hold much appeal for you. basic pattern.

So don't expect much there. The interesting part was the past relationships, which (btw) becomes totally meaningless by the end. I don't even know why the creator even bothered?!As for the characters, a load of them should have died off or become part of the quiet background. Amazingly, the only interesting character was the main (Apollo). Which, I must add, is just...sad since he doesn't change at all through the whole series. Which made me wonder just what is the point of having such a static main character??The animation/art is pretty modern so that is one of the only things in the anime I can actually comment on positively. And I didn't enjoy any of the opening/ending themes so I can't say much for that.So, this anime should only be watched when you have a looooott of time to waste. sad since he doesn't change at all through the whole series.

It reminds me of Gundam, With the robots,romance and saving your friends lives.Lastly Here are my scores, I chose a 9 for the Story, I always had a feeling that angels would want to take out humans(either in a show,Movie,whatever). Me and my brother saw the episodes already, there good. I chose a 10 for the Art, because It really mixed with the story and emotions that it had.

The art is pretty good, sometimes even really cool, the music I didn't notice which generally means there was nothing wrong with it.Really, from an artistic point of view this anime is fine.  There's nothing wrong with the visuals.  I'd even go so far as to say they're great!  The trouble starts when we move on to the writing side of things.  The story just sort...of plods along for episode after episode, with not nearly as much plot development as one would have hoped for.  The villains just sort of mope about, sending out generic mecha monster after generic mecha monster.Maybe I could have looked past all these other problems if it weren't for the orgasmic high that all three of the pilots get whenever their mecha link up with eachother.  The whole thing is handled in such a juvenile, silly way that it becomes impossible to take the show seriously after a while.   The fact that all the characters are like lobotomized versions of Escaflowne characters just makes it worse.So yeah, if you want to watch a Frankenstein's monster of evangelion and gundam wing, populated with many characters who are vaugly reminicent of much, much cooler characters from other shows, have fun watching Sousei no Aquarion.  I admit, it is amuzing to watch just to sort of chuckle at, but it really offers nothing new or special.Also, it was directed by Shoji Kawamori, who should really freaking know better.  For those who don't know who he is, imagine if Hayao Miyazaki made a movie about a group of schoolgirls who all had a crush on some really skeezy older dude, and there were tons of upskirt shots.  Picture that in your mind, and you'll understand my disappointment. of plods along for episode after episode, with not nearly as much plot development as one would have hoped for.

This is ""Aquarion"".In an unspecified futuristic land, eleven years before there was a series of cataclysms known as the Great Catastrophe, which caused considerable damage to the Earth. But this was only the prelude to the catastrophe, since this disaster caused an even worse disaster: the...awakening of the Angels of Darkness.And precisely on the day when the Aquarion makes its first appearance against the attack of the Angels of Darkness, with results nothing short of disastrous for the surprise appearance of a ""Legendary Beast"", Apollo enters the scene, a boy from almost animal-like character due to its bizarre character, as well as having a very developed instinct of survival, but with a very strong heart and which is bound to ties with people; his friends were captured by the Angels of Darkness, but with an unexpected move he managed to get on board the Aquarion and allow the victory to the DEAVA, showing his incredible qualities of Element.The series, in addition to narrating the struggle between the factions, analyzes one by one the characters of both ranks, while concentrating to a greater extent on the staff of the DEAVA, often with episodes dedicated to them, so as not to make them simple extras to make up , allowing a very elaborate characterization of them.The series also focuses on the feeling of love, in the romantic sense, both normal, as in the case between Apollo and Silvia, both as a reincarnation of two lovers and unconventional, as in the case of Silvia\'s obsession with her brother Sirius, who it always nearly touches incest, both homosexual and masculine in the case of the silent love of Toma towards Apollonius, both female, because of Tsugumi that with time will come to fall in love with her senpai Reika. ""Aquarion"" is a particular series, a series that lets an air of legend breathe in its unfolding, as well as showing to the nth degree that love also drives the events and can lead to the end of a war, proving that is able to turn off any hatred.

Two of the warriors Silvia and Apollo were lovers two thousand years ago that are supposed to bring victory to their cause.Story 7/10: It's decent. I like the fact that two characters (Apollo & Silvia) get a second chance to bring their love about and win against the winged race. There is a fair amount of plot development as well, which is nice. Basically the winged race (Shadow Angels) harvest human souls to give life to their tree so that they can rule once again....Apollo meeting Silvia (Apollonius and Siren in their past life) has a change of heart and leaves the winged one's race by ripping his wings off and joining in Siren's cause. As it turns out though, Silvia is a winged one as well.Art 6/10: I would have given the artwork a better rating, but for some reason at times it was obvious they switched to a computer based animation (not just during the fight scenes but at times when I think it wasn't necessary) and every series that switches mid-way through, the difference is just too great.Sound 9/10: The music was awesome!

Graphics are good 2D+3D but the story is not one of best i have seen forom mecha. I recommend this if you run out of Macross Frontier,Gundam,Herioc Age and other top mecha series.plot more detailed:Eleven years before the start of...the series, a disaster only referred to as the ""Great Catastrophe"" destroyed significant parts of the world and killed off many of its inhabitants. Along with the disaster came the appearance of the Shadow Angels, winged-beings who have been in slumber for twelve thousand years in their city of Atlandia. The Shadow Angels harvest humans on Earth, dubbed the ""wingless ones"", like cattle, extracting their prana (life force) from them, serving as energy and nutrition to the Shadow Angels, but also to feed the legendary Tree of Life. The Shadow Angels facilitate their harvesting via giant, floating harvesting machines guarded by giant golem-like creatures called Cherubim Soldiers. How these are normally piloted is unknown, yet there are times when they are piloted by Shadow Angels.Ordinary weapons prove ineffective against the Cherubim, but a human expedition under the leadership of Gen Fudou eventually excavates three very technologically advanced fighter planes. Gen Fudou disappears, but an organization called Deava takes over the research of these machines, called Vectors, trying to find out how to use them. The three Vectors are the Vector Luna, the Vector Mars and the Vector Sol. Deava discovers only people who are Element users can control the Vectors and, ultimately, unite the three to form the giant fighting machine Aquarion.During the first sortie to fight a Cherubim, Deava encounters 15 year-old Apollo, who seems to be the reincarnation of the hero Apollonius, also known as the ""Solar Wing"", who betrayed his Shadow Angel bretheren for his love of the human warrior Celiane. the series, a disaster only referred to as the ""Great Catastrophe"" destroyed significant parts of the world and killed off many of its inhabitants.

As well, I don't think Aquarion knew what kind of anime it was as it tried to combine too many kinds of anime in one series.  I also found that there were too many filler episodes that brought up new ideas that were never followed up on.For its time, the CGI of the mechas in Aquarion were pretty good.  If one were to compare the CGI to an anime made in 2015 then the CGI would...look clunky.  I also found that the animation has aged well over time.I found the music and the opening themes enjoyable and the English VA's were pretty good for their roles.  I didn't find any of the voices to be annoying.I found that each of the main characters fit easily into an anime stereotype.  Not to give anything away, there is the typical womanizing athlete, the klutz, the stubborn princess, etc.  None of the characters really grew and I found them to be very 2 dimensional.All in all, I thought Aquarion was a decent anime.  Not horrible, but not something super stellar to add to my collection to rewatch. look clunky.

Now the review I am writing is keeping in mind the time at which this was released.The story is like a mish mash of NGE, RaXephon, mecha link etc. The art and the art detail are not that great. Sound is bad. This concept of souls merging when the robots merge gives a very. ahh how do I say in better words, I can't say, so its erotic and has an erotic sound with all characters screaming ahh, oohh, I have never felt this before etc. You get the point.

It takes itself way too seriously. Giant robot shows are always over the top. I can't take a show seriously when the protagonists punch a robot to the moon. I have nothing against ridiculous fights, but you can't have crazy fight scenes and then have melodrama in then scene right after. If you want to have a serious show, then please stay away from the mecha genre. But the story doesn't matter in a giant robot show, so how are the fights? Not good at all. The fights...focus mostly on the head guy giving directions to the robot pilots. There are only a handful of robot designs in the series and stock footage is overused. If it were just about the fights, Aquarion would be middle of the road, but the story makes it that much worse. It may be free on Funimation's site, but it's not even worth the time investment. focus mostly on the head guy giving directions to the robot pilots.

Nothing much to say about it, I just loved it.About the sound I have to say that I disliked the Dubbed voices in the beginning. In the end I actually did like them. I only disliked Reika her voice pretty much.I have to say that I really hated Sylvia in the beginning, but how more I watched, how more I liked her. I seriously loved what happend between her and Apollo through the series. Ofcourse there were a few characters that I disliked, like Reika, but I liked a...lot of the characters in the end.As for the story...it was perfect in my eyes. Everything what happend in the past with Appolonius and Celiane was beautiful and kind of sad at the same time. The cool thing about this anime was that there happend a few things that I didn't expect to happen at all. There were some cruel and sad things in it too. The anime made me laugh and happy, but sometimes it made me sad too. It even happend twice that I cried.I absolutly loved this anime. Actualy...

It feels like it’s doing it on purpose almost and it’s very entertaining. It gets to the point where some of the show is just utter nonsense, but I mean that in the best way...possible.The fan service feels kinda gratuitous (why do they almost orgasm whenever the mechs merge) but that’s just an anime thing I guess.Overall I enjoyed it a lot. possible.The fan service feels kinda gratuitous (why do they almost orgasm whenever the mechs merge) but that’s just an anime thing I guess.Overall I enjoyed it a lot.', 'I came upon this anime while i was browsing thru itunes ^^ and i was like oooooo giant robots XD i mean who doesnt like giant robots fighting other giant stuff.The first few episodes were really good because they actually had some good material to put in. the visuals were quite nice but after a couple episodes they all became more or less the same :P. the only parts i liked about this anime was the beginning and the ending because those episodes had most of the plot.If i were u i wouldnt really spend my time on this there r a lot better anime...than this but if u like giant robots a lot i guess it wouldnt be that bad than this but if u like giant robots a lot i guess it wouldnt be that bad', 'As a casual fan of mecha series, I was looking forward to watching Sousei no Aquarion. While I found it enjoyable, at times, I couldn\'t help myself from being relatively bored throughout the series.Story:The story is laid out in the first few minutes of the series as the narrator describes the legendary war between the Shadow Angels and humans as well as the tragic love story between Apollonius and Seliane. 12,000 years later, history is about to repeat itself as the Shadow Angels have re-emerged and the humans at DEAVA must use the power of Aquarion, a three part mecha in three different forms, to...repel their advances. The reincarnated souls of the heroes and villains from 12,000 years ago must first realize who they are, and what they must do to save the world from total destruction.The story is very compelling and lays the groundwork for an exciting plot. However, that plot tends to show up and then casually leave without fully understanding what is really going on. Most episodes share very little in common with one another and revolve around some aspect of Gen Fudou\'s training and team building exercises. It seems as though there is a set formula where they receive some unconventional training, initially struggle with the concept, alarm sounds as a Cherubim soldier shows up, beats up Aquarion a tad, characters switch out, characters learn basis for training, beat Cheribim with a corny, aptly named attack, rejoice. It becomes quite trite and predictable, and its really not all that fun to watch. Within these episodes there tends to be character development: back-stories, tragic events, etc. That being said, where the plot does show up again, the show is at its best. As you advance, you gain a little more insight to the truth of the events from 12,000 years ago complete with quite a few juicy plot twists. The last 7 episodes are very, very plot -heavy and very, very good.Art:It\'s tough to rate this show\'s art in 2013 knowing what we have available now as compared to 2005 when this show aired. That being said, I wasn\'t a big fan of the animation in the show. The basic animation was sketchy and inconsistent. This led to a bunch of clipping issues and some very unintentionally interesting, and unflattering faces made by the characters. Character designs are very basic and nothing special. They aren\'t ugly by any measure, but no one is particularly beautiful either. The CGI during fight scenes and the merge sequences is very good and is probably the saving grace for this show\'s animation. Something changes in episode 19; however, where the animation is downright poor. I\'m aware that the animation change is pivotal to the plot-line of the episode, but the areas of ""normalcy"" should not have changed. It almost seems like the illustrators said screw it, which is upsetting. Additionally, while the show uses a lot of sexual imagery, there is practically zero fan-service aside from silhouettes and goo-covered bodies. Take that for whatever it\'s worth. It is not necessary a dig at the show, but it is something I find inconsistent.Sound:The Openings, Endings, and OSTs in this anime are by my opinion the strongest facets of the show. When you have someone as well known as Yoko Kanno taking care of your music, it is normally a good sign. Most notably, the opening Sousei no Aquarion by Akino is a beautifully sung and arranged song. It\'s invigorating and gets you excited to watch. It\'s English counterpart, Genesis of Aquarion--an inset song introduced in the series--is an a capella arrangement in English, in which English speaking viewers can understand the powerful lyrics through a very soulful performance.* The voice acting is solid, but nothing spectacular. One facet of the voice acting that you\'ll either love or hate is the excessive sexual innuendo during the merge sequences. Each episode contains copious amounts of orgasmic moans and screams where you can draw the conclusion that merging=sex, which may or may not be the case. Supposedly the feeling of merging with someone is pure bliss equitable to sex. This is a bold approach that could alienate some viewers.*I have an English version of Genesis of Aquarion on my iPod, but the actual track in the anime is in Japanese. My mistake.Character:One thing I always look for in any anime I watch is characters that I am drawn to, not necessarily attracted to, but a character who I can relate to or is very likable. I found no such character in Sousei no Aquarion. For the most part, I found most characters annoying aside from Gen Fudou and Toma. Whether it was Apollo\'s animalistic behavior, Silvia\'s brother complex, Sirius\'s arrogance, or Reika\'s constant negativity, the main characters just bugged me. There were some likable major/minor characters such as Rena and Sophia Belin, but their likability was overwhelmed by the major characters.Despite its flaws, Sousei no Aquarion is an an enjoyable anime. I can honestly say that while I did not love it, I by no stretch hated it either. I admire Sousei no Aquarion for what it is, a solid mecha with an exceptional story and good action scenes. As a casual mecha fan, that is all I can ask for. I\'m not entirely sure it needed it be 26 episodes as well. However, it is not easy to put aside its flaws. The characters and animation are bland and uninspiring. Sticking through the overly mundane middle episodes and reaching the final episodes is very rewarding, and well worth the wait. Also, if you plan on watching Aquarion Evol, I highly recommend watching this series to lay the foundation for what is to come. repel their advances.

Also, it's cheesy and generic but provides some enjoyment If you go in with few expectations. I would say that its overall rating is a little to high. Its not great, nor is it terrible.

Would that past life have some kind of impact on your current life? Perhaps in a past life, I could have been more of a mecha fan than I am in this life. Even though I don’t consider myself to be a huge fan of mecha anime, I still happened to have a particular one on my to-watch list for years for rather stupid reasons; after finding a DVD of it at my local library, though, I finally got around to watching it. Now that I’m finished with it, though, exactly what do I...think of it?Merge one! Merge two! Go, my review of Aquarion! (Okay, that was terrible.)Aquarion takes place 12,000 years after a war between the Earth and a race known as the Shadow Angels. The Shadow Angels went into slumber after the end of the war, but eleven years before the beginning of the series, a disaster brought the Shadow Angels back to Earth, with them resuming their feeding of humans’ life force. To combat this, an organization called DEAVA uses a mecha called Aquarion, which had been used 12,000 years prior and requires people with special powers called Elements to pilot three fighter planes called Vectors to combine them into Aquarion by “merging”. (A lot to take in, I know.) The series mainly follows Apollo, a boy who is believed to be the reincarnation of Apollonius, who played a large role in the war. He is recruited by DEAVA to become a pilot for Aquarion, and when his friends are taken by the Shadow Angels, he agrees.It is difficult to explain what kind of story Aquarion is trying to tell, but exactly what kind of story it actually tells is even worse. A good portion of the anime’s 26 episodes contain filler that contribute absolutely nothing to the plot; filler episodes aren’t necessarily a bad thing if those filler episodes were entertaining to watch, but with Aquarion’s filler episodes, I would just groan out of frustration from how stupid they are. Fortunately, the series DOES try to tell a cohesive story, and I commend the attempts at telling that story. However, most of the plot twists are too predictable or just plain confusing; there were very few that I actually liked. Another thing that I must mention is the fact that it doesn’t try that hard to differentiate itself from other mecha anime; I have at least seen enough mecha anime to be watching this and thinking, “Yeah, that’s happened before.”As for the characters, they’re honestly a bit of a mixed bag. All of the characters are cliché, but some of them are actually likable in spite of that. However, there is one issue that the characters share, and that is the amount of development. Most of the characters get one or two episodes of real development each, if any at all; after that, although those characters may get some time in the spotlight, any real development instead goes to Apollo, Silvia, and maybe Sirius. I must admit that it was kind of interesting to see the development of Apollo and Silvia’s relationship, but the other relationships in this series don’t get as much attention or development, which is a real shame.The art and animation.... What can I really say about those? Well, the settings were decent, and some of the character designs were good. The CG animation wasn’t that good, but it may just be that this anime came out in 2005, when CG animation wasn’t the best. I really, REALLY want to praise the more 2D animation; Satelight and Production Reed have each done some decent animation, and in this series, some of the animation is actually good. The key word there is “some”; it may, again, just be the fact that this anime came out in 2005, but the animation quality is a bit inconsistent and falls at times. The biggest offender of this is episode 19; a majority of that episode was drawn in a different style altogether, and while I understand why the animators decided to go that route with that episode (although it did come off as rather jarring), the parts of the episode that returned to the normal style of this series were very poorly animated and came off as even more jarring.One genuine praise I have for Aquarion, however, is the music. Both of the opening themes sound like they could be the opening themes for most other mecha anime, but they’re catchy enough to warrant a re-listen or two; the same goes for the ending theme, although that is more because of how completely beautiful it sounds, from the instrumentals to Yui Makino’s voice. The soundtrack is pretty good, too; the piano rendition of the first opening theme is absolutely, breathtakingly gorgeous. Finally, I watched the English dub of Aquarion, and the voice acting is pretty good for its time. The characters’ voices fit their characters quite well (although Brian Palencia as Silvia takes a bit of getting used to, although that may just be my fault for not knowing she voiced her and dumbly expecting a different voice to come out of her mouth), and they convey their emotions quite well.Overall, Aquarion is pretty much just your average mecha anime. No one is going to kill you if you don’t watch it, but hardcore mecha fans may get a kick out of it.

There is more to the Aquarion anime than just these 26 episodes, however; I wonder how it evolves from here....', 'Something to remember when Shoji Kawamori is involved: Plot is not his forte-- in fact I daresay it\'s his biggest weakness as a content creator-- and Aquarion is no exception to this rule. Whenever he didn\'t write the script or screenplay, like Macross Plus, that story was tight. Not so here. Like Escaflowne that preceded it and Basquash that followed it, the show tends to be episodic, with sort of a direction towards the end, but with very loose cohesion from subplot to subplot. As a result, characters that learn something new one episode are often reset to their ""default"" behaviors the next (especially Sirius)--...but they had some fun with that in the ""cosplay"" episode. Honestly, I\'d much rather watch a music video with his mechanical designs and Yoko Kanno\'s music, but this is the next best thing.The ""reincarnation"" subplot is one of the better things about this show. While I sometimes wished that we saw more of Apollonius and Celiane, this connection to Apollo and Silvia is a great driver of their relationship. The other characters, as I\'ve mentioned, tend to be rather static until the major turning point at around episode 20.The art and character design in the show are stunning. So much so, that when they decided to have some fun with other animators, it was jarring (and hilarious... though I didn\'t really see the point other than that line shouted at the end). I seem to remember a slight disconnect between the drawn animation and the CG-- the CG lines are very ""clean"" and smooth, whereas the drawn lines are less so, especially in close-ups. Usually I don\'t notice it unless I\'ve paused the video and really pick the frame apart.The soundtrack, well... Yoko Kanno. \'Nuff said? You may have previously heard her work in shows like Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, and Turn-A Gundam. Well, since this is a show about kids piloting the mechs rather than soldiers, in addition to the ""trinity"" motif of the mecha, there are a lot of ""threes"" in the battle themes rather than marches. One starts with a piano and violin riff descending into a wild waltz, another starts with the violins playing a repeating triplet-beat above a live choir. One of the best tracks is a long build-up with orchestra and choir to an epic piece that backdrops significant battle scenes, also in a meter of ""threes"".Speaking of music, this show introduced me to one of my favorite bilingual singers, Akino from bless4. Now, her theme songs are probably a bit overused in the show, but that\'s okay by me because they are fantastic. The ending, Omna Magni, was... interesting. Initially I thought it was in an artificial language like Esperanto, but nope, this language was evidently original.To wrap up, take one episode at a time, sit back and enjoy the soundtrack, the giant robots, and the big booms. but they had some fun with that in the ""cosplay"" episode.

What happened was Shoji Kawamori trying to find everything that a mecha anime represented (guns, robots, a tsundere with bro-con, the ass, wimp, etc) and threw it into the blender; much like your typical Scary Movie (I-IV), Date Movie parody flick.What starts out as an awesome Voltron/TTGL combo of robots coming together as a greater whole becomes a mess of one liners and sexual references everywhere.Story: 3/10Besides the overall theme of...saving the world with and while you search for your lover of past reincarnate, there is really not much to the story. Episodic in nature, most of the episodes are stand alones except for the last few where they try to finish the main plot of saving the world.There were also minor plot holes which are filled on the go (like the Pierre fight with the Eva-like doppelganger bad guy) and how some scenes show blind Rena seeing the action even though she is blind.Art: 7/10Best way to put it: If you want to appreciate the art, watch it in Japanese without subs, that way the terrible dialogue will not get to you as you watch epic scenes unfold with the 1st Op.Sound: 8/10Yoko Kanno leads the whole series with her music, which comes full swing halfway through the series.

Sylvia is a bro-con the whole way through until the last 2 episodes, Tsugumi is still the yuri she is from the beginning, Reika is the Shinji (with her whole mantra about her misfortune), and the list can go on.

This show has an interesting world and fun fights, but failed to truly develop the characters and story in favor of a lesson-of-the day (90% of the time that lesson is teamwork or confidence) episode format. Every episode starts by presenting a character flaw or emotional challenge for the heroes. As they struggle and fail, an alarm sounds, interrupting their efforts with an incoming attack. Coincidentally, the enemy is uniquely designed to be unbeatable based upon the specific challenge shown earlier in the episode. After a few fight scenes, one character will have an epiphany allowing the team to discover...how to launch an attack that will destroy the enemy.The true flaw in the show is that the characters promptly forget all of the lessons they have learned by the next episode. It is a bit hard to believe that after 20+ episodes learning the importance of teamwork, trust, friendship and overcoming jealousy, the characters still act as if they are unloved and alone.Further, the sudden enemy attack often  interrupts what was an interesting story of character development. Had the writers abandoned the episode formula and allowed a story to develop over 2-3 episodes, then this show could have had a compelling story and character to complement its action scenes. As is, it is disjointed.Watch episodes 1-3, 5, 12-13 and 19-26 and you can get the whole story while saving a bunch of time. how to launch an attack that will destroy the enemy.The true flaw in the show is that the characters promptly forget all of the lessons they have learned by the next episode.

It\'s a Mecha show, so there will always be some serious suspension of disbelief, but they have some interesting ideas, even if some of them come across as a little... silly.  The mecha in question, Aquarion itself, is three parts that can combine and recombine into different forms for more adaptability (don\'t let children watch them ""merging"" unless you want awkward questions about the faces they make), and the pilots usually have psychic-ish special powers that help them in various situations.  All of this, and more, add up to situations where the pilots really have to not...only work together, but trust and understand each other, which is a decent message, even if the anime tends to cop out on that idea later.The biggest complaint I have is that it could have used more attention to detail.  The story is good, but weak; the main characters get the standard amount of attention, meaning that they have a persona that may or may not be fleshed out by individual episodes about them.  However, secondary characters, no matter how prominent, remain two-dimensional at best.  (Jean-Jerome Jorge, I\'m looking at you.)  Some of the plot points seem tacked-on, such as the military-industrial-complex types that apparently were perfectly content to let children pilot giant mecha with a mysterious stranger commanding them, without actually bothering to have a bunch of military folks sitting there grousing, but they were still waiting patiently to do military-industrial-complex things as soon as it became convenient to the writer.I don\'t have any comment on the art (it passes...?), and the dub was predictably awful, what with english voice actors never managing to make any of their lines sound like they were actually part of a conversation, much less the conversation in question.  It would be hard to blame this on the anime itself, though.In all, if like me you like to be given a glimpse of another, interesting world, then Aquarion is a world that you might find interesting.  If you\'re looking for something more serious, or which really takes itself seriously, maybe not.  Or you can just ""read the footsteps"" of this somewhat odd anime and decide for yourself. only work together, but trust and understand each other, which is a decent message, even if the anime tends to cop out on that idea later.The biggest complaint I have is that it could have used more attention to detail.

Set in a future where humanity is under threat by supernatural beings called Shadow Angels, a homeless boy named Apollo and several teenagers with various special abilities become co-pilots for the transforming mecha known as Aquarion to fight the Shadow Angels. Before I go into the mess that this series is, I should compliment the presentation of this series. The visuals are quite pleasing on the eyes with gorgeous and majestic scenic shots of both Earth and the world of...the Shadow Angels, a number of unique character designs for the Shadow Angels, and nicely rendered CG animation of the mecha used by both factions that blends in almost seamlessly with the show\'s regular animation. The soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno also sports a variety of instrumentals, orchestral scores, and haunting lyrical pieces that are fitting for the various scenes that play out throughout the series.Outside of presentation, Aquarion\'s faces plenty of issues with its plotting and characters, in no small part because it felt like the series was trying too hard to appeal to various audiences. The show\'s plot seemed to be spinning its wheels for much of its run with ""monster of the day"" plots where Apollo and the teens faced off against different creations of the Shadow Angels while trying to figure out some vague hint dropped by their team captain, with the occasional hints dropped about Apollo\'s past life as a fellow Shadow Angel and a few of his teammates having their own connections to his past incarnation. However the revelations are nothing remarkable as the series doesn\'t really take much time to further flesh out the origins of the Shadow Angels and the Aquarion mecha created specifically to combat them. The show also could not seem to find a consistent mood to maintain in many of its earlier episodes where some come off serious, while others have a more comical bent. While the final 6-7 episodes do get somewhat more compelling with some shocking twists and developments that reveal more about the origins of some major characters, the show still devolves into a mess focused around mecha combinations and mysticism that the show had done a poor job of attempting to have complement Aquarion instead of being the anime\'s main attraction, which is laughably ridiculous with its pilots almost orgasming anytime the Aquarion\'s different formations combine together.Not helping matters are the characters not having much to offer in terms of depth. All of the characters fill your typical anime character types in one form or another that include our lead Apollo as the rude and impulsive troublemaker, Silvia your short-fused noble girl with a brother complex, Sirius the attractive bishounen craving beauty and perfection, and team captain Fudou loaning enigmatic and vague hints that the teen pilots have to learn of. The Shadow Angels aren\'t much better off either as many of them are mostly two-dimensional baddies who look down upon humanity and see them as cattle for maintaining energy for their realm, with only main baddie Toma getting any sort of dimension for his character.In spite of its impressive presentation, Aquarion is still a mess of an anime that loses focus over what sort of mood and plot direction it wishes to take its story, lacks any memorable characters due to how shallow they are, and trying too hard at attempting to please as wide a fanbase as possible.

Overall, it\'s a rather forgettable entry in the mecha genre.', ""This will be my first time writing a full review while mentioning episodes. It might contain some minor spoilers about what is happening in the episode. If you don't care about what I feel and wanna avoid some spoilers(Honestly I don't think any of the spoilers I wrote can ruin the show) then skip to the very bottom where I give my Summary and reasons why you need to watch this anime.First thing I have to say is that I already watched Aquarion Evol two times before I watched this.(First time I watched it was when I was a kid around 2012, I...didn't know that time that it was actually a sequel since I watched it on air in tv) Second time I watched Aquarion Evol is exactly before I started watching this. Since I already watched Aquarion Evol, I already know the whole truth about Apollo, Sylvia, Sirius, Toma, and even high commander fudo. So that might have killed the first few episodes for me, but thats okay I'm aware that some episodes will be boring for me because they were explaining stuff that I already know so I still sticked to watching it. For the sake of the review I still watched all episodes and it doesn't feel right for me if I skipped some.heads up! this might contain some spoilers!Episode 1-9 like I said was mainly focused about the legend of Aquarion, Atlandia, Apollonius and Celiane. For the record, I still learned some new things even tho I watched Evol already(Since Aquarion evol is focused already about the reincarnations of Apollo and Sylvia/Sylvie, not about Apollonius and Celiane anymore). I can't say I enjoyed 1-9 but it was still interesting because (SPOILER) I always seem to forget the fact that Amata and Mikono and Evol itself is focused on the Reincarnated Love of Apollo and Sylvie, If you watched these already you will understand why I didn't say Apollonius and Celiane.At Episode 10, it felt like the series is finally kicking up but when I got to episode 11 it returned to the bland episodes. At episode 12 Apollo and Sylvia finally got a bit of development. At Episode 13 it got interesting again and gave more development between Apollo and Sylvia it continued till episode 14. At episode 15 it felt like it was boring again not much to say. Now Episode 16 for me felt like a huge turning point for Apollo and Sylvia.Episode 18, probably one of my favorite episodes, not because it have a huge relevance to Apollo and Sylvia but because it was funny. If you understand the characters and their personality this will give you a good laugh too. From there it continued to stay interesting since its already past the Introduction pace(Irrelevant to me because I watched Evol) . There was an episode around this part (I forgot what episode exactly) But it started with this shitty animation and I was really turned off at first. I thought the animator got sick or something or maybe someone else did it. But as the episode progressed it started to make sense. So if your watching/going to watch this keep in mind that the shitty animation is to give an effect of what they are experiencing.Episode 23 Another huge turning point for Apollo and Sylvia and it remains that way further until the end. I have to say that it felt pretty rushed and the pace was really fast in this episode. Around this part of the story(SPOILER) Apollo and Sylvia shipping start to go well and Sylvia finally starts to look at Apollo differently(yes its this late in the series that she kinda admits to herself or atleast show it) Ok so it kinda showed that Sylvia can look at Apollo even if it means she have to defy her brother(Its huge considering she is a huge bro-con, ill get to that later) So it kinda showed the scene where Sirius the brother is inviting Sylvia to join him and his side and Sylvia being a huge bro-con starts to reach out for his hand. Then Apollo stops her by telling her some stuff about dreams and hands Lol. Ok so Sylvia kinda says some stuff that that hand without the feathers is used to hold the hand of someone she cherish(Something like that) then she kinda held hand with Apollo. At this point I was screaming as hell already(not the point).The next remaining episodes the pace remained fast and it actually got faster. (I was legit shocked what happen to their vice commander guy. Ive always thought badly of him but when he said something about acting autonomously I was like woah he is cool at somepoint, then shit happens I was shocked and it felt kinda rushed)If you already watched Aquarion Evol, the finally part of the story is probably too common for you now(Because that scene was shown multiple times in Evol) and thats how I feel. I still felt the series but its no surprise for me already. It still felt a bit rushed for me. But it didn't betray my expectations.Some things I noticed and felt like I need to mention is that, the voices, design of the bodies didn't fit to the age of the characters. Apollo and Sylvia are 13 and 14 if I remember correctly, and Sirius is 16-17. I understand that this anime is pretty old and when it was made this was pretty common. One thing that annoys me is Sylvia being a bro-con. I understand why some characters develop those kinds of feelings(Sis/Bro-con) since I watch a lot of animes that have/or revolves around those, you can say its normal for me to see them. But my point about this is that its not necessary, and the fact that there was no background to that make it feel like its completely random. From what I understand there is no reason for her to be infatuated like that. In some anime there is always a back story about why someone develops an infatuation to their sibling, like for example they are not really related and they kinda got connected already before they even meet as siblings, or the one that develops a crush on their brother or sister is always protected by them because they are lacking something and is getting ignored by their parent. But this series didn't show any of that. From what I understand Sirius is the one that was being isolated or something by his father because he have no memory of being the solar wing that they believe him to be. And they actually compare him to sylvia who have some memories. So if you compare it to other Bro/Sis-con patterns it should be Sirius having infatuations towards sylvia(If she kinda show concern about it). It can be because they are the only ones in their family that is left alive and that could serve as a reason but in the flashbacks it was shown that sylvia is already shows infatuation even before that fire incident. I don't really wanna rant more about this but at this point Mikono(From Evol) actually have more reason than Sylvia to develop a bro-con to Cayenne(Mikono's brother) but she didn't so why does Sylvia have the Complex? still a mystery to me. Further in the series it starts getting faint as she grow closer to Apollo but even till the last episode she still shows signs of it.Summary & Why you need to watchFirst its not all about the mecha, its more about the legend of aquarion that will carry out to Aquarion Evol. Aquarion Evol is in top top top lists of my favorite animes. If you want to watch this anime you need to continue and also watch Aquarion Evol because this alone will look like shit and won't make sense. Its a package you have to watch them both. For me Genesis of Aquarion is just an introduction for the next series(Aquarion Evol). And thats the only reason you need to watch it, so you can watch Evol. Over all the anime is good. Its obviously old and have outdated features but if your looking for a mecha that is different from other common mechas like gundam and code geass then this show is for you, Why? because it have feelings! do gundams have feelings? Nope but an Aquarion does!Edit: The ending is really Iconic for me, it still feels fast but as I said its just the beginning for Apollo and Sylvia love story, because Aquarion Evol covers that.Either way if your going to watch these are the things you need to remember.- Its not just a mecha, its an angel.- the pilots(Elements) have powers so does the aquarion(mecha)- its not about wars about robots, its about love and fighting for it- its not Evangelion, if evangelion is for kids then Aquarion is for Teens- Don't drop the series because its boring at the start. Episode 10, 13 and up is where the story flows differently and more interesting.- Like I said its sorta just like a setup with its own story for Aquarion Evol(Story revolves around reincarnation of Apollo and Sylvia and how their love will continue after 12,000 years) Its the perfect set up so watch it! if you don't then watching this is pointless.Over all this and Evol is really a Beautiful anime. You just need to understand the story and watch them all. didn't know that time that it was actually a sequel since I watched it on air in tv) Second time I watched Aquarion Evol is exactly before I started watching this. Since I already watched Aquarion Evol, I already know the whole truth about Apollo, Sylvia, Sirius, Toma, and even high commander fudo.

At this point I was screaming as hell already(not the point).The next remaining episodes the pace remained fast and it actually got faster. (I was legit shocked what happen to their vice commander guy. Ive always thought badly of him but when he said something about acting autonomously I was like woah he is cool at somepoint, then shit happens I was shocked and it felt kinda rushed)If you already watched Aquarion Evol, the finally part of the story is probably too common for you now(Because that scene was shown multiple times in Evol) and thats how I feel. I still felt the series but its no surprise for me already. It still felt a bit rushed for me. But it didn't betray my expectations.Some things I noticed and felt like I need to mention is that, the voices, design of the bodies didn't fit to the age of the characters. Apollo and Sylvia are 13 and 14 if I remember correctly, and Sirius is 16-17. I understand that this anime is pretty old and when it was made this was pretty common. One thing that annoys me is Sylvia being a bro-con. I understand why some characters develop those kinds of feelings(Sis/Bro-con) since I watch a lot of animes that have/or revolves around those, you can say its normal for me to see them. But my point about this is that its not necessary, and the fact that there was no background to that make it feel like its completely random. From what I understand there is no reason for her to be infatuated like that. In some anime there is always a back story about why someone develops an infatuation to their sibling, like for example they are not really related and they kinda got connected already before they even meet as siblings, or the one that develops a crush on their brother or sister is always protected by them because they are lacking something and is getting ignored by their parent. But this series didn't show any of that. From what I understand Sirius is the one that was being isolated or something by his father because he have no memory of being the solar wing that they believe him to be. And they actually compare him to sylvia who have some memories. So if you compare it to other Bro/Sis-con patterns it should be Sirius having infatuations towards sylvia(If she kinda show concern about it). It can be because they are the only ones in their family that is left alive and that could serve as a reason but in the flashbacks it was shown that sylvia is already shows infatuation even before that fire incident. I don't really wanna rant more about this but at this point Mikono(From Evol) actually have more reason than Sylvia to develop a bro-con to Cayenne(Mikono's brother) but she didn't so why does Sylvia have the Complex? still a mystery to me. Further in the series it starts getting faint as she grow closer to Apollo but even till the last episode she still shows signs of it.Summary & Why you need to watchFirst its not all about the mecha, its more about the legend of aquarion that will carry out to Aquarion Evol. Aquarion Evol is in top top top lists of my favorite animes. If you want to watch this anime you need to continue and also watch Aquarion Evol because this alone will look like shit and won't make sense. Its a package you have to watch them both. For me Genesis of Aquarion is just an introduction for the next series(Aquarion Evol). And thats the only reason you need to watch it, so you can watch Evol. Over all the anime is good. Its obviously old and have outdated features but if your looking for a mecha that is different from other common mechas like gundam and code geass then this show is for you, Why? because it have feelings! do gundams have feelings? Nope but an Aquarion does!Edit: The ending is really Iconic for me, it still feels fast but as I said its just the beginning for Apollo and Sylvia love story, because Aquarion Evol covers that.Either way if your going to watch these are the things you need to remember.- Its not just a mecha, its an angel.- the pilots(Elements) have powers so does the aquarion(mecha)- its not about wars about robots, its about love and fighting for it- its not Evangelion, if evangelion is for kids then Aquarion is for Teens- Don't drop the series because its boring at the start. Episode 10, 13 and up is where the story flows differently and more interesting.- Like I said its sorta just like a setup with its own story for Aquarion Evol(Story revolves around reincarnation of Apollo and Sylvia and how their love will continue after 12,000 years) Its the perfect set up so watch it! if you don't then watching this is pointless.Over all this and Evol is really a Beautiful anime. You just need to understand the story and watch them all."", 'Long ago there was a battle between angels and humans, which ultimately ended with the angels’ retreat. Now, after twelve thousand years, the angels have returned and have begun harvesting humans in order to drain their prana to feed the world tree. A group of gifted teens from around the world are called upon to train and pilot the vector machines known as Vector Luna, Vector Mars and Vector Sol. They must come together to form the ancient mecha known as Aquarion to battle the Shadow Angels.My thoughts:I enjoyed watching this anime. I found the story of reincarnation fascinating. Remembering a long ago past...must seem strange, but the makers of Aquarion pulled it off. Each character has his or her own quirk, but I found Silvia’s brother complex a little too much, but then again I kinda understand it at the end when the Shadow Angel explained Celiane’s separation from herself. I do love the commander Gen Fudou and his strange metaphors that seem to have deep meaning and is always on par with the current situation. Aquarion is always action, there are no boring parts to it, it keeps moving forward and doesn’t stop until the end. The music was great and the animation is very well done. I definitely recommend Aquarion. must seem strange, but the makers of Aquarion pulled it off.

First, anything Shoji Kawamori, I take a look into.  Second, anything with Yoko Kanno doing the soundtrack deserves to be atleast looked into, if not watched with the eyes closed. Third, with their powers combined, I got excited (Escaflowne for eff\'s sake).So after mentioning the above, I had VERY high expectations for this show.  Escaflowne still stands as one of my favorites, but we\'re not reviewing that.  The premise of the show isn\'t anything all that original, with all of the Kawamori usuals, Mecha, Wings, Feathers, underlying romance,...tortured souls, etc.  The first episode showed promise of a fluid story line progression, cliff hangers, action, and suspense.  Sadly, the suspense is only there as a tease, the fluid filler free progression was not there, and the cliff hangers were next to non existant.  MOST of the ""revelations"" were predictable, but not all of them.  Instead, you spend the next 20 episodes learning a ""little bit"" about everyone and their relationships with eachother, usually by the almost direct verbal guidance of the ""Commander"".  You would think with the slow progression of the story that everything would have been explained, but it seems to save the day or end the episode things are discovered or revealed with no explanation or progression. They figure out how to defeat the enemy with the mutterance of the commander, repeating the words in their head, and then CLICK! it\'s all solved. Seconds, literally.  It picks up again around the last 6 episodes or so with a very progressive pace, plenty of action and story, and a bit of a rushed romance developement that ""changes the world"" . The idea wasn\'t all the original, but enough differences and variants I think this could have been done way better.  The animation is top notch for a TV series, the soundtrack is superb, and the comedy was just light enough I wasn\'t annoyed.  ( I like comedy, but not in abundance with a serious plot.) I would say this would have probably been a better series had it been scaled down to 13 or 14 episodes, cut the filler, And left it open. Now if you\'re looking for a show that is mildly entertaining, and you can start and stop and pick up 2 weeks later, this isn\'t a bad casual watch.  I\'ve seen worse by all means.  If I hadn\'t had all the episodes to watch together, I may not have finished it in nearly the same amount of time.  I would reccomend Escaflowne as a better choice, but if you\'re determined to watch Aquarion, watch it first then pick up Escaflowne. tortured souls, etc.  The first episode showed promise of a fluid story line progression, cliff hangers, action, and suspense.

However the show seemed to be unsure of its tone which was all over the place throughout the length of the series, a more dedicated and concrete thematic tone would have elevated this from good to excellent. Nowhere was this more evident than at the end of the series as the ending seemed...strangely out of keeping with the rest of the show (and was also vaguely confusing). I'd like to see it finished off properly in an OVA or film, as long as it didn’t go the route of the (truly awful) Nadesico movie.

Space Adventure Cobra,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2452/Space_Adventure_Cobra,"['This is not your everyday anime movie to watch these days, especially one thats oldskool and special as this one, andhonestly i was inpressed that the traditional anime was left out and a more mature animation was given througout the movie.The story is quite nice and because it was 1982 it was´nt influenced by the macross big spacefights that later anime woud get, but then again it is some sort of space opera, and one worth seeing again, good music there as well. ', '~Mr. Panda\'s VCR of Doom: #5~The movie version of Space Adventure Cobra comes right out of the center of anime\'s intrepid Space Age.  The same year publishing began for the manga versions of Akira and Naussicaa of the Valley of the wind,  Buichi Terasawa\'s name-making series had been serialized for several years, and founded the basis for its continuing popularity with the release of this movie (which was shortly followed by the more manga-accurate version of the TV series.The plot is something of a conundrum, mostly due to confusion as to whether the movie represented a separate part or a ""retelling"" of the...events of the series.  In brief, Cobra and his android partner Lady must assist bounty hunter Jane Flower in preventing the Pirate Guild from controlling an artificial, wandering planet.  Jane is part of a set of triplets (the daughters of the last Queen), and the planet\'s course can only be changed if only one sister is alive or if they ""all love the same man.""  Yes, that\'s right.  I\'m not making this up.I\'ll leave additional details for you to see for yourself.  As a consequence of the plot (and due to the nature of the old school Sci-Fi genre) various instances of cheese occur.  In fact, Cobra is one of the cheesiest Sci-Fi flicks I know of from the 80s.  Mix touching romantic moments in with loss, the fate of the galaxy, and gun-toting action makes for that kind of a flick.  Oh, did I mention the classic psychedelic disco scene on the snow planet?  Inevitably--as a movie version of a much longer story--the plot is not only changed but also compressed.  Occasionally this is obvious, and this may serve as a turn-off for some viewers.For some this may come as a surprise, but as I see it on every other count Cobra is a shining star in the Sci-Fi library.  Early 80s Sci-Fi anime is not reputed for the attention to detail and (dare I say?) beautiful art designs that come as part of this movie.

The characters in Cobra\'s original dub are all voiced well.  The voice of Cobra especially.  The English version, unfortunately (though not unexpected) doesn\'t match-up.  It\'s the more common version  available in the states; and while some of the cast actually fits as far as sound goes, much of the dialogue comes off insincere and thus tends to put the movie down.

Cobra really presents himself as the perfectly balanced character by the end of the movie.

After years of searching, I finally found an Osamu Dezaki anime I liked more than the one with the angsty boy who never does anything and the sweet girl who sings about dangos and ended up dying in the last third because it’s not a touching drama until someone is dead. Now I admit to never seeing any of Dezaki’s non-Key films, let alone finishing any one of his f*cking long series that drag so much that they make me want to throw my hands in the air, turn off the screen, and go hang around on Twitter like an anti-social...nerd. I did notice that almost all of them are franchise films though. Golgo 13? Hamtaro? Black Jack? The only two films he directed that are attached to series he also did are Aim for the Ace and Space Adventure Cobra.The latter is what I’m looking at for in this review and apparently it’s a different interpretation of what happens in the series, but I’m not going to be doing any comparisons as I won’t be finishing the series until the second part gets released in a few weeks and it wouldn’t affect the quality of the film in any way. In other words, it wouldn’t increase nor decrease just how fucking AWESOME it was.I’m no stranger to the Cobra franchise due to watching that revival from a few years back, but in case you guys haven’t seen it (and not many of you jackasses did because you’re awful people who would rather watch a shitty Nodame sequel during that cold dark Winter of 2010) I’ll fill you in.

He has a female assistant named Lady who dresses in some metallic suit and does fuck all, and together they go adventuring across the stars, helping out women dressed in clothing so skimpy you’d probably mistake them for the cast of Highschool DxD - except with blond hair – and fighting bad guys who you know Cobra is going to beat the crap out of, but they’re so varied and entertaining that you don’t give a shit.Most notable of the bad guys is Crystal Boy, who’s basically the Joker to Cobra in that whilst you know he’ll never be able to win, he’s the archenemy of the show that provides a great contrast to our hero due to Cobra’s most powerful weapon not affecting him, having legions of henchmen to do his bidding, and being much more interesting than our main…okay he doesn’t quite reach that level of Joker-dom. But he kicks ass nevertheless.It’s basically pulpy space opera at its best and if you have something against that, then obviously you were born with genes so recessive that it’s a miracle you can operate an electronic device to read this review.Cobra’s adventures pretty much rely on whatever substance is given to him and whether he can chew on it harder than that oversized cigar he always carries in his mouth, and in this particular adventure, the substance given to him is how he deals with “love”. That’s right. Love. A weapon so powerful that Ma-Ti from Captain Planet could use it to cause more damage than all the Smash Ball attacks from Super Smash Bros Brawl combined if the show had been written by someone who knew what AIDs actually was. And not with just one lady. But three. Sisters. It’s the harem anime movie we’ve always wanted, and it was made years before that blasted genre existed.The actual story details elude me, partly because I was too busy admiring Cobra’s muscles and charisma and practically everything that I’d want to be if I was space-travelling - let alone be in real life – and partly because I don’t get what the actual importance of the grand plan was. Apparently those three sisters I mentioned above are the only ones left of some doomed planet and when two of them die or all three fall in love with the same person, that planet gets revived. Whilst I can understand reviving a civilization, I don’t really get what Crystal Boy gets out of it. He becomes ruler or something? He gets enough cash to make Scrooge McDuck weep? He makes his gold metallic body shiny to the point that he’ll have the power to blind his enemies when light refracts off of him? I’ve seen plotlines in Legend of the Galactic Heroes that were easier to understand than this.Also, the whole bounty-hunter sister just disappearing into the other sister because she fell in love with him? Yeah, how does that make sense?The only part I really understood, besides Cobra being the invincible hero who wins in the end obviously, was the way the film deals with the whole romance angle. Cobra and the first sister fall in love. They eventually get separated because of that disappearance mumbo-jumbo I mentioned earlier. The second sister falls in love with Cobra, but he’s not ready to move on so soon and resists. The third sister is brainwashed by Crystal Boy to love him and when she eventually gets free (not a spoiler because that plot point is more predictable than Barney the Dinosaur singing “I Love You” at the end of every fucking episode of that fucking show), she (actual spoiler) rejects the whole love thing and basically dooms her planet so that its power – whatever the fuck that was - can’t be used for evil.Considering that Dezaki is known for directing dramas, I don’t think this was all an accident. I think he purposefully wanted this particular Cobra story to be a metaphor for what Seo Kouji tries and fails to do in every single thing he writes. You see Mr. Kouji, you don’t have to have the most unlikeable people on the planet go through angry misunderstanding after angry misunderstanding for over two-hundred f*cking chapters (which is the equivalent of like a three to four-cour series) to show the pains of first love, moving on, and the final inevitable conclusion. Sometimes, all you need is a flawless guy with a gun for his arm sailing through space on his ship with his lady cyborg fighting men made out of crystal and aliens that would give the one in Star Wars a run for their money. It surprisingly works a lot better than trying to emulate real life. Or not so surprisingly because experience has shown that anything that tries to emulate real life is almost always less realistic than Dragonball F*cking Z.Being a guy who has a soft spot for romance at heart and more love for the whole space western thing than Justin Bieber has for being a massive douchebag, it was pretty much guaranteed I would love this movie. But the icing on the cake that really complements how awesome it is is the animation/art direction. Maybe it’s because I’m used to the shit production of Magic Bus’s revival, but the visuals in this thing blew me away. It doesn’t exactly make you feel like you’re in space, Gravity-style, or anything, but it does a great job of adding atmosphere to the whole shebang beyond just moving pictures. It’s kind of like how we thought the N64′s polygon graphics looked impressive at the time, but when the Gamecube came into town, not only was the eye candy causing us to need glasses 3x faster, but suddenly the opening to Mario 64 causes more nightmares than learning that someone on this godforsaken planet thought it’d be a good idea to make another Garbage Pail Kids film.In other words, go see this movie unless you hate awesome things. You monster! nerd. I did notice that almost all of them are franchise films though. Golgo 13? Hamtaro? Black Jack? The only two films he directed that are attached to series he also did are Aim for the Ace and Space Adventure Cobra.The latter is what I’m looking at for in this review and apparently it’s a different interpretation of what happens in the series, but I’m not going to be doing any comparisons as I won’t be finishing the series until the second part gets released in a few weeks and it wouldn’t affect the quality of the film in any way.

You monster!', 'Serves best as an introduction to the Space Cobra series. A 1982 movie with great visuals that holds up today. Note this movie is a retelling of episodes 1-12 & there are two English dubs to this film: Manga UK & Streamline Pictures. The UK version has a soundtrack done by Yello & various changes in its script. This review covers the Discotek release which should be the Streamline dub.Premiering a few months before its television anime, Space Adventure Cobra: The Movie delivers what you expect in anything Cobra related being; sexy women, stylish visuals, great soundtrack, science fiction & manly action. That being said,...the movie\'s plot is an alternative form of Cobra\'s 1st manga story arc which was adapted in the anime version of that same year.To quickly summarize the story, Cobra is a space pirate with a bounty on his head who comes in contact with a bounty hunter named Jane who then asks for Cobra to rescue her sisters Catherine & Dominique. Along the way, they encounter ""The Guild"" a mafia group filled with space pirates. The movie version has various differences from its manga storyline which in some cases seems almost better than its source material.The main difference is Jane being Cobra\'s main love interest while in the anime it was Dominique, however this is presented better through the newly made up mythology. While the triplet sisters were human in the anime, the film decided for them to be part of this ancient alien civilization who hold the secret to the most dangerous weapon in the galaxy. Their unique traits as a species are lot more explored in the film as it presents this theme of passionate love which at the time was a recurring trend among 80\'s shonens such as City Hunter, Fist Of The North Star & Saint Seiya.Cobra\'s villain, Crystal Boy, also makes an appearance yet he is presented a bit different from his anime counterpart. Crystal Boy is portrayed a bit more sadistic in this film as he tends to make these facial expressions & often having close ups of his read bulging eyes. Another key difference is Crystal Boy not using his signature hook but instead uses his ribs like a spear. Aside from those changes he still remains as threatening & stylish as ever.In terms of visuals, this is a great film as it was directed by Osamu Dezaki who knows how to make eye pleasing scenes. The character designs are improved in this film such as Jane having blue hair to contrast Cobra\'s blonde hair & red jumpsuit. The same goes for Crystal Boy as he looks his best in this film giving a more ""pop art style"". As for Cobra, the only significant change in his design are his boots being black instead of red.Space Adventure Cobra is set in a ""Star Wars like"" world where various aliens & robots inhabit different planets. Cobra himself is a mix of James Bond & Han Solo, although his comedic side isn\'t shown in the film. The movie is a good starting point to get into Cobra & its English dub is good enough, especially in its 90\'s release date. However, I\'ve only seen the Discotek release which contains the Streamline Pictures dub. I\'ve heard its Manga UK release had several changes including dialogue, names, & even soundtrack which too many viewers came off as an odd movie experience.Essentially, it\'s a good movie but serves as a taste for the 1982 anime series ""Space Cobra"" which explores more of its universe & Cobra\'s character. the movie\'s plot is an alternative form of Cobra\'s 1st manga story arc which was adapted in the anime version of that same year.To quickly summarize the story, Cobra is a space pirate with a bounty on his head who comes in contact with a bounty hunter named Jane who then asks for Cobra to rescue her sisters Catherine & Dominique.

It\'s really amazing looking, and features some stunningly creative layouts, choreography and animation for its time. Miyazaki and Dezaki (along with a spry Ryuutarou Nakamura!) are working together here, so it should come as little surprise.I feel it\'s an appropriate time to say that I personally watched this film out of an interest in Osamu Dezaki\'s work, expecting to see a fun and visually spectacular piece of anime. That\'s truly what I got, and I can\'t say I\'m at all disappointed. However, I watched the Ace wo Nerae film with similar intent, and while Ace wo Nerae is a bit...older and not as awesome in the visual department as this is, I rated them about the same because I am far more interested in checking out the story of Ace wo Nerae beyond the film, than I am in the story begun here in this introduction to Cobra. That\'s just me, though.Back to Space Adventure Cobra: It\'s kind of like an 80s Redline without any trace of the latter\'s tongue-in-cheek self awareness as an inheritor of the fun sexy action anime tradition. If we put Cobra on Freud\'s couch, the first things we\'d have to note is that he is constantly playing around with a cigar (dick) and has a massive magical gun (dick) growing out of his elbow. His penis arm is called the psycho-gun. He\'s an utterly silly picture of outmoded masculinity and his life is a ridiculous juvenile fantasy. The hottest babe in the galaxy and the Queen of Miros (who\'s actually three babes in one, scattered in 3 different locations) is in love with him and he has to save 1/3 of her from an evil crystal man named Crystal Bowie (or boy?) with a skeleton made of energy (or something). Crystal Bowie\'s skeleton doubles as a sort of devastatingly powerful armory that he can access by reaching into his own body and pulling his bones out, and he\'s brainswashed the 1/3 of space babe in his possession, Catherine, to be in love with him. Is it not equally suspicious that whenever Cobra makes out with Jane or Dominique, he starts tripping balls and finds himself hopelessly enamored by her? I guess perfect, unearthly beauty is supposed to have that intoxicating effect.The scenarios and characters here are as dweeby by design as the scenery and action are visually dazzling, though they aren\'t totally without a certain cheesy, boyish charm and cutting-edge style. In any case, it fortunately works out that devil-may-care Cobra\'s hidden feelings for Jane/Dominique that he himself doesn\'t seem aware of coincide with ""doing the right thing,"" e.g. destroying the guild before they destroy the galaxy, and preventing Crystal Bowie from ruling the 3 in 1 space babe\'s special home planet of Miros. All this means Cobra gets to fulfill the role of casually disinterested hero that we so love to see. I tell you, the ending I would\'ve preferred would\'ve been if Catherine had been pretending to be under Crystal Bowie\'s control, seeing as how the power of Love allowed Cobra to resist being brainwashed toward the beginning of the film; in turn allowing Catherine to be the one to save the 7th Galaxy. But what are ya gonna do, eh? The story is far more conventional than that, not that it\'s a surprise.I don\'t want to spoil things too badly, but let\'s just say, despite what the characters explicitly say about Cobra\'s feelings for the Triple Waifu Queen of Miros, he doesn\'t really act like he feels all that strongly, even through the very end of the story. Also, I think it\'s pretty clear that the Cobra character ""works better"" as a sort of womanizing space ruffian, and in that sense he certainly doesn\'t undergo a major arc of character development over the course of the series (as a side note, would people remember Kamina as fondly if he lived to love Yoko, or would he have changed too much? I wonder... TTGL is another series this one reminds me of). Fair enough I suppose, since there\'s a lot more story (in the TV series and manga) left to go by the point this film leaves us.In short, you can turn your brain off for this one (and perhaps you should. jk, never turn your brain off. critique everything you see!!) and just enjoy how cool everything looks, and how hot the space babes are if you\'re into those. older and not as awesome in the visual department as this is, I rated them about the same because I am far more interested in checking out the story of Ace wo Nerae beyond the film, than I am in the story begun here in this introduction to Cobra.

Cobra is a Gary Stu. This needs to be said simply because male characters need to be called out just like female characters. Does this mean one can\'t enjoy the movie? No, but it\'s not a bad idea to go into the movie a bit wary.The next thought popping into my head regarding the Anime is how ""that\'s not how love works"". This movie definitely tries playing up the true love angle for...the viewers, yet no matter how the series tries painting the interaction as something more than lust on the part of the characters, what we have is a guy lusting after three hot babes who just so happen to be triplets which is supposed to be one of those wet dreams guys have.I also felt the narrative rather sexist with how the viewer ends up hit over the head regarding how a female protagonist needs a man to save her. We\'ve a brainwashed female, but two females who don\'t know anything but the need to find their true love because they need a man that much. Added, the planet needs a woman of just the right proportions and only one female of these proportions exist - the Queen.Wait! But doesn\'t the lives of these three girls end tragically meaning that the Gary Stu doesn\'t get his happy ending? While your classic Mary Sue often ended up with a happy ending and the guy she wanted the classic Gary Stu often ended up with their love interest dying. After all, that means no kids to tie them down and they can have as many love interests as possible. The dynamics between a Mary Sue and a Gary Stu changed because of differing expectations, but he\'s a Gary Stu none the less.Was there anything enjoyable about this movie? I\'m actually a fan of B-movies, so I loved watching how bad this one was, but I knew this would be one of those rides when I saw the bouncing head earlier on. For me, that made this a lot of fun - but for others - no, not fun at all. the viewers, yet no matter how the series tries painting the interaction as something more than lust on the part of the characters, what we have is a guy lusting after three hot babes who just so happen to be triplets which is supposed to be one of those wet dreams guys have.I also felt the narrative rather sexist with how the viewer ends up hit over the head regarding how a female protagonist needs a man to save her.

Shin Tennis no Oujisama: Hyoutei vs. Rikkai - Game of Future,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41842/Shin_Tennis_no_Oujisama__Hyoutei_vs_Rikkai_-_Game_of_Future,"['I’m still in awe after watching this two-part ONA. I absolutely loved it and it really revived the passion I had for this series. Thank you to Funimation for getting the relicensing rights to the ENTIRE series. Without it, I would have been stuck trying to suffer through VPN-ing into Japan to try and watch it on U-NEXT. I’ll try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible and be as objective as I can.The story is essentially written in a way to close out the entire TeniPuri and ShinTeni series. I’m glad that Komomi was the one writing/supervising the script’s direction. Objectively speaking, the premise...is pretty mid and it’s just your typical “this is the last time I get to play with my senpais” story that you see in every sports anime based in a middle/high school setting. In terms of the story relative to the rest of the TeniPuri/ShinTeni series, it was surprisingly better than I expected. If you knew the backstories to the Hyoutei and Rikkai players, this ONA would be a very exciting watch. If you’ve only recently gotten into the series and haven’t taken in much of the material, asides from the manga and the non-filler anime, this will be a confusing watch. The story itself is set after the events of ShinTeni, so I’m excited to see what direction the rest of the ShinTeni manga will take after the release of this ONA (at the time of airing, ShinTeni is still being serialized in Jump SQ).The visual metaphors for the new techniques were absolutely ridiculous. I knew a lot of it was just Konomi taking the piss out of everything and it was just trying to 1-up the other dumb supernatural techniques that were previously animated. I have to say, the visual metaphors were very well done and I was surprised that it looked this good. The rest of the animation is your standard Production I.G. anime. The CG usage wasn’t offensive. If you’re not looking hard, you wouldn’t even notice it, but there were some times where it bothered me slightly. It was pretty fanservice-y at times, which is fine if you’re into that. It’s pretty unfair of me to compare this ONA to its predecessors, since animation technology has developed a lot since the last OVA released (vs. Genius 10). That being said, if you’ve seen Kuroko’s Basketball and Haikyuu, it’s pretty comparable in terms of the animation. It’s very good for sports anime standards and it’s S-tier for TeniPuri standards.I love the new original character songs that were used for the OPs and EDs. The voice acting in it was probably the best I’ve seen out of all the anime in this franchise. I’ve watched a lot of the livestreams on the TeniPuri Anime channel on YouTube with the VAs discussing the ONA and they all seemed super excited about being able to work on something related to the series again. Suwabe and Nagai were especially good at Atobe and Yukimura, but I have to give my kudos to Morikubo and Iwasaki for their Kirihara and Hiyoshi performances.Overall, this is a great watch if you’re a fan of the TeniPuri series. If you want to get into this series, this might not be the best place to start, but it will give you a glimpse into how ridiculous one of the OG sports manga/anime actually is. Getting into this series will be a lot easier now, thanks to Funimation (and they’re going to redub everything too, which is going to be super interesting to see and I can’t wait to see who they’re going to cast). Hyoutei vs. Rikkai is a 9/10 in my heart. is pretty mid and it’s just your typical “this is the last time I get to play with my senpais” story that you see in every sports anime based in a middle/high school setting.

If you’re not looking hard, you wouldn’t even notice it, but there were some times where it bothered me slightly. It was pretty fanservice-y at times, which is fine if you’re into that. It’s pretty unfair of me to compare this ONA to its predecessors, since animation technology has developed a lot since the last OVA released (vs. Genius 10). That being said, if you’ve seen Kuroko’s Basketball and Haikyuu, it’s pretty comparable in terms of the animation. It’s very good for sports anime standards and it’s S-tier for TeniPuri standards.I love the new original character songs that were used for the OPs and EDs. The voice acting in it was probably the best I’ve seen out of all the anime in this franchise. I’ve watched a lot of the livestreams on the TeniPuri Anime channel on YouTube with the VAs discussing the ONA and they all seemed super excited about being able to work on something related to the series again. Suwabe and Nagai were especially good at Atobe and Yukimura, but I have to give my kudos to Morikubo and Iwasaki for their Kirihara and Hiyoshi performances.Overall, this is a great watch if you’re a fan of the TeniPuri series. If you want to get into this series, this might not be the best place to start, but it will give you a glimpse into how ridiculous one of the OG sports manga/anime actually is. Getting into this series will be a lot easier now, thanks to Funimation (and they’re going to redub everything too, which is going to be super interesting to see and I can’t wait to see who they’re going to cast). Hyoutei vs. Rikkai is a 9/10 in my heart.']"
Wan Jie Xian Zong 5th Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49305/Wan_Jie_Xian_Zong_5th_Season,"[""Its okay. Plot is decent enough. The characters are great except Ye Yan Ran. She takes so much screen time and literally is useless in the fights yet she's glued to the main character shamelessly. Like she literally wants him to protect her every day every min every scene. For a 5 min content, useless comedy sketches with her contributes nothing to the story infact it's annoying repetitions.As for animation, its okay. Fights are decent too specially when Ye Yan Ran is not there. Main character is smart. For me I would not watch this if I had anything else to watch. It's okay for...time pass if you have nothing else. time pass if you have nothing else."", ""Writing a review for all seasons combined (130/176 of this season). A few Spoilers ahead.Story started with promise of a smart but not OP MC who would solve the problems with his wits and careful planning. But with time, all his plans became unfruitful and he gets lucky in most situations. Nowhere has he used half of his brains to defeat his enemies and progress his plans.All his careful plans which took seasons to setup were mostly left ignored like main plot of taking revenge on Emperor Wu and it became story of him facing death multiple times (like literally dying) and then getting lucky...plot armour power ups instead of dying. And all this time he never learnt any lesson and kept repeating same mistakes like fighting much powerful enemies without any planning, letting his secrets leaked, leaving his enemies alive after defeating them, etc.As if this wasn't bad enough, the episodes are full of fillers with no contributions to plot and MC showing off his brains for no reason at wrong places. Fights are short lived with no brains involved there as well. Cultivation progress is also random, he stayed at same level for 4 season, then broke 5 levels within 10 episodes, like wtf?And after ascending why does he need to hide his identity as Ye Qingyun? better go back to his old identity.

Tetsuwan Atom,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2747/Tetsuwan_Atom,"[""Created in 1952, Osamu Tezuka revolutionized american cartoons forever when Astro Boy came to our American televisions in 1963.

One of my personal favorites, Astro Boy will definitely be a favorite to kids for a long time to come."", 'I was around 9 when I first watched the first 10 episodes of Astro Boy on VHS. I had no idea at the moment that it was the 80’s remake of an older show, which in turn was actually a legend in the field as it revolutionized how anime look and feel decades before we had the internet to hype everything with little effort. And here I am some decades later myself, making a small essay on the damn thing. You may have heard from time to time about a series that begat a whole new genre, such as Tetsujin-28 being the first mecha series...that began the trend. Other times you may have heard about a series that defined a whole generation, such as Dragonball Z being the most renowned series of the 90’s. Well, Tetsuwan Atom is THE series that begat and defined ALL anime. Why? Because it is the VERY FIRST anime tv series ever made!There are of course older animated movies that were made in Japan, way before Atom. The anime was made in mid 60’s the manga was around a decade older, but there already were animated features made even as back as 1910. The thing is all those cannot really be called anime in the traditional sense because the style of animation was not the same and neither were its themes to the most part. You see, up until the 1950’s, animation and graphics were made to look in a very Japanese way to the most part. If you look for classical paintings of Japan’s past, you will find a lot of pictures that depict their way of artistic expression, up until that time. Their trademarks were the almost extinct perspective and the expressionless faces of the people, which were very realistic and reminiscent of the average Asian morphology. Many short features were copying the style of the west of course but those were still seen as foreign influences, not traditional in the broader sense. Also, all western-looking characters of that time were all anthropomorphic animals, while human figures were kept Asian-looking all the way.When Japan lost in World War 2, the new generation tried to get stronger by mimicking the winning side and amongst them was Osamu to try something entirely new. He made his humanoid character to resemble western cartoon characters, which allowed emotions to be a lot more expressive compared to the emotionless faces of the earlier Asian-looking caricatures. He basically took pointers from Walt Disney and gave his characters huge eyes and easily distinguishable grimaces. Also he allowed for dark themes to be explored instead of being silly fairy tales or war propaganda.Obviously you can’t judge the show based on its visuals because they are as outdated as they can. There is no color, the animation is super choppy and cartoony-looking characters are off-putting for most even today (look how much One Piece suffers because of it). What you should instead focus on is how much passion and energy was thrown into it at a time when budgets were super small and there wasn’t an audience of tens of millions who would nag on the internet over 5 seconds of someone not wearing his jacket in a fluent enough way. Also keep in mind how artistic and mature it was for the time it came out despite being a show for kids. Lots of dark and depressing themes are explored in it and the outcome is not always “they lived happily ever after”.The protagonist (and essentially the only character you get to care for) is Atom (or Astro in the dub), a human boy who was killed and was then replaced by a humanoid robot. Seen as a replacement for his creator’s dead son and potentially a powerful weapon, Atom practically fails at both the prime purposes he was made for. His body doesn’t age like a human so his father does not see him as a son and his feelings constantly prevent him from ruthlessly obeying orders from megalomaniac leaders who want to use his advanced weaponry for war. At the same time he is made to care about everything and everyone, using his abilities to protect what he cares for. Every episode is a test of strength or courage Atom faces in a mechanized, and rather dangerous and deprived society. He faces people with cruel hearts and inhuman behaviors, but is also aided by good-hearted people and robots. Every episode features a battle with an evil robot or human that attacks an area or goes against Atom’s moral code. Sometimes he is forced to fight a battle he finds unnecessary (taking orders and such) but does so anyway, just to prove himself useful. Although “too goody” as a character you still see how he is tormented by social norms and he can’t always please everyone.The premise is inspired by classic stories such as Pinocchio, Frankenstein, and Metropolis, and criticizes the dehumanizing factor of technology. It obviously does it in a very light and episodic way, so it won’t mean much once you get accustomed to the dark sci-fi anime of the late 70’s and beyond. There have been countless shows that dealt with the same themes and with far better visuals, such as the Ghost In The Shell franchise. One could even say that Neon Genesis does the exact same with the relationship Gendo Ikari and Rei have, which is homage to the one Dr. Tenma and Atom have in this show.Astro Boy is practically surpassed on every field by a show that followed it, but that doesn’t change the fact it was the original inspiration for all anime of the future. Atom’s special attacks are classic mecha weaponry, the big eyes are a staple of the medium, and exploring the dark side of societies is a very interesting theme to this day. It’s not like the franchise died either, as remakes of the show are still being made today with Pluto being the most recent one. Atom’s legacy never died, it just got surpassed and overshadowed by its contemporaries. It’s still the foundation of all anime in general and as such deserves to be remembered, at least as an important historical footnote. that began the trend.

With an ambitious project devoid of a high production budget, Osamu Tezuka pioneered production methods like limited animation, use of recycled footage, and outsourcing animation work when there was hardly any precedent to learn from. Especially early on, this was in many ways an experiment, and it cannot be viewed under the same critical lens as even subsequent 60s works.In its most basic premise, Tetsuwan Atom has...the titular character thrown into various dangerous situations involving human extremists, rampaging robots, mad scientists conducting dangerous experiments, and even alien creatures. While shallow on the surface, Atom frequently contends with complex issues such as coexistence between humans and robots, ecology, war, grief, and revenge. The anime rarely gets too deep into the philosophical aspects of those deeper issues, but they at least leave some questions open to the viewer, which help keep it engaging despite a somewhat generic “monster of the week” formula.Similarly to the manga, the animated series is episodic and most episodes adapt a single story, with a handful of more ambitious two-parters in the second half of the broadcast. Episode directors and scriptwriters rotated frequently, and the influence of directors such as Rintarou, Yoshiyuki Tomino, Osamu Dezaki, Eiichi Yamamoto and Osamu Tezuka himself in their respective works is obvious. For example, Yamamoto-directed episodes often have a dramatic and sometimes melancholic tone compared to the rest of the series, a penchant which he maintains in his later works and is most evident in episodes 52 (雪ライオン) and 71 (地球最後の日). On the other hand, Tomino-led episodes vary in tone, but commonly diverge from the typical formulaic structure of the series; episode 139 (盗まれたアトム) is structured as a musical comedy, while the popular Blue Knight (青騎士) story, adapted in episodes 179-180, makes clever use of the opening crawl technique for dramatic effect. These episodes, and others molded by young directors who would go on to become household names in the industry, tend to be the highlights of the series, while episodes produced by committee or by lesser-known directors have fewer idiosyncratic and interesting qualities.Two episodes were notably produced in color, which was unheard of for a TV anime series at the time, as monochrome broadcasts and TV sets were still the norm; one (episode 56, 地球防衛隊) was fully colored and the other (the aforementioned episode 71) was partially tinted for a muted, contemplative tone. They were later screened in theaters as a compilation film, where audiences were able to view them in color. A handful of episodes also have missing original footage. Some were restored from secondary copies, while others (unfortunately including episode 139) are presented in audio form with restored stills and/or storyboards where they exist.Production quality improves noticeably over the years. Early 1963 episodes, barring some exceptions like episode 1, use recycled footage liberally and motion is minimized to accommodate the rushed production. Still, some interesting cuts pop up here and there even early on, and the background art is generally superior to the average modern-day TV anime, especially in episodes taking place in foreign locales on Earth. It does take some time to get used to the cheap animation style, which makes sparse use of in-between frames early on, though it becomes noticeably more fluid as the series progresses.Music is mostly limited to a small set of familiar tracks and character themes which are simple but effective. More notably, the distinctly otherworldly sound effects were largely made by Matsuo Ohno, who was featured in a 2011 documentary about his work on the series called The Echo of Astro Boy’s Footsteps (アトムの足音が聞こえる). While he did not have an extensive career in film and anime, his synthesized soundscape of space likely inspired other composers in the field for years to come.On average, Tetsuwan Atom is not always compelling, but it is remarkably consistent given the environment in which it was produced. Even episode 34 (ミドロが沼), which was outsourced to Studio Zero and became a legendary production disaster that allegedly led Osamu Tezuka himself to destroy the original film, is surprisingly watchable. Unfortunately, many episodes feel “samey” and directed by the numbers. Only about a fourth to a third of the series merits a discerning viewer’s attention. Despite this, experiencing the series in its entirety offers a unique view on the process of experimentation and refinement that took place over the four-year runtime of an industry pioneer, and provides important context for evaluating its followers. Most compelling is the possibility to view the first directorial works of many highly respected directors, many of which are genuinely engaging.

Vampire Knight Guilty,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4752/Vampire_Knight_Guilty,"['StoryBetter than season 1, but still dismal.  I liked Yuki\'s post-traumatic stress behavior, which was the reason I gave this season a try.  It was a relief having her emotions at the forefront, instead of the previous season where she was constantly consoling the suicidal Zero.  I usually enjoy heroines in torment, but they didn\'t do much with it.  She continued obsessing over Zero and repeating the phrase, ""I cannot hurt Zero any more than this"" in her monotonous internal dialogues.  She also kept on chasing after Kaname, begging him to tell her about her past.  This dragged on...WAY too long.  I can take only so many scenes of Yuki crying and pounding her fists against his chest while he goes, ""Yuuki,"" in his sad voice.  Unlike season 1, there was some buildup to the final events, the villain was decent, and there was some resolution.  However, the story was so boring and the characters\' behavior so repetitive that by the climax, I just didn\'t care.ArtThe art was similar to season 1.  Decent, nothing special.  I was disappointed but not surprised by the cheesiness of the monsters and the lameness of the fight scenes.  One treat was how cute Chairman Kaien was once he let down his hair and took off his glasses.SoundAnother excellent soundtrack.  Just for the music, suffering through the two seasons was worthwhile.  I hate the intro, but the ending theme makes up for it.CharacterYuki was unbearable.  She was as weak as ever, but much more intent on protecting everyone, even though she had ABSOLUTELY no capacity for doing so.  Watching her chase after the villain and put herself in danger was really irritating, especially because she endangered a lot of Kaname\'s lackeys in the process.  Kaname did improve somewhat; he was less opaque and we finally understood his attachment to Yuki.  Zero and Ichirou also gained some depth.  The twins may have been the most powerful, compelling plot element in the entire show.EnjoymentThey shouldn\'t have raised our expectations that Yuki would become strong if they weren\'t going to deliver.  They did nothing with her being the guardian.  If the main focus was the love triangle, then they should have put WAY more attention on developing the two relationships.  Yuki spent a lot of time with Kaname and Zero, but she didn\'t connect with Kaname until the end, and her scenes with Zero were just angsty melodrama.  I can\'t remember a single romantic scene in either season that I would rewatch, and I\'m usually pretty enthusiastic about corny shoujo moments.OverallI\'m truly shocked by this show\'s popularity.

It was due to my positive opinion of Vampire Knight that led to me to Vampire Knight Guilty and hence my judgement cannot make dichotomies of the two (so I hope you don't mind me making reference to Vampire Knight).As you'll probably know, VKG continues right where VK left off, retaining much of VK's good qualities at first. The characters from VK/VKG are very well-built and generally three-dimensional enough for me as an audience to relate to and hence enjoy, with the exception of Kaname-kun, who was so perfect...in his prestige, power and popularity that there was no room for him to be anything but an admirable and incomprehensible figure.The artwork itself was generally quite well-done, although I felt the quality didn't follow through towards the end of VKG. In terms of sound, nothing stood out as being special but nevertheless, it complimented the plot and character developments.The one thing that I really want to talk about is the storyline. The reason why VK was excellent in my opinion was its plot. The flow of the story introduces audience to a very different and intriguing world of vampires, and as you journey through the plot progression, mysteries of the world and its creatures unravels itself through introduction of new characters, philosophies and events, that spices up and quenches curiosity of the world whilst requiting the audience a greater interest in knowledge of vampires and their existence.And so VKG begins with this highly anticipated and built-up plot where most branches of side and main plots from VK was left wide open. However, as the story progresses in VKG, the pace of the story really dies down. Excluding a few snippets of fair back stories to some of the supporting characters, the main plot really felt mundane and hard to trudge through.Due to an overly pretentious overemphasis on subtle foreshadowing, the climax of VKG comes about in a very poor, but surprising way, which in its own was interesting. VKG was on a road to revival, bringing back the essences that made its preceder a success. Inevitably, due to lack of pacing in the story, VKG ran out of time to wrap up properly, failing to arrive at the respectable conclusion that VKG's climax opened up for. In all honesty, the conclusion simply felt rushed, as if the writers just ran out of time and whipped up a mediocre ending and forgot about all these other things.Having enjoyed VK, it really was a pity that VKG did not follow through. VK felt like it created so much potential for VKG, who grabbed a single point of interest and neglected the rest of VK's successful elements. To sum VKG up, it centralises on one element of a good script, then patched a drawn-out and repetitive build up to its front and a short and undermined continuity to its back.It was not bad, but the fact that it was a mere shadow of its former annoys me, and so I give it a 6/10 (it's simply my opinion).Nevertheless, if you have seen VK, watch VKG with an open mind. (I don't take into account that I wasn't in it for a fanciful, mystical tale about pretty boys, which was part of what VK/VKG was marketed to be.) in his prestige, power and popularity that there was no room for him to be anything but an admirable and incomprehensible figure.The artwork itself was generally quite well-done, although I felt the quality didn't follow through towards the end of VKG.

Inevitably, due to lack of pacing in the story, VKG ran out of time to wrap up properly, failing to arrive at the respectable conclusion that VKG's climax opened up for. In all honesty, the conclusion simply felt rushed, as if the writers just ran out of time and whipped up a mediocre ending and forgot about all these other things.Having enjoyed VK, it really was a pity that VKG did not follow through. VK felt like it created so much potential for VKG, who grabbed a single point of interest and neglected the rest of VK's successful elements. To sum VKG up, it centralises on one element of a good script, then patched a drawn-out and repetitive build up to its front and a short and undermined continuity to its back.It was not bad, but the fact that it was a mere shadow of its former annoys me, and so I give it a 6/10 (it's simply my opinion).Nevertheless, if you have seen VK, watch VKG with an open mind. (I don't take into account that I wasn't in it for a fanciful, mystical tale about pretty boys, which was part of what VK/VKG was marketed to be.)"", ""Note: Vampire Knight Guilty is a direct continuation of Vampire Knight more so than a sequel, so it is necessary to watch Vampire Knight first to truly understand Vampire Knight Guilty.  This review is only based on Vampire Knight Guilty.Story:  Vampire Knight Guilty is very much a traditional shoujo series about forbidden love.  However, through the inclusion of vampires, the series takes on a bit more of a gothic feel which is heavily relied on to hold the viewer's interest.  The story is mainly told from the point of view from the female protagonist, Yuuki, and her inner turmoil about her...past and her feelings about the two male main characters, a vampire Kaname and a vampire hunter Zero, are the main driving forces behind the story.  The story is also sometimes told from a third-person perspective, allowing the viewer to know details that Yuuki does not.  While the story in itself is quite good and probably one of the best gothic romance animes out there, due to the switching of perspectives, the plot pacing can sometimes feel excruciatingly slow and often very repetitive.  Yuuki continuously tries to tackle the same issues internally episode after episode to the point where it becomes very redundant; the actual story moves along much better when it is not dwelling on Yuuki's thoughts.   This also creates a conflict in the main point of the story, since it sometimes emphasizes the mystery shrouding Yuuki and the other main characters and other times seems to try to hold the viewer solely by building up (almost uneccessary) romantic tension to keep the viewer watching to see which character Yuuki will end up with.Short version: The story is conflicted in a way that it sometimes tries to be a mystery/suspense anime and other times simply a gothic shoujo/romance.  7/10Art:  The main character designs are lovely for shoujo and done very well' some character features are a bit too over-exaggerated (Yuuki's eyes being one example), but this kind of character design is fairly normal for the shoujo genre. The background is also illustrated nicely and gives off a bit of an eerie feeling to lend to the gothic mood the anime is trying to create.  However, sometimes there are inconsistencies in the animation, many still frames, and skimping out on the details of background characters.  For the most part, this can be overlooked because the actual art direction is done very well, showing the right images at the right times.  Someone with a scruitinizing eye will definitely pick up on the flaws, but a casual viewer probably won't.  One flaw of sorts that almost any viewer would immediately pick out is the rather boring ending sequence that looks like it was thrown together in five minutes.Short version: Nice shoujo character designs and animation, but definitely not the best out there.  7/10Sound:  This is where Vampire Knight Guilty excels.  Although the opening song is nice, but nothing to rave over, the ending song by Wakeshima Kanon is excellent and really gives the series an extra nudge into the gothic genre.  The sound effects are also nicely done, as well as the background music which also gives the anime a rather eerie feeling, reminding you that you are watching something a bit darker than your average shoujo romance.  The voice acting overall is great, but it is Miyano Mamoru (Best Actor in the Seiyuu Awards of 2008 for Setsuna from Gundam 00) that really does an outstanding job by voicing two charcters, twins, and giving them their own distinct nuances.  Really excellent work.  8/10Character: The main characters are all round, very well-developed characters for a shoujo romance, although their development is done in a way that negatively impacts the pacing.  The anime almost forces you into their heads to experience thr emotions of certain characters, particularly in Yuuki's case, while leavin other characters in an air of mystery.  You wouldn't be able to miss an instant of what Yuuki's thoughts and emotions are even if you tried.  On the other hand, not everything is given to you on a silver platter, other characters remain much more mysterious and it is up to the viewer to try to unravel the mystery behind those characters themselves.  It's a very stark contrast, but it works very well for the series.  8/10Enjoyment:  If you are looking for a shoujo anime overflowing with romance, this show will definitely hook you.  It is filled with forbidden love, love-triangles, anguish, angst, unrequited love... just about any element you can think of that fits into the genre.  However it is unique in its dark atmosphere.  If you are looking for a shoujo anime and like the added bonus of a gothic edge and a bit of mystery, this is definitely the show to watch and would get a 10/10 in that regard.  On the other hand, if you are looking for something that is more solely along the lines of suspense or supernatural  without all the angsty romantic flare, give this one a pass.Overall:  An enjoyable, well-animated and produced show that definitely stands out in the shoujo genre as something a bit more unique than others.  The added gothic edge and use of mystery will hook the lovers of the shoujo genre even more and probably pick up other casual viewers as well, since overall the show is better than your run-of-the-mill anime love story.  7.5/10   But, if you aren't a fan of the shoujo genre in the slightest and not interested in romance animes, you will want to give this one a pass.  Although the show does contain a bit of mystery, suspense, and vampires, the main emphasis is undoubtedly romance, and there is no way to disregard that shoujo romantic factor in this anime to just enjoy it for the mystery and suspense it contains. past and her feelings about the two male main characters, a vampire Kaname and a vampire hunter Zero, are the main driving forces behind the story.

I don't normally affiliate with the genre, and this series reminded me why. The abrupt ending of Zero's affection for Yuuki given the circumstances involving her having been a pure blood vampire this entire time was nothing short of a kick in the teeth. To watch 26 full episodes of them going back and forth with...each other in one of the most twisted and abusive love triangles I have ever seen, only to find in the end because Yuuki was never who Zero thought she was he can no longer love her?Admittedly there is some bias to my words. I preferred Zero over Kaname only because the latter of the two was a self absorbed prick who's soul intent was roughly the same as Zero's later on in the series. I don't really feel that the story for both the manga and the anime were all that in depth as so many things could have been done to prevent the overall conclusion, everything just seemed to happen because one vampire wanted to be strong. For some reason, however, no one ever thought to band up and kill him all at the same time? And why exactly did he need to drink Yuuki's blood?Overall, a very bad series that sadly had great potential. each other in one of the most twisted and abusive love triangles I have ever seen, only to find in the end because Yuuki was never who Zero thought she was he can no longer love her?Admittedly there is some bias to my words.

Mostly because it is the continuation of Vampire Knight, but also because it's more developed than Vampire Knight and contains a better story. It's not that I didn't like the story to Vampire Knight, but that I like the story to Vampire Knight Guilty better.Story: You know, the story here it's good. And I have told you that I liked the VKG (Vampire Knight Guilty) better than VK (Vampire Knight) It's, I find, very well thought-out. Like any other anime that is based on a manga, it follows the manga, though not always the...same. (It is in this case, but anyways.) The main subject really is about a love that can't happen; in this case between humans and vampires, friend and friend's enemy. Well, really, it's Zero and Yuuki, or Yuuki and Kaname, as the way I see it. It doesn't drag on like some of the animes I've watched, which usually makes the viewer get bored of the series and looses interest in the anime/manga. That has happened to me millions of times, but because this one gets to the point, or, just a lot of things happen in just a short while, and everytime we get to a better and better plot. That is one of the things you'll definitely like about VKG.Art: I find the guys have a bit of a feminine feature to them; particularly their eyes, which are basically just a smaller version of a female's, and the small curve when they wear their uniforms. Their faces are very.. pointy, may I say, at the end and actually just gives me a feminine vibe. Their hair is usually long, though some of them are shorter but is long, like most of manga guys. Most, not all, because some of them actually have short hair, like Naruto. But in this case, Zero, Kaname, Shiki, Ichijou, and a lot of other people have longer hair than usual. I find the eyes to the girls, which are what I find an enlarged version of the males', are a bit haunting. They have that weird impression, and it gives you the feeling that there really are vampires in this world. It just suits the main subject of this story; vampires.Sound: It's good, I guess. I'm not one to judge about sound; but I find the openings and endings do fit the series, however. Also about the voices, it's okay. I don't really care about the voices, as long as they actually make sense, but I doubt someone will make an anime with voices that don't make sense.Character: This is where I'll rant. I don't like Yuuki's character. She's too innocent. And every guy seems to just want to flirt with her or something. Kaname loves her, in some way, and Zero; and if you notice, in one point of the story, Hanabusa is quite the flirt, too. It just seems that it's unfair to the other girls in the Night Class, plus the Day Class students. (But I don't really care about the Day Class students because they aren't REALLY critical to the story,) I'm not saying that they all love her the way Kaname and Zero like her, but everyone in the Night Class, males I mean, have a particular liking to her. They either want something to do with her, or regularly talk to her. Like, I'm not saying Akatsuki Kain wants to get married with her. I'm just saying that they have a particular liking to her. I'm glad Shiki isn't really, or actually not at all, having a liking to Yuuki. The girls in the Night Class are pretty well-made, too. Rima's character is my particular favourite, since she's mysterious and she's cute at the same time. Ruka is a strong girl, I know it, even though I dislike her... but only a bit.Enjoyment: I enjoy everything I see, really. If I don't like it, I'm not really going to watch it. That's the kind of person I am. Don't like it, don't care about it. I'm not going to review, or something else.Other than that, I enjoy watching this anime 'cause it keeps catching my attention.

The series is set in a school that caters to both vampires and humans that are separated into the night and day classes respectively. The story revolves around a girl whose first memories she can remember is being attacked by a vampire and being saved by a pureblood vampire which is the highest rank. She starts to harbour feelings for both her good friend and vampire hunter Zero as well as the pureblood who...saved her which is currently in the school.I think the story was quite original from the usual vampires and stuff. Incorporating the shuojo genre very well. That is probably the main genre of ths series. Coupled with a bit of action here and there, suspense, drama and mystery to create a fairly good series. There are good twists in the show and the story is not so cliche in terms of the relationships between characters. However, the show can be rather dark at times, so if you prefer something more lightheated,comedic than prehaps this won't be the best choice of anime for you. Plot wise it may be a bit cliche, and don't expect heavy suspense or drama.The art incorporates the typical shuojo style of drawing characters with big eyes and bishiounen(pretty boys). not necessarily the best i've seen but still of a decent quality.The background is mostly dull to help enhance the dark theme in tisi show.The voice actors did a good job. Each voice fitting the characters perfectly. The OP and ED songs contribute to the gothic theme of the show. background music now and then also helps to enhance the atmosphere.

However, this does not apply to Vampire Knight Guilty. Almost in every category VKG was better than VK. The only thing I liked more in 1st season was OST. Music was good in VKG too, but not as fitting the mood of the story as the VK one.What was 1st season lacking the most, was not enough character introduction in my opinion. I was rather disappointed that only Zero's past was showed and explained while Kaname's and Yuuki's was left unknown. After watching VKG I can understand why didn't show their past in VK. It does...make sense and it was a good decision.So yeah, we finally got to see their pasts, which also lead to see some better character development as well. If Yuuki was rather annoying and useless in VK, then in VKG she changed almost completely. At the beginning she still wasn't very contributing and as always Zero, Kaname or other Vampires had to take care of her, but she start to grow as a character in my eyes. Of course, that sudden event changed a lot, but she was already getting stronger before it.On the other hand, I wasn't really expecting to see Kaname's true colors, but surprisingly we did get to see that. I thought he will be used as a mysterious character till the end, but here we got his past, we know why he's so caring about Yuuki and what are his future plans. I believe it was really well done, good timing I mean to do it. It was definitely shocking... I found his past even more harsh than what Zero had. No wonder Kaname was always so distant from everyone.Vampire Knight Guilty in my eyes were already better when introduced antagonist early in the show instead of at last episodes like in VK. Although I wish he had more screen time. He did get more than enough screen time in the flashbacks, but a bit disappointing how short we got to see him in action during the current time. Yet, I am not really complaining about this as usually fights that take long are just irritating... I am not really fond of shows who drag fights, so I was rather happy how everything happened in VKG.As I have already mentioned, the music wasn't as good as in Vampire Knight. However, I am not gonna lie, it was still very good. I gave 9/10 and only not a 10, because I know that it could have been better (VK as example). The whole OST was playing the right mood that characters of the series contained, so that was a great addition to the series.To sum up, the VKG has definitely exceeded my expectations. I can honestly say that it's the first shoujo anime to me that was able to include some mystery and supernatural genre's very well. Another great thing about this anime is that it was unpredictable. Till the very end wasn't sure who will Yuuki choose if she will choose that is.Whether it was helpful or not, please do not hesitate and give me feedback ^^ I do want to improve writing reviews.

Thank you for reading!"", 'I ask you not to read this review if you have not seen the whole anime. Understand? Understood.Ok, then, Holy Mary, this anime has been a pile of cheap psychological rubbish. Let\'s start with Yuuki who always finds a way to faint and to apologize every time. Seriously, this girl is not repetitive, it\'s a broken record. I realized that Yuuki has to do stupid things so that she can be more submissive than the two guys who want her for them. This girl is a lost case and I am sorry to have to say it but she cannot understand that Kaname knows more...about the devil and every time she tries to rebel against that fool, then she comes out with a: ""I\'m sorry, Kaname-sama!""I mean, come on! But how can you make a female character so bad? Let\'s not talk about the fact that Zero becomes Kaname\'s bitch. You have a serious character like Zero, a vampire hunter who is cool like no other, yet for some reason ends up depending on Kaname. Zero literally becomes another pawn in the large chessboard of that incestuous vampire. In just one season, Zero\'s dignity disappears.Kaname is Yuuki\'s brother.A moment of silence.

You lied and you know it.Kaname is Yuuki\'s older brother and wants to marry her so that he has a vampire offspring that has pure blood. Damn! Yuuki really had a difficult choice to make (sarcasm). After she was vampirised, she had to choose whether to have a story with Zero, the guy with whom she grew a healthy romantic relationship, or to have a story with Kaname, her older brother who manipulated her for two whole seasons. Tough choice, huh?In the end, Vampire Knight is simply a mediocre anime on vampires. about the devil and every time she tries to rebel against that fool, then she comes out with a: ""I\'m sorry, Kaname-sama!""I mean, come on! But how can you make a female character so bad? Let\'s not talk about the fact that Zero becomes Kaname\'s bitch. You have a serious character like Zero, a vampire hunter who is cool like no other, yet for some reason ends up depending on Kaname. Zero literally becomes another pawn in the large chessboard of that incestuous vampire. In just one season, Zero\'s dignity disappears.Kaname is Yuuki\'s brother.A moment of silence.

had some amazing suspense, great cliffhangers and had a lot of twists, and even for how steriotypicaly emo zero was they handles him very well and he came off like a selfless teen that was willing to let him suffer and even die a slow painful death if he had to, to save yuuki or his father and even just people in general, and his hatred for vampires and yet him being one realy built up his charecter, why am i mentioning this,...well i mentioning it cause zero is hardly even in the second season, and heres where the show starts to take a sudden downturnthis seaosn focused very much on kaname and yuuki, and befor ei go off i have to mention this, this show has the absoulte WORST TWIST EVER, you wont see it coming but when they reveal what it is and what they continue to do after words is just WTF worthy, but back on topic the show focuses much more kaname and yuuki, now this would of been the chance to make kaname more likable caus ein the first serise he is a total asshole that steals the spotlight and acts very high and mighty, basicly hes a asshole and the first time i saw guilty i though he was the villian cause they make him much much worse, he does some dasterdly things and he just come soff as evil till the very end and even then he still seems like he\'d fuck over everyone for his own goal, which is protecting yuuki but his logic is ""ill kill everything but yuuki"" so yah kaname may have somehow become even more worse, yuuki isnt any different from the first serise at alland heres the biggets problem with guilty, theres no suspense, every build up leads to a let-down, a cop out, or they just drop the plot point all together, they build up this one villian who lasts about 20 seconds of fighting, i wish i were kidding, the show just doesnt have any good cliffhangers either and for a lack of a better word its just boring, not to sound like a fanboy/girl but when zeor comes in the show does get better, mainly cause some very emotional things happen and you want this guy to get what he wants but he has everyone int he world agianst him, ide say if it werent for scenes of zero and his brother the sow would have been a 4,the actual ending does leave not really a cliffhanger but leaves alot of things open for the inevitable season 3, its a good ending and i want to see what happens next the ending fight is a letdown but the actual ending while not satisfying will leave you wondering what happens next, the next season really needs to work on making yuuki less of a idiot, make kaname stop doing worse things the actual villians do then season 3 wil lbe good. fingers crosse dit will work outalso before i leave i just have to comment on how dated and lazy this shows animaiton is, it seriously looks like its from 2003, whenever

But that is nothing compared to the second season, Vampire Knight Guilty.I must say, I expected this to get better, but it actually got appallingly worse. I tried to be fair with it, but when I look at it overall, it was just awful. The story barely made sense, the characters didn't have any development, and even if they did, it was really difficult to notice. It seems the creators got lost in trying to...create something ambiguous, and 'cool' and misplaced the actual plot.All of the minor characters seemed to want bigger parts, but, (for some reason) couldn't seem to 'budge their way in' going by the strange relationship with Yuki, Kaname, and Zero taking up a lot of the confusing screen time, and ended up getting written off.

Though, not long after he resumes his role, members of the Supreme Vampire Council ambush Zero with the intent to execute him for the murder of the pureblood, Shizuka. Luckily when Kaname intervenes, he sends the council away and insists that they stay out of school affairs. However, whilst Kaname continues to hide the truth about Shizuka's death, there are others who grow suspicious of what happened that night and what the dorm president is hiding. Meanwhile, Yuuki begins to have flashbacks, leading her to investigate...her blood-stained past: what will she find, and will she continue to be tempted by an offer from Kaname?Now on to the review and I hope you and enjoy reading this review and I hope it helps you's in anyway. Aha, late to the party I know. Anyways, lets get started:Story (7/10)Built upon a sturdy foundation of shoujo clichés and pretty animation, Vampire Knight Guilty is a lot of fun without being particularly elegant. Moreover, as the second instalment in a successful dark shoujo series, it brings the story of mysterious vampires and tragic love to an agreeable conclusion.For most, VKG’s main attraction will always be its contrivances, clichés, and ham-handed delivery of the romance. Consider the corniest scene involving vampires possible (OMG he licked her neck! *squeal*), then set it to repeat across several episodes. Throw in hints of homoeroticism for extra tang and some half-baked lore, and VKG gives the impression that it’s not so much animated as churned. Indeed, the series makes no claim to originality or wit, but it manages its cheese surprisingly well, and, on balance, turns out to be more interesting than irksome.Nevertheless, buried amongst all the silly love triangle stuff, there’s still that core of well-executed mystery keeping the story afloat. Crucially, VKG knits together much of the political threads left hanging by the first season: after lurking in the shadows so long, the Vampire Council finally takes centre stage, as does a newly kick-arse Headmaster Cross, and Kaname’s true intentions become clear in a gasp-worthy twist.One true disappointment, however, is that, despite wishing to portray a violent clash between the various factions, VKG’s battles look and feel anything but. The static sequences are usually over before they’ve begun, and attempts at spicing things up with flashy gimmicks just look forced. Even the finale can’t escape this flat-lining of tension as everything generally happens too fast and too easily.As a final note, ardent fans of the manga should brace themselves for a slight but significant reinterpretation of Zero at the end. No doubt, it will send a few spitting in rage.Art (7/10)Like Vampire Knight, VKG looks very pretty, with lush colours and attractive character designs perfectly catered towards the shoujo lovers. Regrettably, it also adopts VK’s disregard for movement. While VK is predominantly drama-based, VKG relies on fighting sequences during some of its climactic moments; the insufficient number of frames, straightforward camera angles, and uninventive choreography, therefore, only lessen their impact.Sound (7/10)The cheap pop opening and closing themes add nothing to VKG’s charm. The score, on the other hand, though mostly generic (aimless tinkering on a piano, queer string instrumentals, that kind of thing), still holds one or two surprises. The most useful additions include the sound effects subtly used to heighten the spooky ambience; for example, the sudden rush of cymbals during particularly tense exchanges goes a little way to enrich the viewing experience.Characters (6/10)With fewer comedic scenes to add colour to Yuuki’s personality, the effects of her clueless vulnerability and passive nature leap from uninspiring to outright disgusting. Taking the initiative and driving the story on her own merits is certainly beyond her as she stutters and sighs her way through every conversation. Most irritatingly, she’s the kind of contradictory character who speaks of saving others whilst constantly needing protection herself.As such, providing entertainment falls to Kaname and Zero. While Kaname wields his mysteriousness like an expert by throwing a dark and truly unexpected spanner in the works, Zero escalates his catalogue moping (seemingly, just because he can). Neither ventures from his archetypal pigeon hole, but both remain engaging, nonetheless, because of their anguished backgrounds.The other good news is that Kaname’s previously nameless hangers-on get fleshed out and become more relevant to the plot. In particular, I find the exploration of Aidou’s friendship with Kaname to be an interesting addition to the character development.Overall (7/10)VKG will prove the perfect fix for fans addicted to a sugary diet of bishies, immature angst, and romanticised horror themes; competent central mystery aside, those elements are its forte. For anyone looking for substance and/or action, however, the show will leave a distinct ‘Is that it?’ feeling as anticlimactic fight scenes and an insipid cast dog the plot. On the whole, VKG may not feel as fresh and exciting as its predecessor, but it remains at all times a fun and easy romp to follow. her blood-stained past: what will she find, and will she continue to be tempted by an offer from Kaname?Now on to the review and I hope you and enjoy reading this review and I hope it helps you's in anyway.

The school, the teachers, the bonds, the story itself had the same goal.

In admitting this, I am also saying that my rating is incredibly biased.I was on the hedge when it came to Vampire Knight Guilty, more so than I was with the original series. Most of us can agree that sequels rarely live up to the original. In many cases, the original series is meant to establish characters, relations, and a foundation for the overarching plot. Sequels, then, are supposed to consist of the meat of the story. They are supposed to clear up all issues, ties up loose...ends, and leave the viewer satisfied at the end of the day. Unfortunately, this concept isn\'t always followed. Instead, a number of sequels are made to continue sucking revenue out of an already popular show.This leads to that annoying filler we all know and hate. In series that air extensively, the filler can sometimes last entire arcs, for the dual purposes of lining pockets with greenbacks and to continue an anime with an on-going manga counterpart.But this isn\'t new to many of us. We know and loathe the process, as it turns otherwise great shows into absolute travesties that we wish to never have experienced.Vampire Knight Guilty, however, is one of those rare successes in a sea of failure. While there are elements of the plot that became... tedious to deal with, the developments were rather satisfying, and the intrigue hinted at in the original came to fruition. This installment was not perfect. It had its fair share of flaws, and some might express malcontent with the ending.I have read the other reviews here, and quite a few seem to hate the ending without the possibility of reconciliation. I personally enjoyed the twists presented, though the pacing was a bit odd. Vampire Knight Guilty deserved to be a longer series. Crammed into thirteen episodes, the viewer is given a steady plot progression over the first nine and then a race to the finish line for the last four. The final episode, though, did leave me satisfied. I can ignore a rushed end game if the actual ending is nice enough.However, I recognize that not everyone will appreciate the decisions made as I have. The best way to describe it without giving it away is to say that the end ties up all of the loose ends of the main character\'s relationships. Unlike some romance anime, Vampire Knight Guilty does not end with a wishy-washy ""let\'s all get along and love her equally"" type deal. Instead, it caters to both consummated and unrequited love. There are a few elements that some viewers may find tasteless, but that is a matter of perspective. The way those elements are presented in the anime make sense, and as such I can accept them.There is a lack of catharsis, though, which may shock some of the viewers. I know that I was expecting a little tragedy to hit somewhere near the end. With all of the build-up, I was almost hoping for some death and despair. Even so, I can\'t say that I am dissatisfied with how events turned out.Now, die-hard fans of the manga will be quick to note that Vampire Knight Guilty does not live up to its counterpart, but I cannot personally vouch for that. Having never read the manga, my experience is limited solely to the anime. I can say that the manga is on-going, and the anime was created years ago. At the very least, I expect the manga to be paced more evenly, and to explain several of the developments that were only haphazardly touched upon.At the end of the day, I can only say that I enjoyed Vampire Knight Guilty more than its predecessor. While I did enjoy the introductions of the characters, the ending of Vampire Knight Guilty won me over. The art and sound quality is the same in both, though I must note that the ending theme for Vampire Knight Guilty is one of my favorite EDs. It\'s one of the few that I was willing to listen to more than once as opposed to skipping right over it.I will say that if you watched Vampire Knight, you should watch Vampire Knight Guilty. Even if you wind up hating the ending, I cannot see how anyone can be satisfied with the state of affairs as they were left off in the original. If you did not enjoy Vampire Knight, however, you should stray away from Vampire Knight Guilty.

The art and sound quality is the same in both, though I must note that the ending theme for Vampire Knight Guilty is one of my favorite EDs. It\'s one of the few that I was willing to listen to more than once as opposed to skipping right over it.I will say that if you watched Vampire Knight, you should watch Vampire Knight Guilty. Even if you wind up hating the ending, I cannot see how anyone can be satisfied with the state of affairs as they were left off in the original. If you did not enjoy Vampire Knight, however, you should stray away from Vampire Knight Guilty. It\'s in the same vein of entertainment, after all.', ""There are no spoilers in this review, so it can come off as vague, but I didn't want to spoil anything for those who may read it!In my own list, I rated this as a 10 purely because I really, really loved it. But being more realistic, I think that in general, this anime is more like an 8 out of 10.I don't really understand the complaints about the romance. Yes, it's angsty at times, yes, it has some cliches. But this is literally a romance anime targeted at younger girls. If you have a problem with that, why would you watch it or...rate it negatively?Ok, so now that I have that out of the way, I guess I'll go more into the series itself. I watched the first season because someone recommended it to me. I wasn't aware of what it was about, or what shoujo even was. I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of cleavage shots and other annoying things that typically occur in popular anime. It started out a little slow, but I love vampires, so I kept watching, and I'm glad I did.The first season was pretty good, but nothing special. In my person opinion, the second one blows it out of the water. It is NOT confusing if you pay attention. The characters DO have development. I really question whether the people who made these complaints were fully watching the show or not. This definitely captures the feel of a gothic romance anime, but it also has a really good plot and other things to draw you in besides the romance.The second season did have some things that I would have preferred they explained more about because it would have been interesting. However, there were no huge plot holes that I could see or anything they left really unexplained that was necessary to the show. Maybe I'm dumb, but I found myself genuinely surprised by some of the discoveries the characters made and the plot itself, in a good way. I didn't find it overly predictable at all.While there is an antagonist, VKG is more about Yuki, the main character, discovering herself. It continues well from the first season and doesn't seem like a sloppy add-on like some second seasons do (cough cough Black Butler cough cough).I'd talk about the art but it's the same as VK. Pretty, with some exaggerations (Yuki's eyes for example). It also has background characters that get extremely basic designs, like VK. Nothing new.One thing I don't like is how few girls/women are in this show. Perhaps people watching shoujo don't like having women in it? I'm not sure. It just disappointed me that one of the main girls, Luca, is mostly seen as a super jealous/stereotypically catty girl who doesn't like Yuki because of a dude. And the other main girl is the main character. Any other girls don't get big parts at all. But like I said, it's shoujo, so maybe I'm just ignorant of how the genre usually is since I've never watched it before.If you like romance but you also like a good mystery/action/supernatural/gothic anime, I definitely recommend you watch this. It's not perfect if I look at it objectively, but I absolutely loved it, and can't find anything else that comes close to being as fun to watch as VKG, or anything that gives me the same feeling when I watch it. rate it negatively?Ok, so now that I have that out of the way, I guess I'll go more into the series itself.

Also some other things are discovered too. I enjoyed the second part of the story between.Art 10/10The art didn't change obviously so I still enjoy it....Sound 10/10More music was added and sound effects which made the anime between.

Yuki is not so obsessed with Kaname and is more focused on her past with help but eventually does discover it with help.Zero is slowly building up to becoming a level e but still does have help to try to keep his humanity which is still slipping though. More hatred for vampires starts to appear because of Yuki's past with Kaname.Enjoyment 8/10I enjoyed the story again but wasn't too big on the ending and feel like it could have ended better than it did.Overall I give this season 8/10.

In the second season, the show is again really how much potential lies in it. Again, there are again many funny, sad, thoughtful, cheerful moments. In general, one is confronted with a lot of feelings for Vampire Knight. As an example, you can watch Yuki. She feels deep sympathy for Kaname, but do not know how to deal with it.

On the whole it was a very good season with an interesting end."", ""You've read the synopsis, the story basically revolves around the main heroine, Cross Yuki; however, I think damsel is a far more fitting title.So what I really think? Pure quintessential BS.Seriously.It's so cliché and over melodramatic that it's practically excreting out hearts and tears.While it might sound harsh I can only be just that: truthfully, bluntly, harsh. However does it mean that I hate it? Well, no.It’s a cliché and corny romance involving vampires and humans. You have the fluff, the love triangle and the forbidden love. Nothing really new. Simplistic plot pumped on melodramatic steroids with cheesy characters and bishi love interests. Pretty to...look at and easy to follow along.The main protagonist Yuki can be quite unlikeable; she’s childish and selfish. Gasping, crying or complaining is not always cute - in fact I want to slap her a few times. Good god, grow a brain cell or two. I understand she was intentionally written to be 'a little dumb', but come on does she have to be one of those stereotypical damsel in distress? The weak demoiselle that has the need for either Kaname or Zero (the male heroes) – like in those classical romance novels, or in the more recent Teen Romance Vampire Novels (*cough Twilight cough*). You have the controlling, stalkerish males and the submissive damsel. This seems familiar. Although most vampire stories follow along those lines... so I guess I shouldn't just single out VK.The problem with VK is that it can be so painfully annoying at times, drama added on top of the already overflowing melodrama – as I’ve been repeatedly saying because there’s no other way to explain it; it’s just there in your face all the time. Perhaps it’s best if I explain:Yuki is bouncing back and forth between Kaname and Zero, she constantly thinks about Kaname and moans about feeling inferior. If she isn’t tearing up then she’s so shocked about everything because she’s too dense to see what’s right in front of her. While she's suppose to be a guardian, protecting the students from any impeding danger (aka Vampires snacking on them), she seems incapable and too weak to perform those duties. Instead 9 times out of 10 she's the one getting in trouble.Zero is a plain broody b@st@r*, ok that’s a little harsh, but everything he does he does it with melancholic dismay (this is me sounding poetic). He's the anti-vampire-angry guy friend, who’s secretly lusting for Yuki.Kaname, the elusive guy that enjoys sending mix signals – one moment he’s so friendly, next he’s lusty/touchy and then he clams up and becomes reclusive. Despite his supposed friendly persona he's a controlling, manipulative, liar.Woe is me. Every single scene feels so over the top, the reactions are just so Shakespearean…There’s so many long winded angsty inner dialogue or people brooding or girls crying or blushing.Look, I like drama, it’s entertaining but when it’s always thrown in your face it gets trying. Yes I will admit some scenes are exciting, especially the showdowns involving Zero, he just adds to the angsty tense atmosphere. And while the characters are over-the-top they are at least fleshed out and given back stories.The show tries to stay true to the gothic style, as seen with the architecture of the academy, the secrets, the supernatural element, the toned down colouring (black, white and red being the main colours), the stock characters, the soundtrack, etc, to name a few. However while it dabbles into the genre it fall flat and comes across as unsuccessful.Because all that supposed Gothic style given to us is background, just background. They could have used it to their advantage, instead you don't pay too much mind to it. Instead it's mainly focused on the main characters - while not necessarily a bad thing - the gothic and supernatural feel just dwindles down to nothingness. A good vampire story would have uncomfortable, suspenseful and omniscient scenes, this does not, the drama and angst overshadows any semblance of mystery or suspense we're given.But it is what it is; I know I can't really expect a convoluted plot with surprising twists. Sure the story did have some surprises, if you ignore the fact that it was heavily hinted.The story is just so predictable.I think VK is just genre confused, it doesn't know if it wants to be a romance comedy or a paranormal-romance (mystery, suspense, supernatural). It switches back and forth and tries to find a middle between the two. While I'm all up for having some humor, I find it ruins the atmosphere at times or plain unnecessary. With a tenser atmosphere it would probably appeal to a wider audience and not just vampire-loving-teens (sorry for the stereotype but it is its targeted audience).  I find there's little to no build-up of suspense or climax so you're left wanting more.Not to complete bash the whole thing like some raving flamer, the story does have its moments. It sucks you in like those cheesy Soap Opera your dad refuses to admit he loves watching with your mom. With the overused plot lines and over the top drama, you can't stop yourself from watching with sickening interest, anxiously waiting to see what happens next (even though you know how it will turn out) like some junkie waiting for his next fix. It's sickening but true, I'm guilty of being part of said population. It’s a guilty pleasure; it’s an easy read and fun to watch. I wouldn’t take the series too seriously.But wait, I must have something else positive to say… like I said: easy to follow, pretty to look at, they are a few select scenes that are good and sometimes the jokes can be funny. It has good parts here and there. The plot isn’t so appalling and the manga does pick up in the later volumes.The big problem I have with the anime of Vampire Knight is the wasted potential; instead of giving us a heroine that evolves we're stuck with a whiny, weak lead. There's also a lot of potential for darker themes: obsession, self-hate, jealousy, possessiveness and violence. It does dabble a bit in the dark themes but it simply never pulls through. Instead we're given predictable melodrama.The obsession is downplayed to 'passionate' and 'eternal' love; the self-hate comes across being excessively broody and melancholic; the jealousy card is a main factor in the story but it's more like a high school debacle - which I suppose suits the story considering they are in an academy, but it has to be pointed out that story does involve vampires which I expect a more serious and dangerous tone to said jealousy. The possessiveness of Kaname is well played, he plays the role of the manipulative and controlling smooth-operator well; however, in the end the fact that Yuki is so accepting and submissive to him you can't help but feel the shojo-iness oozing out - it's sexy when a guy is possessive and controlling. :disbelief: Not the best role model for young girls. Finally the violence, well, it's there but it really isn't detailed and as obvious. It's really glazed over.I suppose you can say it's the Twilight of the Manga world, a love-hate relationship. Albeit personally I find it a cut above - at least the vampires don't sparkle.In the end you’ll have those who hate it because it lacks substance and its overall predictable cheesiness, and you’ll have the fans who love the lovey-dovey teenage vampire romance (or the angsty drama). Would I recommend it? Sure, why not, despite all the short comings give it a go it can be quite enjoyable if you give the series a chance to grow on you.

Which I found good as since there was a little too much going on with the last series, there were some lose ends. Generally though the story is pretty tantalising and although it is mellower, it's all in a bid to the one penultimate moment, so for me it's forgiveable. I've read others complained of the pacing though for me it's not an issue as we're divulged into more character development.

The first half of this series was so bad that I wished I hadn't even watched any of it. I managed to push through to the big reveal (no spoilers in this review, sorry guys!), which managed to interest me enough to keep going. After all, the only reason I kept watching this in the first place was because of Zero, who I love for a myriad of reasons, even if he isn't written all that well. More on that in the character section.To begin with, the story: Vampire Knight Guilty was a direct...continuation of the first series, Vampire Knight, though it was a pretty bad sequel in my opinion. The plot was bland and slow and nobody's motivations or goals were correctly explained. What were supposed to be plot twists just ended up confusing me and in all honesty, it made me feel horribly bored and irritated.The art was tolerable. It wasn't very pretty (I personally hate the whole bug eyes trope for heroines) but it served its purpose. The backgrounds were drab and uninteresting and the colors were all dull and blended too much for me to focus well. The drawings seemed like they were barely even outlined, and the animation was choppy and a little unnatural. The body structures of the characters were unrealistic and angular and just most things about the art didn't sit right with me.The sound was surprisingly alright. The opening and closing themes were gothic enough to fit the setting. I actually really liked the creepy feel of the closing theme.The characters were kind of a mess. They tried to portray Kaname as some sort of evil mastermind like Ciel Phantomhive, Kyoya Ootori, L Lawliet, Light Yagami, or Lelouch Lamperouge, perhaps (wow, look at the alliteration... so many L's...), but nothing in his plan clicked or made any sense. His ideas of making people 'pawns' just seemed to be their natural actions and his motivations weren't clear either. Besides that, Yuki is always on my nerves.

Still no spoilers, research for yourself :DHave a great day everyone! continuation of the first series, Vampire Knight, though it was a pretty bad sequel in my opinion. The plot was bland and slow and nobody's motivations or goals were correctly explained. What were supposed to be plot twists just ended up confusing me and in all honesty, it made me feel horribly bored and irritated.The art was tolerable. It wasn't very pretty (I personally hate the whole bug eyes trope for heroines) but it served its purpose. The backgrounds were drab and uninteresting and the colors were all dull and blended too much for me to focus well. The drawings seemed like they were barely even outlined, and the animation was choppy and a little unnatural. The body structures of the characters were unrealistic and angular and just most things about the art didn't sit right with me.The sound was surprisingly alright. The opening and closing themes were gothic enough to fit the setting. I actually really liked the creepy feel of the closing theme.The characters were kind of a mess. They tried to portray Kaname as some sort of evil mastermind like Ciel Phantomhive, Kyoya Ootori, L Lawliet, Light Yagami, or Lelouch Lamperouge, perhaps (wow, look at the alliteration... so many L's...), but nothing in his plan clicked or made any sense. His ideas of making people 'pawns' just seemed to be their natural actions and his motivations weren't clear either. Besides that, Yuki is always on my nerves.

Now that that’s out of the way let's get into this.Story:The story isn’t that bad per se, it’s just the way it’s executed that makes it seem bad. Things like the use of incest about half way through the anime...and then the attempt to justify it make the story cringy at times. Pair that up with dry voice acting and this destroys what is a pretty good idea for an anime.Art:The art work in this anime feels kinda like Code Geass but a lot less colourful. I think that this style of art works really well for the anime and does a good job of expressing the moody feel that the environment would have in the world of Vampire Knight.Music:The music in this anime is pretty bad. The opening was ok at best and ending was terrible. The music didn't really fit with that anime and the background music was so quiet I couldn't even hear it most of the time.Characters:The characters are one of this shows biggest weaknesses. Out of the three main characters Yuki, Kaname, and Zero the only one who seems to have any personality is Zero, and he doesn’t have much of a personality in the first place. Rei from Neon Genesis Evangelion has more of a personality then Yuki and Kaname put together, and the whole point of her character is to not have a personality.

One thing in particular that I love is how each character is not just there for the sake of being there. They all have their own importance to the plot development, and may I say that the plot is just phenomenal! I mean VAMPIRES!? LOVE TRIANGLES!? This anime right here...is both original, and creative.The most admirable character, though each character is immensely admirable in their own right, is definitely Yuki, our heroine. She is so brave, and not even once doubted herself. (SPOILER WARNING) If I were to have a daughter, I would raise her to be just like Yuki-strong, easygoing, dependable, and a vampire. Her eyes never distracted me in the slightest, unlike the eyes of Brock. (Brock  is a character from the Pokemon franchise, if you\'ve been living under a Brock. Haha get it? Rock, Brock?). Ok so anyway, this show is a must-watch for anyone looking for a compelling and engaging storyline. I have absolutely ZERO (buh-dum-ch) regrets about watching the show in its entirety.

One girl, a bunch of sexy guys fighting to be her lover, plot twists, and corny lines... so many corny lines...  what we have here is the perfect example of what love stories should not be like if you\'re trying to make something original and enjoyable. But don\'t get me wrong, I...didn\'t hate the series, but I didn\'t love it.The story goes like this: Yuuki Cross, a teenage girl who attends an academy whose classes are split up into 2 different sections, the Day Class (for the humans), and the Night Class (for the vampires). Being head of the disciplinary committee, it\'s her job to keep all the raving teenage girls from going all fangirl on all the gorgeous night class students, while holding back feelings for the leader of the night class, Kaname. By her side, her somewhat adopted brother (I guess, don\'t really know a better term for it...), Zero, helps her out with her job as a member of the disciplinary committee himself, although he in no way has any feelings towards vampires himself other than pure hatred. With all of these crazy things going on, it\'s basically a ""Who will Yuki choose in the end?"" deal. There are plenty of other anime with a similar plotline, although I feel like the ones without vampires would be about 10 times more interesting.Studio Deen! The studio that brought us hit anime such as ""Higurashi"", ""Dragon Crisis!"", ""Hetalia"", and the well known yaoi dream boat of an anime ""Junjō Romantica"", and in all honesty, there were some hints in there that made me think, ""Oh, of course Studio Deen would add some similar traits to Junjō Romantica in this..."". The art was one of the few redeeming qualities of Vampire Knight. The characters were well designed, enough to tell them apart at least, the scenery and effects were well done, and I liked the overall mood the design of the show gave off. One of the few things I can actually say I liked.English Dub or Japanese Dub, whichever you prefer, both were alright in my opinion. Watched season 1 in English, watched season 2 in Japanese. Honestly, both were as good as the other. I liked Vic Mignogna as Zero in the english dub, and I liked Yui Horie as Yuuki in the japanese dub. For english dub fans, you won\'t be disappointed, and the same goes for the japanese dub fans. It\'s not extraordinary work, but it\'s nothing terrible like some anime.Characters are what I had the biggest problem with. Characters are where I felt like I was watching Twilight with their behavior and their personalities. I was screaming at Yuuki to just pick someone to fall for instead of both giving me impressions that she wasn\'t even thinking about who she was gonna choose. Zero had issues. Plain and simple. He hates vampries, but he goes to school with them. He wants to murder them all, but he guards them. He loves Yuuki, but he\'s kind of a jerk to her. Which is it Zero, are you gonna be a jerk, or a man with feelings? And then... there\'s Kaname. I wanted him to just keep away from Yuuki so badly, cause he kept causing trouble for everyone it seemed, especially Zero. Zero is one of Yuuki\'s best friends, don\'t try and keep him away from her. Don\'t be a douche-nozzle... Sorry about the rant, I just have problems with some of the characters, mainly the main ones. As for the minor characters, like the rest of the vampires, I had no problems. They were funny, cool, and didn\'t cause much trouble, unlike the main characters.Vampire Knight had it\'s moments. Mainly in the beginning, it was funny, with a little bit of a darker side every once in a while. Then it became a love triangle, plot twists, betrayal, and boom. Twilight. It wasn\'t terrible, but I gotta be honest, the main reasons I watched this series is because the fangirls in my class wouldn\'t stop yelling at me to watch it... next they want me to watch Free...

I enjoyed the fact that we got to see more of the life\'s of the vampires and the background lore of a good chunk of the characters. However a lot of it felt a little too rushed and/or shoehorned in. Certain aspects of the story were a little rough to follow like the hunters association president turned out to have been drinking vampire blood to stay young, that just seemed to kind of come out of nowhere. And the association breeding it\'s own level E\'s was an interesting point that I...think they could have done more with. The interactions of Zero and Kaname kind of let me down they kept hyping up[ some big showdown between the two.The character Development was just OK. I feel like they could have done more with character interactions between Kaname, Yuki, and Zero. Yuki seemed to go from a ""goody 2 shoes"" character to a ""goody 2 shoes"" with a hero complex character. I feel like they could have done a better job showing Yukis struggle with her emotions primarily through Kaname and Zero. Like maybe they could have had more Zero and Kaname scuffles and Yuki keeps interjecting herself to stop them. Yuki has shown that she has feelings of love for both of them and they could have had her kind of flip flop between which one she was after, kind of a ""which do I choose situation"". However I do like the ""inverse"" concept they seem to have going where what they desire seems to cause the opposite to happen, it\'s subtle but well placed throught the characters emotions.All in all the shown was fine. I wouldn\'t go out of my way to try and get someone to see it but I also won\'t try to dissuade someone who is interested from watching it. It\'s worth, what I call, a ""passive watch"" if you are board and have nothing else to watch I would give it a go.P.S. Yuki should have ended up with zero.

I saw season one in my recommendations and decided to give it a shot since i’ve never watched any vampire anime, it started out decently, Zero was an interesting character to me which is why I continued to watch it despite not being that impressed. By the time I finished season one I was more into it, I gave it a 7 overall for being unique...with mystery behind almost every character.I started season 2 right after and all my expectations slowly came crashing down. It was a quite disappointment, the so-called love triangle was dragged on for too long and I may hold this against the writers since I originally preferred Zero much more over Kaname. Yuri’s character became almost intolerable, she kept appearing weaker and weaker and despite being so weak she kept insisting she wanted to protect Zero even if she had no way of doing so, it may just be me but her constant “I’m alright. I’ll be alright.” was annoying as well.Kaname was a complex character, but he got more interesting as his true colours were slowly being revealed. At the same time my dislike for him kept growing, I found it mind blowing how a powerful being like him was so obsessed with a weak human.I wanted to drop the anime around 6th episode because the whole Yuri smacking Kaname on the chest and begging to learn about her past was becoming boring but my theory was that because of her flashbacks she might posses suppressed unique power, her vampire hunter parents got killed by Kaname’s parents who wished to posses Yuri’s powers but because of that traumatizing night she faced a bad vampire, it caused her memory loss so Kaname was used to get close to her until she rediscovers her powers. Somehow Kaname’s parents were killed and he kept Yuri around to manipulate her like a puppet, so she can serve him with her powers and he’d become unstoppable. This theory of mine kept me invested and part of me was hoping for it to be true so Kaname’s character would start growing on me and how realistic his motive would’ve be, everyone wishes to become more powerful.In ep.7 I just couldn’t handle how dragged the whole Yuri begging to be told about her past drama was so I told myself I’d drop this anime once I finish the episode. Much to my luck, it got intense quickly and I hoped for that to change my mind but the end of the episode was just so. no words. I’m an impatient person and when I heard the “he’s my brother” I just lost it. My disappointed went from 10/10 to 100000000/10, I knew this anime had to pull some weird sh*t because it’s about high school and vampires but that was just too much, I wasn’t sticking around to get an explanation as to why Kaname had his tongue down Yuri’s throat and proceeded to say “if I had been born her real brother, I would have been much happier” seconds later. I’m not sure how the writers plan to twist that around but it was the cherry on top to a ‘wtf was that’ anime.I’ve read a few other reviews to spoil it for myself and it seemed like the ending was so not worth it. It’s a shame, I was hoping for Zero to end up with Yuri. with mystery behind almost every character.I started season 2 right after and all my expectations slowly came crashing down. It was a quite disappointment, the so-called love triangle was dragged on for too long and I may hold this against the writers since I originally preferred Zero much more over Kaname. Yuri’s character became almost intolerable, she kept appearing weaker and weaker and despite being so weak she kept insisting she wanted to protect Zero even if she had no way of doing so, it may just be me but her constant “I’m alright. I’ll be alright.” was annoying as well.Kaname was a complex character, but he got more interesting as his true colours were slowly being revealed. At the same time my dislike for him kept growing, I found it mind blowing how a powerful being like him was so obsessed with a weak human.I wanted to drop the anime around 6th episode because the whole Yuri smacking Kaname on the chest and begging to learn about her past was becoming boring but my theory was that because of her flashbacks she might posses suppressed unique power, her vampire hunter parents got killed by Kaname’s parents who wished to posses Yuri’s powers but because of that traumatizing night she faced a bad vampire, it caused her memory loss so Kaname was used to get close to her until she rediscovers her powers. Somehow Kaname’s parents were killed and he kept Yuri around to manipulate her like a puppet, so she can serve him with her powers and he’d become unstoppable. This theory of mine kept me invested and part of me was hoping for it to be true so Kaname’s character would start growing on me and how realistic his motive would’ve be, everyone wishes to become more powerful.In ep.7 I just couldn’t handle how dragged the whole Yuri begging to be told about her past drama was so I told myself I’d drop this anime once I finish the episode. Much to my luck, it got intense quickly and I hoped for that to change my mind but the end of the episode was just so. no words. I’m an impatient person and when I heard the “he’s my brother” I just lost it. My disappointed went from 10/10 to 100000000/10, I knew this anime had to pull some weird sh*t because it’s about high school and vampires but that was just too much, I wasn’t sticking around to get an explanation as to why Kaname had his tongue down Yuri’s throat and proceeded to say “if I had been born her real brother, I would have been much happier” seconds later. I’m not sure how the writers plan to twist that around but it was the cherry on top to a ‘wtf was that’ anime.I’ve read a few other reviews to spoil it for myself and it seemed like the ending was so not worth it. It’s a shame, I was hoping for Zero to end up with Yuri.', 'They are back with more of their irresistible sexiness and gloomy yet cool looks.This sequel is way even better from the previous season where it was more of an introduction and the story focused more on Zero. In this season, Kaname and Yuki’s real identities are reveal. Friendships and love as well are tested with the appearance of a new villain and huge revelations. We see how miserable and complicated the lives of the pureblood vampires.Again, the characters are all gorgeous looking. Main characters, supporting, extra, and even the villains are so beautiful. Seriously, if I said in the previous season that I slightly...dislike Yuki; in this sequel I extremely hate her. She keeps on doing stupid and unnecessary things. She does things which she thinks are heroic when she herself is weak and so end up being a bother to others. It is not cool at all. If you can’t help at all then you might as well stay away from danger as to not go in the way of others. That’s the least that you could do. She’s very dramatic, too. But what most irritates me is the very obvious fact that she’s also in love with Zero. To be honest, it really looks like to me that she both loves Kaname and Zero. When she found out her real identity, the very first thing that she worries is Zero. How Zero would feel about her and all that stuffs.  Compared to her relationship to Kaname, her bond with Zero is way stronger. It might be complicated but her feelings for Zero is so strong. Sometimes I even doubt her feelings to Kaname. Perhaps she loves them both but her feelings for Zero are stronger. Despite that, I don’t hate Zero. In fact, I pity him and Kaname as well. Both of them suffered a lot and because of that they are very lonely people. I seriously question why they are so head over heels with Yuki. Especially Kaname. He is the epitome of an enigmatic and cool guy. He’s not only strong but very smart as well. I’ve been in love with him for so many years now. But despite everything else; all of them are such lonely creatures. It just shows that despite having powers, wealth and eternal life, happiness is still not guaranteed.With a very short distance from the time where the season one ended, the animation of this sequel is not so different from the previous one. Still, the animation is one of the best among all of today’s animes. The characters and scenes are very much well made.I am sure going to miss these guys.

All of the failures of the first season are just as bad and sometimes worse. There is not even a cool opening song. There is nothing good or redeeming about this mess of a show. It made me hate vampire stories more than I did before. After watching this evil and satanic show I had to pray to feel better. I felt as though everything in this show was the author's fetishes projected onto her self insert character and her ideal romantic interests. But there is nothing romantic about evil, blood-sucking creatures...which will make you become one of them if you're not careful.I despise the Vampire Knight story. There aren't even any knights. which will make you become one of them if you're not careful.I despise the Vampire Knight story.

Considering how the lot of animu nowadays consist of strong females (and pansy-arse males) for the lonely otaku audience, VampKnight Guilty\'s ""flaws"" can be overlooked.I\'m not gonna dwell on what\'s obviously obvious in this show. But I will say that there\'s little hesitation when it comes to fang-sinking and blood-drinking. Which is AWESOMAGE orz and what needs to be seen in some entertainment piece about people who are vampires. ', 'This season is a massive disappointment from where season one ended, and that is better (slightly) than this. Yuki yet again is a useless insufferable character that goes back and forth back and forth back and forth. The adults are more-so spineless, including headmaster Kaien, who is/was a legendary vampire hunter. Even weirder are several incest subplots woven throughout. Little progress is made, and the ending is very unsatisfactory. Kaname Kuran is a manipulative creep, and the Zero vs Kuran rivalry leads nowhere. The side characters are as deep as a kiddie-pool. Maybe them being emotionless is due to their being vampires? This anime subverts...your hopes and expectations, from the first season and dashes them. your hopes and expectations, from the first season and dashes them.', ""(SPOILERS) The second season of Vampire Knight, was well better than the first season at least. The characters never really developed besides the main two Yuki and Zero becoming full vampires. Well Yuki becomes a pure blood vampire. I didn't hate watching it. It was actually pretty enjoyable but just wasn't one to go back and rewatch. At the end of the season I felt very empty and lost a little due to the whole show developing Yuki and Zero's relationship. Which in the end they don't even end up together but as enemies. I just can't find this a suitable option for the ending...of the show. Besides the horrible ending, I loved the art, it was one of the best parts of the show. The art style is more of the early 2000's art. It definitely has a acquired taste. The sound was good but I don't know how it could get any better or worse. The dub or sub are both good. The character's are actually pretty forgettable, especially the background characters. All the vampires that follow Kaname I cant even remember a single name. I find they didn't want to focus on other characters besides Yuki, Kaname, and Zero. Which I find very sad due to some of the characters having better development than the main three. I watched the full season in a few hours and I didn't feel as though I was pushing to watch the show. So, overall I give the show a 7. of the show.

Characters are believable and interesting to watch, attention to human motion is impressive in this animation and design style is rather nice not complicated by extra layers of shading.

', '“A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men.” - Roald DahlWell, I\'m back again with another obscure, bargain bin title review, this time: Birdy the Mighty.Preface:Birdy the Mighty 1996 is a precursor to the more popular BTM: Decode series, which aired more recently. Masami Yuki, a guy who\'s done literally nothing else of note, started Birdy way back in the mid 80s, which he mysteriously and abruptly stopped writing. (it was probably the cocaine, that he along with everyone else back then did, \'the 80\'s, mannnn\'.) Well, Birdy was turned into a 4 episode OVA series by everybody\'s favorite studio...MADHOUSE!Unlike their peer Production IG, who had an absolute turd of a show in 1996 called ""Panzer Dragoon"" (we daren\'t speak that name), Madhouse delivered a quality animation. Unfortunately, the licensing in NA was handled by Central Park Media, known for their schlockiness and giving dubs a bad name.Artwork and Animation: 8Madhouse, true to form, delivers a very high quality, fluid, and fast moving product that looks great for a mid 90s show. This came before the big CGI boom in the late 90s/early 00s, so we\'re saved from those horrors, and blessed with some very slick hand drawn animation. While there are some lazy moments with stillframe, the action was as good as it was going to get for a show of this budget, and it is very easy to watch.Sound and Voice Acting: 3This is where the problems begin, and it\'s mostly on the voice acting front.My biggest problem with this is on a technical level, and it\'s partially a result of the technology at the time, and partly because they used junk equipment. When there\'s no music (which is usually mixed at a higher level than the voices anyway, making it hard to hear), there\'s a slight static that everything made before the digital age has. It\'s there, just trust me.Well, when the actors are speaking, you can hear hard mic cuts, where the only sound mixed is that of their voice, then it cuts back to ""silence"" which resumes the static scratching sound, which is a bit jarring. They also apparently didn\'t know what pop filters were, and you can hear their lips smacking together as they talk.Half the VA sound really bored, or phoned in, it\'s just this side of bad cheesy, but not bad enough to laugh at, since it takes itself seriously. A lot of the music sounds like it came straight out of Super Mario Kart, but the ending themes are pretty groovy.Story: 6Being that Birdy the Mighty is incomplete, it\'s natural to say that it\'s got a poor story, but I disagree. It\'s ""fair"". The first episode is just an intro to Birdy and Tsutomu, but 2-4 cover the plot. It\'s nothing original- an investigation into a growing series of crimes perpetrated by an intergalactic criminal intent on creating psionic soldiers with which to destroy the intergalactic police organization hunting him. The mastermind has created a serum through a series of genetic tests on himself and others which turns the recipient of it into a hulking reptilian psionic rage monster (think Akira- it definitely had some influences here). There is another villain who is explored , but not resolved, which hurt the show, but in a way left it open ended for an eventual revisitation.Characters: 7   ---*minor 1st episode spoilers*---Tsutomu is a weenie and a giant loser who lucklessly happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up dead while the Intergalactic supercop Birdy is chasing a criminal. As punishment for ending the poor kid\'s pathetic life, Birdy is instructed by her giant Radroach of a boss to ressurect Tsutomu by morphing bodies with him. They\'re able to switch at will, and both have their own lives to attend to, which often leads to some pretty funny results.Birdy herself is a confident and capable fighter, but impulsive and hot-headed, a trait she vehemently denies, then tries to fight someone over for saying, hah. She\'s tough, and she don\'t take no crap- which sometimes ends in billions of dollars in destruction of property, but she makes sure to kick enough intergalactic ass to cover the bill.Enjoyment: 9I picked this up on a whim, like most of my obscure titles, and while the first episode was pretty boring, the 2nd-4th were really good. There\'s some brutal action including arm and leg breaks, and several awesome sequences- one where an entire skyscraper is taken down in a battle, and a second where there\'s a telekinetic fight that ends with an oil tanker being thrown into a character who crashes through a 6 foot thick concrete wall! There\'s a few cheeseball lines of dialogue to snicker at too.Overall: 7It has some over the top moments, but overall it\'s a good twist on the typical superpower shonen. A handy female protagonist who shows the beta male how it\'s done, and a fun concept of the body switching made for a good little show.Recommend?Sure.

It\'s a nice change of pace, and at 120 minutes runtime, not a big investment.', 'Birdy the Mighty started as a 1980s manga that combined tropes of the ""Magical Girl"" genre with the Space Bounty Hunter genre. It is unsurprisingly about a lose cannon Galactic officer named Birdy. She gives zero fucks and often causes some massive collateral damage. However, after accidentally killing a random Japanese highschool student, her boss comically yells at her and forces her to save his life by binding his spirit to hers. Anime fans will instantly recognize the similarity to the relationship between Alucard and Seras from Hellsing, which came about 10 years after the Birdy manga concluded. However, the boy Tsutomu does not get...to keep his own body like Seras. Instead he and Birdy share a body and switch during times of danger, much like Yugi and Yami from Yugioh. With this fairly interesting set up, our story begins!Birdy the Mighty is largely episodic with our title badass taking down a new threat in every episode. There was supposed to be an overarching plot about Birdy chasing a famous alien criminal hiding out on Earth for unknown reasons, but the anime was scrapped after just 4 episodes! What is amazing is that Birdy actually had the makings of a decent show, but was never given a chance. Why? There are anime out there WAY worse than Birdy that are actually popular and have multiple seasons! Ikki Tousen is one of the worst anime I have ever seen and I believe that piece of shit has 4 seasons now! Several attempts were made to reboot Birdy, but none of them caught on in popularity. Perhaps because Birdy is a very shonen action series, but broke the rules by having a female main protagonist? I\'m honestly not sure why this show did so poorly with Japanese test audiences.Tsutomu is a bland, beta male that is easily forgettable. The character that is actually interesting is obviously Birdy herself. I love how she grins from ear to ear while tearing apart her opponents with her bare hands. She is gleefully psychotic and is sort of like a female Alucard, or if Revy from Black Lagoon was actually likeable. It is too bad we have likely seen the end of Birdy and her reckless police work.One possible reason for Birdy\'s failure in the US was that it was adapted by the dreaded Central Park Media. Of all the companies to licence anime in the United States, no one had a reputation worse than the now thankfully defunct Central Park. This was a company that adapted the absolute WORST anime that NO ONE wanted to see, simply because they didn\'t have to pay very much money to adapt and bring over Z tier anime titles to the US. This was the company that gave us MD Geist, Mad Bull 34, Angel Cop, and probably 8 of the top 10 worst anime ever to see an American release. Like all Central Park titles, Birdy suffers from HORRIBLE voice acting and cheesy music inserted in. However, I didn\'t honestly think Birdy suffered that much from these flaws. It kind of made it nostalgic and fun.Overall: 6/10Birdy the Mighty was obviously not a cinematic masterpiece, but it certainly deserved more than 4 damn episodes before getting axed! Sometimes for whatever reason, good shows get screwed and cancelled WAY too early, while shitty shows somehow stumble on season after season. Birdy is one of those decent shows that had some real potential,  but failed to find an audience and was never given the chance it deserved. Of all the garbage that Central Park Media dumped on to American audiences, this was EASILY one of their best titles. to keep his own body like Seras. Instead he and Birdy share a body and switch during times of danger, much like Yugi and Yami from Yugioh. With this fairly interesting set up, our story begins!Birdy the Mighty is largely episodic with our title badass taking down a new threat in every episode. There was supposed to be an overarching plot about Birdy chasing a famous alien criminal hiding out on Earth for unknown reasons, but the anime was scrapped after just 4 episodes! What is amazing is that Birdy actually had the makings of a decent show, but was never given a chance. Why? There are anime out there WAY worse than Birdy that are actually popular and have multiple seasons! Ikki Tousen is one of the worst anime I have ever seen and I believe that piece of shit has 4 seasons now! Several attempts were made to reboot Birdy, but none of them caught on in popularity. Perhaps because Birdy is a very shonen action series, but broke the rules by having a female main protagonist?

If you want you can read my review in Spanish.Masami Yuuki is known for being the author of Patlabor (1988-1994), but also of other works such as Assemble Insert (1985-1989) or Birdy the Mighty (1985-1988). The latter, like the previous ones, received its own anime in the form of 4 OVAs. The responsible was Yoshiaki Kawajiri, director of films such as Ninja Scroll (1993) and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2000), although this time he did not have much creative freedom to shape his interests. Hence, it is difficult to identify the style of the prestigious author, with...only a few signs such as his predilection for action or spider monsters.Birdy the Mighty is an action miniseries with science fiction elements that tells the story of a student and an interspace agent, both united in the same body due to an unfortunate incident, who must collaborate to defeat the evil extraterrestrial organization. The main attraction, therefore, is the fact that the main couple live together in the same body. An infrequent change because the usual thing is that the hero ends up in the body of his partner and vice versa, both having to deal with situations that he is not used to. See living the life of another completely different person who reaches the sex, age, occupation, etc.On the contrary, here we speak of a different experience, in the sense that they must find a way in which both guests are satisfied. On the one hand, Birdy must preserve Tsutomu\'s life in the same state he was in before. On the other hand, the boy must accept Birdy\'s mission and collaborate with her. Contrary to what might seem, coexistence does not take long to take place, with some initial friction before Tsutomu\'s annoyance and Birdy\'s abruptness that are resolved by the need to cancel the threat. In other words, the dramatic and emotional dimension does not have much of a journey, despite the fact that the nature of the situation could be used to strengthen ties at a more intimate level. They also don\'t take much advantage of the comedic realm, settling for some jokes that Birdy plays on handling his body around the city or hugging his friend. At least, the experience serves to get us out of unnecessary romances and that the protagonist is an easy target in the face of enemy attacks.In the same way, the potential of the couple did not reach its maximum either. Neither together nor apart. Like many others, Tsutomu and Birdy are a duo whose interactions are sympathetic, but lacking a singular team chemistry in the absence of contrasts or bonding elements. The exception is on the battlefield, as each brings their own: Birdy the strength and Tsutomu the decisive ideas. Which, by the way, one wonders where he gets them from because the boy is not the brightest or the most interested in science. Either way, the true pillar of the group is Birdy. Facing the ordinary student with no more conflict than recovering her previous life, we have a woman of action endowed with a certain spark due to her beauty, strength and fighting character. Unlike the teenager, the intergalactic agent has a personal goal: to get revenge on Christella Revi for the murder of a loved one. Hence her commitment and responsibility for her work since she is always attentive to any signal and patrolling the area. Unfortunately, we did not get to explore her personal drama because the story is incomplete.Of the secondary my opinion is shorter. They serve mainly to configure the personal environment of the protagonist, allowing us to better understand why he wants to preserve his intact life. At the same time they also fulfill a comic function. Be it the family with the overprotective mother, the annoying sister and the clumsy father or the classmates who dedicate themselves to teaching you erotic magazines. In a higher place is Tsutomu\'s friend: Hayamiya. We can point out the same topics about her as about other classmates with the same role, but the most disappointing thing is the resolution of the conflict in which Birdy\'s identity is revealed. The reason is that he ends with a simple ""tell me when you are ready"", returning to the status quo.On the enemy side we have something more of value, although nothing to make coherent. Starting off, we have the main village: Revi. Undoubtedly, the presence of women draws her attention because she is always surrounded by luxury and an interest in fashion and personal beauty, but by depriving ourselves of a direct conflict with her there is nothing more to say. Instead, we have the antagonist of the arc: Seichiro Hikawa. He is a researcher who experimented with human beings during World War II to create perfect soldiers, but after these events he could not continue and his ""work"" was never recognized until Revi\'s arrival. He is perfectly suited to the classic narcissistic scientist who trusts in his evil genius, but does not bring a fresh approach. At the very least, he does not stay in something more generic thanks to the background granted by the police investigation and the Machiavellian plan to transform the inhabitants of Tokyo into monsters with psychic powers.Despite the fact that the work does not stand out in the previous aspects, at least it gives greater emphasis and attention to the action and the development of the combat. A very favorable point when the intellectual pretensions are of such a small size. The clashes involve Birdy and the organization\'s enemies, who are capable of using superhuman or psychic powers. In general, these encounters are remarkable for several reasons. First of all, it hardly uses limited animation resources. You will not witness static images or recycling of sequences or substitution of backgrounds. Instead the movement is clean and fluid. Second, the battles are free from the most obnoxious obstacles in fighting shonen like annoying exposure or deliberate slowness to stretch.Afterward, he has enough choreography and visual effects to put on a little show. In this sense, some animators like Yoshiyuki Ito (Cowboy Bebop, 1998; and Soul Eater, 2008) have contributed some sensational action scenes. Of course, the action manages to be clear to the viewer. On the other hand, there is plenty and variety in the fights, changing the enemies and the locations (buildings, aquariums, amusement parks, train tracks, etc). However, they are far from perfect. For example, music is far from memorable, however fitting. Some impact on the action is also missing because Birdy is almost never seriously injured, even if they can put her in trouble. As a last detail, it would have been better not to omit certain punches or kicks at the moment of impact.

It's based off of a short manga called Tetsuwan Birdy by Masami Yuuki. It was released from July 25 1996 to Feb 25 1997, and the OVA was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (The Animatrix).At the start of the story we meet Tsutomu Senkawa. He's just an average middle school kid studying for exams. As he goes outside to get some fresh air and something to drink to stress down from all his studying, some man runs into him and asks Tsutomu to hide him. Something is chasing this man and Tsutomu...ends up being dragged into it. Turns out that this man is not a man at all, but rather an alien, and the thing that is chasing him is the Intergalactic Officer Birdy Cephon Altera. Tsutomu ends up being attacked in the confusion and killed by Birdy. The only way to revive Tsutomu is by having Birdy join Tsutomu's body. Now with Birdy in his own body, he gets dragged into a life of capturing criminals and saving lives.Tsutomu Senkawa is our mian character. He's as blank slate and scared as they come, and the only things we know about him is that he's trying to get into high school. Other than that he's simply dragged around by Birdy, only being helpful when the situation requires something that is very rare on other planets, but extremely common on earth.Birdy Cephon Altera is an alien who looks human. She is also an intergalactic officer who has come to earth to capture intergalactic criminals. She accidentally ends up killing Tsutomu when she's chasing down a criminal and ends up having to join his body to save him.The animation in this OVA is very servicable, but falls just short of being good. The fight scenes are animated well enough that it's exciting to watch, and other moments are animated a lot less. It plays it very safe with it's animation, and while it doesn't exactly make it the most visually impressive show to watch, it does it's job well enough.The music in this show I enjoyed. I thought it worked well with the show overall and I have no real complaints here.Overall I have to say that I enjoyed this OVA. It was short and sweet. It got to the point very fast and still managed to make me interested in the situation and what was going on with the characters, with the exception of our main character as there just isn't that much to him in those 4 episodes. What I will say though, is that if this show suffers from one thing it's that while it mostly hits it's story beats without being too stupid or just plain uninteresting, there are moments where it goes 100% stupid for a few seconds. This is the case for two of the fights in the OVA where they end up having to be defeated by something that is very rare on other planets, but not that rare on earth. Things like detergent for example, or even electricity. I felt like this was a bit dumber than it needed to be, but overall it didn't ruin my enjoyment of this series. I would recommend this show if you're in a sci-fi mood and looking for something on the shorter side. And if you do end up enjoying this little OVA but you're still cracing more, you can always keep going with Birdy the Mighty Decode. ends up being dragged into it.

Not much has changed here. This is the original 1996 adaptation OVA of the manga and is a fun action miniseries. This one doesn't really try to go anywhere with heavy development of characters or any amazing plot but it works in its favor to get straight to the action and it's great, the parents are actually there. Plus the quality of the art never really plummets like the Decode series does and can even impress me at certain moments. The best way I describe the difference between the two...is the OVA is all about fun and Decode is about the character and plot. Though they can both do well in the others specialty. If there's one problem, it's done and over with before real quick and leaves you wanting more. Would I recommend Tetsuwan Birdy? Yes, especially if you want to find a quick watch. is the OVA is all about fun and Decode is about the character and plot. Though they can both do well in the others specialty.

Focusing on poignant, visually interesting action and the two central characters, Tetsuwan Birdy, though flawed, is a brief but endearing, inventive time sync.CHARACTERSBirdy Cephon Altera: Is the titular character of this series, and a rather enjoyable one at that. She is hotheaded, impulsive, possibly a narcissist, and unbelievably charismatic. Certainly not a role model, Birdy is an alien Space...Cop basically, and after accidentally killing a young man while on the job, she is forced to merge mind and body with him, at the dismay of them both. She has badass abilities, she has a badass body, she has it all, and is certainly the most captivating draw to this series.Tsutomu: His last name is unimportant, he reeks of generic male protagonist, and quite frankly, he\'s a complete clown. His ass dies in the first episode, setting off the forced cooperation between him and Birdy as they fuse together. Though being a complete loser, he does try his best with the situation he unfortunately found himself in, and does make some sort of impact as the show goes on.The other characters aren\'t that important, not even the villains really. One of them has literally no characterization, and the others play little to no importance in the grand scheme of things. Though this is not without explanation. At the time, the original manga run by Masami Yuki had gone unfinished for whatever reason, and the OVA had very little to work with.STORYSimilarly, the story here also isn\'t much to speak of without spoiling anything, and even when spoiling it, I can\'t say it left a mark on my mind. But the story in this OVA is not what I believe to be the main focusing point anyway. And like I said, the story itself was never finished by the time this OVA was released.SOUNDI remember nothing of the music, or if there was any to begin with. Like I said earlier, my first viewing of this show was the dub, and it left much to be desired. It\'s definitely got that 90s sound quality, and it seems maybe the crew over at Madhouse weren\'t too concerned about making the show audibly presentable.ARTThe art on the other hand is very nice. The old animation style is endearing for those who appreciate that sort of thing. Action scenes in general are of great quality, and are loaded here and there with unique shots, interesting scenarios, and lots of ""gifable"" moments. The action is where it\'s at, it\'s dynamic and entertaining all the way through.Overall, I may find myself one day coming back to this on some sort of nostalgia trip. Tetsuwan Birdy is simply great entertainment. Some of ideas presented are fun to think about too. I mean, a show about a girl merging mind and bodies with a guy, and can switch sexes at will? How would that go down in today\'s culture if it was released today?I recommend this show for anyone who knows how to enjoy themselves.

High school guy gets trapped in a girl's body, what's not to like? Well it's more like they share a body but he still gets to look like himself. It's weird. The four episodes play out more like a single long movie, best to watch them back to back if you can. Beyond the sci-fi body switching stuff it's got a very noir detective feel. Birdy is basically a space cop investigating trouble here on earth. There's a lot of mystery and gritty environments. I would have enjoyed seeing more of this version of Birdy but the original author...basically reworked the story from the ground up for his second version of the manga, and I don't think this one ever got finished. This animated version at least certainly feels like it could have done more, it leaves things very open.It's a fun watch, I give it a 7/10 basically reworked the story from the ground up for his second version of the manga, and I don't think this one ever got finished.

Reminds me of why I watch anime to begin with.  Let me explain why.The story is very basic and uncomplicated but compelling enough to drive itself.The animation is usually pretty damned good and I\'m very fond of most of the character designs (and none of them are bad).The action is fluid and well choreographed. Fights have actual progression and a flow to them.What I really enjoy though is the relationship between the two protagonists. They have great chemistry together and they\'re both on helping one another. Neither is useless, even though...one is just a regular human.Now I was talking about how much I liked it but I feel I should mention the story just kind of ""ends"" all of a sudden. They also have this obnoxious ""flashing"" during some fights which ruins some moments (and could probably cause seizures in epileptics).Overall though, it\'s just a well put together series of OVAs that are entertaining from beginning to end. one is just a regular human.Now I was talking about how much I liked it but I feel I should mention the story just kind of ""ends"" all of a sudden.

But what makes it good? Well...- Story & ThemeThe story is simple. A spacecop accidentally kills someone, which is a big no-no, and the only way to save him is to merge their bodies together. Hijinx can ensue, right? Sure, too a degree, but the story actually comes off as surprisingly serious and the theme is more sci-fi action mystery then gender-bender rom com. There is a romantic...interest, but she is handled in a different way than one might expect and while I wouldn't call the story anything more than generic it all just simply works. Part of that is that the story plays to its strengths, but a large part is also...- Characters & WritingIf anything really shines in this OVA it's the characters. Even the over-the-top aliens and monsters feel like relatable characters and instead of going for tired cliché copies of characters we've already seen the characters are written more believable and normal. They act and talk in believable ways and they all feel like actual people than just tropes.

Tsurikichi Sanpei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3137/Tsurikichi_Sanpei,"[""As far as I’m aware, Tsurikichi Sanpei is the first anime about fishing. In fact, other than a small handful of titles, there aren’t that many anime solely about fishing. We recently had Houkago Teibou Nisshi back in 2020, and in 1997 there was Super Fishing Grander Musashi, both of which featured fishing as the main focus. But I struggle to name more besides those and a few others. Perhaps it’s the slow and monotonous nature of fishing that is hard to translate into entertainment—something I assumed before getting into Sanpei. I couldn’t have been more incorrect. So how does Tsurikichi Sanpei make fishing entertaining?...And does it live up to the expectations of being one of the first anime about fishing?Tsurikichi Sanpei adapts a popular 1973 fishing manga under the same name, written and illustrated by Takao Yaguchi, into 109 episodes. It follows the experiences and encounters of Mihira Sanpei on his adventures to learn all there is to know about fishing. The anime follows an episodic structure with sets of multi-episode arcs ranging from 3-6 episodes interspersed between single episodic stories. Tsurikichi Sanpei is in fact so episodic that there is no overarching plot whatsoever, with the only semblance of one being Sanpei’s quest to find his father after an accident out at sea that left him with permanent brain damage, wandering throughout Japan with no memory of who he or his family is. However, this plotline is rarely of importance for the episodic stories because Sanpei is instead more interested in focusing on the fishing aspects. This is not a bad thing at all as this style of storytelling lends itself to a laid-back experience which suits its TV Anime format. Fishing takes centre stage in every episode, including everything from fishing technique to fishing locations and, of course, the fish themselves, thus creating both an entertaining and educational experience at the same time.From analysis about fish and their habitats to exploring a diverse range of different fishing techniques, Sanpei never fails to deliver an educational perspective to the bulk of its episodes. Hell, some of the techniques shown seem so obscure that I can’t help but be fascinated. Episodes 40 to 42 are a great example of this. In this story arc, Sanpei is taught the technique of catching mudskippers using a unique spiked fishing hook, guided by a master of the art. The episode goes into great detail about the patience and immense precision needed to perform this technique, and over the span of 3 episodes we watch as Sanpei slowly masters it. I love these longer multi-episode stories as they convey precisely the patience and time investment needed in fishing. A lot of the single episodic stories weren’t that interesting to me; most didn’t take the time to expand on the information presented. In comparison, it felt like Sanpei was able to breathe and take its time when it came to these longer stories. Though with that being said this wasn’t an issue I found in the second half because many episodes began to focus more on dramatic character stories.These educational moments are, of course, intertwined with the stories being told in each episode. Episodes 40 to 42 were accompanied by a competition with the son of a rival mudskipper fishing master, which provided the much-needed drive for Sanpei to master the skill himself. Episodes can vary in storytelling; some can be as simple as a laid-back story about learning a new fishing technique, while others can be blood-pumping high-stakes insanity. For example, Episode 53 is a pretty laid-back episode about catching a golden koi and explaining the phenomenon behind its colour. Then, the stretch of episodes immediately following, episodes 54–57, has one of the craziest moments in the whole anime. The story starts off with Sanpei participating in a competition to troll the biggest marlin (a type of fish) as he meets a veteran fisherman who explains that years ago he and his friends were attacked by a massive marlin, which not only killed his friend but also damaged one of the old man’s eyes, ripped off his arm after it was caught in the fishing line, and was violently attacked in the stomach. After hearing this, Sanpei makes it his goal to find that same massive marlin. So eventually they find the fish out in the ocean, made clear by the fact that it seemingly recognised the old man after he joined alongside Sanpei. After a long battle to maintain the Marlin, the old man stands directly in front of it on his boat, and in a fit of rage, the Marlin jumps up and fucking leaps into the boat, causing a massive chunk to rip off, and continues to bash into the boat till it’s completely tired out, to which then the old man pierces its eye and finally kills it, but then immediately following a group of sharks appear, so Sanpei and the old man have a battle with the sharks so they don’t eat the dead marlin still in the water. After the insanity that was this stretch of episodes, the following episode is just a simple story about a unique use of bait to catch a certain fish. The way Sanpei can jump from laid-back stories detailing unique techniques or analysing fish to pure insanity with battles against fish makes getting into each episode always exciting.What makes some of these episodes so suspenseful is the inherently erratic nature of fish. Like in the aforementioned Marlin episode, when the Marlin suddenly pulls on Sanpei’s rod, it causes him to almost fly out of his trolling chair. There are many scenes like this throughout the anime that play on this unpredictableness. I’m a huge fan of both the laid-back educational episodes and the suspenseful, stakes-driven episodes. All of these aspects are what create such a unique experience where it’s both educational and entertaining, which is how Sanpei manages to make learning about fishing a very enjoyable experience.Sanpei himself is a fun character to follow. He is incredibly talented and knowledgeable about every aspect of fishing. Yet despite this greater knowledge, he’s always very humble. We get to see throughout the series Sanpei sharing his knowledge of fish with others, like in episode 83, wherein Sanpei is trying to teach his friend Yuri how to catch a fish using a dragonfly when a man walks up to them and asks if he can watch. Sanpei, realising the man knows this technique of fishing, immediately offers for the man to join in with them, and they spend the rest of the episode getting to know each other and enjoying their time fishing together. With that being said though, there are plenty of episodes about a technique or unique fish that Sanpei knows nothing about, yet he is always willing to learn about them. The mudskipper episode I mentioned before is a good example of this. This is an important aspect of what makes Tsurikichi Sanpei so entertaining. We, the audience, are learning these techniques and analyses about fish alongside Sanpei. It’s the opposite of another edutainment anime I love, Oishinbo, where Yamaoka is often the one telling others the facts and information about food. Riffing off of the Oishinbo comparison for a moment; one aspect of Oishinbo that I like a lot in comparison to Tsurikichi Sanpei is a sense of community.Sanpei meets a lot of people throughout the series, yet almost every character is self-contained within their respective episodic stories. In comparison, Oishinbo has many characters we meet throughout the series who reoccur, even if for only an episode or two. While I personally love this aspect of Oishinbo’s storytelling, it’s only fair to point out that the lack of said aspect in Tsurikichi Sanpei puts greater emphasis on other aspects. Like the aforementioned focus on the different techniques, unique locations, and different analyses of fish and their habitats, the characters within these stories are used to facilitate these ideas. This approach is entertaining in its own unique way. Though this isn’t to say the characters in these self-contained stories aren’t good. My favourite character is from the stretch of episodes 69–71, where Sanpei met a musician who ran away from this past life of mastering a complex netting technique but was convinced to reconcile his relationship with his father, eventually leading to him passing on his knowledge of this technique to Sanpei. It was a genuinely heartfelt tale and is one of my favourite stretches of episodes.A surprisingly prominent aspect of Tsurikichi Sanpei are tales of death. Sanpei meets many characters who either end up dying or have a family member who dies. Around the second half of the anime, there are about 7 to 8 episodes that feature a prominent character's death. In these episodes, Sanpei is understandably horrified by these deaths; however, these emotions are not felt nor expanded on in subsequent episodes due to the nature of the anime being purely episodic. Though, these little details really don’t affect the greater enjoyment of the anime, especially when it makes itself clear what the main focus is.Another aspect of Tsurikichi Sanpei’s storytelling is the occasional episode with commentary on the social aspects of fishing, such as proper etiquette when fishing around other fishermen. In episode 82, a fisherman was drilling too many holes at an ice lake and being an asshole to the people trying to warn him. Eventually, the ice cracks and causes a huge chunk to fall off, dragging the man down with it. This episode highlights the importance of being aware of those around you and the rules one should follow for the sake of everyone’s enjoyment. However, my favourite episode that tackles social topics has got to be episode 76, which focuses on debunking the myth that women (particularly middle-aged women and wives) are “unsuitable” for fishing. This episode has Sanpei and his friends meeting an older woman fishing at a lake who explains to them that she takes turns with her husband going on vacation out to this lake every year, with the other going to work to support each other financially. At the end of the episode, Sanpei admits that “thinking fishing isn’t suitable for women is not right” and is glad that he was able to talk and become friends with the older woman. Based as fuck episode, one of my favourites. There are also episodes about local folktales, like lake monsters or historically significant people and deities. These episodes are a great diversion from the usual educational episodes, which helps keep things interesting.Tsurikichi Sanpei has a strong visual style. With gorgeous background art and a focus on detailed fish, the anime does a great job translating the gorgeous art style of the manga into animation, keeping in mind that the art of Tsurikichi Sanpei’s manga is incredibly detailed and that naturally there’ll be cut corners when it comes to animation. The background colours are often muted, but it creates a good contrast in scenes where the colours are more vivid, especially during the freeze frames. Tsurikichi Sanpei, like many anime at the time, took influence from Dezaki’s visual style. This can be seen most commonly in Sanpei with the extensive use of freeze frames to highlight the details on fish when they’ve been caught. In general, Tsurikichi Sanpei puts a lot of emphasis on the detail of the fish, utilising different techniques to achieve a consistent quality of detail. In contrast, the character designs are kept simple yet recognizable. The freeze frames also emphasise the poses Sanpei does as he fishes. Actually, the pose Sanpei does as he’s pulling up fish is an important piece of Japanese pop culture, and you can find it referenced throughout anime and Japanese media.I’m unfortunately not that knowledgeable enough about the staff behind Sanpei to confidently describe their relations and contributions to the project in detail; however, I do highly recommend anyone who’s interested have a look at the staff list, as there are some interesting names behind this anime.Being one of the first anime about fishing, Tsurikichi Sanpei gets a lot of what makes for an entertaining series about fishing on its first try. By focusing on an educational style of storytelling, it’s able to cram every episode with new experiences and information. By being entirely episodic, it’s able to keep each episode fresh with new ideas and stories. Tsurikichi Sanpei’s attention to detail with the fish, not only in its art but also in its ability to analyse fish, is endlessly fascinating. As someone who doesn’t have much interest in fishing in real life, I still had a blast with everything this anime had to offer. If Tsurikichi Sanpei sounds like something you’d be interested in, then I absolutely recommend giving it a try. Thank you for reading my review.

While the amnesic element might be cliche for some of you, 我是江小白 handled this excellently by using 小白 (Xiao Bai)\'s amnesia as a plot device to nurture the relationship between 小白 (Xiao Bai) and the mysterious writer 佟离 (Tongli).  Every episode you find out more and more of Tongli\'s identity, Xiao Bai\'s missing memory and their connection. The drama in their relationship gets more and more interesting everytime Xiao Bai recalls one of his lost memory. Each time he does, you\'d find yourself shipping him with a different girl.Let\'s talk about the characters. Xiao Bai is...a flat character. He doesn\'t remember anything and most of his ""important"" screentime is him having headaches and trying to remember his past, so there isn\'t much to say about him. The female lead Tongli on the other hand is a more complex and rounder character in comparison. In fact, I go as far as to say she pretty much carries this show with her motives and emotions. I feel this show is more plot driven than character development as there isn\'t any plot element that demands change from the main characters. If anything, I found the characters in their flashback to be more fleshed out than the present day characters. I could honestly see that as a separate anime. I also especially loved the chemistry between Xiao Bai and 夕雨 (Xiyu) in their flashback.The music is great, one of the few occasions I\'d work up the effort and listen to the OP/ED. The band\'s unique song ""FLY"" is a very catchy song. After listening to it I found myself looking for it afterwards. I also commend the use of music in this show as it really helped heighten the emotional moments in this show.The animation is a bit tricky, a lot of people seem to not like CGI. I don\'t have a problem with the CGi myself, but that may be due to me being an active follower of RWBY. It isn\'t as unwatchable as the Berserk CGI and it isn\'t as good as the Ghost in the Shell CGI. It is middle-ground, but this is a romance drama show, not some action sci-fi show that needs impeccable animation.

He doesn\'t remember anything and most of his ""important"" screentime is him having headaches and trying to remember his past, so there isn\'t much to say about him. The female lead Tongli on the other hand is a more complex and rounder character in comparison. In fact, I go as far as to say she pretty much carries this show with her motives and emotions. I feel this show is more plot driven than character development as there isn\'t any plot element that demands change from the main characters. If anything, I found the characters in their flashback to be more fleshed out than the present day characters. I could honestly see that as a separate anime. I also especially loved the chemistry between Xiao Bai and 夕雨 (Xiyu) in their flashback.The music is great, one of the few occasions I\'d work up the effort and listen to the OP/ED. The band\'s unique song ""FLY"" is a very catchy song. After listening to it I found myself looking for it afterwards. I also commend the use of music in this show as it really helped heighten the emotional moments in this show.The animation is a bit tricky, a lot of people seem to not like CGI. I don\'t have a problem with the CGi myself, but that may be due to me being an active follower of RWBY.

There is a lot of twist and turns in the story and they drop a lot of foreshadowing which makes each twist more impact.

It only took me one episode oddly.Soundtrack is alright, its the generic chinese song but the theme song that was used was pretty good at make me feel the emotions.

[No spoilers (probably)]Story: 10Art: 4Sound: 9Character: 7Enjoyment: 8Overall: 8As a non-Japanese show, I was expecting something pretty cliché and boring story. It turned out to be a hidden gem- a near masterpiece. The pacing was perfect and managed to cramp all the necessary detail into a 12 episode long series. Both the innocent scenes and serious ones balances each other out filling each episode with rich and filler-free story....Art was... disappointing. After watching other Chinese shows like Quanzhi Gaoshou or even Quanzhi Fashi I was fairly disappointed to see the use of bad CGI on the characters, although I must admit the still scenes remind me of Your Name and A Silent Voice level of animation, but that\'s really the only reason I give the art a 4/10. At least it\'s not as bad as Bersek?Again, I wasn\'t really expecting anything out of the ordinary when it comes to sound quality and music. Voice actors and sound effects were pretty average, but the music is what gives more impact on the scenes. While I still think Japanese sound lovely, I wasn\'t expecting Chinese, with their ""Xi""s and ""Feng""s, to have a very soft tone with no hard pronunciations.Nothing really to be noted on the characters that would make them stand out. Fairly cliché personalities but amplified by the story.Overall this is definitely an anime I recommend if you\'re into the genres. A lot of people might have dropped it due to the CGI and framerate, but that\'s also a lot of people who have missed out on anything but the animation. If it wasn\'t for the art this would be the 3rd anime I\'d objectively give a solid 10/10. Art was... disappointing.

And there are these two girls Xiao Li and Xi Yu who both seem to have a connection with Xiao Bai. What happened in the past is the biggest mystery of this anime, and Xiao Bai’s long path to recover his memory makes you go through various emotions – impatience, frustration, and sadness but also empathy and happiness.Not only is the story really heart-warming and enjoyable, but the pacing is also really good, making you entertained until...the very last episode of the season. There are so many twists in the plot, I was really surprised and didn’t foresee at all what was gonna happen – I am usually not that naïve.Furthermore, you get deep immersion in the characters’ inside personalities and get to understand more and more every one’s motive.And the most important for me, music plays an important part in this anime, as we soon learn (in episode 1 or 2) that Xiao Bai and Xi Yu both used to play in a band together… This is great opportunity to enjoy some beautiful Chinese songs completely in match with the overall atmosphere.Art is good and background drawings are enjoyable, as much as daily life’s details, but as Chinese people say 美中不走 the characters are made with CGI and I can understand many will find it bad and unnatural. I definitely can’t say I love CGI in general, but I don’t hate it either. I don’t think the average quality of animation here is a major issue as I personally got used to it after the first two episodes.%%%%%%Overall, this anime is evidence that you don’t need extraordinary animation and techniques to make good anime – story, characters and OST are more important.

It was Chinese and I didn\'t really like their animation because of some other studios that I\'ve seen.First 5 minutes of the show the animation was little off and kinda buggy. I didn\'t dislike the CG animation though. It was great and I think Japanese Anime\'s should do this more often. I saw Berserk, Dragon Ball Super and Ajin do this quite often but I never saw it this smooth except for Berserk.After the first 5 minutes of the show you kinda get used to it. I liked the animation so much....It got smoother and better after a few more episodes. For a show to use CG in the whole show amazed me.The character art is great, It wasn\'t off that much and it was so clean. As I\'ve said I\'m looking forward to these type of animations in the future.As for the story. Some of you won\'t relate to it too much because of the ""Childhood Aspect"" and it might be quite confusing for you in the first 8 episodes. You just build it up then. The story gives hints and shocking things by then. It\'s like puzzling it all together. That\'s what made me watch it until the end in just one go. There\'s not much of comedy, just a bit of slice and life.I disliked 2 characters in the show but I get what the characters are saying in their parts. You won\'t really get the characters too much since it was focused on 2-4 characters in the show. A bunch of them ended up being background and supporting for the main character.The music is great, it\'s gonna fill your playlists up a lot. The soundtracks are nice and gives you a bit of a nostalgic feel in the ambient.This show is a 10/10 for me. It was the best anime I\'ve watched in a while.If you\'d like a story like this you might want to watch these five shows:1. Clannad2. Orange3. Air4. Your Lie in April5.

The story in general was at most mediocre, kind of had the same vibe as 2000-2010 yaoi anime, so immediately wasnt my favourite. But the ending scene just was not it. (Spoilers ahead) I have learned to kind of dismiss rape-y scenes in the yaoi genre cause its so normalised and frequent, but I cant anymore that was just plain wrong and the dude was sorta coerced into doing it, it just doesnt sit well with me. The story had potential but it just didnt work. I wouldnt recommend, however...if you still want to watch it, it is available on youtube (i cant seem to find it anywhere else). if you still want to watch it, it is available on youtube (i cant seem to find it anywhere else).', 'I had high hopes for Yes ka No ka Hanbun ka, but it fell victim to a few stereotypical shounen ai/BL/yaoi tropes which made it fall short of its potential.THE GOOD--------------This anime definitely accomplished a lot story-wise for being under an hour long. The storyline does hinge on the classic ""misunderstanding that spirals out of control"" set up, but the way it played out felt more unique in a way I really enjoyed. The main character, Kei, also felt unique and had some nice character development.Finally, the animation and voice acting was very nice -- especially shounen ai usually doesn\'t get the biggest of budgets....No complaints there!THE BAD----------------It would have been nice to see a little more personality in the secondary character, Tsuzuki. He kind of just existed, with the most memorable thing about him being...yeah, nothing really. Really, I think this film would have benefitted from an additional 30 mins. of run time. I know this was adapted from a LN (which I haven\'t read) so maybe the story shown is all there is to it, but overall the relationship between the characters felt shallow and it would have been nice to have some more time to see that deepen and make me care more.THE UGLY---------------HEY BL CREATORS: There\'s one trope that\'s hated more than any other BL trop out there. LET\'S STOP DOING IT, okay?

Why is this still considered acceptable? I admit, I'm not familiar with the light novel, so maybe it wasn't as creepy, or maybe it just has a big following, but why did this have to be one of the few BL works to be adapted into animation recently? Why did they choose this one?Yes ka (shortened for the sake of my fingers) is, according to this adaptation, a very traditional BL that follows along the lines of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi and the like. Literally everything about this production screams of a work that's right at home in that mid 2000s to around the...2011 mark, and the animation quality and lineart will back me up on that one. I legitimately think that the Black Butler anime, which debuted in 2008 (and which I also dislike heavily) had better looking art than this film in every sense. There must have been budget issues going on behind the scenes, or else this movie got shafted in terms of funding. The musical score also screamed 'royalty free', I must say, in that the vast majority of it is comprised of plinky piano tracks that kind of sound like someone listened to a shitload of Ludovico Einaudi's ambient piano themes and decided, with no composition experience whatsoever, that they could 'do it better'.The story is... humdrum. Not bad, not good. It's tropey for anyone who's squinted at BL in the last quarter century, but not unbearable. Its themes are pretty obvious, and in some cases literally spelled out to viewers, and while they're quite nice themes most of the time, I can't call this well written. This is writing that comes at you in a back alley with a hammer. No shade on the LN, because I can't rightly say whether that was any good, particularly since translations can be a bit shaky. But this film, at least, was very blunt with its overall themes of duality of self and such. (Edit: in hindsight, the reason for this is likely that the scenes and dialogue are lacking in subtext. Scenes do exactly what they need to do to showcase the movie's themes, and no more. They don't really serve to enrich the characterisation, or actually dissect the subtextual themes, or present interesting ideas. There's no hidden or double or nuanced meaning to think about in Tsuzuki's stop motion animation, or in his dialogue with Kunieda, just a very bluntly delivered message that serves to highlight how nakedly artificial that message is in the context of the film. If the film had purposefully set up Tsuzuki's dual nature, through foreshadowing in his dialogue and interests, and thereby made the rape at the end make sense, this could have been a brilliant Hannibal-esque toxic romance, where Kunieda's pride prevents him from speaking out in the end, thereby solidly delivering on his own characterisation as someone who internalises his problems.) If you want a film that actually discusses that theme properly, maybe try Perfect Blue instead. If there hadn't been rape, I'd probably be calling this a tropey but cute BL film to watch when you want to shut your brain off, and given it a 6/10. But really, the thing everyone's really here to discuss is the rape, so let's get onto that, because it's a doozy.Now, BL has some interesting roots that I won't go into too heavily here, but needless to say, it was important in allowing women to enter the manga industry. Look up 'Year 24 group' or 'the 49-ers', or the works of Mori Mari if you're curious. Long story short, this gave us works with very androgynous, almost 'third gender' characters that could be projected onto by just about anyone, such as Gilbert from Kaze to Ki no Uta. In terms of female empowerment, it removed the woman from a sexual scenario, so that they could enjoy romance without placing themselves in situations they found threatening, due to the power dynamic between men and women at the time. Despite doing a fair amount of research for a layman, I'm honestly not sure how this ideal metamorphosed into the creepy, toxic BL tropes we see today, but I suspect a little film called 'Death in Venice' might have some answers. DiV is, at its core, a pedophile fantasy that the author, Thomas Mann, drew from his obsession with a Polish tween he met while on vacation in Venice. This work was, arguably, very influential on some members of the 49ers back in the seventies, and it's not surprising that the idea of a bigger, older man forcing sexual scenarios onto a younger, protesting, boyish character would enter the BL scene, although DiV ends with the obsessed man dying of cholera the moment he decides to actually do something. I can't prove it, but I know DiV was influential on those people, and it seemed plausible as to where this trope could have originated.Anyway, we got the Seme-Uke thing somewhere along the line, either from works like Death in Venice, or possibly from the 'grow your own spouse' elements of the Tale of Genji, or possibly even through cross-contamination with the shoujo industry's complicated relationship with writing women. And it's bad, at least for gay men's general health and wellbeing. Because BL isn't about androgynes like Gilbert anymore, but much more recognizably about men, with male physiques and rippling muscles, and when you factor in the DiV angle... urgh. Yeah, gay men have been grappling with the rapist/pedophile accusations for longer than I've been alive, and this work does absolutely nothing to change that perception. We're in 2021 now. Gay marriage has been legalized in a lot of countries. And last month, Japan pushed out a dated-looking fifty minute 'film' that features one of the worst 'rape as love' moments I've seen in years.It's not uncommon for a character to moan 'yamero...' in Japanese erotica (women would probably say 'yamete...' instead), which can literally be translated as 'stop...', but Japanese is a pretty thorny language when sex is involved, as far as I can tell as a non-native semi-speaker. 'Iyada', meaning 'don't' isn't unheard of, but often the reason for all of this is essentially 'we shouldn't do this, it's embarrassing for me', because of Japan's very reserved attitude towards sex. Hence the preponderance of characters declaring 'I can't control myself anymore!' while their love interest essentially screams 'we can't!'. This whole self control vs loss of control thing makes some amount of sense to me, given the cultural background. Now, what I can't get my head around is Tsuzuki's absolutely cursed sounding ways of essentially denying Kunieda's right to say no to him. I get that Kunieda isn't averse to the idea of having sex with Tsuzuki, but he was definitely saying 'not right now', even in the cursed world of BL translation. And then Tsuzuki held him down and screwed him anyway. Look, if that whole pre-sex business was meant to come across as tsundere flirting, then maybe it shouldn't have been shot at dutch angles, and maybe the VAs shouldn't have made it sound quite so realistically panicked.Either way, it's presented as a solidly 'rape as love' angle, and it was horrible to witness. It felt out of character for Tsuzuki to be so inconsiderate and pushy over sex. Maybe this work was meant to make me wonder if Tsuzuki also had another side, but that wasn't established at all, and his 'other side' is so repulsive yet treated as loveable with no explanation that I can't not call it bad writing. It felt out of character for Kunieda to be fine with things after that, considering his bitchy personality. If Kunieda had a rape fetish in the story, or this had been presented as a legitimate BDSM relationship with safewords, I might have been cool with this. Rape presented as a sign of true love is way too accepted in the BL industry, and despite the help BL has given women in becoming mangaka historically, this needs to stop. I don't give a damn how wet the uke's screams made you. This kind of depiction is quantifiably harmful for gay men in real life.We can all do better than this crap by now. 2011 mark, and the animation quality and lineart will back me up on that one. I legitimately think that the Black Butler anime, which debuted in 2008 (and which I also dislike heavily) had better looking art than this film in every sense. There must have been budget issues going on behind the scenes, or else this movie got shafted in terms of funding. The musical score also screamed 'royalty free', I must say, in that the vast majority of it is comprised of plinky piano tracks that kind of sound like someone listened to a shitload of Ludovico Einaudi's ambient piano themes and decided, with no composition experience whatsoever, that they could 'do it better'.The story is... humdrum. Not bad, not good. It's tropey for anyone who's squinted at BL in the last quarter century, but not unbearable. Its themes are pretty obvious, and in some cases literally spelled out to viewers, and while they're quite nice themes most of the time, I can't call this well written. This is writing that comes at you in a back alley with a hammer. No shade on the LN, because I can't rightly say whether that was any good, particularly since translations can be a bit shaky. But this film, at least, was very blunt with its overall themes of duality of self and such. (Edit: in hindsight, the reason for this is likely that the scenes and dialogue are lacking in subtext. Scenes do exactly what they need to do to showcase the movie's themes, and no more. They don't really serve to enrich the characterisation, or actually dissect the subtextual themes, or present interesting ideas. There's no hidden or double or nuanced meaning to think about in Tsuzuki's stop motion animation, or in his dialogue with Kunieda, just a very bluntly delivered message that serves to highlight how nakedly artificial that message is in the context of the film. If the film had purposefully set up Tsuzuki's dual nature, through foreshadowing in his dialogue and interests, and thereby made the rape at the end make sense, this could have been a brilliant Hannibal-esque toxic romance, where Kunieda's pride prevents him from speaking out in the end, thereby solidly delivering on his own characterisation as someone who internalises his problems.) If you want a film that actually discusses that theme properly, maybe try Perfect Blue instead. If there hadn't been rape, I'd probably be calling this a tropey but cute BL film to watch when you want to shut your brain off, and given it a 6/10. But really, the thing everyone's really here to discuss is the rape, so let's get onto that, because it's a doozy.Now, BL has some interesting roots that I won't go into too heavily here, but needless to say, it was important in allowing women to enter the manga industry. Look up 'Year 24 group' or 'the 49-ers', or the works of Mori Mari if you're curious. Long story short, this gave us works with very androgynous, almost 'third gender' characters that could be projected onto by just about anyone, such as Gilbert from Kaze to Ki no Uta. In terms of female empowerment, it removed the woman from a sexual scenario, so that they could enjoy romance without placing themselves in situations they found threatening, due to the power dynamic between men and women at the time. Despite doing a fair amount of research for a layman, I'm honestly not sure how this ideal metamorphosed into the creepy, toxic BL tropes we see today, but I suspect a little film called 'Death in Venice' might have some answers. DiV is, at its core, a pedophile fantasy that the author, Thomas Mann, drew from his obsession with a Polish tween he met while on vacation in Venice. This work was, arguably, very influential on some members of the 49ers back in the seventies, and it's not surprising that the idea of a bigger, older man forcing sexual scenarios onto a younger, protesting, boyish character would enter the BL scene, although DiV ends with the obsessed man dying of cholera the moment he decides to actually do something. I can't prove it, but I know DiV was influential on those people, and it seemed plausible as to where this trope could have originated.Anyway, we got the Seme-Uke thing somewhere along the line, either from works like Death in Venice, or possibly from the 'grow your own spouse' elements of the Tale of Genji, or possibly even through cross-contamination with the shoujo industry's complicated relationship with writing women. And it's bad, at least for gay men's general health and wellbeing. Because BL isn't about androgynes like Gilbert anymore, but much more recognizably about men, with male physiques and rippling muscles, and when you factor in the DiV angle... urgh. Yeah, gay men have been grappling with the rapist/pedophile accusations for longer than I've been alive, and this work does absolutely nothing to change that perception. We're in 2021 now. Gay marriage has been legalized in a lot of countries. And last month, Japan pushed out a dated-looking fifty minute 'film' that features one of the worst 'rape as love' moments I've seen in years.It's not uncommon for a character to moan 'yamero...' in Japanese erotica (women would probably say 'yamete...' instead), which can literally be translated as 'stop...', but Japanese is a pretty thorny language when sex is involved, as far as I can tell as a non-native semi-speaker. 'Iyada', meaning 'don't' isn't unheard of, but often the reason for all of this is essentially 'we shouldn't do this, it's embarrassing for me', because of Japan's very reserved attitude towards sex. Hence the preponderance of characters declaring 'I can't control myself anymore!' while their love interest essentially screams 'we can't!'. This whole self control vs loss of control thing makes some amount of sense to me, given the cultural background. Now, what I can't get my head around is Tsuzuki's absolutely cursed sounding ways of essentially denying Kunieda's right to say no to him.

And don't get me wrong, you can definitely portray rape in movies. But the moment you portray it as something to be accepted in a relationship, as something normal, that's where you cross the line.I think it's time we finally got some more BL animes with consensual...sex , is it that hard? All you needed to do was for both characters to want to have sex, how is it so impossible to do?And an argument, that you can't stop doing it, when you've already started, that it's not fair, is just plain wrong. If someone tells you to stop when you're about to have sex, you are going to stop.  I mean why, when the person you love is crying, saying it hurts, why for the love of God would you completely ignore him begging you to stop?This scene was completely out of character for both main characters, it was completely unnecessary and it seriously needs to stop.So yeah, I would still recommend you watch this, but stop after they kiss at the end. sex , is it that hard?

But compared to other yaoi/sho-ai, the progression is relatively natural (if you exclude the reason why Kunieda helped Tsuzuki in the first place, that is). The pacing was really good. It wasn't too fast for me to feel annoyed and awkward, but it's not too slow for me to feel frustrated. The little bits about the show-biz/news-biz/entertainment world are interesting, as well as the technique about pronunciation/articulation which is important in the industry and, interestingly, serves as a plot device.[4/10 for Art]: I googled the original illustration for the light novel, and honestly I don't think this anime...did it justice. The novel's illustration looks really pretty, soft, and has a 'light' feeling to it (perhaps also because of the 'soft filter' it uses. I probably didn't explain it right, but just google the novel's cover and you'll know what I mean). The anime's art, on the other hand, didn't even attempt anything special, not even to distinguish itself from the light novel's illustration. It looks mediocre for a 2020 anime. The character design also looked different. They appeared slightly chubbier in the anime.[7/10 for Sound]: It makes sense for the anime to talk a lot about voices/sounds considering the setting and I think the casting for the VA was really great to maintain that energy. Abe Atsushi's voice suits Kunieda's character a lot and he did well in making the voice for both sides of Kunieda distinguishable. A lot of Kunieda's mannerisms also seemed to translate to the voice. I enjoyed hearing it a lot. Kawahara Yoshihisa, on the other hand, was just okay for me. It's not that he's bad... I actually think he did better than average, but I think it's just the kind of voice that is typical for a 'seme' in yaoi, so it didn't leave that deep of an impression.[4/10 for Character]: Kunieda is a relatable, yet interesting character. I think I relate to his dilemma about work ethics and job position a lot. His duality, even though exaggerated, is humane. A lot of yaoi MC annoyed me but I'm glad Kunieda didn't (perhaps it's because I saw too much yaoi MC who's easily flustered over every little thing the seme said/did and Kunieda, who the majority of the time wasn't like that, refreshed me). Tsuzuki seemed genuine, kind, and straight-forward. I have to say, he didn't seem very special, but he was personable and seemed like a guy we encounter in our everyday life./!!!spoilery paragraph!!!/I, however, don't like the part where Tsuzuki ignored Kunieda's plea to stop the sex when he's scared. The guy also didn't stop when Kunieda said he was hurt, which I think is an asshole move. With the way the story progressed so far and how kind & understanding Tsuzuki seemed to be, I would've thought that he'd stop. But no, apparently this is still a yaoi movie and characters don't care when their partner is hurting as long as they can serve sex to the audience.

But, come on.Nah, I'm not judging and I'm not writing this at rage (I was actually gonna start differently before reading them and I wanted so see if I watched the same movie as everyone else, if you know what I mean) but I think that being progressist about it is ruining a scene that I liked because...I laughed my ass off on the dialogues. I, as well, felt a bit weird about that scene, I'm not gonna hide it, but I personally don't mind at all cause I take it as just fiction and in real life I know it's wrong.If you really, really are gonna take a cartoon so seriously, I'd say either don't watch or skip as said below me (but why would you start watching something just to skip it at the end?). Anyways, let's start.I really don't have anything new to say that's not been said before, I actually wanted to make my point up there xD but I'll write some more things I liked about this movie for you to understand my rating.- Kunieda is so relatable, I liked having those doubts about himself and his career, it's really normal to have those kind of questions. I laughed a lot with him being so hysterical (yes, I like tsunderes) and double-faced. His voice actor made an splendid and outstanding job and I can see we are all agree about it.- Tsuzuki is okay but he has great lines sometimes that also made me laugh a lot to think that he was damned right but in the ''wrong way''.I also agree that Kunieda's career felt a filler and bored me at the beggining but that didn't take very much screen time to be fair and I actually liked that final post-credit scene, I felt they took charge of every little thing presented in the movie and had a nice conclusion (and also an opening to another movie, maybe?). It's a shame the art is not as cute as the LN.The story is the most typical and normal thing in BL/Yaoi: the uke being tsudere about the seme and having doubts because #homo and encountering in the most convenient way possible to rush a short story, which I personally didn't mind at all cause I didn't feel it was a bother. Nothing you've never seen before though.Then why did I rate a 9? Well, I can't put 8.5 and I wanted to give a higher note cause nothing I've seen lately made me laugh so hard with only simple dialogues and also it had a little phonetics lesson and I love phonetics and phonology so this rating is purely subjective to my own tastes and I guess I'm in a good mood. I really liked this movie, simple as that.If I had to be as objective as possible this is a plain 7/8 cause the story and charas are really normal but it is consistent at the very least with almost everything it has (trust me, I've seen much worse OVAs that lead to nowhere and have zero sense AND also raping scenes, so...).

The way that the semi-last scene was written was quite uncomfortable, however, I disagree with the other reviewers and think that it wasn't as detrimental to the quality of the movie as they are suggesting.[Story]The story was simple and cute with an interesting dynamic. I learnt a bit more about news reporters and stop motion and it was an easy watch.[Art]I liked the way the art was. Also simple but cute. No yaoi hands or chins and pretty eyes.[Sound]Meh, could've been better but it's just a romance anime so it's fine....[Character]While the MC and main love interest didn't seem to have any friends lol, their personalities were both sweet in their own ways. I would've loved a deeper delve into it but that might not have suited the vibe of the movie so idm not knowing more :)[Enjoyment]I found myself laughing at the tropes that I saw. I guess as someone who has seen/read a fair amount of bl I'm used to them and worse so this just kind of felt innocently thoughtless. The only potentially 'damaging' aspect of this movie was the semi-last scene where they (spoilers) had sex.Now I personally find it very very annoying when writers needlessly do this. I would have much preferred if they both consented and instead of showing him literally saying 'no', show him saying 'yes' if you know what I mean. Playing devil's advacate, I could say that it's in Kei's character to be a little tsundere and not be honest with what he wants when it comes to romance at least and that's why they still had sex, but I could ALSO say that Tsuzuki seems to be the type of guy who would listen when someone says no with how caring he was shown to be.This is a problem with bl, but also romance fiction in general. I love it when the more submissive person in the relationship is still a person and consents and enjoys it. Roleplay is different (the rape fantasy) compared to when characters are explicitly rejecting the proposal but it happens anyway. I don't care about this shit in hentai but writers...when we've read/watched about their damn relationship and root for them, don't expect it not to annoy us when you make poor writing decisions....that said, I don't think it took much away from the story. Yes it's a, frankly, toxic trope that we would do 10298% better without but what if Kei actually wanted it? What if they had a good time and later discussed consenting better? I, personally, can sort of move on from it and ignore it in a sense as another bad (bad bad) trope and still see the movie as a good watch. I do respect you if you can't though.[Overall]I'd recommend watching it. It is not as bad as these reviews are making it out to be, I've seen much much worse which isn't to say it's flawless, but come on...If you like bl, try it out.

One as a Calm, Friendly, Polite News Anchor and other as a well... his inner thoughts which are filled with frankness about his feelings without holding anything back. Everyone only sees the...New Anchor persona and not the Inner thoughts one. Then he meets the LI and I surprised by how well their relationship developed.The LI meets both personas of our MC and gets close to both. Is friends and has heart to heart conversations with both. I expected the LI to be your typical Yaoi Seme but he's not. WowI like how MC and LI get together too. All in all I am impressed!I really like our MC and how his hardwork is recognised.If you are used to BL then you can give this a shot. Both of them have a good relationship growth and their feelings felt natural.The only problem which can't be ignored no matter what is the last 5 mins where they sleep together. It's not rape like in so many BL animes where it's easily brushed aside by the Anime like it's not rape where the Uke(the Bottom) is clearly trying to push away the Seme(the top) and is trying to escape the situation and the Seme is basically forcing himself on the Uke and calls it love. It's not that! It is consensual for the most part but... if you don't mind minor spoilers read ahead. Nothing Plot Related. I had to bring down my rating from 7 to 6 all because of this scene and how troubling it is and how much of a wrong message it sends.Minor Spoilers:-It's hard to say it's not consensual and that's the problem.

I think he was scared... to take that step maybe not terrified but scared of the new experience which is a a vulnerable moment  and it wasn't respected enough by the LI and it feels OOC of the LI to just tell him that he can't hold bac.The MC didn't hit the LI or push him away... I mean the MC is Not Rejecting the LI and the LI doesn't seem like he is forcing himself on the MC but It's just odd. It leaves an icky feeling. I don't like it. I hate that I have to bring down the 7 to 6 because of this one scene!!!They could have gone the Consent route completely! I don't understand why they had to make the LI suddenly be the Yaoi troupe! That's the disappointing part. Very disappointing. Made me question all my enjoyment till now.It could have been perfect because neither of them were being your typical Yaoi Anime Troupes. Their relationship felt natural. I love how they started to like each other for a reason! Then this happens.The Sleeping Part which is I guess Mostly consensual but not really! UGH they should stop doing this!If only there was a scene where the LI stops and talks to the MC about it and respects MC when he says no . I am giving a 6 for rest of the story and because MC doesn't look like he is scared of LI himself but more of going all the way. New Anchor persona and not the Inner thoughts one. Then he meets the LI and I surprised by how well their relationship developed.The LI meets both personas of our MC and gets close to both. Is friends and has heart to heart conversations with both. I expected the LI to be your typical Yaoi Seme but he's not. WowI like how MC and LI get together too. All in all I am impressed!I really like our MC and how his hardwork is recognised.If you are used to BL then you can give this a shot. Both of them have a good relationship growth and their feelings felt natural.The only problem which can't be ignored no matter what is the last 5 mins where they sleep together. It's not rape like in so many BL animes where it's easily brushed aside by the Anime like it's not rape where the Uke(the Bottom) is clearly trying to push away the Seme(the top) and is trying to escape the situation and the Seme is basically forcing himself on the Uke and calls it love. It's not that! It is consensual for the most part but... if you don't mind minor spoilers read ahead. Nothing Plot Related.

Yoroiden Samurai Troopers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1264/Yoroiden_Samurai_Troopers,"[""Honestly: Ronin Warriors is kind of an awful series. The story is rambling and at times nonsensical [especially the English adaptation], which consistently wonky art and animation. The sound tends to be ridiculous [evil theme music precedes every villian ever] and totally period-80s. The characters are maybe the best out of all of the series' points, with mulleted teenage boys and ridiculous villians that are dopey and endearing. The voice-acting has a few gems: in Japanese, Takeshi Kusao voices the main character, Ryo, and Nozomu Sasaki voices Shin; in English there's Matt Hill as Ryo and Scott McNeil as the warlord Kale. However, the English...dub also has voice-actors doubling up on roles [Cye and Sage, Rowen and Sekmet, Anubis and other random villians], which makes for a few ridiculous moments where it's so, so obvious.Also honestly: I love all of those flaws so, so much. I grew up with Ronin Warriors. It's one of the first anime I ever saw, and when I was 11, I was in love with it. Almost 10 years later, I have such a huge spot in my heart for it, I can't do much else except keep loving it. It can be so silly, so strangely suggestive, and yet, so pure and innocent. You can laugh at it for being bad--I do. I very much do. But I also love it because it embraces everything it's trying to be, and it does nothing halfway. If two characters are going to be the embodiment of mere helpless humans that the Ronin Warriors have to continually protect, then they're going to be the most irritating things in the world. If a villain is going to have his heart set on engulfing Japan in darkness, then he's going to cast a massive shadow over Shinjuku and laugh maniacally for a full minute. If a character decides he's going to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind, then by god, his comrades are going to cry gratuitous shoujo-tears while dealing killing blows in an inexplicably naked fashion.And my love will abide. dub also has voice-actors doubling up on roles [Cye and Sage, Rowen and Sekmet, Anubis and other random villians], which makes for a few ridiculous moments where it's so, so obvious.Also honestly: I love all of those flaws so, so much.

The licensors originally intended to keep its true title, Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, but because of Saban Entertainment&rsquo;s two big name titles at the time: Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad and VR Troopers having the names in their titles, they feared a law suit. I know it&rsquo;s stupid, but this is America we&rsquo;re talking about. But I think Ronin Warriors is also an appropriate title for our cast of characters. Despite the title and name changes, as well as some other ones in context to the story, it maintains a substantial amount of faithfulness...in presentation with character interaction, development, and themes such as friendship and unity. But for what it&rsquo;s worth, the story is appropriately paced and stunningly engaging. I was really captivated by how much Ryo values his friendship with his teammates, and it was also an anime that had death scenes and showed a naked woman on early after noon television. So some of those qualities were just unique to me during that one summer vacation of 1995. But beyond that, I also loved its approach to the concept of what defines good and evil in a way that my 11-year-old mind at the time could handle.Of course some major flaws and issues people will have is that the team doesn&rsquo;t have an official back-story. Such as how and why they got their armors.  In the Japanese version, some of the characters are descended from samurai which does give some indication that they were bounded by blood or destiny to become so. But I heard there are some manga material and drama cds that do give some elaboration to this.Well, to some people the style may not really be unique, but to me when I was getting into anime, seeing the art alone was enough to tell me that I should watch this show. To me, the art was fresh, sharp, original, and distinctive. And for some reason, I still have some of those same impressions to this day though it&rsquo;s not as strong as it was 13 years ago. Granted the multi-color scheme was very Power Rangers-ish for that time period, I just thought the designs of both the Ronin and Dynasty Warriors brought out a really retro and original approach to the style. I was truly frightened with what the bad guys&rsquo; armors looked like and the power it had. And even though the attacks relied on recycled footage, I just love how dramatic they were and how much detail they put into the movement and expressions. The fights at the time were very exciting and high octane for me because like I said, it was something new and it just pulled me in. But I did notice the use of hyper space backgrounds and ever since then as well as in other anime, they still bother me to this day. I want to say more but I&rsquo;ll leave what I say in relation to this topic for my overall commentary.OK, the English opening theme was cheesy, but I just loved the guitars. Granted it didn&rsquo;t have a Japanese feel to it, but I thought it was still hypnotic. But I do appreciate that the dub still kept the original background music soundtrack. I always loved the guitar edition of the first ending theme, Far Away, and I thought it was always appropriately used and it always stuck out to me, as well as other background mixes of the other songs such as Stardust Eyes and Samurai Heart. But when you hear the actual theme songs, they have this certain Japanese authenticity to the show.The dub may sound cheesy and lame to some people, but I personally still love it to this day. I think the dub is appropriately 90s and I think the accents for some of the characters truly reflected their personalities. I liked Cye&rsquo;s or Shin&rsquo;s or whoever you want to call him&rsquo;s British accent. I think it perfectly brings out his gentle and happy nature. I also loved Jason Gray Stafford as Kento or Xiu. He brought out his party animal personality and I also enjoyed Matt Hill as Ryo or Raioh or whatever pronunciation you want to use. I recognized his voice as Captain N the first time I heard it and I just simply liked him for the role. And the dub voices of the Warlords were excellent and they just brought out the true evil in them. But I also think the Japanese version is also excellent in its own right. I truly enjoyed Kusao Takeshi&rsquo;s Ryo as well and brought out his qualities in his own right as well as being passionate and commanding. And Wakamoto Norio, who voiced Cell in DBZ I thought was also great as Kaos or The Ancient One, and the English voice actor, Michael Dobson brought a great charisma to that role as well. I say watch both English and Japanese versions not to see which version is better, but to just overall enjoy it.Well, as you can tell by this review, every time I watch and talk about this anime, the inner child inside me who first watched comes out and talks about his impressions after watching it the first time. I was officially watching anime for barely six months at that point and I thought it was unique to see anime on TV at the time. Keep in mind that shortly after, DBZ and Sailor Moon would soon follow, but would have yet find any mainstream success. The reason why I feel I can&rsquo;t be outraged over what was changed and edited is not really over the legal circumstances, but I felt that despite whatever changes were made, I personally felt that this anime still had all of its qualities that made it likeable as an anime. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like any direct Japanese references were cut out. I was captured by how the story wasn&rsquo;t traditionally episodic as I grew up with American cartoons.

This show aired on Toonami in the afternoon alongside DBZ, Gundam Wing, and Sailor Moon. What made this one stick out is that it is several years older than most of the anime from Toonami and really has that vintage 1980s look and feel to it. Although it certainly has some flaws, it is a cheesy fun experience that still commands a cult following in 2014. Actually, it was recently announced that this series is going...to be re-released on blu-ray!Plot and characters: 4/10The plot is that an evil demon was defeated over 1,000 years ago and his mighty armor was divided into 9 separate suits, each having a different element and virtue that it represents. Of course this means that 5 suits end up being used by the good guys and 4 by bad guys because it is fucking MANDATORY for every anime and Sentai (NOT hentai you pervs) show in this genre to feature a 5 man team. It is also pretty much required for each member to have a different color and element, and to strike cool group poses all the time. Of course there is also an animal sidekick and chick to be the team\'s cheerleader. Even the unconventional 4 man Ninja Turtles had to have April O\'Neal.  This show really used a cookie cutter 80s formula that will give modern viewers a good look at how pretty much all childrens\' action shows looked and felt at that time period. When the armors of fire, water, wind, earth, and void combine together, they summon Captain Planet! Wait! They summon the Inferno Armor! Inferno Armor is what I meant to say! One interesting thing the show did was that even the 4 ""Dark Warlords"" each had a virtue that they followed. This at least gave it a small bit of moral complexity and not just pure good vs. evil.Art and sound 4/10Ronin Warriors featured the same ""finisher moves"" in every episode which each had the same few minutes of animation used over and over. This meant that an average episode would be 20 minutes with 10 minutes of new footage and 10 minutes of recycled animation used in all 39 episodes. Even shows with larger budgets like Sailor Moon used LOTS of recycled animation at this period, so this was simply accepted as the norm by anime fans. Today we are far more spoiled and would never simply accept a show being this fucking lazy and cheap. The soundtrack is allright, although if you are expecting cheesy 80s songs like Top Gun or Rocky 4 than you will be sadly disappointed.Overall: 5/10I gave it an extra point for nostalgia and cheesyness. This isn\'t a good show, but it was a fun little show back in the late 1990s when I was 10 years old. I\'m sure if a kid today watched it, he or she would be like...""The fuck was that shit?!"" However, it still holds a special place for me as a silly bit of my childhood. to be re-released on blu-ray!Plot and characters: 4/10The plot is that an evil demon was defeated over 1,000 years ago and his mighty armor was divided into 9 separate suits, each having a different element and virtue that it represents.

Even the staff involved such as director Masashi Ikeda (Gundam Wing, Inuyasha) and with Shinji Takamatsu (After War Gundam X, Gintama) doing storyboard and episode directing, Ronin Warriors has all of the tools to succeed. Finally, the voice acting, both English and Japanese are all known actors in the anime industry.However, even with a strong company and a strong staff, with terrible writing beyond imagination, this anime cannot make up for it. The plot is...incredibly simplistic. A demon, Talpa, was defeated in the past, and is coming back with his four evil henchmen to conquer the mortal world. Now, five warriors must stand in his way to defeat him. Going a bit further, each hero possesses an armor of different elements with a virtue, as well as the four bad guys.Ronin Warriors has typical uninspiring repetitive music, with constantly recycled poorly done animation sequences. For example, the transformations and powers are used over and over again in every episode making up for about 40% of each episode. The rest of the episode consists of no explanation to anything, only the fact that evil is taking over and must be defeated.What this shows lacks the most is, nothing is original at all. It’s a hero team of five, with a useless female teacher, a useless boy whom always gets in the way, and a crazy animal sidekick (white tiger) that their entire function is to basically be sideline annoyances.With little to no back-story, awful character development, poor animation, bland music, and horrible writing, Ronin Warriors is a show that must be skipped. Anyone with nostalgia for this show must stay way clear in fear of ruining childhood memories. incredibly simplistic.

DOOM -copyright the Japanese dub and accompanying English subs, which are truly a treasure- It was, I think, the second anime I watched, and the first one I ever fell in love with, and the first I ever owned.The plot is... largely bad, and it\'s so obviously built to pad time that it\'s somewhat laughable. We\'ll ignore the plot holes large enough to fill the Grand Canyon. After all, that\'s what the show did. Characters are so dense...they could probably stop bullets with it. The dialogue is at times phenomenally stupid and laughably stupid, with occasional bursts of heart. This was first released in 1988, and the art quality (not the style) looks it.It has every bad hallmark of 80s-90s anime you can think of, even if you ignore the cheeseball dialogue DOOM. Repetitive overuse of the same long transformation and attack sequences (not just calling out the name of the attack and starting it, but actual movement) to cut costs and save time on writing plot by filling episode length. The only show I can think of that was worse with this was the old ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoon.Annoying child character/audience stand-in who serves no purpose other than to be rescued and be a whiny asshat. Lots of damseling the single female character in the main cast. And then adding a female antagonist who also gets damselled a lot. Sentient-ish animal sidekick. Convenient (with the copyright logo) villain dumbassery. A truly random baseball sequence that... I still don\'t understand. At all. But you know. Why not? The protagonists are only 14-15 anyway.That\'s not to say there aren\'t some very good plot ideas and episodes in the series. E03, E05, E10, E21, and E32 are particularly close to my heart. I\'m biased because I\'m a Ryo fan, if it wasn\'t obvious.If you\'re looking for cheese that\'s so bad it\'s funny, this skids the line of not quite making it there? Sure, DOOM is added to almost every villain\'s dialogue at least three times an episode, and the mangst wavers between good fanfiction fodder and true cheese, but well... This probably is not the corny thing you want to watch for shits and giggles while you get drunk or something. It\'s too slow most of the time for that. Although if you\'re watching the English dub, at least revel in the fact that Matt Hill, who voices Ryo, also voiced Ed from ""Ed, Edd, and Eddy"". ""Your mother wears army boots"" indeed, my dear, stupid English dub. (what does that line even MEAN I ask you)The series has a ton of potential. There\'s a rich bed of Japanese fantasy lore in the show that you don\'t see in a ton of easily recyclable shonen from the era. I\'d love to see a modern adaptation of this. It would be spectacular. Particularly if the main cast got character development. The art, for all that it\'s generic 80s-90s quality, has a neat style that could do well on a modern show. The armors all have neat designs, particularly the Shiroi Kikotei. It\'s not surprising that this is the studio that went on to produce the ""Escaflowne"" movie in 2000, for better and different kinds of worse.The first ED, ""Faraway"", by Mariko Uranishi, is quite good. The rest of the music is forgettable. I seem to vaguely recall that the English OPs were pretty bad, but it\'s been so long since I watched the dub that it\'s thankfully faded from my memory.Honestly, if you aren\'t watching this for the nostalgia factor, I\'d suggest skipping it. It hasn\'t aged well at all. And are the OVAs bad? Yes. Yes they are. All three of them. Oh you didn\'t know there were OVAs? How fortunate for YOU.Unfortunately there really aren\'t alternatives that hit the same-ish genre spots as this that I\'d recommend. Too many mecha or samurai shows are terrible for similar and somewhat worse reasons, particularly from the same era.  ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" is an amazing Japan-centric supernatural/fantasy show I\'d always recommend, but it\'s not shonen or mecha. ""Macross Frontier"" is pretty, with some good plot and mangst, and some great music, even if it does succumb to some typical mecha genre issues. ""Katanagatari"" is a beautifully drawn and stylized fantasy samurai-centric-ish show with great fight scenes that embraces the cornball factor, so that might be the best alternative. If you want a more modern product of this studio with some nice animation, try the ""Escaflowne"" movie, which has Bones animation to give it the polish completely absent from the storytelling. they could probably stop bullets with it.

I seem to vaguely recall that the English OPs were pretty bad, but it\'s been so long since I watched the dub that it\'s thankfully faded from my memory.Honestly, if you aren\'t watching this for the nostalgia factor, I\'d suggest skipping it. It hasn\'t aged well at all. And are the OVAs bad? Yes. Yes they are. All three of them. Oh you didn\'t know there were OVAs? How fortunate for YOU.Unfortunately there really aren\'t alternatives that hit the same-ish genre spots as this that I\'d recommend. Too many mecha or samurai shows are terrible for similar and somewhat worse reasons, particularly from the same era.  ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" is an amazing Japan-centric supernatural/fantasy show I\'d always recommend, but it\'s not shonen or mecha. ""Macross Frontier"" is pretty, with some good plot and mangst, and some great music, even if it does succumb to some typical mecha genre issues. ""Katanagatari"" is a beautifully drawn and stylized fantasy samurai-centric-ish show with great fight scenes that embraces the cornball factor, so that might be the best alternative. If you want a more modern product of this studio with some nice animation, try the ""Escaflowne"" movie, which has Bones animation to give it the polish completely absent from the storytelling.']"
.hack//G.U. Trilogy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3269/hack__GU_Trilogy,"[""First of all, I&acute;m a german and this is my first english written preview, so please bear with me if I made some spelling-/grammar-mistakes^^Just to have said it in advance, I finished all three .hack//G.U. games, so it&acute;s not like I&acute;m not familiar with the story itself. I had high expectations, but I sadly got dissappointed.Story:They tried to put the story of each game in 30 minute-parts. Since the games itself had a play-volume of 12-18 hours per game (don&acute;t remember exactly and can&acute;t check it because my PS2 is broken), you can guess how extremly it got cutted...The arena battles that were essential...in the games are only shown as flashbacks for around a minute. The story itself strays from the game after the last scene that belongs to &quot;G.U. Rebirth&quot;.  From here on, everything focuses at Atolis and Ovans story-parts; other characters that were involved with the story (like Sakaki) won&acute;t appear.Art:They used the ingame-movie grafic for this movie. It looks cool and awesome in the action-scenes '(especially phase-battles), but terrible at the &quot;chatting-scenes&quot;. And in the end, as a GC movie, it&acute;s measured at Final Fantasy anyway, and here, .hack//G.U. trilogy can&acute;t compare at all.Sound:After hearing the &quot;Gentle Hands&quot; remix of the trailer, I thought we get more cool remixes, but I hoped too much. Still, the music fits very well, esspecialy the fights.Character:My biggest part to complain about.Most of the main-characters aren&acute;t even shown, and the story focuses totally at Haseo, Atoli and Ovan.Instead of the cool PKK style that Haseo had in the game, he only has that mad side shown in &quot;.hack//roots&quot;, and seems like a little kid very often in the first half, Atoli isn&acute;t even half as fun to watch since she has not much air-time in the first quarter, and Ovan&acute;s calm attitude is nowhere to be found.Enjoyment and Overall:If you played through the games, even with that changes you&acute;ll do nothing wrong with watching the movie at least once. If you never even played the game you may do better to ignore it, since they left so much out and made a speedrun through the story, so that it&acute;s hardly understandable at times.I only recommend this to fans of the &quot;.hack//G.U.&quot; - Universe, the others will just ask &quot;what the hell was that about?&quot; in the games are only shown as flashbacks for around a minute.

The games were loads of fun and the game story line was one of the best since SIGN and the first quartet.   I was a tad skeptical that they would be able to capture the dynamic of the GU story in a one 90 minute film and boy was my skepticism right.   In short .hack//GU Trilogy is made for those who have played the games and not for those who haven\'t.   If you watched Roots but haven\'t played GU I would suggest not watching this movie.The story is of...course based on the GU trilogy of games for the PS2, the immediate sequel to .hack//Roots.  And this film is supposed to be a film adaption, or so I thought.  In reality GU trilogy is an expensive and choppy recap and abridgment of the GU Story, made entirely for those who have played the games.   Unlike most, I understand the difficult task of adapting medium into film, so naturally I wasn\'t expecting a 100% loyal adaption, but I was expecting that this film would make sense to a person who has never played GU.   It doesn\'t, it\'s like watching "".hack//GU abridged"" only with out the humor and jokes of the Abridge series that litter YouTube today.   It was appalling how quickly and pathetically this story jumps from one scene to another, no exposition is conveyed, no character development is conveyed, nothing, it\'s as I\'ve said a million times by now, an over the top and over expensive recap of the GU.  It was as bad as the writing in Blade of the Immortal.The music score which was amazing in the games was all but dropped from the film. I barley heard any of the great themes from the games by Chikayo Fukuda.   Tomoyo Mitani the vocalist did provide some nice vocal tracks of course, but they pale in comparison to her tracks in the games.  The music is far and few between and silence is used way over the top.The Japanese acting in this was beyond dreadful.    Expressions and grunts were over emphasized and frankly the English dub track in the games is much more pleasing than in this.   As this has no dub I had to rely on the fansubs and my own imagination to hear the voice cast I liked.  The only plus to the Japanese acting in this case was that Endrance didn\'t sound like the tormented artist like he did in the English dub of the game.   Most of the time you hear overly dramatic grunts and sighs and yells.The 3D graphics are however rather good.  They look much like the cut scenes in the game and the action is spectacular almost to the level of Advent Children.  However there were several bad facial renderings and really silly expressions.  The director did allow the camera to move, when I was fearing the action would  static and uninteresting.  The action scenes are great and they would be perfect for an AMV.Overall GU is just plain horrible.  It was made for those who have played the games, and one 90 minute film simply would not do it justice.   CC had a great opportunity to make and interesting movie based on the games.  Instead they made it into a long and expensive recap.  They should have made three 2 1/2 hour movies to fully tell the story in depth, and to even make it remotely interesting.  If you are thinking of watching this, don\'t waste your 90 minutes you\'ll be horribly lost and confused.

Play the games instead.', ""The .hack animated series is certainly something that is difficult to understand if you haven't played the games. Even after watching all the .hack anime series, I still sit there, and go:what..hack//G.U. Trilogy is one of the more confusing ones. Watching this reminded me of watching Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children; never in my life have I played a Final Fantasy game, and I can say that actually with some shame.STORY: The typical story line of the .hack series; something within The World is causing players to go into a coma. I can't really remember much from Roots, since I watched that in 2008, but...I'm thinking Trilogy goes into further detail about this 'AIDA' infection that's spreading in The World. This is something that probably shouldn't be watched if you haven't watching Roots, or played the games, since the movie actually goes straight into where Shino is 'PK'd'. Regardless of lack of .hack information while watching this, I felt that the story was still deep.ART: I didn't actually read the description of MAL on Trilogy until I was just about to watch it. The CG was a biiiiiiiig turn off, well, that is when you compare it to something like the Final Fantasy merchandise. I realize that the CG style was probably supposed to be similar to the .hack game graphics but either way, the lack of detail made me want to cry. Haseo's face just did not look right compared to the design in Roots, but for some silly reason, all the other characters looked fine. Some parts of the movie were well animated, but overall, it just seemed like average CG animation. I did however liked some of Haseo's psycho facial expressions, along with Tri-Edge's.SOUND: Congratulations to myself! I've finally realized where most of the sound effects and sound clips in DJ Sharpnel's 'Terror Of Death' are from now. Even though it was pretty obvious by the song's title, and I never picked it up while watching Roots. ANYWAY. Sound as always in the .hack titles is lovely, actually I've already forgotten what they sound like since this review has been written two days after watching Trilogy.CHARACTERS: Main complaint with the .hack series is the ridiculous seriousness of a characters, obsessed over a game. If you find out it's going to harm your actual physical self, then stop playing it immediately and not try to live up to the saying 'curiosity killed the cat'. I honestly have no idea who the crap is Atoli, and what kind of relation she has to Shino and the other characters.The reason why I gave this a 7, rather than a 6 (would actually be 6.5) was because of one particular scene. This would be the scene with Haseo and AIDA Atoli in the classroom. Oh. My. God. Animation, design and emotion looked like it had been carefully thought out well for this scene, I'd have to say it was mind-blowing. I even had a want-to-cosplay moment when I saw AIDA Atoli, despite the complexity.Moving on, this is definitely something for the .hack fan, especially someone who is a fan of the games. I must stress again once more, not to watch this, along with the other .hack series, without having a robust knowledge about the .hack world and/or already having played the games.

Please do NOT read it if you are going to watch this movie.Well, first of all, I didn't play the .hack games, but since I got interested in the story I read the GU+ manga. Therefore I will be comparing the movie and the manga. So let's see what the movie offers us.Story:The story presented in G.U. Trilogy is incomplete and full of leaks. There is a strong focus on the relationship between Atoli and Haseo which becomes annoying pretty fast. In contrast to this it is hardly explained what Epitaph Users are and who have got the Morgana Factors....Also the movie is missing the Net Crisis and the reason of Ovan killing other player (collecting the 8 Morgana Factors for Aura's rebirth).Art:Well, this is of course amazing. But sometimes some really strange facial expressions were shown, some full of exaggeration. I espially liked Yata's appearance who doesn't look as lame as in the manga, lol.Sound:Yes, this is the part where I've got to seperate. On the first hand we've got some awesome OST which I really love and enjoy listening to them while I'm drawing. Therefore it's a pity that the only melody I could remember being used in the movie several times is Liar's Smile.On the second hand we've got the voice actors. They DID their job. Aber the text itself was awful. I've got to mention here that Haseo is screaming half of the movie. I mean - 2 or 3 times are okay, but everytime something bad or dramatic happens? Pathetic.Character:Too bad the only character who are really shown are Haseo, Ovan and Atoli. It even takes time during watching to recognize the names of the GU project's members. And though Haseo kept fighting for her all the time, you only see Shino dieing in the cathedral.Another aspect I didn't like (there is plenty of them..) was that the movie didn't show the relationship between the World and real persons sitting at their computer. My boyfriend who I watched this movie with told me that he couldn't take this all for serious knowing it's just a MMO.Atoli is shown more annoying than in the manga, but I guess it's her role. And Haseo.. since he was screaming and screaming and fell down to the ground because of his despair.. no, I didn't like him either.Enjoyment:Actually I only can enjoy it if you:1. like clichés, because the movie is full of it2. REALLY are interested in the story of .hack, but here again the story isn't very thrilling3. can laugh about all the things I have criticized because that's what my boyfriend and me did after a while.Overall:All in all, I would definitely NOT recommend this movie. Though I don't think the manga is great or special, I believe that the movie even more horrible.

As it\'s apparently the compressed version of 3 games. So I will only say a simple thing that wouldn\'t equal negativity with cause of compressed game into animation.So we get a bit story of .hack//roots and from there we get to see all sorts of cool battles, powers and some new plot points. I did enjoy for the most part. Consider it kinda special bonus for .hack// franchise fans/players.✦Art & SoundIt\'s like watching video game cutscenes in a row....Meaning that for the most part it was good, but not that impressive.With music & ost I had a bit of an issue. Meaning that whenever it was the version of movie I watched, encoding or whatever, that ost/music was horribly quiet when I watched, heard almost none of it, which really took a piece of enjoyment out of me.✦Character.//roots + some others. Mostly same cast, some just a bit different now and not as enjoyable were some of them. So they were enjoyable as before and addition of new characters was good.ONLY, big complaint would be Atoli. Here existence/appearance was confusing as heck, considering how quickly she grew into others and valued them really quickly. But I\'m quite sure the cause would be 3 games compressed into 1 Anime movie. Most likely in game she is actually character I would grow into & understand.✦Enjoyment & OverallDid like the game\'esque CG movie. Had some cool moments, but nothing amazing.

The games' plot is amazing, but this movie proceeds to ruin it in every way possible. Do yourself a favor and play the game.There are scenes in a different and weird order, and others were brutally skipped or ruined. There are some cute additions, but they aren't enough to justify watching it.It also randomly forgets to explain important plot points, while instead trying to create a love story between Atoli and Haseo, which ultimately means nothing to the viewer because they never showed their friendship moments in the first movie. "", ""It's one thing to try and adapt a game into a movie. It's got challenges, things to cut, and you really sacrifice a lot in the transition. We have a different beast here, trying to adapt 3 ENTIRE GAMES INTO A SINGLE 90-MINUTE MOVIE.I played the games back in the day, and I have the plot fresh in my mind. You can easily make a movie out of each game, honestly. The problem with the material is the illogical emotions displayed. The game asks from the player suspension of disbelief to a high degree, and it isn't that big of a problem since you do...get to slowly enjoy the characters and world. I could get invested after two hours, but this is a movie that expects you to believe everything thrown at you in less than that with 3 games of plot.It doesn't work, it's impossible for it to work. Putting myself in the shoes of a newcomer, this is the most incomprehensible movie ever. Motives, twists, arcs, and terrible editing. Movie vs. audience. Sadly, it's not even a summary. Served more as a cutscene compilation from disjointed moments of every game, with original scenes that make no sense, with or without the context.The only thing I like, is the animation. Stylish CG animation that doesn't care about realism, but on the flow. The big fights, with some unintentionally funny, and exaggerated expressions that could work in a well-written work. I'm sad that that's the only good aspect, and some people seem to hate that too.2/10.

Ashita no Joe (Movie),https://myanimelist.net/anime/2920/Ashita_no_Joe_Movie,"[""Ashita no Joe is considered a classic, and it's pretty clear why even from this abridged movie. Its arc has a very iconic feel, reminiscent of other underdog sports shows as it follows an unrepentant asshole on his path to redemption through hitting other guys in the face.The visuals are limited through most of the run, but there are parts, specifically the more intense fights, that get really intense, emphasizing how the fighters are pressing themselves to their limits. When people aren't fighting, it's slow, but I feel like that's just a consequence of having to cut down a 70 episode series into 2.5 hours...and retaining a lot of critical exposition.That said, there's not really much to learn from the movie. It rewards Joe for being petulant to a funny, but unhealthy degree, and the moral of the final arc about success not being worth compromising your entire life is more than a little obvious even if it is shown in a really powerful way. and retaining a lot of critical exposition.That said, there's not really much to learn from the movie.

It's hard to call it a *good* film, exactly: it suffers from the kind of severe pacing issues you'd expect to emerge adapting a nearly 80 episode story into a single film, and at it's lowest points even the excellent designs can't really save the scenes that are simply underanimated and lacking in life. But viewing the...film as someone intimately aware of the legacy of Ashita no Joe, it's hard not to instinctively look past the problems and appreciate the movie's best moments and core appeal. For every scene that drags on there's another that moves exactly the way you want it to and shows off the best of Dezaki Osamu's directing, and for all the barebones, underanimated moments within the film there are excellent bits of character animation and engaging fights that put the rough linework and overall aesthetic to great use.Ultimately I think it is the protagonists and main characters in the film that keep it engaging even when it fails on a moment to moment level. Joe is likable and funny and kind of a jerk, and watching him grow bit by bit and find something meaningful to channel his anger and malaise into is satisfying. He has this roguish charm to him that's just flat out fun even when you're kind of bored and the movie is starting to drag, and despite his cruelty the tiny details in the animation when present make him feel like more than just an asshole and show you a level of interiority and complexity that keeps you rooting for him. The other characters are really solid, too, but the rapid arc of the show leaves moments that should be more dramatic (particularly regarding Tange) out of place and rushed. Still Rikiishi is compelling too, so you're genuinely invested in both sides of the final fight, which make the events of the ending (which I won't spoil if you happen to not know) feel impactful and satisfying.That's again not to say the movie manages to overcome the structural and pacing problems inherent to it: it tries to adapt a very long story into a movie: a very long movie, but still just a movie. In some ways the length only makes it harder: it manages to slow down enough to be comprehensible, but I think if the fat was trimmed and the story was adjusted a bit those 2 and a half hours or so could be slimmed into a probably better film.Still, Ashita no Joe is I think worth watching: for historical reasons, yes, but also because there's real value in the animation and characters on display here, and because the story has things to say and stories to tell that have impact and meaning today. film as someone intimately aware of the legacy of Ashita no Joe, it's hard not to instinctively look past the problems and appreciate the movie's best moments and core appeal. For every scene that drags on there's another that moves exactly the way you want it to and shows off the best of Dezaki Osamu's directing, and for all the barebones, underanimated moments within the film there are excellent bits of character animation and engaging fights that put the rough linework and overall aesthetic to great use.Ultimately I think it is the protagonists and main characters in the film that keep it engaging even when it fails on a moment to moment level. Joe is likable and funny and kind of a jerk, and watching him grow bit by bit and find something meaningful to channel his anger and malaise into is satisfying. He has this roguish charm to him that's just flat out fun even when you're kind of bored and the movie is starting to drag, and despite his cruelty the tiny details in the animation when present make him feel like more than just an asshole and show you a level of interiority and complexity that keeps you rooting for him.

It lives up to it\'s prestige, being a sobering account of Joe\'s rise to prominence in the boxing scene - for all the victories and consequences which it entails. For such a story, it\'s appropriately gritty and tragic.The art is noticeably rough. It is hard for this anime to hide it\'s age, but for those of taste - this will not be an issue, as it\'s visuals elevate the brutality that is fighting and very much emulates the style...of the classic manga. The punches and impacts would not feel so \'weighty\' had it been animated in a more clean and contemporary way. It genuinely feels like each frame was pulled fresh off the storyboard in the studio, but has a clear passion behind it. Though each line is rough, they flow smoothly and dance when the story ramps up to it\'s climax, keeping you engaged fully.The sound is slow and melancholic. The kind that still lingers with you long after you have stopped watching. It captures not just the mood, but the soul of Joe\'s character when the music drops to it\'s more somber moments.Joe as a character is a bastard. You aren\'t supposed to like him. Not in the beginning, nor even through much of the middle. He has defined flaws and in contrast to his rival Rikiishi, makes you wonder at times why the story is about Joe and not him instead. In a more conventional story, Joe would be the antagonist. What keeps you from turning off the anime due to his behavior is the brief moments where he does do the right thing and can let himself be open with other people. Until this happens more, and more. Joe isn\'t the bad guy, he is just a person with flaws like everyone else, and he does eventually grow from his mistakes. It is not a change that happens instantly, though, and that is what I appreciate about how this story handled Joe as a character.Ashita no Joe resonates with me in a way that most other anime cannot perform the same. It has less in common with other anime than it does with classic film as a whole. I am drawn to Joe and his tale in the same way that I am with Rocky and his movie. When I sit down to watch an anime, there is often concessions I will have to make in order to enjoy it: ""This anime has great writing, but the anime leaves on a cliff hanger that I\'ll have to read the manga for"" ""this one has amazing art, but the fanservice is distracting and unnecessary"" etc. I do not have to go through this process, because Ashita no Joe stands perfectly on it\'s own as an art piece deserving respect and isn\'t held to the excuses that a lot of anime fans put fourth to justify why their show is good.Whether it is the show or the movie, do take the pilgrimage of classic anime and enjoy some of what Ashita no Joe has to offer you. It will be an enriching experience, one way or another. of the classic manga. The punches and impacts would not feel so \'weighty\' had it been animated in a more clean and contemporary way.

Aquarion Evol,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10447/Aquarion_Evol,"['(Note: this review covers the whole series\' content and has done so forever, but MAL stuck a little yellow tag on here that says ""preliminary"")Aquarion EVOL. It\'s been 12,000 quarter-days since the first series came out back in 2005 and now it\'s been reincarnated for the new era. First, some history:To my knowledge, not many people liked Genesis of Aquarion. It was an overly melodramatic, awkward, very episodic and somewhat girly mecha series where the robots were essentially powered by orgasms(You read that right) and it had to compete in an era where good mecha anime was still a thing. It was a show that...couldn\'t take itself seriously even when it was trying to take itself seriously. Audience response was mostly apathetic, but people loved the theme song and the OST had some of Yoko Kanno\'s best work. Hell, that OP was the sole reason I decided to blindly download the whole show on dial-up back on Christmas of \'05. It took 4 months to finish, and was actually my first subbed anime.I loved Aquarion. It was stupid and weird in all the best ways, and to this day it\'s still a very different spin on the super robot genre. The melodramatic characters and their reactions to everything, the complete nonsense shouted by the leader that would lead to victory in every episode, the omnisexual, ten-way, cross-dimensional love story... All of it was just grand in retrospect. I had no idea of what to expect from this series\' new art direction and the effects of a near-decade hiatus, but ho-damn am I satisfied.Aquarion EVOL opens 12,000 years after the end of Aquarion, with the main character, Amata, watching his favorite decade-old movie that (poorly) depicts events of the prequel series\' final episode. This is followed by his boss coming out and telling him ""Amata, no one likes that movie but you, really. The theme song got popular, but that\'s about it."" So yeah, the opening of this new foray into the orgasm-powered mecha genre is Shoji Kawamori brazenly declaring that he gives not a single fuck to the haters out there. I can\'t even tell you how happy that scene made me, I felt like Amata.After that, you get treated to what\'s easily the prettiest god damn show of the season, and maybe year, as Amata takes this big-boobed blue haired girl on a date through the rivers of neo-Venice. The environments are always painted in absolutely beautiful detail and color, and many shots are screencap worthy because of how genuinely pretty they are. I strongly suggest watching this in HD.The character and world designs are all very unique and memorable, infused with an injection of sharp detail, personality and visual originality that you don\'t see in many anime anymore. The world and characters feel alive, and there\'s even two full fictional alphabets that show up in the show that contribute to this. Also, each scene is well-composed on screen and because of that, Aquarion Evol is never a bore to look at.So far, Aquarion Evol\'s new cast of characters is what makes it shine, at least in my opinion. Rather than the really odd focus of the first episodes of the prior series, Evol began strong by introducing a cast of lively, thought-out and memorably designed little mecha pilots and having them ping off of each other.The antagonists are presented in a very neutral and borderline desperate way. They don\'t appear evil and their motivations and details about their pasts are kept as a mystery for a while, but the show gives many hints and allusions as to who they really are and keep the viewer interested rather than starve them for details.The writing is strong and sharp up until about 2/3rds the way through, and then it gets a little dumb near the end when old plot lines end in anticlimactic ways, pointless new plot lines appear and things get pretty drawn out in general. But then the final episode is pretty great and brings all the important stuff back to the forefront for the most part, and the series ends on a strong, melodramatic cheesy note that it should.This is all in contrast to the first series, where the story and characters were a little unfocused until the final 6 or 7 and episodes, and then those were all amazing and climactic.Then you have the titular fighting robots. Shit looks absolutely fantastic, though, honestly, the 3D animation is a bit stiff and the original Aquarion has a leg up on it in terms of good choreography and smooth movements.EVOL makes full and complete use of the ""orgasm when combining"" joke throughout the first episode, but actually lightens up on it as the show has progresses. So far, the only real mecha orgasm sequences have been for particularly climactic moments and new character introductions. The gag is used sparingly and after the first series it\'s apparent the creators took note that it alienated some people. This whole project in general looks like it\'s taking the widespread criticism of Aquarion both in stride and into consideration, creating a series that satisfies both old fans and newcomers.The OST is still amazing. If you watched the first series you\'ll probably recognize a number of the background tracks, remixed or reworked, along with a bunch of nice, new pieces. This show\'s opening theme is an orgasm of Japanese vocal work. Yoko Kanno knows what she\'s doing.All of the base elements of Aquarion remain intact, for better or worse. It\'s still pretty cheesy and melodramatic, but this time they\'re hamming it up even more while at the same time keeping a good focus on down-to-earth elements like the cast, for the most part. I appreciate the hell out of it, but I\'m sure some people still won\'t \'get\' it. It\'s also still really, really pretty and the energy produced by the visuals and sounds carry the show\'s asinine writing like a thoroughly lubed bullet train.""So should I watch the first series before getting into this one?""Yes. Or at least maybe the OVAs to get a feel for the characters and stuff. One of the main draws of this series (for me) was that it\'s actively referenced Aquarion quite a bit, such as one of the main villains basically being an evil version of the main character in the first show. Kawamori\'s also stated that the main cast in this show are reincarnations of the previous cast. Eventually learning how the two stories and their characters will tie together is going to be, as I predict, one of the most rewarding aspects of EVOL. So if you want to enjoy Evol as much as you can, experience the previous project a little bit first.Also, honestly, while Evol might be more ""likable"", Aquarion was a better put-together show in the end, in my opinion.""They... orgasm in the robot? that\'s stupid!""And ironically this show has far less ecchi and has more thoughtful writing than any series it\'s directly competing with. But really now, you probably just got done watching tit-infused garbage like Lagrange, you can\'t criticize this show lmao""So, is it better than Lagrange, the other girly mecha show this year?""Yes, in just about every single possible way, shape and form.""Is Fudo Gen in it? He was the only good thing about Aquarion""Yes, and he\'s a fucking pirate ohmygodit\'sgreatAquarion Evol gave me colorgasms and excitement for something to see every week for half a year, and I hope it did the same for everyone else.

Give it a shot.', 'This is my first time writing a review, so please bare with me, but for this series I felt like I needed to write my opinion of it.Story:Episodes 1 - 13 = 7Now, the series started off very good, I wouldn\'t say it was amazing, but it was enough to pull me in and get me interested in the series. It was lighthearted and comedy filled at points, but it also had plenty enough action and mystery involved to keep you looking forward to what might come next.Episodes 14 - 21 = 5Unfortunately at this point, the story seems to start getting thrown all over...the place. Some episodes I liked and some were just not so good... and I\'m sad to say that it continued to get worse.Episodes 22 - 26 = 2This is where everything in the plotline just falls apart. Revelations and twists are made and it all seems to turn into a horrible joke. It didn\'t end well either as there will a lot of plotholes and loose-ends in the series that were left unanswered. You know it\'s bad when you root for the antagonist in the series to win and hope that the heros will lose.Overall, the plotline was decent, but definitely no where near amazing.Total Average: 4.5Animation: 7Tha animation quality was overall pretty, but not overly fantastic, especially since the CG wasnt really well done on some points. It had a lot of recycled footage through out the anime and unfortunately the reused footage from Sousei no Aquarion stuck out like a sore thumb against Evol\'s animation. But for the most part it was very pretty to look at, especially the first ending.Sound: 10Ah, the saving grace of the show and probably one of the few things I will remember from Evol. The music is just astounding; I could listen to it all day and not get tired of it. Gekkou Symphonia, Paradoxical Zoo, Eve no Danpen, Kimi no Shinwa, Yunoha no Mori, Aquaria Mau Sora... they\'re all wonderful songs, there\'s not one I do not like.Characters:Main Characters = 2The main characters are some of the worst I have ever experienced in a show. I started off liking Amata quite a bit; he was a weak willed character but he seemed very devoted and it looked as if he would develop into a stronger character; how wrong was I. He continued to be weak and couldn\'t seem to function without Mikono around; it was unbearable to watch him near the end.  I think most will agree with me when I say that I definitely won\'t miss his ""MIKONO-SAAAAAAAAANNNN!""Mikono... she starts off as quite a snotty character a little bit in the beginning and shes always looking down on herself and calling herself useless... at one point it seemed that she stepped up and looked as if she would actually do something and help out, but in the end, remains to be useless and forever stuck in the damsel in distress mode.Zessica- as much as I love Zessica, she was a poorly developed character. She started off amazing and had the potential to be a great person, but gets stuck in her mopey and dull self as her unrequited love for Amata beats her down repeatedly into a deeper depression. If Zessica\'s character taught me one thing, it\'s that no matter how you try to go against fate/ destiny, you can\'t and it will beat you down.Kagura started off as an interesting character, but I also think he was poorly developed. Has a very beast-like personality and his sole focus is to get Mikono and anyone in his way will get hurt/killed... there\'s really not much else to him. But the thing that will continue to bug me to the end of days is his OOC\'ness at the very end of the series... he is suddenly shown capable of being a human being and rather intellectual when that was definitely not the case from before.Supporting Characters = 8The supporting characters, to me at least, outshown the main characters by far. Jin and Yunoha were some of my favorites, separately they were both very good, but when they were together, something sparked and they quickly became my favorite love interest in the show. Andy and Mix provided a lot of comedy, especially when they were together, but their love at the end really moved me. Both JinxYunoha and AndyxMix were by far better love interests than AmataxMikono and much more enjoyable. The other side characters were also very enjoyable in their own way- Cayenne and Shrade, along with Sazanka and Malloy were just wonderful.Total Average: 5Enjoyment: 5The first half of the series was very enjoyable and I was always looking forward to the next episode, unfortunately my high expectations from the first half led to a lot of disappointment in the second half. It became a trainwreck; the plotline became something that I didn\'t look forward to and I found myself groaning at a lot of scenes or just not really caring.Overall: 6I think it was my high expectations from the first half that led to my great disappointment, but Evol just stands as average to me. The terrible plotline, poorly developed main characters, and lack of enjoyment for the second half really hit me. Despite the not so good things, there was still enjoyment from the supporting cast and especially from Mykage(whom was a great villain), so overall it wasn\'t terribly awful, I just felt it could have been handled better. the place.

However, I will be watching the first season after this season is over to get a better feel of the story.Story: The story is really good imo. You have 2 guys who clash together in order to win over the girl they love. The season isn\'t over yet but in my opinion it feels like 1 side represents ""old love/destined love"" and the other represents ""new love/breaking chains of fate""....It\'s a typical space/sci-fi/school life anime where a boy gets involved in a cross-planetary war and his whole life is changed. He gets introduced to various ""special"" people who possess unique powers that are used to protect the planet.Art: The artwork is beautiful. It\'s basically a 2012 looking anime so of course the colors are vibrant and very nice.Sound: This show reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier for some reason. Music plays big rolls in major events that happen throughout the show. New powers = music, dramatic events = music, etc , etc.Character: The characters are really good. You have the perverted male friend who clashes with the tsundere boy hating goodygoody girl and the typical bishounen guys that the girls are head over heels for. Then you have the various girls that are in love with the MC (One is more open, the other is the typical conservative shy soft spoken girl).Enjoyment: This show is really really good. I honestly only watched this for Zessica Wong (she\'s cute :3) but I wound up enjoying the show a lot. It reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier + Isekai No Seikishi Monogatari which happens to be my favorite anime :3ENJOY IT and don\'t forget! ZESSICA IS #1 F*CK MIKONOEDIT: I finished watching the first season. I recommend it to those of you that want to a get a better feeling of the whole Aquarion history. However, it is not necessary to watch S1. All you basically need to know is that 12000 years ago 2 lovers fought to save the world from destruction and through self sacrifice they were separated from each other, destined to fall in love again when they were ""reincarnated"". It\'s basically a recurring 12k year cycle of lovers. All of this information is shown in EVOL (episode 1 for that matter).If you would like to get to know more about the past lives of some of the characters you should watch S1. You can see how Kagura and Apollo share MANY traits which leads viewers to believe he is the true reincarnation of Apollo, yet Amata has the Sun Wings.Even if you watch S1 you still won\'t understand why Mykage does what he does or why he looks like the dude from S1 (forgot his name... wait it\'s Toma, now I\'m too lazy to change what I just wrote -____-)Basically the reincarnations as I see it are:Amata/Kagura = ApolloSilvia = who cares, she\'s a betch :3Toma = Zessica (can\'t say why because that\'s a spoiler, message me if you want to discuss)Silvia\'s Brother = who cares, he\'s a loser. Seriously, he really is. Go watch season 1. It\'s a typical space/sci-fi/school life anime where a boy gets involved in a cross-planetary war and his whole life is changed. He gets introduced to various ""special"" people who possess unique powers that are used to protect the planet.Art: The artwork is beautiful. It\'s basically a 2012 looking anime so of course the colors are vibrant and very nice.Sound: This show reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier for some reason. Music plays big rolls in major events that happen throughout the show. New powers = music, dramatic events = music, etc , etc.Character: The characters are really good. You have the perverted male friend who clashes with the tsundere boy hating goodygoody girl and the typical bishounen guys that the girls are head over heels for. Then you have the various girls that are in love with the MC (One is more open, the other is the typical conservative shy soft spoken girl).Enjoyment: This show is really really good. I honestly only watched this for Zessica Wong (she\'s cute :3) but I wound up enjoying the show a lot. It reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier + Isekai No Seikishi Monogatari which happens to be my favorite anime :3ENJOY IT and don\'t forget! ZESSICA IS #1 F*CK MIKONOEDIT: I finished watching the first season. I recommend it to those of you that want to a get a better feeling of the whole Aquarion history. However, it is not necessary to watch S1. All you basically need to know is that 12000 years ago 2 lovers fought to save the world from destruction and through self sacrifice they were separated from each other, destined to fall in love again when they were ""reincarnated"".

Aquarion EVOL shines brightest in its absolutely gorgeous setting and consistent animation. Each location is drawn with such care and beauty and there were plenty of places for us to see. The artwork is what I\'d would call ""eyegasmic"" or ""scenery porn"". It was a completely positive surprise. As of 2012, I can only list a handful of TV series that had such amazing artwork on display.Unfortunately, aside from the delightfully eyegasmic setting it was in, the story and characters leave a bit to be desired. At...it\'s core, it\'s not a story to be taken seriously. Like the prequel, there are a lot of ridiculous and ludicrous events that happen throughout the show. How about a punch move that wraps the entire planet just to punch the enemy into space? How about each time the characters combine into the Aquaria mech they experience near-orgasms? If you can suspend a great amount of belief, you can enjoy this show since there are lots of funny and exciting material here. For some, the lack of a serious and well-thought out story can really be a disappointment. Indeed, the story in Aquarion EVOL had a lot of potential. The villains of Altair and their motives belong in a moral gray area, but the planet Altair is mostly left undeveloped and unexplored as the credit rolled.The characters also suffer from wasted potential in terms of depth and attitude. The main characters, especially, come off quite shallow and frankly, annoying. Both Amata and Mikono are shy and often unreliable, and they often misunderstood each other for both comedic purposes and really shallow and cliche reasons. On the opposite spectrum is Kagura - the bad boy villain who lusts over Mikono and Zessica - the scantily dressed confident girl who lusts over Amata. These main characters came off as largely one-dimensional. While they do receive character development, it was often too late in the series to really appreciate them. Kagura\'s sudden change of character near the end is frankly just sloppy writing. Their one-dimensional personalities became repetitive quickly.Character writing was undoubtedly not a strong point of Aquarion Evol. However, the side characters certainly were pretty entertaining even if they were one-dimensional. There is Andy W. Hole who is completely obsessed with holes, Mix who is obsessed with neatness, the loli president Crea who amuse with weird puns, the immortal Fudou who speaks in riddles, and many more. Their character interactions are usually amusing to watch even if the main characters comes off as annoying and boring.Each episode often starts with light-hearted character interactions, and usually ends with the mech Aquarion in action against an opponent mech. The CG in these fights is really obvious and differs in style from the beautifully rendered artwork, but it doesn\'t really take away any entertainment value. Combat flows fluidly and is entertaining in general since each fight seem to end really differently. Sometimes, it\'s just not enough to destroy an opponent with a punch. Aquarion EVOL will punch with such profound disregard to physics that will make other mecha series tame in comparison. Still, the problem with Aquarion EVOL is each episode becomes formulaic. The series is what I\'d call mindlessly entertaining, but it really could\'ve had more depth if it spend more time developing the villains and developing the world instead of spending time on flat characters and formulaic mech fights.Other than that, the presentation value is really high and I was pleasantly surprised. AKINO returns to this sequel with catchy j-pop insert themes and OP/ED credits. The soundtrack is varied with grand orchestra pieces, solo piano or violin pieces, as well as light-hearted or solemn moody pieces. Character models are pleasing to look at and remains in quality even if zoomed out. And of course, the gorgeous landscapes and space artwork whether it was day or night made lasting and unforgettable impressions. Words can\'t really describe the beauty I\'ve seen, but I highly recommend it if anyone enjoys what the anime medium could offer in looks.Ultimately, Aquarion EVOL was an enjoyable series full of heart and ridiculous combat, albeit often ending up as melodramatic and exaggerated. The artwork and sound are gorgeous and catchy, but the story and characters came off as wasted potential. For someone looking for a serious and well-thought plot with realistic characters, this is definitely not the series for you.

And when i saw the trailer i saw Good looking characters and animation, and i could tell right away it was of a Romance genre. This show has alot of Fan service, but some of the fan service thats shown is shown when they begin to use the Aquarion as a group and i wont spoil what its called(Im guessing thats what those robots are called since they always shout out ""GO. AQUARIOON"" when they start to fight which can give a corny feel. I watched it all but if i sound ignorant of...it its cause i watched it a few months ago.)So the ""Fanservice"" during those parts can get corny.It definitely has some funny moments so you will laugh while watching it, but most of it is based on the romance.Now the story....im not gonna spoil it but the story is understandable but its explained horribly, you just have to use the information you get while watching it to get the story.This show is very hard to explain because it is hard to understand while watching it. I havent watched the Original Aquarion because others told me this is the second season, and i heard the first is better than this one.Its watchable, but if you have other anime you know has good recommendations and you\'re itching to watch those then go ahead and put this one on hold. it its cause i watched it a few months ago.)So the ""Fanservice"" during those parts can get corny.It definitely has some funny moments so you will laugh while watching it, but most of it is based on the romance.Now the story....im not gonna spoil it but the story is understandable but its explained horribly, you just have to use the information you get while watching it to get the story.This show is very hard to explain because it is hard to understand while watching it.

It is saturated with an abundance of metaphors and symbolism; some painfully and intentionally obvious whiles others subtle. Nevertheless, it is not particularly intelligent and never makes any attempts at being profound. Aquarion Evol distinguishes itself from others with its ostensibly ludicrous gimmicks: homosexual angels and donut philosophy to name a couple. Most significantly, however, is the amount of passion and love that pervades the series. Evol spelled backwards is love, and is filled to the brim with exactly that.Aquarion Evol is a dog bereaved of life, revived, and bestowed with wings. It...is conceived and directed by Kawamori Shoji, known for his works teeming with passion such as the Macross series and AKB0048. Aquarion Evol may not be his best work to date in terms of quality, but it is the absolute pinnacle of his creations in spirit. Set 12,000 years after Genesis of Aquarion, it renews the legend that the first series paved way for. Evol is not dependent on the original; it gives the audience bits and pieces of backstory throughout its duration, as well as incorporating an exposition episode which contextualizes all prior events. I have not seen the original myself, and the standalone experience of Evol was nonetheless seamless.Aquarion Evol is the ugly duckling: scorned for unsightliness, but an ethereal swan from the start. The intricate backstory notwithstanding, the premise of Aquarion Evol is simple and trite. Set in a city constantly terrorized by “Abductors” who kidnap women for unknown purposes, Sora Amata and Suzushiro Mikono are forced to enroll in a school for people with supernatural abilities that pilot mechas known as Aquaria. The nearly banal story then gradually escalates into an ambitious tale of fallen angels and inter-dimensional love. Similar premises have been seen countless times before, but Evol adds to it its heart. As the grandeur of the story unfolds, the audience is presented with an exceedingly corny story that despite its seeming unoriginality is bursting with genuine passion. Aquarion Evol exudes such love and imagination that it is difficult to blame it for being clichéd. Ultimately, Evol can be seen as a massive allegory for the indiscriminate power of love which, both figuratively and literally, brings worlds together.Aquarion Evol is a boy helplessly in love: mistaken for indecency, but with feelings ever so pristine. The public often fallaciously presume that Evol is filled with vulgar or lowbrow humour. Indeed, the robots are fueled by bodily communion and metaphorical orgasms. Though sexual it may be; vulgar it is not. Evol treats sexuality with utmost earnestness, approaching it indirectly through metaphors and symbolism. The mecha battling is another appropriate example of Evol’s tactfulness: the combat not only advances the story or provides enjoyment, it serves primarily as a platform for character growth and thematic development. During combat, the characters confront themselves as well as their enemies, and the battles are usually accompanied by some sort of symbolic exploration into sexuality or love. This is not to say that Evol is completely devoid of pandering, but the earnestness with which it is handled makes it forgivable.Aquarion Evol is a puzzle; its fragments hollow of meaning are but emergence potentials for its, if assembled, holistic magnificence. In the presentation of its themes, Evol’s characters play a far more pivotal role than anything else in the grand scheme. The cast of Evol consists of a wide array of characters; most of which are extremely likable in their simplicity. Their personalities are often defined by a single trait, and none of them are particularly complex. There is Andy W. Hol, whose obsession for digging holes embodies the desire for connecting worlds. There is the dying musician Shrade, whose love for music composition symbolizes the equilibrium between life and perilous passion. These simple characters are thematic representations more than anything else; each of them embody an abstract idea related to love, and it is through these ideas and their interplay with one another that the audience receives the messages of Evol.Aquarion Evol is love; nothing more and no less. The greatest charm of the series is the overflowing passion emanating from every single one of its components, from its characters to its symbols. In the end, no one and nothing is cast in a negative light. Even the antagonists, who initially appear heartlessly sadistic, eventually become heart-felt characters that the audience can sympathize with. The ending beautifully wraps up all the conflicts and strife using one thing only – ephemeral yet eternal, earthly yet ethereal – love. It is a conclusion so overwhelmingly corny, yet undeniably satisfying. Evol’s atmosphere is dramatically enhanced by its production values, which while not exceptional are above average in all respects. The art is sharp and detailed, the CG mecha combat is a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack is fitting to say the least as some of the more touching tunes can be tear-jerkers by themselves. The production quality is epitomized by its ending theme, which complements a gorgeously archaic montage of the characters with an ambient ballad which perfectly captures the romantic and melancholic air of the series. The producers poured all of their heart into Evol, conceiving a series that is by no means insightful, but by all measures enchanting.Aquarion Evol is not everyone’s cup of tea. It is perhaps best treated as a lengthy parable; an anime allegory for the power of love. It does not feature complex characters or tactful development; nor is there any profound exploration of humanity or society. What it does offer is its heartiness unparalleled by any other anime. With a wealth of giant robots, radiant characters, corny passion, and unwavering love, it captures the anime spirit more than most other shows do. Words cannot possibly do its magic justice; Aquarion Evol is an anime that needs to be experienced. is conceived and directed by Kawamori Shoji, known for his works teeming with passion such as the Macross series and AKB0048.

I translated the words at random and developed this idea that it would be like Finding Nemo with a twist. Don\'t find that too surprising, it insults my creativity (lets call it that) since my mind read the title as ""Aquarium Evil.""  Anyway, I was a tad disappointed.Don’t get me wrong; evil fishes would have made my day but I’m trying to be “cup half full” for the New Year’s crap. So I decided to watch even after the first...five minutes confirmed that evil fishes were, in fact, nowhere present, but it was better in a way.For those wondering, this is a review based on one episode (long one it is!) that I’ve seen. I know nothing of this genre or if this has any previous works but there’s always a first and I’ll forget to write my thoughts on it later, I’ll share them now:The first couple of minutes create a sort illusion that Aquarion Evol is just about Sora Amata, who’s name I only remember because of Kingdom Hearts. He’s a loner, who works at a movie theater and is in love with a movie (Skies of Aquaria) and wishes people loved it as much as he does. While talking to a girl about his favorite movie he blushes at something she says and starts floating in air. At first I thought it was a weird-anime-guy-thing and he floated when he got turned on or something, even though that isn’t weird by anime standards (meaning I’ve heard/seen of weirder). I decided to postpone that thought and let the show tell me why he has to stuff his boots with metal pieces to keep from floating up.The story’s attention shifts and action drops into our lap (finally!).We learn about their world, how it’s divided and the boys and girls don’t “mingle,” so to speak.  How members from their force have elemental powers (can it be called that?). How Aquarion has been battling with beings from an alternate dimension who wreak havoc by kidnapping citizens from Aquarion with spirit like machines called Abductors(not very creative there but it gets the point across and if your memory sucks like mine it’ll also help you remember) and take them back to their dimension. Aquarion fights back and sends their army called Aquaria to defend Aquarion.Along the way we get confirmation of what we already suspect, that Sora isn’t an ordinary boy but a chosen one who is “destined” to be fighting alongside Aquaria in his own special mecha spirit thing that he eventually unlocks by calling it by its name:“GO! Aquarion!”“Aquarion. He knows the forbidden name.” -----Are you kidding me!The animation is very nice and sort of reminds me of a role playing game sometimes. The characters each have their own uniqueness even in their own particular hair color. It’s a colorful world that’s for sure, but it gives it the aquatic feel to it that the anime wants to express (I guess). Something’s looked out of place for me, like one minute they were in a high tech building where everything seemed robotic or futuristic and the next it looked like a street in Paris. Threw me off a bit but I expected evil guppies so, eh.The characters, it\'s too soon to tell and I can\'t get a feel of them right of the bat, I mean I can make assumptions and say it\'ll be like so and so but I like to assume they\'ll surprise me even if they end up not doing it. The main cast pair, you know who it is right off the bat, I wasn\'t a fan of much after 40 minutes just because the girl is annoying, but she\'s cute (in an Princess Euphemia way) so that\'ll make up for it.The soundtrack is good, but honestly I would only notice something is off if it didn’t belong, like if Taylor Swift started playing during a fighting scene, otherwise I just notice that the music and instruments were in sync with the action scene and the mellow ones.I wasn’t a fan of all the “aqua” to everything but I was surprised that I was enjoying the first episode more than I thought I would.Why did I keep watching this show even though I don\'t watch sci-fi? Well because apart from the fish thing (above) it was the one show that I clicked on that during the first five minutes didn’t use the phrase, “wet panties.”It’s an entertaining show and even though I am probably not making sense in this review since I don’t review non-romance anything I think it has potential and it reminds me a little of the fighting scenes in Code Geass which is the only other mecha anime I’ve watched, ever.

Aquarion Evol is also one of the few anime I liked from the winter lineup.', 'The orgasm powered robots are back and ready to kick some ass. Now at this point I would like to say that if you dont already know, this is a sequal and I will admit that you dont need to see the first to understand this, I think you still should, because you will be able to appreciate this more.The original was good but the main problem I had was that I didnt really think a whole lot of the characters. There wasnt that one guy that I was like, hey I can relate to this; it just didnt happen. Here however they did...a far better job creating appealing characters which is the biggest step up in my book. Another change is that the show isnt about the orgasm powered robots, in fact they kinda go away from that. I like that because while I can say it was funny as hell at first it got old after so long and I was scared that that was all it was gonna be for a second season. Instead its used more in a symbolic nature, saying yeah thats whats up, but we\'re not here to make a vulgar display.The story itself starts 12000 years after the stuff in Aquarion goes down, and as you probably know it follows the reincarnates of those characters, and of course the characters before that. As was the case in Aquarion, Evol follows a group of teenageish characters as they pilot Aquarion to save the world from abductors. It focuses on their relationships with one another and shit like that, but at the same time it is able to maintain an interesting story that keeps you going all the way through.One thing that the story does is this: it changes alot of stuff that happenned in the original Aquarion, as in details that mattered alot to the story. This was risky because if you start changing stuff people can become confused, but I didnt and I doubt anyone will because they do such a good job in just the overall story-telling effort. It answers all of your questions which is very very important in any show.The art was beautiful. I thought that the art in the original was pretty decent but damn, this just takes it all up several notches. The fight scenes are terrific and everything is so clear. The character models are done far better than in Aquarion and that was just fantastic to see.Now on to the characters themselves. As ive already said, the characters were far more appealing to me this time around and I found myself rooting for them, which is something that didnt happen in the original. It follows Amata and his friend (who he\'d like to be more than friends with) Mikono as they enter the Neo-deava academy and become elements for Aquaria. As you should have figured out by now, or will shortly these are supposed to be the reincarnates of celian and apollonius which is kinda true but at the same time not and as it goes on you\'ll see what i mean. Also in this you have a villain who looks suspiciously like Amata and some others make return appearances such as that shadow-angel dude from Aquarion and that crazy bastard Fudo shows up(yeah 12,000 years later).As the story progressed, it got more and more tragic. There are just sad situations and the whatnot popping up everywhere at a point and I was all depressed and shit like ""aw damn, this is gonna have a sad ending"" which was the vibe I was getting. The actual ending though is very good and all the sad stuff that goes down at least gets brought to points where theres closure if nothing else. The ending also provides an actual end, by this I mean that the whole 12,000 year repeating cycle can finally be ended by the end to this.On a whole I was really happy with this show. It had subtle humor, good characters, orgasmic animation(sorry I just had to use that pun) and it fixed alot of the crap that Aquarion didnt do so hot with. I will recomend thsi to anyone who liked the original, hell, Ill recomend this if you didnt like the original because this is just on such a higher level. Enjoy. a far better job creating appealing characters which is the biggest step up in my book. Another change is that the show isnt about the orgasm powered robots, in fact they kinda go away from that. I like that because while I can say it was funny as hell at first it got old after so long and I was scared that that was all it was gonna be for a second season. Instead its used more in a symbolic nature, saying yeah thats whats up, but we\'re not here to make a vulgar display.The story itself starts 12000 years after the stuff in Aquarion goes down, and as you probably know it follows the reincarnates of those characters, and of course the characters before that. As was the case in Aquarion, Evol follows a group of teenageish characters as they pilot Aquarion to save the world from abductors. It focuses on their relationships with one another and shit like that, but at the same time it is able to maintain an interesting story that keeps you going all the way through.One thing that the story does is this: it changes alot of stuff that happenned in the original Aquarion, as in details that mattered alot to the story. This was risky because if you start changing stuff people can become confused, but I didnt and I doubt anyone will because they do such a good job in just the overall story-telling effort. It answers all of your questions which is very very important in any show.The art was beautiful.

Enjoy.', 'This Is the 2nd season Of Aquarion. Its By Kawamori Shoji and is currently writing the manga as well. I officially liked the ending but really needs a third season because it didn\'t describe or answer many questions about the previous series. I\'m happy for this anime but a few of the fans are hating cause it had an alternate ending to it.The other Aquarion was more serious,in a way. This starts with a boy named Amata who goes to a village and meets a girl named Mikono, they share deep love connection to each other. This season is about destiny,faith and Forbidden love(That every...affection that everybody has, yeah its forbidden). Even a few Shadow angels are reincarnated here and want world domination against humans and want to be with there favorite angel but don\'t get the love...eh to bad. Love makes you do crazy things in life, Good and bad times.I really loved the story but I wish they make more episodes for the season..like an ""ongoing"" Anime or something. I liked the Art because it felt more new than the before series.The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that they didn\'t answer every question about everybody. By the way don\'t let a shadow angel use Aquarion..It doesn\'t look to well. I was also happy that they had new Aquarion vectors and names for them.I chose a 7 for the Story cause It didn\'t feel like it actually answered enough questions about everyone. I still like the story and characters with it.The Art was a 10 because its different than the other that Its stunning with everything around it.The sound was a 10, because the music and the attacks had the same melody as The first series did, which was good.The Characters was a 10 because every character stayed in there place during the series. They listen and help one another.The enjoyment was a 9 and Overall was 10, I really enjoyed watching it so I recommend you go watch it if you haven\'t seen it yet. Its great and new chapter for you as well. affection that everybody has, yeah its forbidden).

Duuuuh, I guess, I\'d probabaly say that this is all good, the genres indicated like Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Mecha, Romance and Sci-fi did proved well  for this anime, ok so there is that  fujoshi element in the last episode of this thing which for me is EEEEEEEWWWWW. But then again the romance genre has the most impact in the story so for the ""Story"" part I\'d give it a ""Very Good"" number 8, since I like the main plot were there are challenges that comes with Amata\'s quest for...Mikono\'s heart, aside from it every episode has its own set of climatic thing in it which make the whole 26 episode worthwhile.Art and sound: Mediocre 5.I just have nothing to say about these parts, since the art is similary with ""Sousei No Aquarion."" Plus, the fanservice is kinda off, though Zessica looks hot in her skimpy outfit. As for the sound, I kinda like the mechs changing theme.Character: Good 7.I like the romantic role that Amata and Mikono played as lovers who are fighting to reverse the destinity that keeps them apart, also I kind like that role of Andy breaking into Mix\'s heart I guess you may say that the comedy genre of this anime is them, as for the other characters like Sharade, Cayenne, Kaguya and Mallory they really did their part well as part of the  of this anime for as they represent the anime\'s action genre . I also like that the antagonist is solely reside in Mykage, in fact his role is a total representation of evil behind that angelic look. For Fudo.... well I guess since this anime has a fantasy genre, he may well be that genre.Enjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.Ok, so for me, to give it such rating is because I\'ve always expected that the arc would be a Mikono X Amata arc and it did happen, ok so most would expect a Kaguya X Mikono arc and a Zessica x Amata arc.....good thing it didn\'t happend which it the enjoyable part of the anime. Overall, this anime is worth watching every episode and this is one anime which you don\'t have to watch its prequel, since the way that  Mari Okada of studio Satelight created it can stand on its own. In fact you might say that it is unrelated to the prequel- even if it is, then again who cares? This anime is all good, and that\'s that.I hope that Satelight studios would make another sequel or a spin-off of this anime.Btw: Mykage X Fudo (or Apollonius) arc?????????EEEEEEWWWWWW I hate shonen-ai or should I say Otoku-ai. No offends to LGBT\'s out there, just my personal opinion. Mikono\'s heart, aside from it every episode has its own set of climatic thing in it which make the whole 26 episode worthwhile.Art and sound: Mediocre 5.I just have nothing to say about these parts, since the art is similary with ""Sousei No Aquarion.""

Some obvious similarities are drawn in the first episode...between Amata/Kagura (Evol) and Apollo (Genesis)...and Mikono (Evol) and Sylvia (Genesis).It\'s nice to also hear some of my favourite Genesis Akino songs reused in this series.But my favourite part of the series is the clash between the mysterious Kagura character with the humble Amata. Both desire ""the hand"" of Mikono but both share a secret that makes the relationship between the three so much more complicated than ""just another love triangle"".So for those who love action mixed with romance, this is definitely the anime for you. between Amata/Kagura (Evol) and Apollo (Genesis)...and Mikono (Evol) and Sylvia (Genesis).It\'s nice to also hear some of my favourite Genesis Akino songs reused in this series.But my favourite part of the series is the clash between the mysterious Kagura character with the humble Amata.

That's my review of this series and I wonder how in the living heck I manged to watch 18 episodes or 25"", ""Let's be honest. How many of you actually watched the original Aquarion 7 years ago?it came at a time where anime was just starting to be popular where i came from, and where i lived, to love anime as much as i did, or rather, japanese games, art music, etc etc, was anathema to the social ladder. didnt really care. point being i watched it years ago. i still watch it. i have the damn thing in my hard drive right now. when the characters said that the movie the characters were watching was a let down and only the music was good, good...enough to warrant its own show, i felt so vindicated.nvrmind, after all this years thinking how underappreciated it was kinda riles me up. the music it uses now is a variation, remixed and improved. if you loved the music 7 years ago, you'll love it now.graphics? arts? i had a fucking orgasm over the beauty. nuff said. the venice like river of the first date, absolutely beautiful. the characters are drawn far more aesthetically pleasing compared to the original. i mean, put amato and apollo side by side and start laughing. i dont really follow anime as avidly as i used to, but i can honestly say this might just be the best animation of 2012.characters? eh.... just two spisodes..... no comment except that most people in the show seem to have a stick up their arse. especially the single sex ladies in the robot. to be honest though? the first thing that struck out to me when i watched the first ten minutes were how the Celiane and sylvia was depicted in a movie. i had visions of Apollo and Appolonius bursting out of Amato's back old school style and LAUGH at how girly the heroine is now compared to the real thing 12000 years and 24000 years ago. i kid you not. basically so far the blue haired heroine has shown herself to be a typical japanese Yamato Nadeshiko. soft spoken, sensitive, utterly beautiful as opposed to the rough housing, amazon warriors the first two heroines were.overall? i sat in my chair and ate salted peanuts while staring at a blank wall  for 12 hours straight because i was waiting for the thing to be released. so i have to say i might be a little biased. if you like visually pleasing shows though? this might whet your appetite and if not the characters dont, the story will drawn you in. enough to warrant its own show, i felt so vindicated.nvrmind, after all this years thinking how underappreciated it was kinda riles me up. the music it uses now is a variation, remixed and improved. if you loved the music 7 years ago, you'll love it now.graphics? arts? i had a fucking orgasm over the beauty. nuff said. the venice like river of the first date, absolutely beautiful. the characters are drawn far more aesthetically pleasing compared to the original. i mean, put amato and apollo side by side and start laughing. i dont really follow anime as avidly as i used to, but i can honestly say this might just be the best animation of 2012.characters? eh.... just two spisodes..... no comment except that most people in the show seem to have a stick up their arse. especially the single sex ladies in the robot. to be honest though? the first thing that struck out to me when i watched the first ten minutes were how the Celiane and sylvia was depicted in a movie. i had visions of Apollo and Appolonius bursting out of Amato's back old school style and LAUGH at how girly the heroine is now compared to the real thing 12000 years and 24000 years ago. i kid you not. basically so far the blue haired heroine has shown herself to be a typical japanese Yamato Nadeshiko. soft spoken, sensitive, utterly beautiful as opposed to the rough housing, amazon warriors the first two heroines were.overall? i sat in my chair and ate salted peanuts while staring at a blank wall  for 12 hours straight because i was waiting for the thing to be released. so i have to say i might be a little biased. if you like visually pleasing shows though? this might whet your appetite and if not the characters dont, the story will drawn you in."", 'SPOILERS AHEAD:So, as always, Aquarion as a franchise is a mixed bag.  The original series received quite a bit of criticism for both its throwbacks to older style ""Super Robot"" anime, as well as for an at-times silly set of subplots surrounding its characters.  The original conceits of the series were often cringe-inducing as well: the action of the series focuses aroudn Aquarion, which is a giant robot formed of 3 ""vectors"" which combined into a giant robot, accompanied by the pilots undergoing a ""gattai"" (union) which results in them, well, orgasming.Aquarion Evol is not going to do much for people...who disliked the original series, and in fact may not be a great show for people who loved it, either.  I do think that there\'s a lot to enjoy here, particularly if you are a fan of romance + giant robots or the original series itself.  Just don\'t expect too much.SOUND: The Soundtrack is by the always wonderful Yoko Kanno, with frequent vocals by AKINO.  If you\'re a little older-school anime fan like me, you might find yourself wishing that Yoko Kanno had collaborated with Maaya Sakamoto instead, but AKINO has plenty to offer here, and once again displays some quite good English skills (which makes sense, since the singer and her siblings all hail from Utah by way of Mesa, Arizona) alongside a strong voice seemingly made for belting out Yoko Kanno classics.There isn\'t a lot of new music on display however, other than the OP/ED themes and a few insert songs.  Most of the music is recycled from the first series, but rather than seeming lazy or cheap on the part of the producers, I think that the music does a great job of tying together the two series, which is doubly important since there are only a few characters in common, the character designs are a little different, and Aquarion and Aquarion EVOL are also separated by a 12,000 year gap.There\'s not much to say about the rest of the sound, which is to say it\'s inoffensive.  Aside from several of the female characters having your usual squeaky childlike voices and one character (Schrade) sounding like he had a cold the entire time, the cast does a decent job with their characters.  The sound effects and environmental sound are good, and fit well with the fight scenes and quiet scenes alike.ART & ANIMATION:  The character designs and actual animation are great in this show, presumably because SATELIGHT used all their money on the digipaint scenes after saving a boatload by reusing assets from the first series.  The character designs, provided by Chinatsu Kurahana, Kana Ishida, & Hirotaka Marufuji are vibrant, unique, and make it visually easy to distinguish between characters.  There are a few weird choices here (like the prudish Mix wearing a dress that lifts and flaunts her breasts to an absurd degree) but all of it seems fitting with the tone of the series as a whole.As with the original series, the 3dcg itself is not great, but then, it never is in anime.  Animations can be jerky, as if there aren\'t enough \'tween frames, and the mecha often have very stilted and awkward movements.  They do their best to work around these limitations, and since I didn\'t turn the series off in disgust I guess that they succeeded.STORY & CHARACTER:  This is where the good turns a little towards bad.  Way too much time is spent on side characters (particularly the duo of happy, perverted ANDY W HOLE and prudish, frosty MIX) and the main romance never gets much development.  Worse, the main character is written (on purpose) to be indecisive and passive, which really saps the enjoyment from watching him.  There\'s a lot to be praised here for the way that main characters confront their feelings for each other head-on, and the willingness to develop some of the relationships in the series far beyond the usual ""confession in the last 30s of the series"" bullshit, but the truth of the matter is that head writer Mari Okada didn\'t seem to find much interesting in the relationship between Amata and Mikono, and it shows.  As I said before, we spend a lot of time with the characters Jin and Yunoha, and MIX and Andy, and while both of their arcs have relatively satisfying conclusions, Amata and Mikono seem to come together in the end (after 26 episodes of Mikono waffling about Amata and his evil twin Kagura) more because they should for plot reasons than because they seemed a good fit together.Additionally, we spend a lot of time doing silly ""anime trope""-ish episodes: a school festival, a beach episode, etc etc etc.  While none of them are BAD per se, they are also not particularly good either.  The little bit of character growth we get during them is usually ignored completely next episode.That being said, whereas the theme of the original Aquarion may have been ""love as destiny"" this series clearly embraces the idea of ""love in spite of it"".  Kagura claims to have been born to love Mikono who is a reincarnation of Aquarion\'s Silvia, but Amata (her eventual choice) loves her for herself, not because of some 12,000 year long arc towards a destined ending.  Likewise, most of the other characters in the show do not seem interested in finding out about their previous lives the way Apollo, Silvia, &c in the first season were.  Instead they are all focused on their love and relationships in the here and now, and to hell with what your past lives wanted.I will say, one thing this show does fantastically is present homosexual love and homosocial relationships in a positive, engaging manner.  Schrade and Cayenne are clearly deeply in love, but their relationship is hardly even commented on by the other characters except to present sympathy when the inevitable occurs. Meanwhile, while Toma & Mikage may technically be non-gendered or genderqueer, they both present as masculine, as do the objects of their love, Apollon.  This is not presented a prurient, or weird, or even worthy of mention: they simply love each other in a way that shows gender has no meaning in love.  Much later in the series as well, MIX is transformed into a man but Andy doesn\'t even blink: it doesn\'t matter to him.  he loves Mix the person, not Mix the walking pair of breasts with some glasses perched on top.  And while this may seem a little too ""perfect"", it also shows excellent growth in the character from his roots at the beginning of the show where he was desperate to sneak into the girls\' side of the dormitory to get himself a peek at some ""big bangs.""Other than the diffuse focus on the cast and the at-time silly one-off episodes however,the biggest thing that bothered me is retconning.  The identity of Apollo is retconned during Aquarion EVOL,  and while Shoji Kawamori insists this was always part of the plan, There certainly was no evidence in the original Genesis of Aquarion series (there may have been in the OVA released later, but I have not seen that).  This changes the nature of the ending of the original series, and changes Toma\'s character (and his reincarnation in Mikage) substantially, seemingly only because this was the need of having an angel as a villain to manipulate everyone else.Anyways, it\'s about time for me to wrap this one up, and I will say that despite my complaints, I enjoyed my time with Aquarion EVOL and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take as a given the silly trappings of the Aquarion universe (gattai as sex, bad cgi robots, totally ignoring forced gattais as metaphors for rape, etc) and enjoy a series that tries its hardest to fit in some shallow meditations on the nature of love and the connections between humans in between the giant robot fights and eye candy.  Just don\'t expect too much depth here, and prepare for a lot of silliness. who disliked the original series, and in fact may not be a great show for people who loved it, either.  I do think that there\'s a lot to enjoy here, particularly if you are a fan of romance + giant robots or the original series itself.  Just don\'t expect too much.SOUND: The Soundtrack is by the always wonderful Yoko Kanno, with frequent vocals by AKINO.

As I said before, we spend a lot of time with the characters Jin and Yunoha, and MIX and Andy, and while both of their arcs have relatively satisfying conclusions, Amata and Mikono seem to come together in the end (after 26 episodes of Mikono waffling about Amata and his evil twin Kagura) more because they should for plot reasons than because they seemed a good fit together.Additionally, we spend a lot of time doing silly ""anime trope""-ish episodes: a school festival, a beach episode, etc etc etc.  While none of them are BAD per se, they are also not particularly good either.  The little bit of character growth we get during them is usually ignored completely next episode.That being said, whereas the theme of the original Aquarion may have been ""love as destiny"" this series clearly embraces the idea of ""love in spite of it"".  Kagura claims to have been born to love Mikono who is a reincarnation of Aquarion\'s Silvia, but Amata (her eventual choice) loves her for herself, not because of some 12,000 year long arc towards a destined ending.  Likewise, most of the other characters in the show do not seem interested in finding out about their previous lives the way Apollo, Silvia, &c in the first season were.  Instead they are all focused on their love and relationships in the here and now, and to hell with what your past lives wanted.I will say, one thing this show does fantastically is present homosexual love and homosocial relationships in a positive, engaging manner.  Schrade and Cayenne are clearly deeply in love, but their relationship is hardly even commented on by the other characters except to present sympathy when the inevitable occurs. Meanwhile, while Toma & Mikage may technically be non-gendered or genderqueer, they both present as masculine, as do the objects of their love, Apollon.  This is not presented a prurient, or weird, or even worthy of mention: they simply love each other in a way that shows gender has no meaning in love.  Much later in the series as well, MIX is transformed into a man but Andy doesn\'t even blink: it doesn\'t matter to him.  he loves Mix the person, not Mix the walking pair of breasts with some glasses perched on top.  And while this may seem a little too ""perfect"", it also shows excellent growth in the character from his roots at the beginning of the show where he was desperate to sneak into the girls\' side of the dormitory to get himself a peek at some ""big bangs.""Other than the diffuse focus on the cast and the at-time silly one-off episodes however,the biggest thing that bothered me is retconning.  The identity of Apollo is retconned during Aquarion EVOL,  and while Shoji Kawamori insists this was always part of the plan, There certainly was no evidence in the original Genesis of Aquarion series (there may have been in the OVA released later, but I have not seen that).  This changes the nature of the ending of the original series, and changes Toma\'s character (and his reincarnation in Mikage) substantially, seemingly only because this was the need of having an angel as a villain to manipulate everyone else.Anyways, it\'s about time for me to wrap this one up, and I will say that despite my complaints, I enjoyed my time with Aquarion EVOL and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take as a given the silly trappings of the Aquarion universe (gattai as sex, bad cgi robots, totally ignoring forced gattais as metaphors for rape, etc) and enjoy a series that tries its hardest to fit in some shallow meditations on the nature of love and the connections between humans in between the giant robot fights and eye candy.  Just don\'t expect too much depth here, and prepare for a lot of silliness.', ""Story - The story for AE seems more progressive and less episodic than the previous series (Sousei no Aquarion), it is has some good action and comedic scenes which are good, but as a whole, the anime suffers unfortunately because it incorporates the easily misunderstood belief of reincarnation. That combined with some people's disagreement at the coupling at the end despite being obvious from the beginning, it does have a lot criticism, which I feel is unfair. I think it has one of those plots in which you either like it or hate it.Art -  The art is very good and detailed, all...of it from the mechs to the background enviroments. Most certainly the strongest aspect of the anime.Sound - Sound in this anime is also very good, the variation of music is good and is nicely timed to the fighting scenes.Character - Just like Sousei no Aquarion, Aquarion Evol has characters that your going to like and others that you hate, that includes the antagonists as well. I don't know why but I much prefer the characters in AE than in SNA, the characters personalities seem more interesting.Enjoyment - There are some flaws with the story and the characters, but Aquarion Evol is still very enjoyable. The action scenes are well timed with the music, the enviroments, character designs, mechs and lighting are easy on the eyes.Overall - I enjoyed watching it, also Aquarion Evol was designed so that people didn't need to watch Sousei no Aquarion to understand it, so you can watch it without watch SNA. of it from the mechs to the background enviroments.

I would always wait every week for this anime. This anime has everything I\'m looking for; Cute Girls, Robots, Comedy and Romance.At first i had no clue where this anime was going, so i deiced to watch the first season ""Genesis of Aquarion"". It was okay, i...just needed a clue what the whole series was about. Mostly about fight invaders who were harvesting humans so they could stay alive or so, and the only way to stop them are to use these people so called ""elements"" to pilot a Robot.Aquarion Evol revolves around a boy name Amata which i THINK who is the recreation or Apollo. Amata is a boy who is an element (he has wings in his feet) user who meets a girl name Mikono and starts liking her. Mikono seems to be a shy and timid type of person. They then get involve in the Robot fighting with the invaders, and then has been made to stay at this school that is separated between girls and boy. Lets just put it to that for now, I\'m still watching. (xTo be honest this anime will drag you in, with great art as if you are watching in HD, and with also great Opening and Ending songs. I love the Characters. This show is Random and Weird at the same time, that\'s why I love it. just needed a clue what the whole series was about.

I would recommend this anime to people who like to see people having orgasms powering up robots! A funny anime, but the ending was like WTF! So the evil Kagura who was pursuing the amazing Mikono, just suddenly gave up on her! Then Amata the most weak-ass character of all time just took her! Though I do prefer Amata over Kagura, Amata barely did anything outside of his stupid robot!I may be a little harsh on this anime, but I cannot say I absolutely enjoyed it! The plot was great! The mechs fights were ok, the romance was a bit...dull(still Ok)! The music was amazing! They could've easily done a better job on this anime, but they decided not to.

I would add something like Amata suddenly becoming badass and actually standing up to Kagura!Also btw Mikono was the most useless(she says so herself) anime girl I have ever seen! But she was the cutest(obviously) girl that got paired up with an ugly ass guy Amata! Though Zessica and Amata would have been a better match, I still like AmataXMikono better. dull(still Ok)!

But they throw that out and say that he wasn't bust instead hes the reincarnation of the dog, which isn't shown in the previous series at all, maybe the other retelling they show...him but other then that he never existed in the prior series.It was at this point I lost all enjoyment from the series, as I enjoyed the previous series although melodramatic, it still came around for a decent romance drama. Which was founded on the fact apollo was apollonius that gets thrown out the window near the end of this show.Besides the horrible turn of events for the story, the characters are good and develop very well, they entertain multiple relationships between characters which is nice.

This series is a sequel of ""Genesis of Aquarion"" but you need not watch the first series to understand the plot since both were set on different eras.(about 12,000 years apart). When i first started watching it i expected a serious mecha (I haven\'t watched the original series) i had no idea it would be an exaggerated love story.Every episode they would focus on love and romance, heck even the mecha\'s powers are triggered by love. Faith and destiny are also things that are consistently...mentioned in this series. Characters are overly melodramatic, they always shout and their emotions are always exaggerated. The plot is about a young male named Sora Amata. Sora Amata is a fanatic of a movie called ""Skies of Aquaria"" and always spends time alone in an old theater watching it. (There is a reason behind this fanaticism which i won\'t spoil).One day, after finishing the movie again and was about to clean the theater, he was taken by surprise when he saw that he wasn\'t alone. There he met a girl named Mikono Suzuhiro and it was Love at first sight!! Now Sora Amata has the special power to ""fly"" or levitate. Funny thing is he levitates whenever he gets excited or scared. To cut the story short, Abductors came and tried to abduct Mikono. The earth defenders who flying ships called ""vectors"" came and tried to defeat the Abductors but failed. Somehow, Sora with his levitation power, accidentally boarded an aquarion (with Mikono). Sora\'s vector, by pure chance, combined with two other vectors piloted by Zessica Wong and Cayenne Suzuhiro which then formed Aquarion Evol, which then proceeded to beat the abductors. The two joined NEO-DEAVA an academy for teenagers with Elemental Powers (Sora\'s Levitation is an Elemental Power). NEO-DEAVA\'s purpose is to defend the world from the abductors. Students of the academy are also the ones who pilots the vectors. Now the story revolves around love and the battle between the academy and the abductors.There are a ton of characters here, and i\'m happy to say that most of them aren\'t flat or one dimensional, a bunch of eccentric ones. Each student has their own weird and unique elemental power, from Sora\'s Levitation, Cayenne\'s Prophecy to Andy Hole\'s dig or hole creating power. The good stuff about aquarion is that nobody is left out, each had their own time to shine, each have their own romance problem, whether it was a love triangle ,unrequited love, forbidden love, love between abductor and earthling, and even destined love reborn through reincarnation. This makes the series entertaining to watch, watching the interaction between each characters.The Art is definitely good, the animation of the characters is consistently good and I love the colorful style. The 3D for the mecha is quite awesome too, it\'s colorful and vivid, and the way they presented those over-the-top fighting scenes and special moves are a thing of beauty, really an eye candy. The special attacks of the aquarion (born from the different trio combinations of element users) are fun to watch.Now the plot is thick, not complex but a lot of things are going on, from the characters (tons of them) and even the enemies. The enemies aren\'t your one dimensional bad guys, there\'s a reason they\'re doing the abductions, and the show really did a good of job of showing the viewers the ""other"" side or the issues of the Alteans/Abuctors. (Abductors  are some form of aliens from a planet called Altea ""Altair"" who comes to earth and abducts females). Now the acting may be cheesy and exaggerated but it never became annoying, it was quite entertaining to watch, it\'s like your typical heroes in RPG games who would be over melodramatic. The soundtrack is amazing too! just like the over dramatic lines the soundtracks are over the top and are one of the best that i have ever heard in an anime. Good vocals and a lot of beautiful instruments, not your typical anime pop or rock song. The sound effects works quite well with the grand visuals too. You can tell that Aquarion Evol isn\'t trying to be some serious mecha, but stands firmly with it\'s unique style, which was effective and was genuinely really entertaining. I seriously recommend this to anyone, except those not interested in love stories  It has a lot of quality mecha battles to offer too and you\'ll never get bored with this one.My Personal Rating: 9/10 mentioned in this series.

The story in Evol is too complicated, and it destroyed the whole fun of watching it. Its became something like crossover of Dark Souls games and Sword Art Online. Too much love, too much hidden stories to reveal, and never ending cycle.And now, there will be spoilers, of course, theres no way to tell about that in other way.So there\'s a planet, where people have problem with their lineage (Female part of society died, because of resons?), so to solve this problem, they was going to kidnap some of the women from other planet, to find cure for their illnes.They kidnapped a woman, that was an actress, playing an ancestor from the 12.000 years ago (Silvia), showing more or less the story of first Aquarion anime. Unfortunately, Alicia, the actress, get to coma, right afret leaving the planet, so using her as a cure is imposibble, and they have to find another lady, good enough for ""experiments"", but all of them, if survive, will change into male. ""Magic curse"".And there is a first problem. Who are the ""aliens"", and why there is an Shadow Angel with them? Mykage looks almost same, as Toma looked like, but it\'s for sure not him (Am I sure?), because he ended his life peacfully, conecting with Apollo (theoretically Apollonius reincarnation), at first Aquarion.Of course, Altair planet is a creation of disballance in the world, created after end of last cycle. So it is artificial problem, created by unknown powers, to cause even more problems to other people.According to everything, that I read, Mykage, 24.000 years ago, had a ""boyfriend"" Shadow Angel, but he fell in love in human girl, this made him angry, and he promised, the world will be destroyed, and stuff.That means, this story was going simultaneously, with story of Apollonius and Toma, but Atlantis was destroyed and sent to other realm.But no. After few episodes, it turned out, Kagura, and Amata, are not raincarnations of Apollonius, but Pollo dog-like angel being, and Mikono is reincarnation/descendant of Silvia, and Celiana from 24.000 years apart, so that means, Shadow ""Gay"" Angel, was teoretically Apollonius, and Pollo was dog, who fell in love i Celiana, who was fiance of Apollonius. Nice triangle.I was lost. Is that means, Apollonius had a friend in Toma, other Shadow Angel, and had a ""Gay boyfriend"" Mykage, they want to destroy humankind, but Apollonius fell in love, his friend dog-like being fell in love in same person, as Apollonius, and because of that, Toma wanted, after 12.000 years, after his awakening, to destroy humankind, and after another 12,000 years, Mykage woke up and said ""Well. I need some slaves, to use them to destroy people. Maybe that planet with problems will be perfect for that?"".So I dont see any connection between ""alien planet"", and Mykage, dont see conection between Mykage and Apollonius, or at least I didn\'s saw it, maybe I\'m blind.But suprise! Mykage and Toma are the same person. It\'s just happen, that when Toma was sitting with Apollo in Aquarion, he realised, Apollo is not Apollonius reincarnation, got angry, change name, and after 12.000 years, he decided to destroy world, again.And on the top of that, there is ""Mister General"" Fudou, who appeard frome nowhere, with lots of donuts, and started everything from begining, but wrongly, hiding from everyone, who truly is he.4/10 then, no more, no less, because its total mess, and I\'m dissapearing in endless abyss of internet. realise, what is really going on in this world.I don\'t recomend that anime to anyone, who ""pukes"" after too much amount of love on screen, and to people, who have problems (like me, hue hue) to connect all threads in stories, where are many plot twists.Only two things, that can be counted as a pros, is better animation quality, comparing to first Aquarion, and the original soundtrack from first season, that appeard few times.First Aquarion, compared to Aquarion Evol, is a masterpiece, that should recieve an Oscar.

The main plot of Apollonius, Celian and Toma doesn\'t come in until the last 10 episodes or so, and, before this part, it\'s extremely boring (maybe ONLY the last two episodes are somewhat interesting and entertaining, if you liked the story of the prequel).The characters.They are the worst part of this anime. The protagonists are simply stupid. The main male character is Amata, a timid, insecure teen. He\'s annoying, stupid and is completely and blindly in love with the female lead, Mikono. Oh boy Mikono. She\'s the worst character of the entire anime. She\'s the most annoying in the cast, constantly says she\'s useless and dimish herself... but she doesn\'t do anything to change that and what\'s worst is that the other characters see her as committed, intelligent and kind, while she\'s the exact opposite. I won\'t go into details, but she mistreats the male lead constantly, in what I could only describe as an act of narcissism and egocentrism. She\'s spoiled, and always talks about herself. Maybe only ONCE she did something useful for someone else. Her power is completely useless, just like herself, actually. Mikono is truly annoying. I found it funny, at first, to mock her because of her stupidity and awuful behaviour, but, after the first half of the anime, she became the very first reason why I started to dislike it.The other part of the cast is forgettable. Mykage, the villain of the story, is the only interesting character (and he was right all along, imo).Design.Character design, I think, is not as good as Sousei, but it\'s nice. I liked the ""glow-up"" and redesing of some characters, and I think this is one of the most positive things about the anime. Mykage has probably the most appealing looks.Music.As the quote from before said, the OST is the most memorable thing from this anime. The main theme is popular in Japan and if you\'ve watched Sousei, you know it was the first opening. The soundtrack is cool, especially the parts with the choir. To me, they give a sense of mystery and ""holiness"". They are the best part of this anime.

For you guys that don´t like long reviews I summit up here in the beginning about what I liked and disliked with show.Liked: Great art, character designs, and animation - the best thing about Aquarion Evol. Some good characters and character development. The story the first 2/3 of show. Kagura. Quite entertaining to watch.Disliked: The story the last 1/3 of the show. Mikono´s and some other characters development (or lack of it). The lack of deeper explanations of some elements within the story.For you guys that like to really get...to know a show before watching it, here follows a more detailed version about how I experienced Aquarion Evol.Story: 6/10Its really a shame because the first 2/3 of the show are actually really good, but falls a part and spacing out towards the end.Aquarion Evol is the independent sequel to Genesis of Aquarion, so you dont have to watch the first show to understand or enjoy this one. The story takes place 12000 years after the first show. New cast and so on. The story takes up speed already in the first episode, the main characters are meeting for the first time and we are introduced to the world they live in. After that we get introduced to side characters (they are more then sides, many of them have own chapters and good development) and the main plot. The main plot is basically that men in mecha suites from another dimension attacks their world, and kidnap women back to their dimension. Why you may ask? If you watch the show you will know, cant spoil it here - its one of the plots pillars. The world that most of our main cast is living in has an organization that countermeasure these attacks in their own mecha suits (the mecha fights is often quite entertaining). The story builds up nice and steady and becomes quite intresting... Until we are getting to the last 1/3 of the show.. There I feel like the plot was smeared all over the place, and lost it direction to throw in lot of random lines and events. Much of the build ups mostly ran out in the sand, or changed direction. Always sad to see lost potential, but I will still state that it was worth watching.Art: 9/10As mentioned before, Aquarion Evols best trade. Great art and animation. Beautiful scenery`s and detailed backgrounds. How the light fell in throw a window or sparkling sunset - it was all gorgeous. Great and beautiful character designs (more Kaguras to the people). The mechas didnt feel out of place in the backgrounds, which they often can do. Overall very pleasing for the eyes.Sound: 7/10OST was overall ok, some songs better then others. It did its job to highlight the atmosphere in the scenes, but wasnt breathtaking. OPs was also little catchy, but nothing spectacular for me. I watched the dubbed version, and voice acting was above average and put life and feelings in the characters. Backgrounds sounds was also pretty good.Character: 7/10The main thing about the characters in A.E. is that the main cast has very little development. They start out with the tools to be much greater but never really goes there. Some of the ""sides"" the other hand has a lot of development. A.E., would I state, is equally character and plot driven. I like that in a show, but then it has to pull throw to the end with both, and A.E. fails some in both departments. Now its sound like im bashing the show, but I actually liked a lot of it. So let´s go down to way I liked and disliked some of the characters.Mikono - Our main girl. The very cute and shy kind of girl. She doesn\'t believe in herself and think she´s useless, which is a result of her past. Nothing usual to begin with but she kind of stays that way the whole show. Mikono had the potential to be something great but stays in ""damsel in distress"" state pretty much the whole 26 episodes. She has some moments of developing but are soon back on square one.Amata: Pretty standard shounen MC male character. Is very cute but dont know it, and girls falling in live with him and he dont now how to deal with it. Amata has a special gift that give him gravity related powers. Unlike Mikono he train his power and become stronger and stronger to protect his comrades and Mikono. Even do he actually had some development, it was to little and bleak to be that memorable.Was it any good characters in A.E. at all? you may ask now. And yes, there was some great characters.Andy, Shrade, Mix, Yunoha and Jin where all interesting and made the most development in their characters. I enjoyed the relationship development between Andy & Mix and Jin & Yunoha much more then that between Amata and Mikono. All mentioned did a very touching personal development as well, and was the cast i mostly enjoyed to watch.Kagura is his own special case. I loved the character Kagura. He is the shows antagonist, but I ended up shearing for him. Why? Because is a sexy sad lonely badass. What I didnt like was how little time they had put in to his character development, he had so much potential but didnt come throw in the end (or more like a non-logical 180).Enjoyment: 8/10For you poor souls that stayed with me for this long, I keep it short here. Maybe its sounds like I didnt enjoyed the show, but many times I really enjoyed it. Then it was good, it was really good! A combination of beautiful art and animation, with some interesting characters and mostly a good plot let A.E. in to may heart. 2/3 of the show is really worth more like 9.Overall: 7/10I really wanted to give this show a higher score, but the last episodes wont allow it. If for nothing this show should be watched for the amazing art and character designs, that it self is worth the time. But I really enjoyed many parts of the show, I think i cried a couple of times and had some laughs to, so I was moved by the show anyway. I definitely would recommend this show if you want to see something beautiful with some great characters and romance. to know a show before watching it, here follows a more detailed version about how I experienced Aquarion Evol.Story: 6/10Its really a shame because the first 2/3 of the show are actually really good, but falls a part and spacing out towards the end.Aquarion Evol is the independent sequel to Genesis of Aquarion, so you dont have to watch the first show to understand or enjoy this one.

First, the first time I watched this I was still a kid and I was missing episodes. Now I rewatched it, I still felt the same excitement and thrill.This Anime is a rare breed. It gives you the ""I wanna love this character"" feels in most of the pairings. I really adored all the main characters and the way the story was played I felt the emotion that was being portrayed. I hated Mikage when the story wanted him to be hated, I hated Kagura when the story...wanted him to be hated, I felt sorry for them when the story tells their side and showed that they can be forgiven and what they did made sense.I say this is rare because it showed a lot of mini genres in it. a pure love story between Amata and Mikono, A romcom yet so real pairing of Andy and Mix. Mikono\'s attraction to Kagura that gives that bitter taste. Shrade\'s relationship with everyone that suites him. And to be honest even tho I hate BL, Shrade and Cayenne portrayed a beautiful relationship. There\'s Yunoha and Jin too. It showed a lot of comedy too. The Action mecha part doesn\'t make complete sense because of the power of love and friendship tho, but that sets it apart from other mecha anime. Watching this anime can put you in the edge of your sit or bed whatever, specially when Kagura comes to Vega and look for Mikono, you can really feel the thrill and connect to the characters and just shout how dumb and weak Amata is whenever Mikono will get taken away.The story about the two planets was portrayed well too and specially Alicia and Izumo\'s love story too. And the story about Kagura, Amata and his parents was really expressed in a lot of ways. The way they told the legend was really cool, and really makes you feel like you wanna watch the other Aquarion series too.-In short this Anime is not like the Anime this days that are One sided. The art may be outdated but id say in its prime it was one of the best. Story wise not everyone will like it, but if you like and understand deep and meaningful story about love and relationship and destiny then you can relate because in that genre this Anime is #1 for me - wanted him to be hated, I felt sorry for them when the story tells their side and showed that they can be forgiven and what they did made sense.I say this is rare because it showed a lot of mini genres in it. a pure love story between Amata and Mikono, A romcom yet so real pairing of Andy and Mix.

Aquarion, its predecessor 7 years prior, seemed largely to be a tech demo for Shoji Kawamori’s next project Macross Frontier, with as many random plot elements thrown in to see what stuck. But while Aquarion felt messy and uninteresting, Aquarion Evol skims away the fat and refines the hidden qualities of the world. Evol allows a pretty solid reset, taking 12,000 years after original Aquarion. The previous series is both history and a religion in Evol, as well as an in-universe movie that sarcastically references its real world failures (but...hey, at least the soundtrack won awards). Evol is much lighter and more engaging, and also manages to put much more effort into establishing its world, including having the religion and history of the previous series get names, locations, and events wrong just as stories change when passed down generations. Evol uses this to play fast and loose with its ever-changing plot and character dynamics, and ultimately becomes one of the most entertaining mecha shows in the 2010’s. Some of the messy or under-explained pieces of Aquarion are still in Evol, but you’ll be having too much fun to notice them.Evol also is surprisingly progressive for a show with a main character that gets golden wing boners when aroused and a gender divided school that pilots orgasm robots. Aquarion Evol teaches that true love has no boundaries by time, gender, or ideology, as long as an effort to understand them is made. Everyone will hurt those around them, especially those they love. But while you should not simply accept wrongdoings, it also does not make the person a monster if they’re willing to keep trying. Evol moves well beyond fanservice and anime X-men piloting an orgasm robot, into a story about understanding, healing, self-love, and learning to enjoy life and change what you can. It's beautiful to watch, lovely to listen to, and shouldn't be judged simply on the fact it likes to have some silly, dirty fun once in a while.

It is also true that some rather particular themes are dealt with, not in an extreme way, but fortunately they will be solved.For the rest, it remains a very beautiful series to look at, where once again the feeling of love will be the winning card. Finally I do not recommend the vision of this anime for those like me who love Aquarion deeply, or at least don\'t start with the assumption that it can reach the levels of Aquarion.Although EVOL\'s graphics are far better, the story is decidedly commercial. 12,000 years have passed since the final battle against the angels of darkness, culminating then with the sacrifice of the Aquarion and its pilots, who remained inside to prevent the destruction of the planet, and this battle has become legendary among books, religious cults and even cinematographic films, with the foundation of the Sacred Angel Institute, dedicated to the legend of the Aquarion and frequented by young people endowed with Element powers. the previous series: a plot full of twists, where romantic feelings will be the basis of the story, with lots of links to the events that occurred in the first series; a strong characterization of the characters, each with their own characters and with episodes dedicated to them so as not to make them elements to make numbers, where friendships and deeper feelings are born for someone, and also the enemies of Altair show a strong humanity in the scenes to dedicated to them; and obviously fights in the name of surprise and absurdity, where the configurations of the Aquarions (here Evol, Gepard and Spada) will show ever more absurd and spectacular and effective powers according to the pilots (here too with the name of the attack first execution).In the graphic field, the series abandons the picture style of the previous one, in favor of a more realistic and colorful graphic, especially in the CGI scenes depicting the Aquarion and the various Altair mecha, thanks to the appearance of a guest from the past (there the surprise was enormous).Also in the field of sound, the quality of the previous one is repeated, with very orchestrated music, complete with insert songs and excellent opening and ending, but, if you miss those of the previous series, you can rest assured that you will be able to hear them.""Aquarion Evol"" manages to convey the same emotions as the previous series, of course, the beginning is not one of the nicest, but over time the atmosphere will be able to recover.

Directed by Kawamori Shouji, who is famous for making several Macross related shows but in all, his roster doesn’t look so good. Thus we have nothing much to expect on first sight.The first Aquarion series was based on an interesting concept that was trashed by the lack of an interesting plot and by lots of retarded fan service. It remained known as nothing more than a train-wreck called roborgasm for trying to sound serious and dramatic when it had over the top erotic humour and silly robot...action. So after some years they decided to make a sequel to it; something normally ludicrous for a title so loathed by most. The good part is that they flavoured the main idea to look more interesting. The bad part is that it’s still the same retarded presentation.The story takes place 12.000 years after the previous battle AGAIN and has the same cast AGAIN although in slightly different roles because they are reincarnations of the original characters. In this setting, the world is now revived and humanity is flourishing, so you are presented with much more than a wasteland. There is a whole city full of buildings, nicely detailed, colourful and definitely more bright and cheery than that gloomy dark world of the prequel. At the same time there still is a second dystopian world, so you are offered a nice antithesis as the two planets clash. The action scenes are also more complicating and have more interesting choreography than before. In all, there is a lot more for the eye to keep busy even when the plot is not going anywhere. And to the most part it doesn’t, at least not significantly.Speaking of the plot, it is not serious at all AGAIN as most things happen for the sake of comedy or really stupid internal logic. If you try to see this in a reasonable manner then you will be greatly disappointed, as it is just a patchwork of silly clichés from various mecha titles of the past. Individually none are that great to deserve their own show (especially when they already have one) but putting them all together in the same show leads to an interesting chemistry. Here is what I mean.1) Just like in the prequel, the main idea is present. We have people mentally bonding in order to fight in a mecha, which leads to a condition akin to orgasm (thus roborgasm). They also try to expand on the idea by including how using divine weapons through this union is very dangerous and thus they install special seals to prevent that. Those seals are called… chastity stones! Taking the whole ludicrous idea on the next level is rewarding on its own. They even make a villain to be the reincarnation the hero of the first series, thus making you think that something went wrong along the way and what was good back then, is now evil. Thus trying to reverse the roles is an easy way to hook you into a premise you already have experienced and would probably find boring.2) Since the union is considered unholy, boys and girls who pilot the robots are not allowed to be together, much less have relationships. So the school they are in has this huge wall to keep them apart called Berlin (just like than wall in Germany). This separation is a very interesting scenario generator to see how they will cope now that they need to cooperate (and boy do they seem like they are not getting any smexy love all their lives). I remember seeing something similar in the mecha show called Vandread, which was very good for its time. It fondles nicely with taboos by considering heterosexuality to be wrong, while homosexuality being granted as normal.3) The alien invaders of the show (humans from a different planet actually) kidnap people in order to harvest something out of them. This is also interesting as a concept and reminded me of Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross.4) The events of the previous show have been turned into a movie, which reminded me of Macross Frontier. It is also a nice opening to see how the characters try to find the truth out of the myth and later on you even see clip scenes from the first show. So they are trying to blend in the two series instead of considering them separate. They even flavour it further by revealing how some things were not as they told you in the first show.5) The villain being able to teleport or use escape pods after he loses? This is so kitsch, it fits like a glove in this show.6) Gender bending curse on top of a split personality that went amnesiac. Further details are unnecessary; you will be watching this for the sake of watching this.Of course all these good ideas can only help you to have positive first impressions. They still need to develop them if they intend to keep you interested and, guess what, everything is completely chaotic. You quickly find the same huge asspulls that ruined the first season by making everything possible if the scriptwriter felt like making it so. It ruins all sort of strategy, as well as the emotional conflicts if you can accomplice anything with some magic gizmo. I mean they have a huge selection of superpowers to use in each possible situation so nothing seems impossible to them. Thus although the premise is constant and attractive, it is never taken seriously. All issues the characters have are always resolved in the same episode they begin in. Heck, they even form teams of three, based on antithesis instead of uniformity. Then they are thrown to fight invading robots while still hating each other, with wise guy Fudo expecting them to solve all their problems in the most improbable moment: During a battle for the salvation of the world. And you know what, after awhile saving the world is less important than getting their silly teen issues resolved. Thus here is what you get in pretty much every episode:Enemy pilot: I will destroy this place because it has horny hot girls and my place doesn’t.Girl pilot: You only like me for my boobs.Boy pilot: That’s not true, I love your ass too.Nun general: Will you please cut that out and just fight the robot that is trying to destroy our world?Wise guy Fudo: (plays with cards, says some weird stuff about passion and life and shit).Girl pilot: Oh, I get it now.Boy pilot: Me too. Let’s teleport in the person we need, get into an orgasm, and beat the robot in a most improbable way.Enemy pilot: That’s not fair! They use any special attack they like and gang up on me!And despite their defeat once again, the evil Gaylord leader Mykage will play with some rose petals, say some weird stuff about love and duty and shit, and makes anything he likes to happen with hax powers, thus rendering the previous battle completely pointless.Just like before it was interesting at first before the lack of doing something with its premise and the retarded roborgasms full of asspulls made it too stupid to care about it after a few episodes.Although many viewers can claim that this is a super robot show and realism is the least you should be expecting, it still doesn’t work out in the longrun. Even guilty pleasure shows like this one need to have some sort of internal logic in order to work and this one in particular doesn’t even try. The proof of which are the motives of the villains for attacking the world of the good guys. After they reveal the reason, you will be scratching your head without the faintest idea of why this war happened in the first place. They could have just asked them for some humanitarian aid, or permission to relocate. We could assume they were denied all that, or they are too proud and prefer to fight than beg, or that their leaders are insane megalomaniacs, or whatever else generic villains do in fiction. The problem is, we don’t see any of all that; the villains act like normal people and thus you will feel like the whole war was not only pointless but could also have been avoided altogether. And sure, avoiding the war in a super robots show is the same as saying we won’t “have” a super robot show in the first place. But the excuses for it are just retarded.Going further than that, Fudo clearly knows everything about what has happened in the past and is even the leader of the whole robot organization, yet he doesn’t explain the enemy’s motivation up until the final episodes. It would make sense if he had enemies that would abuse the hidden information. But clearly nobody can stand against him so revealing the truth from the start could have helped his team in knowing for why the devil they are fighting for. But instead, you get this stupid plot where they are fending off the attacks and don’t even know why they do it but are otherwise too preoccupied with their unimportant sexual frustration. So what’s the point of telling them at all in the end if they don’t care? There is another scene where a heroine is possessed by an evil spirit and although she had full control of her body for several episodes didn’t even attempted to tell the others about it for no given reason. I mean sure, the show would feel a lot less mysterious if everything was clear right away but there was no reason to withhold information. It runs on mysteries that have no reason to be mysteries in the first place.And skip that, even the explanations that are offered towards the end make no sense. They are closer to trolling as the scriptwriter is constantly rewriting the events of the prequel every time he feels like it. It makes the story even dumber than it already is.But let’s try to see past all that. Pure dumb fun comes first and thus all the attention is given to over-the-top situations and extreme doses of action. The mecha battles are great, there are cool transformation sequences, energy beams that fill the screen and special attacks that have all sort of improbable results. Even the music themes are very good in uplifting emotion, despite being just silly j-pop nonsense. Plus we have characters who are all hormone-crazy teenagers who are never allowed to have some fun with the other gender, so imagine their sexual tension as they board the same ship and with their burning passion reach to a state of orgasm and rain havoc upon the poor aliens. Crazy stuff. Who cares if nothing makes sense in the plot?As long as you see it as nothing but guilty pleasure and don’t think about how pointless everything feels, chances are you will enjoy it. Even so, it may feel tiresome and stupid after awhile, as it still tries to be serious and dramatic even when it makes no sense, plus it lasts too much and has too many secondary characters that don’t seem to matter much in the longrun. In all it is quite weaker next to other similarly action packed titles, such as Tengen Toppa’s constant escalated action or Red Line’s short and tight duration. So although it tries a lot, in the end it is just random nonsense and it won’t appeal to an audience who prefers some elaborate plot and seriousness.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10General Artwork 2/2 (good looking)Character Figures 2/2 (generic but cool/sexy)Backgrounds 2/2 (wonderful)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (lots of pretty colours)SOUND SECTION: 8/10Voice Acting 2/3 (silly but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 4/4 (great)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 0/2 (loose and random)Complexity 2/2 (rich context)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 2/2 (funny/sexy)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (it’s there but it’s completely random)Catharsis 1/2 (cheesy)VALUE SECTION: 3/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (low because it gets too stupid after awhile)Memorability 2/4 (the roborgasms are a very memorable trait but other than that there ain’t much to remember it about)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 5/10Art 1/1 (looks great)Sound 1/2 (the dialogues are stupid but the music is great)Story 1/3 (nice ideas but presented too silly)Characters 2/4 (cool and sexy but eventually hollow)VERDICT: 6/10Funny and sexy but loses steam fast. action. So after some years they decided to make a sequel to it; something normally ludicrous for a title so loathed by most. The good part is that they flavoured the main idea to look more interesting. The bad part is that it’s still the same retarded presentation.The story takes place 12.000 years after the previous battle AGAIN and has the same cast AGAIN although in slightly different roles because they are reincarnations of the original characters. In this setting, the world is now revived and humanity is flourishing, so you are presented with much more than a wasteland. There is a whole city full of buildings, nicely detailed, colourful and definitely more bright and cheery than that gloomy dark world of the prequel. At the same time there still is a second dystopian world, so you are offered a nice antithesis as the two planets clash. The action scenes are also more complicating and have more interesting choreography than before. In all, there is a lot more for the eye to keep busy even when the plot is not going anywhere. And to the most part it doesn’t, at least not significantly.Speaking of the plot, it is not serious at all AGAIN as most things happen for the sake of comedy or really stupid internal logic. If you try to see this in a reasonable manner then you will be greatly disappointed, as it is just a patchwork of silly clichés from various mecha titles of the past. Individually none are that great to deserve their own show (especially when they already have one) but putting them all together in the same show leads to an interesting chemistry. Here is what I mean.1) Just like in the prequel, the main idea is present. We have people mentally bonding in order to fight in a mecha, which leads to a condition akin to orgasm (thus roborgasm). They also try to expand on the idea by including how using divine weapons through this union is very dangerous and thus they install special seals to prevent that. Those seals are called… chastity stones! Taking the whole ludicrous idea on the next level is rewarding on its own. They even make a villain to be the reincarnation the hero of the first series, thus making you think that something went wrong along the way and what was good back then, is now evil. Thus trying to reverse the roles is an easy way to hook you into a premise you already have experienced and would probably find boring.2) Since the union is considered unholy, boys and girls who pilot the robots are not allowed to be together, much less have relationships. So the school they are in has this huge wall to keep them apart called Berlin (just like than wall in Germany). This separation is a very interesting scenario generator to see how they will cope now that they need to cooperate (and boy do they seem like they are not getting any smexy love all their lives). I remember seeing something similar in the mecha show called Vandread, which was very good for its time. It fondles nicely with taboos by considering heterosexuality to be wrong, while homosexuality being granted as normal.3) The alien invaders of the show (humans from a different planet actually) kidnap people in order to harvest something out of them. This is also interesting as a concept and reminded me of Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross.4) The events of the previous show have been turned into a movie, which reminded me of Macross Frontier. It is also a nice opening to see how the characters try to find the truth out of the myth and later on you even see clip scenes from the first show. So they are trying to blend in the two series instead of considering them separate. They even flavour it further by revealing how some things were not as they told you in the first show.5) The villain being able to teleport or use escape pods after he loses? This is so kitsch, it fits like a glove in this show.6) Gender bending curse on top of a split personality that went amnesiac. Further details are unnecessary; you will be watching this for the sake of watching this.Of course all these good ideas can only help you to have positive first impressions. They still need to develop them if they intend to keep you interested and, guess what, everything is completely chaotic. You quickly find the same huge asspulls that ruined the first season by making everything possible if the scriptwriter felt like making it so. It ruins all sort of strategy, as well as the emotional conflicts if you can accomplice anything with some magic gizmo. I mean they have a huge selection of superpowers to use in each possible situation so nothing seems impossible to them. Thus although the premise is constant and attractive, it is never taken seriously. All issues the characters have are always resolved in the same episode they begin in. Heck, they even form teams of three, based on antithesis instead of uniformity. Then they are thrown to fight invading robots while still hating each other, with wise guy Fudo expecting them to solve all their problems in the most improbable moment: During a battle for the salvation of the world. And you know what, after awhile saving the world is less important than getting their silly teen issues resolved. Thus here is what you get in pretty much every episode:Enemy pilot: I will destroy this place because it has horny hot girls and my place doesn’t.Girl pilot: You only like me for my boobs.Boy pilot: That’s not true, I love your ass too.Nun general: Will you please cut that out and just fight the robot that is trying to destroy our world?Wise guy Fudo: (plays with cards, says some weird stuff about passion and life and shit).Girl pilot: Oh, I get it now.Boy pilot: Me too.

Viewed through this lens, the show is as meandering and at times frustrating to watch as its predecessor, but still a pretty decent show.Let\'s begin with the setting. Evol continues the ""12000 years"" mythos of its predecessor, only now series 1 is the myth. Most of our heroes\' adventures take place on the planet ""Vega"", with the adversaries coming from the planet ""Altair"" (at least in the Japanese version). This is significant in Japanese (and Chinese) culture, because these are the names of the stars in the...Tanabata story, the weaver girl (Vega) and the cowherd (Altair). So ""Star-crossed lovers"" is a good way to partly describe the three romantic subplots: the young lovers are torn apart across dimensions, circumstance, or the veil of death. The rest of the story (the young lovers can only meet on one day of the year) doesn\'t really factor in, unfortunately, but there are a number of elements that make use of the ""separation"" motif-- the big wall at the beginning of the series, for example.The art style (and character designs) are a bit more towards recognizable anime styles than series 1, which went for ""anime, but with more realistic shapes for facial features"". Like series 1, it\'s a combination of CG and drawn, but because of the ""cleaner"" art style in the designs, the characters and CG mechs mesh a little bit better. Honestly I prefer the mech designs of series 1, but Evol isn\'t bad, Aquarion Gephardt is based on one of the forms of the military Aquarion in series 1, while Spada and Evol are original designs.Characterization... Amata, the hero of the show is a bit of an ""unlikely hero"", or rather, an ""herbivore"" to use the Japanese term. Now, I can understand some people being rather annoyed or even upset with his lack of self-confidence, but y\'all are looking at a boy who was not only abandoned by his mother, but also ostracized by his peers because of his ability, and comes face to face with a girl he falls for at first sight. I defy you to find another teenaged boy with the same background and in the same situation who isn\'t a stammering mess. Personally, I was fine with Amata, as he started at a good place to climb up, he displayed courage when it counted, and that\'s the kind of journey I like to see.However, I think Mikono could\'ve been better written since she\'s the reincarnation of Silvia (spoiler, though honestly, that was very predictable, with the ""wings"" scene and all). I think there was just a bit too much effort trying to throw fans off the scent by writing Zessica as a strong love interest and Mikono as a damsel in distress, or to push a love triangle in the process, but the chemistry between Amata and Mikono was just too strong for it to go any other way. Mikono does have a journey, sort of, but it was pretty contrived.Unlike series 1 where the mythos and lore was revealed in dreams and ""echoes"", series 2 opted for ""story time with Sakura Kinomoto, I mean, Crea"" with a storybook motif (speaking of Sakura, I hadn\'t heard her voice for ages until Evol, and she was well written and directed, though some lines were cringeworthy). It was a creative take on ""telling"" the story rather than showing it, but it was still telling the story. I thought perhaps there could\'ve been a better way to show the story, but they were running short on episodes. During the story revelation, a bit of a retcon was introduced to the lore. It was based on a background ""character"" that was seen in both series 1 and the movies, so it\'s not like it was made out of whole cloth. Despite this, I thought the ""blurring"" of details like names (Apollo to Apollon, etc.) over the course of twelve thousand years was a cool way to show the passage of time.The soundtrack here reuses Yoko Kanno\'s magnificent soundtrack from series 1 and adds a few new tracks by Ayako Otsuka. The new tracks aren\'t bad, but they tend to be recorded from a synthesizer or a studio orchestra, whereas the series 1 tracks were performed by full symphony orchestra with choir. You can clearly hear the difference, though Otsuka went to great lengths to make sure the new tracks blended into the production. Yoko Kanno still composed the theme songs, and Akino\'s performances, this time with the rest of bless4, are glorious. The first ending theme, Moonlight Symphonia, is a beautiful duet, and introduced me to Akino\'s brother Aiki. The second ending theme features Yunoha\'s voice actress, Yui Ogura. I like her voice, but I feel that perhaps this was better marketed as a character song.The episode plots in the first part of the series somewhat follow a similar pattern as series 1, but with a bend to the ridiculous (bananas and doughnuts? really?). Again, story isn\'t Satelight\'s strong point (especially when Kawamori is involved), but the story of the concluding episodes is actually pretty good-- there\'s betrayal, there\'s conflict aplenty, there\'s bitter reunions, the drama building up to the climactic scenes is good viewing. The climax, well, the ""clash of David and Goliath"" has been a thing for centuries. The closing scenes of the climax are well-written and animated, the lines immediately after, however, are ridiculously cheesy.How does it compare to series 1? The story is a touch more on the ridiculous side, but it builds up well towards the end. I liked the characters in both, so that\'s a wash. Overall I think series 1 is a bit stronger because of the ""mythical"" and ""epic"" themes, but Evol is good watching as well. How about its sequel? Ah, well, I think Satelight should\'ve left well enough alone in Logos. Tanabata story, the weaver girl (Vega) and the cowherd (Altair).

Legendary battles that took place more than 12,000 years ago, separated lovers, futuristic world, high-school, vehicle pilots possessing supernatural abilities, giant robots powered by orgasms...Wait what? But alas, that\'s exactly what it is. First time you\'ll see it, you\'ll be like wtf; second time you\'ll see it you\'ll be face-desked and probably crying tears of laughter. That in a nutshell, is what Aquarion Evol is about. It\'s a bit of every genre (musics included)  and it manages to make them work together at that.Aquarion Evol is not meant to be taken too seriously though. It has unimaginable...amounts of cheesy-corny moments (take that orgasm-driven mechas for instance) and quite a bit of melodramatic high-school scenes, but it\'s all perfectly bearable if you\'d grin and laugh at it.

One futuristic world experiences systematic human abductions due to unknown entities called ""abductors"", and the students of futuristic academy being the mecha pilots they are have to fight this unknowable unknown. With time, the intentions of abductors become clear and our heroes will be faced with tough choices. Meanwhile the main hero, a freshly enrolled student of aquaria academy, discovers mysterious competitor for the love of his life which is revealed to be tied to a sinister prophecy and a legend. The story per se, is not bad. Apart from main protagonists the series explores a bunch of secondary characters and gives some insight into the events of previous series, so you won\'t be left in the dark. The issue with this kind of story is that any side-story episodes do feel like fillers and the series would have been better without few of them. Otherwise this anime loses some of its event-driven focus. Unfortunately, this lack of focus and coherence becomes even stronger towards the end of the series, some events prior the ending come off as baffling and illogical.Art.The art is gorgeous. You\'ll want to stare and stare at beautifully rendered backgrounds inspired by Shanghai and Venezia. The light and sfx are also quite on par. The anime boasts memorable character designs. Animation is smooth and lively, particularly during the battle scenes.Sound.The soundtrack is filled with loveable ambient music, consisting from instrumental pieces, most notably crisp and dreamy piano arrangements. It also has quite a few songs in it, Aquaria Mau Sora probably being most beautiful out of all. The OP has classical epic feel to it, and it basically carves itself in your memory.Characters.Overall characters are a likeable bunch. It\'s shame though that Aquarion Evol suffers same disease as most shounen anime: the protagonists are much less appealing than secondary characters. Hell, even antagonists look better against main duo. By main duo I mean Amata and Mikono by the way. Amata no thanks to his way too meek demeanour comes off as spineless, and Mikono pretty much embodies that I-am-useless-but-I-try-to-be-better girl stereotype. Naturally these two would engage in all sorts of silly melodrama, but hey something gotta sustain romantic suspense, no? Having said that, I very much prefer secondary characters including minor antagonists. They offer much more badassery and humor. In the end of the day, even villains of Aquarion Evol are not that villainous. Misunderstood, driven to despair, having no other choice, but not inherently evil evil.Overall.Pretty enjoyable anime spiced with cheesy moments and humor, with both action and mystery involved. Well, minus the fillerish melodrama. A little awkward considering it\'s both high-school AND mecha, but still watchable. Me, I personally loved the music most.

A beautiful balance of romance and action that could make it enjoyable for essentially anyone to watch. It is an absolute must see. I am the type of person who wouldn\'t cry at a goddamn funeral and I cried during specific moments in this, both tears of sadness and joy. It has many deeper meanings inside and can truly make you think differently. I was changed by this anime.PS - This was...my first review, I really do recommend this anime for all to watch. Its great once you can get past the super corny moments of the yelling ""GOOO AQUARIONNNNN!"" my first review, I really do recommend this anime for all to watch. Its great once you can get past the super corny moments of the yelling ""GOOO AQUARIONNNNN!""', '24,000 Years later the story of Aquarion comes full circle. This review will often elude to Sousei no Aquarion and at times compare the two. The aim of this practice is to show how the span of 7 years allowed the creators to expand on the foundation and improve greatly on Sousei no Aquarion’s flaws. As it is part of one gigantic story, I feel as though it futile to speak of Aquarion Evol as a standalone series.Aquarion Evol takes place 12,000 years after the events of Sousei no Aquarion. The world has changed a lot and no longer is there a struggle over Earth,...but a clash between the ""Abductors"" of the planet Altea (Altair in some translations) and the humans of planet Vega. Altea is a dying planet struggling for survival while Vega is a prosperous, Earth-like planet. As the conflict continues, the world hurdles toward disaster and history is set to repeat itself once more.Story:While Aquarion Evol still references the legendary battle of old between the Shadow Angels and humans (often referenced by an in-series film titled Skies of Aquaria), that conflict has been laid to rest. DEAVA has given way to a new organization named neo-DEAVA under new leadership while operating as an academy for young pilots, or Elements. Men and women are separated and there are two ""Aquaria,"" one for each gender, meaning merging is strictly unisex. The Aquaria are similar to the Aquarion of old as it is also a three form, three component mecha composed of Vectors. During the first encounter with the “Abductors,” Sora Amata and Mikono Suzushiro, two civilian teenagers who both claim to have no special talents, take control of a Vector and form AQUARION with students of neo-DEAVA, much to neo-DEAVA’s surprise and dismay.Unlike Sousei no Aquarion, the story in Evol progresses much cleaner and each episode builds on the episode prior. Additionally, the plot does not seem to disappear compared to its predecessor. An explanation may be due to the fact that the plot is only slowly revealed episode by episode, not totally laid out for you as Sousei no Aquarion had. Additionally, gone is the formula Sousei no Aquarion used to mold their episodes that revolved around some special training that were just simple team-building exercises that added nothing to the plot. While there are some training aspects in Evol, they do not consume the entire episode. What may be the biggest departure from Sousei no Aquarion is that it also is no longer predictable in that not every episode leads up to some grand merging of Aquarion to combat an enemy. In Evol, characters also rely on hand-to-hand combat in some instances, while other instances show the characters in their daily lives outside of neo-DEAVA. Ultimately, what makes Evol’s story so compelling is that it keeps you guessing. If you had watched Sousei no Aquarion, you often wonder when what you already know about the story comes into play. It makes going from episode to episode much more enjoyable than watching meaningless battle after meaningless battle waiting for the plot to return. However, Aquarion Evol does tend to fall into the same corny traps as Sousei no Aquarion—mostly from attack names—and also does get a little too “cute.”Art:What a difference 7 years makes. The animation is much more vibrant and consistent. The clipping and quality issues that led to unflattering appearances are no longer there. The animation is very crisp with a wider array of colors. I recommend watching Aquarion Evol in HD to fully appreciate how beautiful this series is drawn. The scenery, the cities, the character designs, everything is leaps and bounds beyond what was presented in Sousei no Aquarion. The CGI is on par with what was presented in Sousei no Aquarion and the fight and merge scenes are very good. One welcome change is the introduction of Aquarion Gepard which features projectile weapons, signs of evolution and adaptation to the changing world. The character designs are a little more “fan-servicy” as most all the females have enormous breasts and some wear highly revealing clothing.Sound:Much like its predecessor, Aquarion Evol earns high marks for music. Akino returns with two very loud, vigorous, and exciting tracks for both its openings. The endings are dialed back into somber ballads; the second performed by voice-cast member, Yui Ogura. As you learn more of her character, Yunoha, it becomes a very touching track. Many OSTs from Sousei no Aquarion return, namely Genesis of Aquarion. The consistency of OSTs and opening artist is much appreciated and lends to the idea that it is indeed one big story spanning many generations. There is a heavy reliance on the track “Aquaria Mau Sora” which appears in the in-series film, Skies of Aquaria. The voice cast in Aquarion Evol is stacked with tremendous talent and is executed brilliantly. Aquarion Evol also scales back the orgasmic moans and grunts that were far too prevalent in Sousei no Aquarion. While merging still seems intense and full of bliss and passion, it no longer seems to equate to sex, though it still is inferred by character interaction.Character:In my opinion, this is where the biggest upgrade Aquarion Evol has over its predecessor. Where Sousei no Aquarion had no overly spectacular characters where they all seemed somewhat annoying, Aquarion Evol has more characters, and most of them are thoroughly appealing and likable. There are two areas of character that Aquarion Evol far outdoes its predecessor. First, the characters receive a lot of development throughout the series apart from their own character-centric episodes. This makes characters a lot more likable as you see their development episode by episode. This makes the characters highly relatable and sympathetic. Second, the formation of character relationships is far more prevalent in Aquarion Evol than Sousei no Aquarion. Sousei no Aquarion focused much on the relationship between Apollonius and Celiane. While other characters often intimate at love, nothing ever develops. In Aquarion Evol, deep friendships are forged, romance is found, loss is experienced, and heartbreak appears. This also leads to characters being relatable and sympathetic. Aquarion Evol also has a clear evil that needs to be defeated.I highly recommend that Sousei no Aquarion be watched before watching this series, though it not be entirely necessary. However, it alludes to the story quite frequently and may seem confusing to those who are unfamiliar with the events of Sousei no Aquarion. While Sousei no Aquarion seems, at times, boring, Aquarion Evol takes the story to a whole new level. For 7 years, the creators were sitting on this thrilling conclusion to a highly captivating story. In watching the story in whole, the plot twists are much more twisted and you may even start to question what you truly even know. As a standalone series, it still is very strong. It carries its own rendition of the legend that sets it apart from Sousei no Aquarion (even though both renditions come into one plot-line in the latter part of the series). A story of love and betrayal, a story of vengeance, a story of survival, a story that spans 24,000 years, Aquarion Evol is a must see. but a clash between the ""Abductors"" of the planet Altea (Altair in some translations) and the humans of planet Vega.

Don't get me wrong, there were some things about it that bugged me (the orgasmic power-up ended up making me laugh by the end of the series), but overall I thought it was actually a pretty unique storyline.Like any lover of an original, I was scared when I heard they were doing a sequel, because, as a in general, sequels have usually sucked.  I know, huge over-generalization, but it felt like that to me.  I will admit, sequels do seem to be getting better and better, so if...this trend keeps up, I'll be willing to change my opinion.  I hope I get to.I'm not very far into the series yet, so this will of course need to be changed when I finish the series, or even get more into it, but I wanted to start with how much I'm actually excited to watch it.  I thought I was going to hate it, but I was completely wrong.The visuals of this anime have blown me away, absolutely breath-taking, and the characters are unique and have depth.  I'm confused by some of them, but I know it'll all make sense in the end.  I won't give spoilers away (darn!), but I'm excited to see how the characters will end up relating to their counter-parts in the original series, and for some of them, how they will relate to the characters from 24,000 years ago.For now, I'll just have to watch and see.

How do I put this?Whilst looking like a really enjoyable show from the outside, soon reveals to be so mediocre and clichée in every way, that its simply gross. You cannot say this is a good show and be serious.Story:The Story revolves around a society after the great catastrophy 12000 years before, that uses the magical powers of certain people (elementalpowers) to power something called ""Aquaria""s. Except for our maincharacter, that - obviousely, why tf now - somehow summons ""AquariON"". This is supposedly a hidden, secretive aquaria evolution - hence the name. But somehow half of the cast knows about it...anyways. Good job.Fights? Stunning on first glance, yet so predictable, clichée and cringe you can\'t really take them serious. Latest when they break their own rules of their own internal storytelling and pull stuff like ""bowing in the middle of a fight to tell someone you love them"" (which in all seriousness looks just so ridiculous, especially when they show that supposedly epic logo thingy for it that you know from every 90\'s japanese show like powerrangers, where they name their special ultimative forms), despite knowing them for like 2 days time total (yes, they were seperated).Feels like a mess already right?

Gicing this anime a 9 overall I generally liked it. However, there are a great meany things that I really disliked about the show.The story overall was good, very complex and detailed. However, some details within the story killed me! I couldn't stand some of the ways things happened and the ending. If you turn out to be a MikonoXKagura fan, this ending is not for you. Also many of Fudo's 'special training' episodes were not...very good either when it came to the story. BUT! out of the entire thing I would say that it was generally a good concept but in some ways it was just too hard to belive.The art in this anime however to me was spectacular! I loved how each character was detailed, unqie, and had amazing coloring. No matter if you pause or are in the middle of a fight scene the detail is amazing and you can really see how much time and effort was put into Aquarion EVOL. The landscapes were also another part of my enjoyment in this anime. I am a relatively picky person when it comes to anime art and I gave this section a 10. Then again, it is very similar to the art in Code Geass. Oh well! I loved it! :)Falling in love with the music was also another great thing for me and I would assume many others. The first OP and ending songs were fantastic to me, Sharades music was wonderful as well along with SOME of the battle music. Later on though I think there was more focus on wrapping up the storyline than attention to the music and sounds of the show. I gave this section a ten though because they included a lot of detail with the sounds. The never forgot to add in the sound of the weights in Amata's boots, ect. ect.DUN DUN DUN! Characters! Every single god dang one of them was amazing! Each had their own unique style and personality, some of them really fit together and made things more believeable. I wish I could cosplay many of these characters for their outfits alone. The only thing that bugged me was the ending with Kagura. He went very OOC in my opinion. But! I will leave those details out, you will have to see for yourself why.I throughly enjoyed this series even though I felt Kagura never got a chance to even whoo Mikono, that a lot of the battle scenes were relatively cheezy (so cheezy it made me laugh and actually enjoy them), and that the ending could have been better. That said this review explains the good and bads of the anime in my opinion as a now Kagura fangirl, and as someone who is picky with the artwork and musics in an anime. very good either when it came to the story. BUT! out of the entire thing I would say that it was generally a good concept but in some ways it was just too hard to belive.The art in this anime however to me was spectacular!

LOL!!!*ahem* The first half of this story was great but the second half, I'd have to say was AWESOME! There was more drama, more conflict, fewer annoying characters, and the art was WAY better. The colors really came out better than in Sousei no Aquarion. The music, like the other one, was a must get and there were a few I could play all day just because they're THAT GOOD. And the characters, though most were semi-1Dimensional and only one really annoyed me (sadly it was the heroine; she kept getting childishly jealous...over misunderstandings with one guy after making NO effort to take him for herself), were fun to watch.The story starded with a love triangle 24,000 years ago between two male angels and one female human (angel 2 likes angel 1 but angel 1 gave up his wings for the girl, it hurt angel 2 badly) 12,000 years later (Sousei no Aquarion) they reincarnate and the same story repeats. angel 1 reincarnates as a human and falls for the girl again leaving angel 2 lonely. In the end, to save the world, the angels' souls come together again and angel 1 prmoses to meet the girl again in another few thousand years.BUT, 12,000 more years later (Aquarion EVOL; takes place on earth when another planet is abduction their women and they have to fight again) angel 2 realized during the soul merge 12,000 years ago that he was trick and now he's back for revenge on the new reincarnations. I won't DARE spoil anything for you but the Plot twist are wonderful and this I will say, the bad guy is pulling ALL the strings and this story is ENTIRELY in his hands.This is worth a see and the best part is you don't have to see Sousei no Aquarion first (though I highly recommend it) to understand what's going on, they give you full backstory (even more than the first actually).

I watched the first episode before I watched the first season and then I realised it was a sequel, so I watched the first season first. I totally loved that one, so I really hoped this would be as good as the first season, but it wasn\'t quite what I expected it to be. However, it wasn\'t bad though.In the beginning I didn\'t really get it, the story was different and I had no idea what would happen in this season. That was kind of fun though, because everything would be a surprise.Let me start with...the story...Like I said.. in the beginning I didn\'t really get it. It was different and I didn\'t know if I really liked it or not. But lucky for me it became more and more interesting. I was hoping that it would be as good as the first season, and it seemed like it would. But then the whole story changed in the last episodes, and of course everything became more clear, but I totally disliked it. I wished I hadn\'t seen it, because it changed my opinion about the whole story( both season one and two). I still liked the story, but it was a complete twist of the story as we knew it in the first season. I totally regretted watching it at first, but later I was happy with it, because it was a good story anyways. Because of my extreme love for Sousei no Aquarion it was almost impossible to rate this anime low, but I actually considered it for a moment because of the huge story twist. But after calming down a little I knew that this story was good in it\'s own way. I just didn\'t want to see Sousei no Aquarion and Aquarion Evol als one anime, with the same story.Apart from the story twist in the end, I really liked a lot of things in de anime. There were a few sad parts, and parts where you could laugh or were you would just feel really happy. It was a kind of emotional anime for me and I really enjoyed it though.As for the fights...they weren\'t really much in my opinion. I don\'t really like fights to start with, but there wasn\'t that much action. I really didn\'t watch it for the fights, because if I would .. I guess I would be really disappointed in this anime.The art was beautiful, I really liked the colors and actually at first I started to watch this series because of it. ( But in the end the story of the first season just really grew to me and I totally loved it for the story.)The sounds were okay. I don\'t really have anything to say about it. There were just a few characters which voice I didn\'t like, but that doesn\'t really matter though, because it didn\'t ruin the anime or anything.As for the characters.. some of them were really weird and I didn\'t like every one of them, but there were a few characters that I totally loved( A few characters were weird in a good way, you don\'t see them in every anime, but a few of them were just stereotyped anime characters in my eyes). I was wondering the whole anime long ""maybe that character is a reincarnation of that character"" and stuff, and I found that kind of funny and interesting. But it doesn\'t really matter that I didn\'t like all the characters, because it would be really hard to let the viewer like every single character in the anime wouldn\'t it?I did enjoy the anime, but it wasn\'t what I expected. It\'s still really a shame that they came up with such a twisted story in the end, so that screwed up the story for me and I enjoyed it less because of it, but I did enjoy the rest of the story. But in my eyes it just wasn\'t as good as the first season, not even close actually. But I love the aquarion series, so I gave it a 9 anyways.I would recommend you to actually watch the first season first. I know a lot don\'t do that, but you will understand a lot more if you watched the first season first.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R: Make Up! Sailor Senshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2937/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_R__Make_Up_Sailor_Senshi,"['I did not see a review for this so I decided to write one.Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R: Make Up! Sailor Senshi is a Sailor Moon special that probably showed right before Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R: The Movie. For some reason MyAnimeList thought it would cute to explain everything that happens in the synopsis. So if you haven\'t read it yet don\'t it\'s major spoiler. Also this special and review is for people that have watched the original series and R. If you have yet to watch those go watch them and come back. This special is only 17 minutes so don\'t expect a...long winded review.I was surprised to see such an iconic series as Sailor Moon to have something unreviewed. Somehow this little special seems to have gotten pushed into obscurity. I love Sailor Moon and rated the previous two seasons a 10/10 so I was excited to see I would be able to review something of it (I only review the unreviewed). But sadly this special was lacking and rather boring.The single episode consists of various scenes from the anime with some new ones mixed. This feels more like a recap than anything and I hate recaps. The special has two girls talking about the Sailor Senshi while Usagi listens. While they talk about the characters it shows some scenes from the previous seasons. The girls pretty much just explain the personalities of the characters and by this point you should definitely know how each character is. This was really boring and I was constantly thinking ""when will this be over?"" The new scenes mixed in are not exceptionally entertaining as well. I gave the art a 6/10. I like the Sailor Moon style and 90s vibe but it\'s still like 80% scenes I\'ve seen before. I usually dislike rewatching stuff and it pissed me off. I gave sound a 6/10 too. As the girls talk about Sailor Moon and Co. the character\'s image songs play. I didn\'t really pay attention to them but they weren\'t that exciting. The whole thing is mediocre.Sadly I do not really have anything good to say. I watched this because it was a quick add, Sailor Moon, and I could review it. I only recommend this if you are currently experiencing amnesia and don\'t remember how the characters act. Or if you for some reason enjoy recaps that don\'t really recap anything.Enjoyment, story, and overall is a 4/10. long winded review.I was surprised to see such an iconic series as Sailor Moon to have something unreviewed.

If you just want it for your completed list go ahead, otherwise I wouldn\'t recommend it.The story tells you about the main characters and little bit of their history while Usagi is remembering how she met other Sailor girls for the first time. Including little mocking towards Usagi because of how basic she is.The cliche ""friendship is magic"" thing. I guess it would be good catch up for those who want to remember how it all started before watching the movies. For example. ']"
Chicchana Yukitsukai Sugar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/831/Chicchana_Yukitsukai_Sugar,"['Have you ever wondered why the snow falls, the wind blows, and the clouds fill the sky?  A Little Snow Fairy Sugar shows us that everything is controlled by musical little fairies!  Weather has never been so adorable!A Little Snow Fairy Sugar revolves around an eleven year old girl Saga and the little fairy apprentice Sugar that only she can see.  Sugar has been sent to earth to complete her training and become a full fledged snow fairy.  But to do this she must find something called a ""Twinkle"" which will make her magic flower bloom and signify she is a...fully fledged fairy.  Saga is a serious girl who plans out everything meticulously and lives a very ordered life.  When Sugar comes into her life she turns it all completely upside-down.The story mostly has a slice of life feel to its pacing.  The episodes deal with everyday issues and are mostly lighthearted and funny.  At times though some of the messages portrayed can be pretty powerful and deep.  Sugar and her other fairy friends who show up are all mostly extremely naive as to the way the human world works, which makes for the source of most of the shows humor.  Even though everything in the storyline plays out predictably, it was still an enjoyable experience.Any series in which the plot is mainly slice of life requires great characters to be successful and that’s certainly the case with this anime.  The cast gets quite large; however the series does a nice job in sticking with the characters that are the most important.  At the top of this is of course Saga and Sugar.  When the story begins they are basically complete opposites.  Saga is serious and mature while Sugar is reckless and naive.  It’s impossible not to fall instantly in love with either of them.  Their relationship is rocky at times do to their personality differences but they both learn from each other and become more complete because of it.The supporting cast is one of the best I have seen in a series before.  Particularly notable is Sugar\'s fellow fairy apprentices Salt and Pepper.  Pepper in particular was so adorable that I wanted to reach into my television and pull her out and cuddle with her.  Viewers will probably also enjoy the antics of Saga\'s classmate Greta, who is herself proclaimed rival.Artistically the series is quite good.  The character designs for Sugar and her friends are really adorable.  The settings feel very early 19th century Bavaria.  The fashions the characters wear don\'t really support that and it just seems like a place lost in time.The music is very important to the story and is performed beautifully.  Since all the fairy\'s weather magic is performed using an instrument, there is a wide variety of sounds.  The classical music score meshes perfectly with the stories laid back approach.  Additionally the series\' OP and ED themes match the shows cuteness to a tee.  I also enjoyed the seiyuu performances and it was nice to hear the voices of some actors you don’t normally hear in the roles of main characters.  Unfortunately I also heard some of the English dub too, which is typically bad and I recommend you stay clear of it.I really enjoyed my experience with A Little Snow Fairy Sugar.  It\'s a bit of a unique take on the fairy genre and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys slice of life.  Be careful to brush your teeth afterwards though as the cuteness and sugary sweetness will likely rot your teeth out. fully fledged fairy.

Tiny Snow Fairy Sugar is just too cute for words. And yet, despite it's adorable factor, I can honestly say this anime made me cry at the end.Basically, to sum it up, the story is of a young, punctual, planning girl named Saga who, much to her dismay, happens to encounter upon a small fairy known as a &quot;season fairy&quot; (and it's not so long afterward until she meets others). The first little season fairy is named Sugar, and apprentice to become a great snow fairy. Now, you can't say Saga is the most...happy to find Sugar. Actually, she's anything but. She doesn't want anything to do with these crazy &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; she's stumbled on-- they're absolutely ruining her plans!But soon enough, Sugar beings to live with Saga after the magic seed was planted in Saga's mini toy piano in her room. Now Saga has to deal with Sugar as she tries to find the mysterious &quot;twinkles&quot; to become a full-fledged season fairy! What's a girl to do?Okay, so maybe the story isn't amazing, but it's wonderfully adorable, and I love the interactions between all the characters. Some parts of the stories have a few flaws, but never enough to distract the viewer.One thing I adore about Tiny Snow Fairy Sugar is it's beautiful backgrounds. That's the thing, it doesn't take place in Japan; it takes place in Germany, which I find refreshingly different and appealing to watch. The backgrounds are gorgeous watercolors. Also, the character designs are by Koge-Donbo (author of Pita-Ten and Kamichama Karin) which makes the expressions extra adorable, especially with Sugar and the other faires.The opening song is very catchy and chipper, contrasting with the more sweet and melancholy sounding ending theme. The music in the background is low-key, consisting of mostly piano and string instruments.Saga and Sugar's personalities clash which makes their interaction all the more interesting. Saga is orderly and mature and Sugar is spontaneous and energetic. I'd have like to see Ann and Norma more developed, as well as other characters, but Greta makes up for that, as she is a nicely developed minor character. Greta constantly wants to be Saga's rival, although as you see as the series progresses, she actually just wants to be friends with Saga (though she'd never admit it).Not all would enjoy Tiny Snow Fairy Sugar. Many might be put off by the title alone. However, despite the sugar-coated exterior it is actually a sweeter, more-heatfelt anime that will make you relate to its characters and have you enjoy each episode's antics. happy to find Sugar.

The fairies Sugar, Salt and Pepper are so cute, but not in the annoying way. Choro-sama, the elder fairy, will also make you laugh with his silly antics over his obsession with Ginger - a fairy obviously so much younger than him! Basil and Cinammon are also characters who, despite their bratty and rascal ways, will worm their way into your hearts.And if you watched Card Captor Sakura, you just might...be in for a surprise. The artwork is so similar but the Tomoyo-looking character is the frenemy (friend/enemy) of one of the lead characters - Saga (patterned after Sakura). I found this to be very funny - seeing a totally different Tomoyo. My only complaint about the artwork is that the characters probably wore the same outfit all throughout the series, in stark contrast to Card Captor Sakura\\'s numerous costume changes.The story is simple, but still quite complex. It won\\'t let you look that hard for questions about your life, but it will make you wonder if you found your own Kirameki - whatever that is. be in for a surprise.

If a show has weak or inappropriate atmosphere, it can potentially tarnish any chance of having emotional resonance with the audience, even if the script and acting are great. There are some anime fans that have a hard time enjoying a lot of horror anime for this very reason, because some of the scenes that were meant to be scary can come off as comedic instead if done poorly.Then you have those rare shows which have a certain aura to them. Maybe the characters are a bit corny and the plot isn’t...very engaging, but despite that, they still manage to pull some emotion out of you.A Little Snow Fairy Sugar is exactly that type of show. What it lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for it with sincerity.The first thing that immediately struck me about Snow Fairy was its soundtrack. It’s easily the highlight of the entire show and largely consists of lovely and nostalgic-sounding piano pieces which play throughout the episodes. Sometimes the show will just sort of stop for a moment and let a character play an instrument for a bit. It can be quite bizarre and jarring at times, but endlessly charming nonetheless.And that’s really how I would best describe the show as a whole. It’s very charming and endearing. With character designs from Koge-Donbo of Di Gi Charat fame, it is unmistakably “of its time” in the best ways possible. The legendary Shichirou Kobayashi is also on the team and he does a fantastic job bringing this world to life with his beautiful backgrounds. Overall, the show is a treat to look at and listen to.However, while the artwork and music are both incredible, the characters and writing can leave a lot to be desired. The plot itself is rather unremarkable and the dynamics are all over the place. Saga and Sugar's friendship do have their wholesome and heartwarming moments together, but a decent chunk of the series is spent with Sugar getting in the way of Saga's everyday life and they end up fighting quite a bit which can take away some of the emotional weight those wholesome scenes could've had because the character progression is very inconsistent. If you’re the type of viewer who prefers getting super critical with what they watch, then maybe stay away, because Snow Fairy doesn’t exactly try too hard to be too deep with its themes and you'll probably end up getting bored and thinking it's stupid.But at the end of the day, Snow Fairy exemplifies a lot of the qualities I love about this time period in anime history. A lot of the industry started converting over to computers and it gave more people the chance to create niche anime that may not have been approved or fully realized before. And while a lot of series from this era can often be rather weird or clumsy, you can often feel that raw passion shine through. Snow Fairy may be far from perfect, but I also don't think I'd want it any other way. very engaging, but despite that, they still manage to pull some emotion out of you.A Little Snow Fairy Sugar is exactly that type of show. What it lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for it with sincerity.The first thing that immediately struck me about Snow Fairy was its soundtrack. It’s easily the highlight of the entire show and largely consists of lovely and nostalgic-sounding piano pieces which play throughout the episodes. Sometimes the show will just sort of stop for a moment and let a character play an instrument for a bit. It can be quite bizarre and jarring at times, but endlessly charming nonetheless.And that’s really how I would best describe the show as a whole. It’s very charming and endearing. With character designs from Koge-Donbo of Di Gi Charat fame, it is unmistakably “of its time” in the best ways possible.

In fact, the anime itself delivers message that is unique for each viewer. Do not let its prominent shroud of childish folly trick you into thinking it is another anime for children for it is entirely in reverse. However, the kiddies are still more than welcome to watch it with you as this anime rarely has any adult contemporary in it.What holds this anime up to very high standards is that, not only did it deliver a very overwhelmingly-good storyline, but all of this was entirely original and not based off a manga which destroys...any complaints against whether or not it ""stayed true"" to such a thing as it is non-existent here for this original anime possesses a very strong and innovative story.If the characters are too cheesy for you to tolerate, then perhaps the beautiful piano symphony will make up for that. With the budget that they had for it, the music comes off as no surprise that it is excellently composed and each song in the anime conveys a different style where nothing falls under repetition; a quality that is very rare to find in an OST of an anime.The production value of this anime is so high that it feels like you are watching something in the late-thousands despite it existing around the early-thousands. The animation, voice acting and music all feel like they are half-a-decade or more ahead of their time. So if one of your peeves with thousands anime is its quality not being too good, think again with this one.What you get here is a story that is unforgettable, WILL make you tear up towards the end and will all be done in resplendent classical piano throughout the whole ordeal. Well normally it would come off as tedious if all you hear is piano, the songs you will listen to are all unique.

They have a slow, easy going and reminiscent feeling to it. And nearly 20 years ago, in the breezy fall of 2001, J.C. Staff graced us with one of the cutest and heart-warming anime ever created: A Little Snow Fairy Sugar. A truly precious hidden gem of the distant past.Set in the peaceful and antique fictional town of Muhlenberg - Germany, A Little Snow Fairy Sugars tells the tale about the everyday life of Little Sugar and Saga.  A bitttersweet and heart-wrenching story full of laughters and tears.How can anyone be as adorable as...our lovely Sugar-chan? She\'s an apprentice snow fairy that only Saga can see. To become a talented fairy like her mother, Sugar and her friends must go on an important training. To find the ""twinkle"" and let the magical flowers bloom. That sets the tone for the lovely slice of life adventure of Sugar and Saga. Watching them reminds me of the good times that I never had.The pacing of the show is very appropriate. It\'s slow enough for us to learn about the characters better while also provided interesting story in each and every episodes to steadily progress the plot. By the half-way of the show, you can clearly see the development of Sugar and Saga and that\'s a rare thing to see even by today standards. Seem like the art of storytelling is lost overtime.The main appeal of the anime must be Little Sugar and her lovely friends, Salt and Pepper. Let me tell you this, Sugar is the type of character that you\'ll fall in love at the first sight of her. She\'s naive, adorable, kinda annoying yet so caring. She made my list of top 10 character right when I see her. That says a lot since that list hasn\'t changed for hundreds of anime now.And Saga, she\'s the one who brings the depth and drama to the show. Lost her mother who\'s a great pianist at a very young age, the tragic has a bad effect on her mental health. a purposeful and kind girl to everyone around. But when ever something reminds her of her mother in a bad way, she will get depressed quickly. Luckily, God gave her Sugar to befriend with. And in a way, Sugar is fortunate to meet her. There they formed an everlasting friendship.I must give my praising to Tsuruoka Youta, the sound director of A Little Snow Fairy Sugar, famous with works in Elf- A tale of Memories; Clannad; Hibike: Euphonium, Fulmetal Panic! and so much more... I cant even imaginine this show without his magical hand in choosing music and voice actors. The op: ""Sugar Baby Love"" is one of my most favorite anime song, the osts are amazing and bring deep emotions in every scenes. Even though, they\'re kinda repetitive. I reckon he did an almost perfect job in this anime. Set in the town with European\'s design, every backgrounds are beautifully drawn, really created the feeling of the town.Overall, I know my silly, homely and unrefined words can\'t do the show justice. But I really love A Little Snow Fairy Sugar. I wanna spread the love cause it needs more. If somehow and in some magical way I can persuade you to watch this show, I\'ll be very happy. our lovely Sugar-chan? She\'s an apprentice snow fairy that only Saga can see.

It's something people of all ages  can get into."", 'The story is based around 11-year-old Saga Bergmann, a young girl in a small German town who lives with her grandmother Regina and works in a coffee shop when not in school. Saga is extremely structured and plans her life down to the minute. One day, she notices a tiny creature in a fluffy outfit that appears to be starving. She offers it a waffle, which helps revive the tiny creature. Saga learns that this tiny creature is Sugar, an apprentice season fairy. Sugar explains that season fairies alter the weather by playing a magical musical instrument, and her specialty is snow, which she creates...by playing the piccolo. Sugar is joined by two more apprentice season fairies, Salt, an outgoing male fairy who plays the trumpet to make the sun shine more brightly, and Pepper, a quiet and caring female fairy who plays the harp to make the wind blow.All three apprentices are shocked at the realization that Saga can see them, since humans are not supposed to be able to see season fairies. Pepper speculates that exceptional humans might be able to see them, which is the best possible explanation. Sugar tells Saga that the three have been sent to Earth to train as full-fledged season fairies, and to do that, they must find \'Twinkles\'.Sugar moves into Saga\'s bedroom and sets up residence, much to the consternation of the super-structured Saga. Saga is a well-meaning, intelligent and highly-organised girl who feels compelled to look after the childish, loud and irresponsible Sugar, who is incapable of looking after herself. The story is complicated further with the arrival of three adult season fairies—Turmeric, a cloud fairy; Ginger, a rain fairy; and the Elder, the leader of the season fairies—and two more apprentices—Basil, a thunder fairy, and Cinnamon, an ice fairy.With the highly disruptive presence of Sugar, Saga\'s life goes haywire. Her friends Norma and Anne think that she is losing her mind, and her teacher, Miss Hanna, is worried that her best student is acting strangely. Not at all concerned with her strange behavior is Greta, an egotistical rich girl who considers Saga to be her rival, and Phil, a goofy inventor who keeps trying to persuade Saga to help him with his experiments, if he is not already busy building and trying out his latest device.ABOUT ALL CHARACTERS..Saga Bergman is the series protagonist. Her mother died in an accident, so she lives with her grandmother. Saga is somewhat obsessed with planning, scheduling her day nearly to the minute and is frustrated when her plans go off schedule.

It has a whimsical story and atmosphere as though this was an old German fairy tail. Sadly, a lot of things that the characters act feels like Japan more then Germany.Saga feels way too grown up and actually talks back to the older people. She always makes plains to do things at a special time period even going down to the second. She’s mostly a know it all who believes every needs a plan for everything. She says no to anyone who tries to give her something for free and strives to be...the very best at things. Even though she does this, when she first sees Sugar, she doesn’t think its odd.Sugar is really cute even though I would be annoyed too if someone would keep kissing me like how she does that. It’s interesting that Sugar and Saga look almost exactly alike, which brings the idea that Sugar is Saga’s childhood. If you want to get into the idea of this show showing not to grow up to fast, Sugar is like her child self asking her to stop being so grown up and to act like a kid again.The animation is really bright and childish like a story book. It works well and brings the feeling of old Germany to light. Strangely, it feels like Belgium instead of Germany with all the waffles that are in it.The voices are somewhat alright but Saga’s English voice is somewhat annoying. Its way to cutesy for a girl of her age. She sounds like Sakura from Card Captor Sakura. Greta feels really snobby. All in all, the English voices are not really the best and in this case, I would go more for the Japanese version. The music adds to the whimsical feel and is never to overpowering for the scenes. You can tell sometimes which fairy is around because the music changes a bit. the very best at things.

It also has a story, even though it\'s simple, it works really well and may even bring out some feels. In the world of Snow Fairy Sugar, Fairies are the reason for seasons (weather too) occurring. The clouds, the wind, the warm sun, the snow, the rain... they\'re all handled by fairies.Snow Fairy Sugar is about two girls, a human girl named Saga and...the Snow Fairy, Sugar. They\'re the two main characters of the show and being the mains, there is a lot of focus on them. Saga is a perfectionist, heck she\'s more than that, she\'s a super perfectionist having her entire life scheduled out to the minute. Her schedule and plans are interrupted one day when she sees Sugar lying on a box, starving for food. The start of a beautiful friendship happens at this very moment.Sugar, the Snow Fairy, is quite the hectic little girl. Being an apprentice, Sugar and her two friends are in search for ""twinkles"" that can only be found in the human world. Once ""twinkles"" are found, they\'ll become full-fledged fairies, how neat!There are two main supports for each girl in Snow Fairy Sugar. Salt the sun fairy and Pepper the wind fairy who support Sugar and each other in the search for ""twinkles"". They\'re all very cute and have differing personalities, Pepper is refined, Salt is a little brash and Sugar is quite eccentric.With Saga we have Norma and Anne, her best friends that help her when she\'s in trouble.The art style used in Little Snow Fairy Sugar is really really cute. The colors are light and vibrant, but not pastel or eye popping, slightly subdued from that nature. The characters are drawn in a simple manner, never over drawing more detail than absolutely necessary. The backgrounds are beautiful water paint-like drawings. Animation involved is also simple, but everything is smooth and there doesn\'t seem to be any issues involved at all.Sound.... This is one of the best things about Snow Fairy Sugar, the music involved.... all of the BGM is orchestral based. Beautiful and harmonious strings accompanied by a soft and touching piano. Saga\'s mothers song on the piano serves as the basis for most songs that you will hear. All the fairies songs are based on it and the song will appear often as BGM; this is pretty fantastic because the simple melody is really sweet and for 24 episodes, I never got tired listening to it.Story.... Although the story is really simple, it\'s a very endearing and touching story about friendship and the creation of ""twinkle"". It won\'t take long for the viewers to figure out what a ""twinkle"" is in Snow Fairy Sugar, but don\'t let that deter you from watching. The way that Saga and Sugar\'s friendship is tested and trailed upon every corner due to small problems is really great; I\'d go as far as saying there are certain arcs that occur that could be realistic in how it\'s handled.Bringing up arcs, the most interesting and unique thing about Snow Fairy Sugar that I\'ve seen is the multiple small arcs and over arcing story that is told. It\'s the first Broccoli anime I\'ve seen that cared to create something memorable in this regard.Another unique aspect to Snow Fairy Sugar is the locale; it\'s not in Japan or anything, but in a small rural town based on Germany. The signs are Germanic, the clothing gives off an old German feeling, the streets and buildings seem very European and German. Big props for having a new and interesting place for an anime to be located in.The ED and OP of Snow Fairy Sugar is pretty incredible too. Sugar Baby Looooooove (said like that), is the start of the OP, bright, bubbly and most astoundingly cute, it could overwhelm the members of AnimeGAF. The ED is really peaceful and much more sincere, using the piano, some light vocals and a super cute vocalist to end the episode, it\'s incredibly peaceful.Comparing Pita Ten to Snow Fairy Sugar, I\'d have to say if you\'re interested in one of these two shows, watch Little Snow Fairy Sugar first. It\'s comedic, it\'s sincere, it\'s well put together and doesn\'t have any annoying aspects at all. It\'s a fantastic anime the Snow Fairy, Sugar.

The signs are Germanic, the clothing gives off an old German feeling, the streets and buildings seem very European and German. Big props for having a new and interesting place for an anime to be located in.The ED and OP of Snow Fairy Sugar is pretty incredible too. Sugar Baby Looooooove (said like that), is the start of the OP, bright, bubbly and most astoundingly cute, it could overwhelm the members of AnimeGAF. The ED is really peaceful and much more sincere, using the piano, some light vocals and a super cute vocalist to end the episode, it\'s incredibly peaceful.Comparing Pita Ten to Snow Fairy Sugar, I\'d have to say if you\'re interested in one of these two shows, watch Little Snow Fairy Sugar first. It\'s comedic, it\'s sincere, it\'s well put together and doesn\'t have any annoying aspects at all. It\'s a fantastic anime', 'Seriously, this anime was just a bundle of cute and endearment. Adorable concept I really enjoyed.Story: 8It isn\'t some super complicated and intricate plot. It\'s pretty simple. Saga, the main character, befriends a snow fairy named Sugar and the other season fairies in the town while Sugar tries to become a true snow fairy. However, it\'s still got enjoyable scenes and little plots of Saga\'s everyday life and development with the characters both human and fairy.Art: 8Nothing super amazing, but some scenes I believe are just very simple and beautiful. Definitely a cute style too! Appealing characters with a quaint town scene that makes you...feel really peaceful and generally happy.Sound: 10My favorite part of the show. I downloaded all the music from this series. The musical instruments and the melodies they produce are so addicting. They\'re quaint, sweet, and smooth. If you like the piano, violin, or trumpet, you\'ll definitely enjoy these melodies that added to the overall atmosphere of the scenes in the series. Not to mention the opening theme was absolutely adorable!!!Character: 9I loved the character development of this series. You got a real sense of character from all the different people, both pro and antagonists. I loved that Gretta, the ""bad guy"" was in fact not that bad at all but a confused child. It really gives a perspective that not all people are bad, but just have their own insecurities that make their thinking distorted. I liked the developed bond between Saga and Sugar, as well as the look into Saga\'s past with her mother and traits such as a strong sense of responsibility. Very likable characters.Enjoyment: 8Great to watch when you may be feeling a little down and need a bit of a pick me up. It was a kind of long series with not real particular plot with a lot of sort of fillers. I don\'t generally like those types of animes, but I did enjoy this one. Episodes with lots of good music were my favorite.Overall: 8.5I did very much enjoy this series. Will I have time to ever rewatch the whole thing again? Probably not, but I definitely enjoyed it. I wouldn\'t mind showing it to my kids or my niece one day if it\'s not too outdated. I think it\'s a good reminder of the simple things we miss in life. Things we should have learned but have forgotten as kids. feel really peaceful and generally happy.Sound: 10My favorite part of the show. I downloaded all the music from this series.

Sounds simple enough right? so why a 9 out of 10 you ask? well you see, there\'s also another aspect to this show, and that is the interactions and relationships that form between the characters. (no spoilers) this in my honest opinion was done very well and it was definitely heart warming.sound: 8/10I loved the soundtrack that was used in this series, i wish i could expand on this, but i would like to keep my review spoiler free so i\'m afraid that\'s all i can say on that front.the music definitely fits with the show, from upbeat to music so calm you feel like you\'re the only person in the world when you\'re listening to it. the opening Sugar Baby Love by Yoko Ishida is also one of my new personal favourites, definitely suited for this show. unfortunately i didn\'t think that the ending track was as good, not to say that it\'s bad though just not as good.character: 10/10the characters are definitely one of the best parts of the show! the way they are portrayed and their interactions with one another are so amusing that you can\'t help but find yourself smiling and yet there are other times that you might get so mad that you wish you had a punching bag to hit, just so that you can let off some steam. this is all a part of the enjoyment that the show gives you.on the note of voice actors, i\'m no expert but from what my unexperienced ears heard, the acting was a job well done, they really made the characters come to life. ah man! i wish i had a sugar too!overall [final thoughts]: 9/10so adding together everything i mentioned above, these are just some of the reasons i love this anime and why i decided to write a review to recommend it to others. if MAL used a decimal point based scoring system this would\'ve been a 9.5/10 for me.so last words... well although it\'s not centered around Christmas, i feel like this would definitely be the right time of year (festive season) to watch this anime. you\'re bound to have many laughs, maybe shed a few tears, sympathize with a some of the characters and perhaps even find a new OST to listen to.-END-PHEW!!!! well that\'s it for my first review! told ya it would be awkward didn\'t I? regardless, i had fun writing this. known as   ""Twinkles"".

These snow fairies will let the moe out of every ""real"" man.The selling part of this series is its overwhelming cuteness. The fact that the characters are chibi fairies and school children  proves no other intention.The story I believed was set in some town in Germany. It is nice to point out that the western setting was defined consistently in terms of culture, names and structures.The naming sense was a genius idea. The cuteness of those chibi characters added with spice names makes them more kawaii and huggable and squeeshable and edible (ok that was...weird).The story is somewhat original in its own way. One thing I found weird is the lack of a main story line. This makes it a little episodic. And the ending i think is not fitting. Although the cuteness makes up for it. hahaThe soundtrack is good. The piano pieces were great. It makes me want to place a camera next to my piano and do those tutorial videos like the one in youtube. The mood of the scene is amplified by the use of good soundtrack so they did a great job on that.The opening song!! Ahh. I love the rendition. The original version was sung by the rubettes but i am loving this version of Yoko Ishida very much. thumbs up if you agree. HahaThe main character Saga and Greta reminds me of Sakura and Tomoyo from Cardcaptor Sakura. The resemblance is uncanny don\'t you think? Because of that, I thought this was from CLAMP. But i think it is not.Overall, This is worth a watch. You will not get tired of watching this until the end, that I gurantee. 9.5/10 it is. XD weird).The story is somewhat original in its own way.

I think it was dragged out a bit and got repetitive at the end, but overall it was a very good children's story if you like that sort of thing. There were parts that seemed a bit dopey in and that I don't believe people would usually react the way some of the characters do. However overall it was a fairly good story. I liked the fairy's clothing too. "", 'Little snow fairy sugar is a very cute show based on fairies that have to find a ""twinkle""in order to be a full-pledged fairy.With cute colors and outfits this best fits young girls. ', ""**Minor Spoilers**What we have here is a magical girl anime that tells the story of Sugar and her human companion Saga and we get to see Sugar make her transition into a full fledged season fairy with the help of her fairy friends. In this anime Season Fairies are little creatures that control all aspects of the weather. It is not only Sugar that is trying to make the transition into a full fledged season fairy but her friends are trying to do the same as well.Judging from the title, your absolutely right - we are dealing with an anime that deals with a lot...of cuteness. Regardless of the cute and adorable nature of this anime there is a compelling story to be told here but unfortunately it doesn't really start to take off until at least over half the anime is over. There is a huge emphasis on self growth and realizing your own potential but by the time your even remotely interested in the characters and the story you've already grown tired of it.The main characters start off very unlikable throughout the first part of this anime because both Saga and Sugar know how to get on each others nerves and it would of been okay if there was any humour associated with it, but there wasn't much in the way of humor throughout the majority of the anime minus a few chuckle moments here and there. However, as their relationship develops throughout the entire anime you start to sympathize with them and how much they mean to each other.The ending of this anime really saves it because it is a little sad with how it ends, but you understand why it has to end the way it did. However ultimately the biggest problem with this anime is its length. It really didn't need 24 episodes to tell its story since a lot of the episodes were useless filler without any real progression into the main heart of the story.The anime is just ok; I don't consider it very memorable because a lot of the episodes did feel like a major drag. There were a few shining moments in the anime; there was one episode where the season fairies had to help a turtle accomplish his dream which was to fly and that was a very adorable episode but there was just too many episodes that focused on character development for characters i had no interest in whatsoever. It was even hard to even have a favorite character in this anime. I know who I hated in this anime the most, but to pick a character in this anime that I liked was incredibly hard.I think another issue I had with this anime is that while this anime seems like something that would cater to kids or fans of magical girl anime there were a few moments throughout the anime that had a very sneaky creepy perverted vibe for it and it was totally unexpected and frankly unwanted. There were a few episodes that focused on a play called The Bear Pianist (Bare Penis), and I'm just saying to myself WTF. There were a few other moments as well but I won't spoil them.Ultimately its a magical girl anime with a slow/intolerable beginning but if you stick with it, you'll grow to like the story and how it ends. It doesn't have a very memorable opening and ending song, but some of the background and foreground music is very beautiful.Recommended for Kids and Fans of Magical Girl AnimeNot Recommend for anyone elseMost Favorite Character: Wind Fairy PepperLeast Favorite Character: Greta of cuteness.

Dirty Pair: The Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1796/Dirty_Pair__The_Movie,"['Speaking as a big Dirty Pair fan, it\'s really amazing how much of disappointment Project Eden is.  The animation is smooth, I guess, and the intro, Yuri\'s impromptu dance (now a famous vaporwave gif), the ""over the top"" song sequence, and the Streamline dub Wattsman\'s VA is about all I like about this particular Dirty Pair franchise entry.Let\'s start with the bath that results in Kei, Yuri and Carson doing Kill la Kill before that was a thing for most of this movie.  While they actually became pretty professional by the end of the TV series, Kei and Yuri are still a...couple of dimbulbs (and I mean that in the most affectionate way) but even early TV series Kei and Yuri wouldn\'t take a bath in radioactive abandoned mine water.But what I don\'t really like about this movie is that once Carson gets (re) introduced in the mine, the Pair seem to take a backseat in driving the story.  Carson leads the Pair around; they tend to respond to him instead of driving the situation themselves and putting the men in the backseat, as is the usual dynamic in the TV series.  For a good portion of the film Kei is off with Carson and Yuri has no dialogue as she looks around for them (though the Xenomorph skin she wears is a nice touch).  The result of all this is that, crucially, the banter and camaraderie between Kei and Yuri is absent from the majority of this film, producing something rather joyless compared to any episode of the TV series.What\'s even more offensive is the cheesy romance angle between Kei and Carson.  The TV series Lovely Angels\' relationships with men are comically bad and these experiences continually reaffirm the bond between Kei and Yuri.  Seeing Kei getting flustered and tsundere with this Carson guy just doesn\'t sit right with me, it\'s not what I expect from girls who\'ve been making jokes about oral sex and giving each other their \'leftover\' men (25 years before Panty and Stocking did it!).  The sexual confidence and savvy dealing with men that characterizes Kei and Yuri is simply not here.This movie is just not fun or funny, and if this is someone\'s first exposure to Dirty Pair I would understand why they wouldn\'t be impressed by it - the movie\'s Kei and Yuri just feel generic and, crucially, they don\'t even feel  like the main players in their own movie when the staff has given so much attention to Carson and Wattsman.  Project Eden is not representative of what makes the Dirty Pair great characters.  Kei and Yuri really deserved a rollicking action comedy epic - like many episodes of the TV/OVA series are- instead of this rather dull affair. couple of dimbulbs (and I mean that in the most affectionate way) but even early TV series Kei and Yuri wouldn\'t take a bath in radioactive abandoned mine water.But what I don\'t really like about this movie is that once Carson gets (re) introduced in the mine, the Pair seem to take a backseat in driving the story.

It was so much mind-boggling fun that this movie raised my expectations of the rest of the Dirty Pair franchise, which sadly did not live up to those expectations. Having watched most of the rest of the OVAs and other movies, I will have to say that Dirty Pair Project Eden is still by far the best of all the Dirty Pair OVAs/Movies.The plot is simple, they are sent to Agerna, a planet rich in Vizorium (one mineral necessary to space travel). Needless...to say Vizorium is unstable and can explode easily - setting us up for Classic Dirty Pair action. Our intrepid WWWA Agents are investigating series of mysterious attacks on mining operations and discover a mad scientist bent on taking a long dormant alien race to its final evolutionary form!Besides the main plot, there is a sub plot involving Carson B. Carson, a thief who`s hunting a bottle of World War II-vintage wine. Now THIS is a good character. He's fun, crazy and a true scoundrel. If they wanted to throw in an obligatory love interest for the Dirty Pair, this is the way to do it.Animation is dated but the characters are classic Dirty Pair. There's more chaos and mayhem than ever, and the ending is exactly what the Dirty Pair should be like. It's just toooo good. If only the rest of the OVAs/Movies were as good. to say Vizorium is unstable and can explode easily - setting us up for Classic Dirty Pair action.

Death in the middle of love. [spoiler] And then everyone dies as they fly away. [/spoiler] that was great. I’m feeling a 9 so far. It gets rated so high purely because of how it looks. It is sort of like X the movie, When it comes to the actual story, it is odd and disjointed. Frankly, I am biased when it comes to these types of things and if it looks good, I will enjoy it. And this looks good in the ways that will specifically appeal to me which are: Futuristic city landscapes/environments. Mechanical mechanisms and gadgets/technological visuals. Alien creatures/settings. (Technically robots but it only has a little of that.) The destruction of the previously mentioned things. When I say looking good, I’m not even referring to the women at all, I could pretty much care less. The blue one was OK until she was revealed to be a flaca apologist. I felt like the whole plant should have came alive. There was even a brain at the top of the plant that I think could have been part of the end goal of the evil scientist. The cat creature should have showed up later and the blue lady should have saved them when the cat did. And then the cat should have brought some sort of ship that would be capable of dealing with the awaken facility. As the facility kept seemingly activating and coming together, but it never really became something new. If the rocks were secretly alive, which, by the way was a concept, I greatly enjoyed, Then using whatever was learned to bring them back alive could have been used to bring the building itself alive as well. I did feel it was odd that the woman instantaneously fell in love with the criminal who groped and punched her. for something with such a provocative name it had a strangely small amount of fan service, or maybe it just didn't appeal to me. The story is just barely passable enough for me to feel a high rating is deserved as the visuals are extremely appealing to what I enjoy looking at. One of the better pieces of cyberpunk I have experienced. A low 9 that could drop. 5 violence. How? Why was it in a case set to explode when an explosion causes mass death.

He knocks down the whole operation. Do something for yourself. Dirty hair suits the dirty pair well. Searching the abandoned plant. The showers. They take a nice bath during the mission. What a suprise they got excited to see naked. Also booo.i accept no flaca apologist behavior such as this.she is valid about herself though. hmm. If he removes them they will be seen. A sneak. No buts or no life either.he cuffs himself. They arrive in the blue. A whole army.they all rip each other apart for the metal. They verbally throw down. Down there in purple town? Professor waton. A professional thief needs to be a professional art collector. A really rough woman will have a really rough time in love “Carson de Carson.” She has already fallen. Crazy. A work of art. A creature. A stone. A sample of a perfect bio spot. The perfect being seemingly a lass. What a way to get around. Kinda like me low key. People the rock is alive. The butt is ripping. The purpose of a revolution is to make the seeds of a better structure gradually. And the seeds separated from my previous structure, never joined together again. Nobody knows why living things have these revolutions. A little shit of minnows? He knows she fell. If you like me act like it. True!!!!!!! He punches her.? Be a good girl? The aliens are brought forth from their slumber. What is he doing? The very best one. A new type. Mushroom fossil pedestals. The red claws. The eye in the sky is shot down. It’s an important thing. He is really going to do it. You get burnt if you fall in love with loving. She’s so used to playing with fire she she won’t get burnt. She wants to learn to hate him for him. She will forget for him. Strong hearted with the weak mind. And it all turns to petals. And then they combine and disappear. She role plays. They are imprisoned together. You just try to say that to me again. Blown into different holes. Gong the name of the movie. Everything is activating. Something seems to be launching. Everything is connecting in together. Environmental displacement by evolution of necessity. Their souls are stolen. The important wine. The very best of the finest. The one who stole his precious wine. The best wine ever. He saw studied and searched. Humanity successor needs to be chosen while the humans are still alive. All of the fossils brought back to life. With boobs too. They get suited up. Theigh rockets. It’s all exploding. Distracted by his destined bottle of wine. She always knew that. A pro shouldn’t start a matter if they end up failing. He’ll miss being a professional. You almost make me feel good. And now it’s your turn. He can’t remember anything because he’s lost. He drinks the wine. Nice wine and a nice woman for a thief. He is a real happy guy. Shedding it after its final shot. Brain. I would appreciate it if the whole facility came alive. Let’s see. 1 million shards of glass. His cords get cut. Only the song during the sequence. It all comes crashing down. [spoiler] And he lives. [/spoiler] you know you will never do that sort of thing. It’s beginning of a new mankind. They awaken the planet anyway. Death in the middle of love. [spoiler] And then everyone dies as they fly away. [/spoiler] that was great. I’m feeling a 9 so far. It gets rated so high purely because of how it looks. It is sort of like X the movie, When it comes to the actual story, it is odd and disjointed. Frankly, I am biased when it comes to these types of things and if it looks good, I will enjoy it. And this looks good in the ways that will specifically appeal to me which are: Futuristic city landscapes/environments. Mechanical mechanisms and gadgets/technological visuals. Alien creatures/settings. (Technically robots but it only has a little of that.) The destruction of the previously mentioned things. When I say looking good, I’m not even referring to the women at all, I could pretty much care less. The blue one was OK until she was revealed to be a flaca apologist. I felt like the whole plant should have came alive. There was even a brain at the top of the plant that I think could have been part of the end goal of the evil scientist. The cat creature should have showed up later and the blue lady should have saved them when the cat did. And then the cat should have brought some sort of ship that would be capable of dealing with the awaken facility. As the facility kept seemingly activating and coming together, but it never really became something new. If the rocks were secretly alive, which, by the way was a concept, I greatly enjoyed, Then using whatever was learned to bring them back alive could have been used to bring the building itself alive as well. I did feel it was odd that the woman instantaneously fell in love with the criminal who groped and punched her. for something with such a provocative name it had a strangely small amount of fan service, or maybe it just didn't appeal to me. The story is just barely passable enough for me to feel a high rating is deserved as the visuals are extremely appealing to what I enjoy looking at. One of the better pieces of cyberpunk I have experienced. A low 9 that could drop. 5"", ""A decent return to form after the disappointing and overly-morose Nolandia Affair, Project Eden is far more in line with the style and tone of the TV series. The plotline is unfortunately too thin to fill out the 80 minute runtime and just doesn't have as much substance as the TV episodes did, but the film makes up for it with an incredible sense of style. Dirty Pair always has fantastic action and the animation here is top-notch. The production design in general is a bit creepier than usual and it almost feels like a Metroid anime in places, and the atmosphere and music are...both spectacular. That sense of style does a lot of heavy lifting because otherwise this kind of feels like the Rocky 4 of anime, in the sense that it's about 30 minutes of plot with 60 minutes of stylish music videos and action. That's not bad and it's still a ton of fun to experience visually, but it's also not super compelling, though there are still some good elements to the story. This installment introduces a very fun Han Solo-esque rogue in the form of Carson D. Carson, who gets the only really meaningful character arc. The ending is such a corny crap-out it kind of brings the film down a bit even more, but I still enjoyed another reasonably fun adventure with the Pair. both spectacular.

Boogiepop wa Warawanai (2019),https://myanimelist.net/anime/37451/Boogiepop_wa_Warawanai_2019,"['Once in a while, there may come a show with complex storytelling and character roster that is much more than what it seems. The light novel medium is such a style of Japanese novel literature where imaginations are endless. As one of the earliest light novel originators, Boogiepop Phantom’s presence could be felt as far as back in the early 2000s. While I have seen that show many years ago, it felt like Boogiepop Phantom was missing something, or perhaps needed a boost to regain its popularity again. It’s 2019 and here we are again, connected by a powerful entity known as the Boogiepop, a...legend among community who came to judge humanity.Consisting of 22 light novel volumes, it’s obvious the show doesn’t have the time to adapt every single one. The 2000s’ series ended up being an anime original while this show commits to a much more faithful adaptation. Jumping into the new Boogiepop may seem like a walk in the park but make no mistake, this show is not so easy to understand. In fact, I would recommend re-watching scenes and episodes at any chance to get a better experience. And it all begins with the first 3-episode arc: Boogiepop Does Not Laugh.Before I venture deeper, do be aware that while the anime overall has interconnecting themes, it follows non-linear storytelling structure. In fact, it adapts an arc format where each arc consists a series of episodes together. From this adaptation, we get four arcs with “Vs The Imaginator” being the longest. That being said, I should mention that the first arc will most likely make or break for most viewers. Essentially, we are introduced to a supernatural entity known as Boogiepop, the urban legend with a keen insight on observing human behavior. But as the show progresses, it’s shown that her ambiguous actions may be more puzzling than what it seems. Who is Boogiepop? What exactly does it want? Why is it here in our world? These are some of the questions many will have in their mind for this first arc. Indeed, it shouldn’t take long to realize humanity is in jeopardy with the presence of “Synethic Humans” among society. On the outside, they may look like us but on the inside, they are beings with a twisted ambition. Their existence also proves how weak humans are by manipulating our free will. It’s a fate worse than death when you realize the atrocious acts manipulated individuals can commit. Spooky E is a prominent example during his reign of terror during the “Boogiepop vs Imaginator” arc. Having no second thoughts about harming or even killing humans, he represents pure evil as an agent of the Towa Organization.That also brings in a big question. Just what exactly is the Towa Organization? While it’s an organization responsible for creating synthetic humans, no one truly knows their real agendas. The catalyst of this mysterious group is a character named “Echoes” who came to Earth to judge humans. The first episode establishes him as a being who is confused about human behavior. The Towa Organization seems to organize ways to test humans through dangerous experiments, many which result in deaths or disaster consequences. Their main goal throughout the show revolves how to control human’s way of evolution. It’s a complex concept that may take untold amount of time to achieve. In addition, the Towa Organization is known to have great influence in the world, capable of escaping the law and defying authority. I think it may take some time for viewers to figure out their purpose in the show because as I mentioned before, there’s multiple subplot building on in each arc that can get very confusing.The remainder of the course of the series also explores other important themes such as human choices. Some characters in the show (who are ordinary humans) play important roles to make differences in certain outcomes. If you remember before, free will allows people to accomplish great things if they put their mind into it. On the other hand, Boogiepop is someone that has potential to accomplish imaginable feats. It’s why she is perceived as a main adversary against the Towa Organization. In a way, I even see her as a successor of Echoes. However, Boogiepop isn’t necessarily an “overpowered character”. In the final arc, she wonders if defeating the King of Distortion is possible. But in essence, it’s her wise words and wisdom that I find more appealing than other characteristics. Her words may be interpreted differently depending on how you perceive them but by the end of the day, she really lives up to her name of being a legend.Madhouse is responsible for once again to bring Boogiepop to life and for what’s worth, it’s somewhat well made in terms of accurately committing to its ominous atmosphere. There’s no doubt the quiet and eerie mood lives throughout the entire duration of the show. This especially applies to the static shots in the opening episodes. It also uses a clever amount of raw character emotions to show how humans react under extraordinary circumstances. My main criticism though lies with some of the raw animated scenes as at times, it feels off . This shouldn’t hold the show back altogether but can weigh down the enjoyment on occasions. Luckily, the music, OST, and theme songs for make up for this with its well-timed choreography and directing.We live in a world now where almost anything is possible. For a show like Boogiepop, its world contains ideas that you can’t even begin to imagine if any of it became real. Being one of the most influential light novels, many writers have followed its origins and made work that became worldwide attractions. Now I will say this anime is really not one aimed for the casual audience. Many episodes may require re-watches as any scene may hold significance or clues to the show’s plot. It’s also recommended to watch this in marathon sessions than a weekly airing.

It focuses around variety of different weaknesses and gimmicks of the human mind in a manner that fully respects its audience. The story-telling is superb; subdued, incredibly well balanced, almost as if the show is in perfect harmony with itself. It doesn\'t tell or advice, rather asks questions and introduces concepts without any shade of agenda.This approach can definitely seem like style over substance to some...viewers, but as far as I am concerned, it is thus far a solid package which different sides such as story, art, characters can\'t be separated or taken out of the context because otherwise it would simply not be itself anymore.The pacing is slow, it\'s hard to tell at this point how the series will deliver and what its success will be with later episodes and how the payout turns out. But that\'s one thing I appreciate here. I can predict with rather high certainty how much I will like something already based to the first episode because I have seen a lot of anime and know my own taste, but Boogiepop is still a mystery to me. Perhaps my opinion will take a 180 turn later on, but currently I am looking forward to watching more on a level that modern anime rarely achieves. That\'s worth a great deal as something this interesting isn\'t been made even every season.So far I have been watching this with such focus and been so deeply immersed by its world and style I can\'t be but happy that this is being made. I wholeheartedly recommend this to those who like stuff such as SEL, KnK, Texhnolyze, Wolf\'s Rain, Dennou Coil, Haibane Renmei, Noein or Shigofumi.

A modern gem reminding its viewers what mature anime once was.', ""The name Boogiepop is pretty stellar. It’s catchy and unique, of course, but it also has a wealth of meaning behind it not many people are aware of, at least not here in the West. The name Boogiepop is a self-deprecating inside joke Kouhei Kadono, the author of the original novels, thought up to mock himself and his struggles in actually getting said novels published. Kadono has always been something of an arthouse writer, and he had quite a hard time getting any of his initial works published since he had yet to make a name for himself and all the publishers he approached said...they simply couldn’t turn a profit printing pieces with such little popular appeal and no audience base, even after—according to Kadono—honestly admitting how good they were. To successfully break out into the market, Kadono made a compromise with himself. He decided to tone down his more abstruse, niche stylization, his self-proclaimed “boogie” writing, and tone up the more accessible, popular style which the inherently cynical publications were willing to print, hence the name Boogiepop: a forced dichotomy between the imagination of an auteur and the creative restraint of a corporate shill, “boogie” and “pop.” The original anime adaptation of the series, Boogiepop Phantom (2000), which was also produced by Madhouse, is founded on that so-called “boogie” style. It seeks to be tonally expressive, narratively experimental, visually symbolic, deep seated in the thematic gravity of the novels which the adaption team clearly had an genuinely intimate understanding of, and most importantly, it sought to market itself toward a largely mature target audience. On the other hand, this new adaptation, Boogiepop and Others (2019), is founded on the “pop” style, which seeks merely to appeal to the lowest common denominator of kids and teenagers with obtusely frenetic action, archetypal writing, generic self-insert character designs, spoon-fed theming, and as much modern anime pandering as they could fit in the package.While my irrepressible love and respect for the masterful novel series this terribly disappointing and wildly misguided adaptation was based on will inevitably turn this review into a thinly veiled diatribe, there is a fair deal of credit to give where it’s actually due. Firstly, the show looks gorgeous…in ways. As mentioned, the artwork is stylistically abysmal. It doesn’t look like Boogiepop should look nor feel like Boogiepop should feel; it’s simply the most accessible, basic art style imaginable which has completely abandoned the textured, almost brooding darkness which characterized the original novels and the atmospherically brilliant original adaptation. However, the actual technical quality of animation—while plagued with about as much inconsistency as any other anime these days—can get stupidly high and make the show a feast for the senses if not for the discerning eyes. I remember hearing the Natsume Team at Madhouse had dropped One Punch Man and being utterly dumbstruck. Why in the world would they’ve dropped one of the industry’s most profitable titles in decades? The manga is always best selling and the anime was an international success, so what could possibly have taken precedence over such a commercial giant? Apparently, this. Director Shingo Natsume utilized many of the same connections he called upon for One Punch Man and Space☆Dandy and landed the show with some positively daring fight choreography and bombastic sakuga—sometimes even to a fault, seeing as a significant portion of episode directors working on the project clearly did not share his creative vision for Boogiepop, but for now I’m getting ahead of myself. Despite the exceptionally clever, thoughtful, and inventive antagonists of the novels being reduced to needlessly enigmatic, vapidly motivated, edgy shounen-style villains, I’d be lying if I said their respective confrontations and subsequent defeats weren’t animated about as well and with about as much personality as Madhouse could’ve managed, and even if the moment-to-moment of the show looked boring as hell, when it occasionally went all out, it brought to life scenes I never thought I’d see outside my imagination, and even I can’t deny that gratification.Even with the visuals being so strong, at least technically, the audio is even better, and more importantly, more emblematic of what Natsume was actually going for with this evidently fallacious adaptation. While the sound design—a facet of production which is seemingly overlooked to a greater and greater degree with each passing day as studios realize their main audience, young people, lack any critical sense for quality soundscapes—is expectedly lackluster, the actual score is outstanding. The composer, Kensuke Ushio, truly is the rising star of the anime industry, praised for all his rightfully acclaimed work from Devilman Crybaby’s revolutionary synthwave, Liz and the Blue Bird’s outright emotive orchestra, Koe no Katachi’s SFX-based composition, and Ping Pong: The Animation’s unforgettably rousing, electrifying soundtrack which amounted to one of the best anime has ever seen. While his music for Boogiepop and Others (2019) doesn’t quite reach the heights of his more legendary work, it’s still as magnificent as you’d expect given his repertoire, but the fact his distinct style is what Natsume was looking for in a composer speaks volumes about why this adaptation feels so off. If you’ve had the pleasure of listening to Ushio’s music before, you’ll know what I’m talking about, but the fact Natsume thought Ushio’s calming aesthetic jibed with the experimental identity of Boogiepop in any way whatsoever really shows why he missed the mark. The novels are mature, and therefore root their humanity in their nuanced characterization. Almost every novel after the first is fueled not by character, but by mystery, spectacle, and metric tons of Kadono meticulously expounding on his genius theming and bizarre concepts, all of which simply do not play well with Ushio’s soft, ambient sound. Boogiepop is contemplative and poignant, certainly, but while the first book wherein these few chapters of concentrated emotion lie would fit well with Ushio’s music, these moments are cut from the anime in their entirety, or worse yet, edited around to such a degree they lost all the catharsis which they had in the original. And this is the problem with Boogiepop and Others (2019): if you’ve read the novels, then the characters and themes will’ve lost all thought, and if you haven’t, then how could you even invest in such a hollow cast or be intrigued by such vacuous symbolism in such a seemingly aimless storyline?Natsume has more than proven himself as a talented director in the past with his work on One Punch Man, the action spectacle you all know and love, and the infinitely better yet infinitely lesser known police procedural, ACCA: Jusan-ku Kansatsu-ka, and if One Punch Man showed us his phenomenal action direction and ACCA his equally phenomenal character direction, then Boogiepop and Others (2019) showed us just how well he could combine the two into a show as (potentially) exciting as it is (potentially) contemplative. Sadly, the script absolutely annihilated any sense of flow which those two works had and greatly limited his skill as a director. The writers of this adaptation very blatantly ordered scenes as if checking off boxes on a bulleted list and make no attempt to add characterization, style, personality, or nuance, simply wanting to show X, Y, and Z just for the sake of having shown it. Myriad scenes had frankly choppy execution, were poorly edited, had awkward pacing, and were made with poor sound design and messy audio mixing. Additionally, what exactly is shown on screen has been greatly edited and sometimes completely censored from what the original anime adaptation was willing to show in gore and what the original novels were willing to show in nudity. The characters are empty husks, since they’re given no time to be anything otherwise. It absolutely speeds through the narrative and character arcs alike, zooming past all the central themes, every chance to humanize the cast, and the alluring tone which had me and so many others in love with the original works. I know I sound like a broken record, but this is all yet another manner in which this new adaptation derails itself from its more adult source material and constricts its own charisma to sell out to the younger, more vast, more accessible audience who just want to watch some flashy action sakuga and go home. They cram an entire chapter of the novel into episode one alone—one of the most dense setup chapters to a novel I've ever read in my life into a single twenty minute episode—only to then cram the next three chapters into episode two, unceremoniously blazing through a major character death which served as the entire emotional crux of the original novel just so they could get to the fight sequence in chapter five as soon as possible, even though their speedy pacing totally killed the tension it would’ve had if they had properly built up to it.To be fair, this problem lessens as the show continues because Natsume entrusted more technically pivotal scenes to outsourced key animators, episode animation directors, and in the case of the Boogiepop Overdrive arc, even a whole new storyboarding team. There were some Ex-Sunrise/Bones animators, some WIT Studio animators in both the show and the opening, and even some Trigger boys. Obviously, this had them ending up with the drastically inconsistent levels of quality I mentioned forever ago, which just so happened to align the “worse” at the beginning and the “better” at the finale. I mean, in hindsight, that opening itself told me everything I needed to know about this new adaptation in a hopelessly forthright fashion. With MYTH & ROID being as invested as they’ve historically been in the projects they're involved with, the opening theme for Boogiepop and Others (2019) is great. It’s nowhere near as unique, striking, tone setting, and memorable as the opening theme for Boogiepop Phantom (2000), but it still got it right more than the rest of this show did, and it warns of what the show had in store for me by being paired with an opening animation which is just a bunch of pseudo-symbolic bullshit having nothing at all to do with Boogiepop or its original message. MYTH & ROID’s theme, “Shadowgraph,” is about loss of self and general despondence and dissociation with social norms and stigma, which, while not directly touching on Boogiepop’s central theme of normalcy, is at least directly relevant to the narrative and characters, but the visuals and animation itself are nothing of the sort. And speaking of theme songs, the lack of insert songs in this show was actually, physically painful for a fan as obsessed as I am. They didn’t play Oingo Boingo’s “No One Lives Forever” during the big Manticore scene even though a song that old would've been a breeze to get the license for—especially for a production team able to get the permission to air five weeks worth of made-for-TV anime back-to-back, by the way—nor did they have Boogiepop appear at the school whistling Composer Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” despite the fact it MADE that scene in the novels, only to then use it later in the Boogiepop VS Imaginator arc anyway. I swear, it’s almost like the staff forgot when and why they should care.I apologize for dropping my eloquence and devolving into a ranting, raving fangirl in the last little moments there, but hey, I warned you it would happen. Bringing it all back to a place of critical review, though, I think it’d be healthy to unbiasedly examine what we ultimately have here. We have me, some fanatical Boogiepop Superfan who recognizes the perfection of the original novels and will criticize anything and everything which isn’t equally infallible, and a well made yet emotionally, thematically, and stylistically unfulfilling and often destructively unfaithful adaptation. If someone watches this and likes it despite everything I’ve bitched about, then that’s awesome. They have another anime to enjoy. And if someone watches this and sees its hollow core for what it is, then they’ll just read my review or others like it, go check out the originals, and love them instead. Neither scenario is negative. Sure, I’m disappointed a godsent novel series and its superb original adaptation weren’t followed up with by an equally outstanding work of art, but nothing it did offended me, because while it certainly fails to fan Boogiepop’s flaming brilliance and all which makes the series so legendary, it didn’t go and make Boogiepop downright bad. So, at the end of the day, I honestly recommend this show if you’re for some reason hesitant about getting straight into the classics, if only as an introduction to the Boogiepop franchise and giving you that initial push. I know that’s cheating, but I’m honestly just worried if I’m too critical, then I’ll scare people away from one of my favorite titles to date and force them to miss out on what could be one of theirs as well. The last thing I’d want is for you to shy away from a timeless masterpiece because a less than competent adaptation team failed to fully capture its magnificence and some hack asshole on MAL gave the whole property a bad name by going in too hard on their work, which itself is both the worst version of the story, and not even all that bad.Thank you for reading. they simply couldn’t turn a profit printing pieces with such little popular appeal and no audience base, even after—according to Kadono—honestly admitting how good they were. To successfully break out into the market, Kadono made a compromise with himself. He decided to tone down his more abstruse, niche stylization, his self-proclaimed “boogie” writing, and tone up the more accessible, popular style which the inherently cynical publications were willing to print, hence the name Boogiepop: a forced dichotomy between the imagination of an auteur and the creative restraint of a corporate shill, “boogie” and “pop.” The original anime adaptation of the series, Boogiepop Phantom (2000), which was also produced by Madhouse, is founded on that so-called “boogie” style. It seeks to be tonally expressive, narratively experimental, visually symbolic, deep seated in the thematic gravity of the novels which the adaption team clearly had an genuinely intimate understanding of, and most importantly, it sought to market itself toward a largely mature target audience. On the other hand, this new adaptation, Boogiepop and Others (2019), is founded on the “pop” style, which seeks merely to appeal to the lowest common denominator of kids and teenagers with obtusely frenetic action, archetypal writing, generic self-insert character designs, spoon-fed theming, and as much modern anime pandering as they could fit in the package.While my irrepressible love and respect for the masterful novel series this terribly disappointing and wildly misguided adaptation was based on will inevitably turn this review into a thinly veiled diatribe, there is a fair deal of credit to give where it’s actually due. Firstly, the show looks gorgeous…in ways. As mentioned, the artwork is stylistically abysmal. It doesn’t look like Boogiepop should look nor feel like Boogiepop should feel; it’s simply the most accessible, basic art style imaginable which has completely abandoned the textured, almost brooding darkness which characterized the original novels and the atmospherically brilliant original adaptation. However, the actual technical quality of animation—while plagued with about as much inconsistency as any other anime these days—can get stupidly high and make the show a feast for the senses if not for the discerning eyes. I remember hearing the Natsume Team at Madhouse had dropped One Punch Man and being utterly dumbstruck. Why in the world would they’ve dropped one of the industry’s most profitable titles in decades? The manga is always best selling and the anime was an international success, so what could possibly have taken precedence over such a commercial giant? Apparently, this. Director Shingo Natsume utilized many of the same connections he called upon for One Punch Man and Space☆Dandy and landed the show with some positively daring fight choreography and bombastic sakuga—sometimes even to a fault, seeing as a significant portion of episode directors working on the project clearly did not share his creative vision for Boogiepop, but for now I’m getting ahead of myself. Despite the exceptionally clever, thoughtful, and inventive antagonists of the novels being reduced to needlessly enigmatic, vapidly motivated, edgy shounen-style villains, I’d be lying if I said their respective confrontations and subsequent defeats weren’t animated about as well and with about as much personality as Madhouse could’ve managed, and even if the moment-to-moment of the show looked boring as hell, when it occasionally went all out, it brought to life scenes I never thought I’d see outside my imagination, and even I can’t deny that gratification.Even with the visuals being so strong, at least technically, the audio is even better, and more importantly, more emblematic of what Natsume was actually going for with this evidently fallacious adaptation. While the sound design—a facet of production which is seemingly overlooked to a greater and greater degree with each passing day as studios realize their main audience, young people, lack any critical sense for quality soundscapes—is expectedly lackluster, the actual score is outstanding. The composer, Kensuke Ushio, truly is the rising star of the anime industry, praised for all his rightfully acclaimed work from Devilman Crybaby’s revolutionary synthwave, Liz and the Blue Bird’s outright emotive orchestra, Koe no Katachi’s SFX-based composition, and Ping Pong: The Animation’s unforgettably rousing, electrifying soundtrack which amounted to one of the best anime has ever seen. While his music for Boogiepop and Others (2019) doesn’t quite reach the heights of his more legendary work, it’s still as magnificent as you’d expect given his repertoire, but the fact his distinct style is what Natsume was looking for in a composer speaks volumes about why this adaptation feels so off. If you’ve had the pleasure of listening to Ushio’s music before, you’ll know what I’m talking about, but the fact Natsume thought Ushio’s calming aesthetic jibed with the experimental identity of Boogiepop in any way whatsoever really shows why he missed the mark. The novels are mature, and therefore root their humanity in their nuanced characterization. Almost every novel after the first is fueled not by character, but by mystery, spectacle, and metric tons of Kadono meticulously expounding on his genius theming and bizarre concepts, all of which simply do not play well with Ushio’s soft, ambient sound. Boogiepop is contemplative and poignant, certainly, but while the first book wherein these few chapters of concentrated emotion lie would fit well with Ushio’s music, these moments are cut from the anime in their entirety, or worse yet, edited around to such a degree they lost all the catharsis which they had in the original. And this is the problem with Boogiepop and Others (2019): if you’ve read the novels, then the characters and themes will’ve lost all thought, and if you haven’t, then how could you even invest in such a hollow cast or be intrigued by such vacuous symbolism in such a seemingly aimless storyline?Natsume has more than proven himself as a talented director in the past with his work on One Punch Man, the action spectacle you all know and love, and the infinitely better yet infinitely lesser known police procedural, ACCA: Jusan-ku Kansatsu-ka, and if One Punch Man showed us his phenomenal action direction and ACCA his equally phenomenal character direction, then Boogiepop and Others (2019) showed us just how well he could combine the two into a show as (potentially) exciting as it is (potentially) contemplative. Sadly, the script absolutely annihilated any sense of flow which those two works had and greatly limited his skill as a director. The writers of this adaptation very blatantly ordered scenes as if checking off boxes on a bulleted list and make no attempt to add characterization, style, personality, or nuance, simply wanting to show X, Y, and Z just for the sake of having shown it. Myriad scenes had frankly choppy execution, were poorly edited, had awkward pacing, and were made with poor sound design and messy audio mixing. Additionally, what exactly is shown on screen has been greatly edited and sometimes completely censored from what the original anime adaptation was willing to show in gore and what the original novels were willing to show in nudity. The characters are empty husks, since they’re given no time to be anything otherwise. It absolutely speeds through the narrative and character arcs alike, zooming past all the central themes, every chance to humanize the cast, and the alluring tone which had me and so many others in love with the original works. I know I sound like a broken record, but this is all yet another manner in which this new adaptation derails itself from its more adult source material and constricts its own charisma to sell out to the younger, more vast, more accessible audience who just want to watch some flashy action sakuga and go home. They cram an entire chapter of the novel into episode one alone—one of the most dense setup chapters to a novel I've ever read in my life into a single twenty minute episode—only to then cram the next three chapters into episode two, unceremoniously blazing through a major character death which served as the entire emotional crux of the original novel just so they could get to the fight sequence in chapter five as soon as possible, even though their speedy pacing totally killed the tension it would’ve had if they had properly built up to it.To be fair, this problem lessens as the show continues because Natsume entrusted more technically pivotal scenes to outsourced key animators, episode animation directors, and in the case of the Boogiepop Overdrive arc, even a whole new storyboarding team. There were some Ex-Sunrise/Bones animators, some WIT Studio animators in both the show and the opening, and even some Trigger boys. Obviously, this had them ending up with the drastically inconsistent levels of quality I mentioned forever ago, which just so happened to align the “worse” at the beginning and the “better” at the finale. I mean, in hindsight, that opening itself told me everything I needed to know about this new adaptation in a hopelessly forthright fashion. With MYTH & ROID being as invested as they’ve historically been in the projects they're involved with, the opening theme for Boogiepop and Others (2019) is great. It’s nowhere near as unique, striking, tone setting, and memorable as the opening theme for Boogiepop Phantom (2000), but it still got it right more than the rest of this show did, and it warns of what the show had in store for me by being paired with an opening animation which is just a bunch of pseudo-symbolic bullshit having nothing at all to do with Boogiepop or its original message. MYTH & ROID’s theme, “Shadowgraph,” is about loss of self and general despondence and dissociation with social norms and stigma, which, while not directly touching on Boogiepop’s central theme of normalcy, is at least directly relevant to the narrative and characters, but the visuals and animation itself are nothing of the sort.

Add in the gratuitously gory action sequences with the cynical (i.e. edgy) antagonists, and Boogiepop Never Laughs is an amalgamation of high-school-level philosophy and modern day rule-of-cool absurdity.“If confusion is the first step to knowledge, I must be a genius.” — Larry LeissnerNo.  Just because a person withholds critical information, does not imply...they are brilliant (same goes for an anime).  Any anime worth its weight in salt, should offer a tangible concept/message — especially during the initial build up period — to give the viewer an inkling of what’s to come; thus, achieving a greater outcome when said puzzle comes together.  Take Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, even though the ending was exceptionally “shocking,” it made sense within the context of the clues that were sprinkled throughout the series.  Shinji’s depression/anxiety was a recurring ailment that finally came to a head in the imaginative finale (and once again in the End of Evangelion).  As for Boogiepop (2019), it’s not understood who these characters really are, so any revelations will seem exceptionally random or out of place.“A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem.” — Albert EinsteinYes.  Boogiepop (2019) — at this juncture — seems to lack a defining theme that holds the cryptic, vague narrative structure together.  Anyone who claims they are enjoying the series thus far, are being swindled by charlatan-like tactics.  While the method of perplexing the viewer is notably polished, the apparent end goal seems rather redundant/useless.  Perhaps this prediction will be proven wrong, but the general tone through the first four episodes seems to suggest that this will be the case.“Washing dishes is the anecdote to confusion.  I know that for a fact.” — Maira KalmanIf there are any redeeming qualities, it would have to be the production values and the OST.  Another quality job by Madhouse Inc., but it was expected for the highly praised company with the reputation of being one of the best in the anime industry.  If you appreciate the upper echelon of animation eye-candy, with a mysterious narrative back drop, then Boogiepop (2019) may be up your alley, but don’t expect much else. they are brilliant (same goes for an anime).

Sure, cotton candy is good now and then, but I suspect most of us would start to get queasy at its saccharine scent if we encountered it on a daily basis.  That\'s exactly why and anime like Boogiepop is so refreshing.  It\'s a nice bag of black licorice following the holiday sweets; an anime truly fit for the season of winter.The story is wonderful, but not...easily followed.  Many people say that it\'s confusing, but that\'s more a lack of experience than a fault of the anime.  Yes, you will probably get lost if you try to watch this while simultaneously checking social media and texting your friends.  The story is a mystery, so even with your full attention you won\'t be aware of every detail of the situation.  Adding to the confusion at first is the fact that the story is non-linear, so you have to keep track of when things are happening as well as what exactly happened.  It\'s probably also true that the story would be easier to keep track of if all the episodes were already out and it could be binged, but on the other hand I think some of the fascination of the anime would be lost that way.  Kaleidoscopes aren\'t any fun when you just blankly stare into them;it\'s in the turning motion that the beauty is revealed.  Overall, I give the story 10/10.The art is well done and fits the mood of the story very well.  In my opinion, it\'s closest in style to anime like Steins Gate and Psycho Pass.  It\'s nice that the characters have very realistic designs, but I do have to complain that a little more effort needed to be put into differentiating the characters.  I had to think to myself one too many times ""Who is this?"" to give a full score here.  Overall, I give the art 9/10.The sound in this anime is done in a fittingly creepy minimalist style, OP and ED excepted.  It\'s the salt in your baked goods, almost never drawing attention directly, but were it not there everything would taste completely off (I actually made this mistake once with brownies...oops.)  The Op is a beautifully done piece by MYTH & ROID and the ED is just as fitting.  Overall, I give the sound 10/10The characters feel very real, though their individual motivations are spelled out much less than is common in other anime.  We see the characters by their actions instead of being told who they are.  I particularly enjoy that almost all of the characters are quite intelligent without needing backdrop idiots to shine.  You know that characters are done well when a character you only met a few times can die and you feel genuinely sorry about the event.  If you\'re looking for traditional anime archetypes, sorry.  Overall, I give the characters 10/10.Finally, enjoyment.  I find myself looking forward to this anime on a weekly basis, watching it shorty after it becomes available.  The episodes really consume my attention, leaving me afterward with the superbly pleasant feeling of having just consumed a good meal without overeating.  Enjoyment is definitely a 10/10.FYI My overall score is only a 9/10 since I don\'t feel comfortable giving a 10/10 at this point in the series.

It may change assuming I get around to updating this review.', 'You know there comes a time when an anime series needs your attention. Not because of the quality of the show, but the fact that if you want to get the full experience of the show, you need to sit down, watch it and pick up any details can be answered and explored later on. Of course not everyone has time for that, but some people like to pick apart anime to fully understand it. This anime is one of these cases. An anime with an interesting structure of storytelling, character development and how to get everything out of it.Sit back, relax and get...your surgical kit on because you are about to dissect an anime and its meanings as I present to you the anime review for Boogiepop and Others. Lets begin.Story: 7.5/10Set in modern day Japan, the story follows the growing rumours of a mysterious, cloaked figure that deals with all kinds of supernatural events. They call it Boogiepop. A person who only a few people have come into contact with due to them being involved in these supernatural events. They are naturally curious as to why these events happen and what exactly is Boogiepop. With all these events happening, Boogiepop must stop them in order for balance to maintain in this world.The show is very arc focused. Each arc deals with some kind of supernatural phenomenon where a handful of characters get dragged in and eventually run into Boogiepop as it also must deal with these events, although they are dealt with rather disappointingly swift as soon as Boogiepop enters the scene. But you see, this isn\'t some shounun battle anime. This is a mystery thriller and Boogiepop acts as the protector? Maybe? Because you see, there are mysteries that make us theorise and put pieces together in order to make sense of it. Now that could mean that the story could not make sense in general, unless it was intentional. Maybe the show wanted you to go back and re-watch earlier episodes again. But now, you will have a better understanding after watching later episodes. The four arcs are told differently in this regard. Where it is a prequel arc, or an arc that is shown in the wrong order. They tell the story in a way that requires your attention. For some people, it might get them engaged, others might be turned away; which is why the method of storytelling is rather rare. But the fact that it encourages you to re-watch episodes means that its rather unique way of storytelling is rather refreshing. To get me engaged in a story not by a gripping narrative, but by filling out the blanks.Now a good mystery always keeps spoon feeding the viewer answers but still leave some mysteries to keep the viewer engaged. I would say the show manages to do this pretty well. There always seemed to be some kind of answer as to what some of these things mean. The main mysteries of this show are what exactly is Boogiepop, why do these supernatural events keep happening and what is this mysterious Towa Organisation that people keep mentioning. The show did eventually give me answers to most of these mysteries by either saying out loud or by piecing together some events to make more sense out of them. But still, I felt like the show still kept me in the dark with some of these mysteries and I feel like I didn\'t get the answers I was looking for. So it isn\'t all perfect. But it didn\'t deter me from enjoying the overall mystery of this show.Characters: 7/10There are only a handful of characters that appear in multiple arcs but other than that. The characters are rather secluded in their own story. Some of them are just innocents that got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, others are actively finding out the truth about certain events and people to get a sense of closure. I wouldn\'t say that there is really a bad character in this series as they all play their part. They all have their role to fill in the story and even then, if you don\'t like a specific character, chances are they aren\'t going to return in a different arc.Of course, the main character the show focuses on is Boogiepop itself. Since we don\'t know what Boogiepop is exactly, it leaves us to theorise. Is it some kind of genetic experiment that escaped, is it merely just an alter ego, is it simply the supernatural protector of humanity to keep things in the balance or is it some kind of otherworldly creature who sees humanity as precious beings? Okay that last might be a bit ridiculous but you get what I mean. You question what exactly is Boogiepop doing, what is its purpose and where it came from. Only through watching, re-watching and putting pieces together will you get some idea. Although I am disappointed that we don\'t get some clarity on Boogiepop\'s human persona, Touka Miyashita. Is she an alter ego for Boogiepop? is it the other way round? or has she merely been used as a vessel for Boogiepop? We never really find out, even with re-watching some episodes. And considering people have seen Boogiepop\'s face, you would think that they would ask questions for Touka about anything wrong with her and is she okay. But no.Another recurring character is Nagi Kirima as throughout the arcs, we see her whole character progression and how she came to be. Being a rather ""unconventional"" girl due to events from her past and her way of doing things. Nagi is kind of like the non-supernatural version of Boogiepop because, like Boogiepop, she likes to uncover supernatural phenomenons as well; leading to multiple confrontations between Boogiepop and Nagi. I like Nagi in this regard because she has her own sense of keeping balance because of what she experienced in her past, it feels like she is the only one that can do it when Boogiepop is not around. She is prepared, she\'s confident and has a lack of fear for these things. She makes for a nice character to watch how she grows into the Nagi we see present day.Animation: 8.5/10Ahh yes, Madhouse, one the most beloved anime studios of all time. They are known for putting a good budget on an anime to make it look good with fluid animation. While they usually do it in battle centric anime, it doesn\'t mean they can\'t do it in other series. And they have done a good job with this show. While there are moments where Madhouse can flex its muscles and produce some really good looking scenes, what sold me was the show\'s art style. More specifically, the lighting. Now that might sound a bit strange but the lighting in this series is really well done. The way they do sunsets, the lights that illuminate the city. It really does look good. Now the art style in general takes a more different look than the original material, but I would say it still looks good. I wouldn\'t say it looks better, but looks different in a good way. There were times though when characters looked poorly drawn so it isn\'t perfect.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack is rather ominous with a heavy use of techno and minor instrumentals to add to the ambience. It generally plays in the background, adding to the supernatural elements of this show. But that is a good thing and the right thing to do because the music shouldn\'t be a distraction. The focus should be on the story to unravel the mystery. So the music mustn\'t be a distraction. So it doesn\'t use anything bombastic to distract you, but uses more sombre techno music and instrumentals to add the supernatural elements that is going on here. This is especially true when the music sounds like its playing backwards, giving this very creepy vibe.MYTH&ROID have become somewhat of a fan favourite amongst anime viewers. While they haven\'t done much openings, their openings for Re:Zero, Saga of Tanya the Evil and Overlord III are amongst people\'s favourites. So here they come again with another great opening called ""Shadowgraph."" This opening is just fantastic with its ominous music, great vocals, great visuals and well used symbolism highlight Touka not knowing what is going on or about Boogiepop until she embraces it with open arms. Like many other openings this season, its a standout and helps solidify MYTH&ROID as a fan favourite amongst anime viewers.The ending sequence as well is enjoyable, mainly due to its art style being really pretty to look at as well as the fluidity of it all. But the song is also good. ""Whiteout"" by Riko Azuna is another good techno piece that is backed by strong lyrics and a great pace to it all. If it weren\'t for a certain ending sequence from Kaguya-Sama, this would probably be my favourite ending sequence this season.Conclusion:Boogiepop and Others manages to tell an interesting story with plenty of mystery and intrigue to it to keep the viewer watching. Yet it manages to encourage people to re-watch episodes to get a better grasp of the story and the mystery overall. But it is also very niche. Only some people will get the full effect of this show as others will not have time for that and will just take what they get. Which means that this anime could become very divisive in the near future. I for one, think this show is very solid due to its overall mystery, great atmosphere as it invokes a very supernatural atmosphere and with animation and soundtracks that add to a scene. Yet I also know that people will definitely not enjoy this as it is too confusing for them. This leaves me to believe that the episodic, week by week structureof Boogiepop went against it when trying to tell this kind of story. But since all of them have been aired, this isn\'t really an issue now.Boogiepop is a show I would recommend if you are looking for an in-depth Supernatural Mystery show to get your teeth into.My Personal Enjoyment: 7.5/10Overall score: 7.9/10 Recommendation: Consider it your surgical kit on because you are about to dissect an anime and its meanings as I present to you the anime review for Boogiepop and Others. Lets begin.Story: 7.5/10Set in modern day Japan, the story follows the growing rumours of a mysterious, cloaked figure that deals with all kinds of supernatural events. They call it Boogiepop. A person who only a few people have come into contact with due to them being involved in these supernatural events. They are naturally curious as to why these events happen and what exactly is Boogiepop. With all these events happening, Boogiepop must stop them in order for balance to maintain in this world.The show is very arc focused. Each arc deals with some kind of supernatural phenomenon where a handful of characters get dragged in and eventually run into Boogiepop as it also must deal with these events, although they are dealt with rather disappointingly swift as soon as Boogiepop enters the scene. But you see, this isn\'t some shounun battle anime. This is a mystery thriller and Boogiepop acts as the protector? Maybe? Because you see, there are mysteries that make us theorise and put pieces together in order to make sense of it. Now that could mean that the story could not make sense in general, unless it was intentional. Maybe the show wanted you to go back and re-watch earlier episodes again. But now, you will have a better understanding after watching later episodes. The four arcs are told differently in this regard. Where it is a prequel arc, or an arc that is shown in the wrong order. They tell the story in a way that requires your attention. For some people, it might get them engaged, others might be turned away; which is why the method of storytelling is rather rare. But the fact that it encourages you to re-watch episodes means that its rather unique way of storytelling is rather refreshing. To get me engaged in a story not by a gripping narrative, but by filling out the blanks.Now a good mystery always keeps spoon feeding the viewer answers but still leave some mysteries to keep the viewer engaged. I would say the show manages to do this pretty well. There always seemed to be some kind of answer as to what some of these things mean. The main mysteries of this show are what exactly is Boogiepop, why do these supernatural events keep happening and what is this mysterious Towa Organisation that people keep mentioning. The show did eventually give me answers to most of these mysteries by either saying out loud or by piecing together some events to make more sense out of them. But still, I felt like the show still kept me in the dark with some of these mysteries and I feel like I didn\'t get the answers I was looking for. So it isn\'t all perfect. But it didn\'t deter me from enjoying the overall mystery of this show.Characters: 7/10There are only a handful of characters that appear in multiple arcs but other than that. The characters are rather secluded in their own story. Some of them are just innocents that got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, others are actively finding out the truth about certain events and people to get a sense of closure. I wouldn\'t say that there is really a bad character in this series as they all play their part. They all have their role to fill in the story and even then, if you don\'t like a specific character, chances are they aren\'t going to return in a different arc.Of course, the main character the show focuses on is Boogiepop itself. Since we don\'t know what Boogiepop is exactly, it leaves us to theorise. Is it some kind of genetic experiment that escaped, is it merely just an alter ego, is it simply the supernatural protector of humanity to keep things in the balance or is it some kind of otherworldly creature who sees humanity as precious beings? Okay that last might be a bit ridiculous but you get what I mean. You question what exactly is Boogiepop doing, what is its purpose and where it came from. Only through watching, re-watching and putting pieces together will you get some idea. Although I am disappointed that we don\'t get some clarity on Boogiepop\'s human persona, Touka Miyashita. Is she an alter ego for Boogiepop? is it the other way round? or has she merely been used as a vessel for Boogiepop? We never really find out, even with re-watching some episodes. And considering people have seen Boogiepop\'s face, you would think that they would ask questions for Touka about anything wrong with her and is she okay. But no.Another recurring character is Nagi Kirima as throughout the arcs, we see her whole character progression and how she came to be. Being a rather ""unconventional"" girl due to events from her past and her way of doing things. Nagi is kind of like the non-supernatural version of Boogiepop because, like Boogiepop, she likes to uncover supernatural phenomenons as well; leading to multiple confrontations between Boogiepop and Nagi. I like Nagi in this regard because she has her own sense of keeping balance because of what she experienced in her past, it feels like she is the only one that can do it when Boogiepop is not around. She is prepared, she\'s confident and has a lack of fear for these things. She makes for a nice character to watch how she grows into the Nagi we see present day.Animation: 8.5/10Ahh yes, Madhouse, one the most beloved anime studios of all time. They are known for putting a good budget on an anime to make it look good with fluid animation. While they usually do it in battle centric anime, it doesn\'t mean they can\'t do it in other series. And they have done a good job with this show. While there are moments where Madhouse can flex its muscles and produce some really good looking scenes, what sold me was the show\'s art style. More specifically, the lighting. Now that might sound a bit strange but the lighting in this series is really well done. The way they do sunsets, the lights that illuminate the city. It really does look good. Now the art style in general takes a more different look than the original material, but I would say it still looks good. I wouldn\'t say it looks better, but looks different in a good way. There were times though when characters looked poorly drawn so it isn\'t perfect.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack is rather ominous with a heavy use of techno and minor instrumentals to add to the ambience. It generally plays in the background, adding to the supernatural elements of this show. But that is a good thing and the right thing to do because the music shouldn\'t be a distraction. The focus should be on the story to unravel the mystery. So the music mustn\'t be a distraction. So it doesn\'t use anything bombastic to distract you, but uses more sombre techno music and instrumentals to add the supernatural elements that is going on here. This is especially true when the music sounds like its playing backwards, giving this very creepy vibe.MYTH&ROID have become somewhat of a fan favourite amongst anime viewers. While they haven\'t done much openings, their openings for Re:Zero, Saga of Tanya the Evil and Overlord III are amongst people\'s favourites. So here they come again with another great opening called ""Shadowgraph."" This opening is just fantastic with its ominous music, great vocals, great visuals and well used symbolism highlight Touka not knowing what is going on or about Boogiepop until she embraces it with open arms. Like many other openings this season, its a standout and helps solidify MYTH&ROID as a fan favourite amongst anime viewers.The ending sequence as well is enjoyable, mainly due to its art style being really pretty to look at as well as the fluidity of it all. But the song is also good. ""Whiteout"" by Riko Azuna is another good techno piece that is backed by strong lyrics and a great pace to it all. If it weren\'t for a certain ending sequence from Kaguya-Sama, this would probably be my favourite ending sequence this season.Conclusion:Boogiepop and Others manages to tell an interesting story with plenty of mystery and intrigue to it to keep the viewer watching. Yet it manages to encourage people to re-watch episodes to get a better grasp of the story and the mystery overall. But it is also very niche. Only some people will get the full effect of this show as others will not have time for that and will just take what they get. Which means that this anime could become very divisive in the near future. I for one, think this show is very solid due to its overall mystery, great atmosphere as it invokes a very supernatural atmosphere and with animation and soundtracks that add to a scene. Yet I also know that people will definitely not enjoy this as it is too confusing for them. This leaves me to believe that the episodic, week by week structureof Boogiepop went against it when trying to tell this kind of story. But since all of them have been aired, this isn\'t really an issue now.Boogiepop is a show I would recommend if you are looking for an in-depth Supernatural Mystery show to get your teeth into.My Personal Enjoyment: 7.5/10Overall score: 7.9/10 Recommendation: Consider it', 'First of all before giving a review.To the people who are planning to watch,are currently watching or dropped it halfway.Please for the love of anime, be very patient with this series,because its really worth itBoogiepop is adapted from the novel/manga and not original like the 2000 boogiepop series)Its a psychological,Horror series which is shrouded in mystery and revolves around a enigmatic supernatural entity known as boogiepop,which possesses one of our MC\'s miyashita touka.Boogiepop though rumored to target and murder people in a really mysterious way is actuallyis a guardian who awakens and manifests itself when the world is in danger or an enemy appears,enemy...that is in the eyes of Boogiepop.The reason being this series can slow paced and confusing at times,you will be like ""What just happened,who\'s this,what does that even mean"",but that\'s the beauty of this series, its like a beautiful puzzle which viewers cannot envision at first but when it comes together,that to whenit does it comes in a amazing fast paced manner,it just hits and blows your mind over literally.This show focuses on theme and meaning of humanity in various spectrum.From the beautiful,mysterious side of humans to the dark and disgusting side.It has different arcs which starts with random scenes and characters on which light is shed much later which mostly revealed to be related to a new enemyand threat which is constantly at play at a psychological degree which begins at a personal level, slowing growing to social and global scale,through variousmediums including  unfathomable chain reactions of character interaction and conversations.Each different arc every time has a majority of new characters with some of the original main cast constantly involved.But the best part is each time when a new character enters with a new arc,almost every single one of them has a interesting personality,characterand a decent backstory,which makes it more intriguing to watch & keeps the viewers attention hooked.Also the characters are not only backed up by their words about who they are but by actions too, and i am talking about really good and surprising fighting and action choreography,which for a psychological horror animes was really a feast for my eyes.There are really good badass characters in this show, one of favorites would be Nagi,one of the main cast.Her character, with her backstory and development really caught my eye and madeher one of the most interesting characters.One of the best parts which i myself personally find is even though the series revolves around,boogiepop makes the least appearance, while the other characters play out their partin the episodes and the arc in a proper fashion while boogiepop enters as a savior at the last moments with its beautiful yet mysterious dialogues which will just mesmerize you.Another reason why boogiepops dialogues are beautiful is the fact the amazing script and even more amazing and breathtaking Voice acting of Yuki Aoi. I could listen to boogiepops likean ASMR over and over, its that addictive. Hats off to her.During this show, with every episode i just find myself getting totally lost and immersed in the world this series presents,i just love how its made including the characters.The narrative structure,its like we are presented with different pieces of story at different points in time that get pieced together gradually. It creates a nice mystery to her as well.The ideology,the mindset of humanity, how every scene and conversations between characters just plays with the viewers mind in a complex but beautiful manner, the concept/message from thebuild up period to the finishing of each arc and episode just pure guilty pleasure for a mature audience.Another thing i am glad to see the horror aspects is done with specific scenarios and very mild gore element which can at times spook and take the audience by surprise.Animation wise, Madhouse has done a really good work on this series.The character designs and animation pretty well fit the aesthetics of the show.It mostly reminds me of Parasyte maxim, another great horror show,so you kinda understand what i am talking about. Its really well done. Only problem i had was sometimes i had trouble sometimes distinguishing characters,as most of the designs were quite closely similar.Other than that setting of show, the background sceneries with its slightly dark, but tranquil element captures the atmosphere in high levels.The production and filter usage also were quite top grade.The sound/OST is another great part of this series.Starting off with OP and ED,especially the OP ""Shadowgraph"" arguably the Best Op of this season and my personal favorite,Myth and roid again with a home run with a beautiful and breathtaking track.Every time i hear it gives my a tranquil feeling and giving me goosebumps at the same time,its that good. ED also quite satisfying to listen to and fits well.The OST\'s and background music is just great and well adapts to the story line and scenarios,while giving the feel of mysterious, tension and bit of horror, also during the fight and climax scenesit picks up the pace, while giving a chill and tranquil vibe during amazing and deep conversations between characters.Also as i mentioned earlier Voice actors have performed well and given justice character,especially Yukii Aoi with Boogiepop,her calm and soothing voice for boogipop is eargasm for my ears literally.The studio and staff just delivered a great package to the viewers.Coming to the end of the review,i would say this is the underrated show of the season,people have been dropping it due to slow pacing and the confusion the plot causes at the start,but are not patientfor it to unfold in an amazing manner which is the unique selling point of this show.It needs immense focus at times but its worth it and i could say its quite a masterpiece in its own way.We might not have another boogiepop, its that unique and kind of a gift from the anime industry to the mature audiences.Watching this show,it really made me realize how much I miss watching a good horror/psychological story, no wonder this series is so beloved and influential towards other LN\'s.This show needs more recognition and appreciation. Really highly recommended. that is in the eyes of Boogiepop.The reason being this series can slow paced and confusing at times,you will be like ""What just happened,who\'s this,what does that even mean"",but that\'s the beauty of this series, its like a beautiful puzzle which viewers cannot envision at first but when it comes together,that to whenit does it comes in a amazing fast paced manner,it just hits and blows your mind over literally.This show focuses on theme and meaning of humanity in various spectrum.From the beautiful,mysterious side of humans to the dark and disgusting side.It has different arcs which starts with random scenes and characters on which light is shed much later which mostly revealed to be related to a new enemyand threat which is constantly at play at a psychological degree which begins at a personal level, slowing growing to social and global scale,through variousmediums including  unfathomable chain reactions of character interaction and conversations.Each different arc every time has a majority of new characters with some of the original main cast constantly involved.But the best part is each time when a new character enters with a new arc,almost every single one of them has a interesting personality,characterand a decent backstory,which makes it more intriguing to watch & keeps the viewers attention hooked.Also the characters are not only backed up by their words about who they are but by actions too, and i am talking about really good and surprising fighting and action choreography,which for a psychological horror animes was really a feast for my eyes.There are really good badass characters in this show, one of favorites would be Nagi,one of the main cast.Her character, with her backstory and development really caught my eye and madeher one of the most interesting characters.One of the best parts which i myself personally find is even though the series revolves around,boogiepop makes the least appearance, while the other characters play out their partin the episodes and the arc in a proper fashion while boogiepop enters as a savior at the last moments with its beautiful yet mysterious dialogues which will just mesmerize you.Another reason why boogiepops dialogues are beautiful is the fact the amazing script and even more amazing and breathtaking Voice acting of Yuki Aoi.

It\'s truly a shame, this was the series I was most hyped for this anime season and it turned out to be my least favourite.I went into this show 100% blind so I cant say anything about how true it is to the source material.The thing is, just because story telling is non-linear doesn\'t suddenly make it genius. I wouldn\'t put this to the same level as shows like serial experiments lain, baccano! and the monogatari series. All very different shows but each with the non linear...story telling format which beckons the audience to attempt put the pieces together.Here there was a mystery...I guess? I couldn\'t seem to care about it. I couldn\'t seem to care about anything. the characters are extremely bland and I cant seem to gain interest in any of them. The plot was equally uninteresting, at the end of each episode I couldn\'t find myself thinking ""ooh i wonder what happened next!"" I just didnt care at all. This series failed to evoke any emotions from me at all. Happy, sad, angry, curious. No, I was just bored.The character designs are also very poor. Boogiepop has a unique outfit but each character looks too similar to each other, and once again bland. Its a common complaint ive seen that people keep mixing up the characters and I have to agree.It might once again have to do with the fact that each character is so unreasonably boring.The best way to watch the series is by watching the OP and then skipping to the ED. Because nothing in the middle really matters. story telling format which beckons the audience to attempt put the pieces together.Here there was a mystery...I guess? I couldn\'t seem to care about it.

Based on the four episodes I have seen so far, Boogiepop is somewhat of a mix between these two anime and has a lot of potential. The non-linear storytelling keeps you on your toes as you try to piece together the overarching plot.What are some specific things I like? I like stories that don\'t treat their viewers like small children. Boogiepop doesn\'t disappoint in that sense. There are no useless side characters whose sole purpose it is to explain the plot to the viewer. The opening and ending music is great...(if you like Myth & Roid, which I do). The voice acting is incredibly authentic in some scenes, and even the ""worst"" performances are believable. The soundtrack fits perfectly. Not only does the music build tension but it inspires you to ponder the secrets of life. It is more mellow than the Parasyte and Durarara! soundtracks.The horror aspect seems lacking in my opinion, but that may be because I have immunity to fear related debuffs. Still, you can probably watch Boogiepop at night even if you get scared easily. It does not heavily employ jumpscares. Also, the character development is slow and in some cases missing due to the non-linear plot. However, it is not significantly detrimental to overall enjoyment.Finally, you may notice that my review rating and my personal rating are different. I try to rate reviews objectively, and my personal rating is how much I personally enjoyed the series. (if you like Myth & Roid, which I do).

This anime adapts it\'s source material at such a fast pace that all the nuance and character moments are lost. The first Boogiepop book was full of inner dialogue and had 6 different narrators that saw a central event through different lenses. The beauty of Boogiepop is learning about these narrators and how they view life and what they think is ""normal"" and then seeing how they react to supernatural occurrences. The anime adapts this first book in 3 episodes and completely lacks inner dialogue. So, the anime feels pretentious with characters spouting out haughty lines with little...to no context. Because of this the first episode was kinda boring and up it\'s own ass. Not to mention the anime literally cuts out the most interesting narrator completely, essentially leaving one of my favorite characters in the first book, Kamikishiro, a husk of her book counterpart.Then there\'s the production. It looks bad. Animation is lackluster and not very plentiful while characters look bland. They completely changed the character designs from the light novels. Even the light novel and manga adaptation artist went on twitter to complain about these character designs. Characters are also often drawn with no face which really bothers me.The action animation is sometimes decent and sometimes laughably bad. The rotoscope looking fight scene of episode 3 was so just weird looking I couldnt help but laugh. However, The music from Kensuke Ushio (Liz Blue Bird, Devilman Crybaby), the op/ed, and Yuuki Aoi\'s voice acting is probably the best part of the show. Also there\'s weird directing with a lot of cutting from a scene with swelling music straight to silence in another scene which throws me off and annoys me every time it happens.I wouldn\'t recommend watching this as all it\'ll do is spoil the amazing novels in an unsatisfactory way. I\'m not saying you can\'t enjoy the show, I\'m sure plenty of people who like a nonlinear mystery story could find it interesting, but as a reader of the light novels I just can\'t see this as anything but an uninspired butchering of a classic series. I usually dislike the whole ""read the manga"" stereotype but for real, the difference is night and day when it comes to the Boogiepop Anime vs Light Novels. to no context.

You\'re probably better off reading the books.Relies too heavily on dialogue for telling the plot and not showing the plot. If all the dialogue is poorly-hidden exposition for a plot that would otherwise be impossible to understand, you need to reconsider whether or not this story should be adapted into a visual medium such as anime. The story is probably good, but impossible to tell as it is all explained by characters whilst events seem to be occurring behind the scenes for uncertain reasons.Between 12.50 and 14.08 in the second episode, you...will hear some of the laziest dialogue I think I have ever heard in an anime (bar Speed Racer). I transcribed it all and read it back to myself to get the full impression of how lazy it was. It sounded like bad fanfiction.For example (I\'ve edited to make it spoiler free):“You mean we’ll be able to get those guys who’re trying to get me because I’m a X, right?”This is a cheap shortcut. It\'s also just not how people talk to each other. If the person she was talking to already knew that she was being targetted because she was a ""X"", then a simple ""Oh great, so we can get back at those guys?"" would have sufficed. If Boogiepop is going for a naturalistic, magic-realism style, the dialogue too should fit this description. I actually thought that some of the characters were possibly androids/aliens because of their stunted and overly descriptive dialogue style.The story has not been properly adapted into the animated format, so it succumbs to lazy storytelling through exposition, which in turn sacrifices the credibility and individuality of the characters. Again, should this have been made into an anime? Moreover, the characters all suffer with same-face. I was perpetually mixing up the two main female AND the two main male characters, and I watch anime regularly, I\'m not a newbie (not to mention I work and research in this field). The main characters, even when all in uniform, should be distinct against one another.On the topic of indistinguishable main characters, the animation is cheap, frequently making use of panning and zoom shots (of still images) to fill time. Additionally there is an overuse of boil animation to show trembling or emotion, in almost every scene, making all characters seem as though they are perpetually emotionally unsettled. Even if this is the case, there are many ways to show nervousness in a character without using a boil technique.A good anime will always visually show the viewer important information instead of engineering it into poor dialogue for the purpose of explaining the plot - but this probably costs too much money. This isn\'t just in episode 2, it\'s across all three first episodes which I wasted my free time watching. Shame, I usually love MadHouse.I\'ll try a few more episodes because it seems to be trying something new, but probably won\'t stick with it.Three points for awesome music/foley sounds, voice actors, Boogiepop\'s character design, and opening sequence. will hear some of the laziest dialogue I think I have ever heard in an anime (bar Speed Racer). I transcribed it all and read it back to myself to get the full impression of how lazy it was.

I was perpetually mixing up the two main female AND the two main male characters, and I watch anime regularly, I\'m not a newbie (not to mention I work and research in this field). The main characters, even when all in uniform, should be distinct against one another.On the topic of indistinguishable main characters, the animation is cheap, frequently making use of panning and zoom shots (of still images) to fill time. Additionally there is an overuse of boil animation to show trembling or emotion, in almost every scene, making all characters seem as though they are perpetually emotionally unsettled. Even if this is the case, there are many ways to show nervousness in a character without using a boil technique.A good anime will always visually show the viewer important information instead of engineering it into poor dialogue for the purpose of explaining the plot - but this probably costs too much money. This isn\'t just in episode 2, it\'s across all three first episodes which I wasted my free time watching. Shame, I usually love MadHouse.I\'ll try a few more episodes because it seems to be trying something new, but probably won\'t stick with it.Three points for awesome music/foley sounds, voice actors, Boogiepop\'s character design, and opening sequence.', ""The only reason I feel compelled to write a review is because based on reading others, I truly don't know if I missed something or watched a different show. There's a difference between skilled nonlinear storytelling to build intrigue and just dropping information out of order for the sake of novelty. It's just a bad story but out of order. The show was so sloppy, had so many stories peter out into lame dead ends, and spent most of the dialogue spouting stiff self-serious nonsense. I love introspective and abstract media, this is just not it.Something that I feel is never mentioned is the...relationship to the trailer. WHY was the trailer so much cooler than the actual show?? Why did they animate separate footage that was completely unrelated to the story?? Who was the fire skating wizard??? Is there a secret I don't know about??? Please help.There's so many distinctly bad episodes that even on a second watch with an understanding of the plot, I can't even begin to fathom characters justification for their actions. Nobody acts like a person. The first episode is hot garbage. I love hearing about potentials that might be happening off screen but are still too vague to know why the even matter for 20 minutes. The girl who is also Boogiepop may as well not be a character, her only purpose is to be an arbitrary connection to the other students where all this crAaAzYy stuff is happening, despite her not contributing anything. The way that magic or aliens or whatever operates in this world is so incredible fuzzy I wish they had said 'because fairies.' Magical realism can be so compelling if you don't use ambiguous magic as a weird crutch to wrap up story lines.There is the rare occasion where someone says something that could maybe provoke a singular thought, but not nearly enough to justify the stale exposition or philosophizing that goes on for majority of the show. I can't reflect on things that have no anchor in reality. So many of the storytelling choices were so strange or weird, I'm not sure if I should be blaming the source material or the adaptation, but I'll leave the original alone out of courtesy and ignorance.I hate this show. It haunts me. Nothing makes sense. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but I have to live with these memories now and I'll never forgive them for that.If you enjoyed this show, you are valid and I'm jealous I can't have fun with you. relationship to the trailer.

I\'m reviewing this at the conclusion of the third ""arc"" because I do think I\'ve got a grasp on the anime as a whole.Art 7/10The big attention getter is the art and animation, the PV and other aspects led to this anime getting SUPER hyped before it was released, which has, inevitably, effected my impression. Although action episodes are rather spaced out the base line of quality is there,...and the action is generally pretty entertaining, there are integral flaws that i\'ll get back to when discussing characters though.Story & characters 3/10 & 4/10There are 2 major issues with the script, forced achronological order and super dark moments that absolutely don\'t fit except to help prop up the unearned ""psychological"" tag.So my theory is that the biggest contributor to the writing, its hard to tell with several directors and character designers, was very character focused. writing out a few really strong characters and then trying to tie them together with a bunch of less well thought out characters in the spirit of other zanier and less serious action sci-fantasy.Speculation aside the result is, very few characters you\'re endeared to and a lot you really couldn\'t care less about. It doesn\'t help that the writer can only do like 2 types of personalities (a variation of stoic and an obsessive). They come together in a messy arc with very straightforward, to the point of killing suspension of disbelief, themes.Everyone is always on the same psychological page, characters praise each other for their wit and intelligence, you can practically see the writer patting themself on the back with every cringe moment in the dialogue. Its a wonder that this work can be called psychological when each arc is pretty much just one cardboard cutout delivering yet another ""reason you suck (or alternatively their hope in death)"" speech to other cardboard cut outs.It also doesn\'t help that the action episodes always use a mix of mind control, electricity, and super strength (boogiepop the only exception) to get over what always ends up being a violent confrontation, all justified due to some overbearing organization.I could go on but I think I\'ve already rambled enoughIn the end, if you like light novels that are super dialogue heavy, or are just getting into anime, this has a lot of what you might like. Its tries to be really clever and the ""twists"" might actually have some meaning to you. Otherwise its just another edgy flick. and the action is generally pretty entertaining, there are integral flaws that i\'ll get back to when discussing characters though.Story & characters 3/10 & 4/10There are 2 major issues with the script, forced achronological order and super dark moments that absolutely don\'t fit except to help prop up the unearned ""psychological"" tag.So my theory is that the biggest contributor to the writing, its hard to tell with several directors and character designers, was very character focused. writing out a few really strong characters and then trying to tie them together with a bunch of less well thought out characters in the spirit of other zanier and less serious action sci-fantasy.Speculation aside the result is, very few characters you\'re endeared to and a lot you really couldn\'t care less about.

Otherwise its just another edgy flick.', 'Boogiepop is a DC Universe comic about a girl who becomes a superhero after being bitten by a radioactive private detective. Unfortunately, she has a terminal case of chuunibyou, so she dresses in a ridiculous outfit, speaks in a weird voice, whistles a random Wagner melody she once overheard on the radio and spouts the typical chuuni nonsense like “so this is the will of the world” and “I’m the terror that flaps in the night.” There are other people with superpowers, who all want to make the world a better place, usually by killing or brainwashing everyone, so she’s not so bad in comparison....There is a mysterious organization whose stated goal is to prevent the emergence of said superpowered freaks, except everything they do achieves the exact opposite - a scalding and totally intentional satire of the ineffectual nonprofits and NGOs that do nothing but create lofty jobs for moral busybodies. There is a guest appearance by Batman, who’s a waifu, because anime. Also, there is a random non-sequitur alien, because JoJo has a random non-sequitur alien, and everyone must know that the author loves JoJo.If that synopsis doesn’t strike you as very accurate, it’s about as good as everything you hear about this series. Boogiepop employs a convoluted non-linear structure, which, actually, is the best thing about it. Unfortunately, a big chunk of the audience finds it 2confusing4me and another big chunk thinks convoluted equals profound. In its essence, Boogiepop is a cheesy urban fantasy with on-the-nose social commentary about 1990s Japanese society plus some cool mystery elements. It’s also an anime adaptation of a series of books. I’d like to elaborate on the social commentary, mystery and adaptation aspects.The problem with doing social/political commentary is that it risks becoming outdated very, very fast, and this is exactly what happens here. For example, one of the plotlines (in the original book) involves a gay teen who can’t process feelings he has for another guy because he literally doesn’t know what “gay” is. How plausible does that sound in the Current Year? The anime does a good job of addressing such narrative problems, but that, in turn, attracts ire of the source material readers doing their usual “they’ve changed it, now it sucks” routine. Also, the social commentary here is quite hamfisted to begin with. Said teen is then brainwashed into essentially being a robot, and given an instruction to “await further orders without attracting any attention.” Because he was originally a delinquent, this makes him no longer skip school or get into fights, which prompts all adults around to commend how he has now reformed into a good, productive member of society. Gee, I wonder if there is some sort of message here. It’s only natural, though. Don’t we all have profound conversations with strangers that conveniently fit whatever narrative our author is preaching? That’s just how life works.Like I said, mystery is a good part of this show. Here is how a typical Boogiepop arc is structured: The first episode begins in medias res, throwing a bunch of characters and supernatural concepts at you, as well as posing some conflict. You’d expect it to dial back to the start and provide some explanations next, but the story instead throws in even more characters and concepts, and there are probably at least two plotlines developing in parallel. It seems overwhelming, but the last episode of the arc actually ties up all the loose ends neatly, providing the necessary answers (key word is “necessary”, doesn’t mean it spoon-feeds you). The plot never tries to be confusing just for the sake of being confusing, there are plenty of things with the sole purpose of helping the viewer to keep up. For example, there is a scene of a character smoking a specific pack of cigarettes shown three times from three different angles just to establish which events happen in what order. The show challenges you to pay attention and appropriately rewards you for doing so. Unfortunately, the non-linear structure kinda fizzles out in the second half of the season, making it less enjoyable.My last point is that Boogiepop originally is a series of books. This, however, is an anime, and anime are not books. It seems to me that a lot of source material readers struggle to understand that concept. Books can be long. Books can have dozens of plot points explained entirely through narration. Books can be written 20 years ago - the outdated social commentary point. Anime, however, has these things called “episode length”, “pacing”, “show, don’t tell” and “not putting your audience to sleep”. Most criticism I’ve heard coming from disgruntled source material readers is about how this Background Character B should have had two episodes worth of backstory, or how they’ve cut this very important “the guy walks alone for an entire chapter, thinking about stuff” moment. So, if you’ve heard this anime is bad because it is a bad adaptation - that’s uninformed nonsense. Considering the narration-heavy nature of the source, it is adapted about as well as it could’ve possibly been adapted by someone whose name isn’t Oishi Tatsuya and whose studio isn’t SHAFT. If we’re talking about medium-specific things - the animation is not exactly sakuga material, but it competently does its storytelling job. For example, the first big fight looks goofy out of context, but it perfectly sells the narrative point that the fighters in question are supernatural monsters that only look like humans, who obey neither limitations of human anatomy nor gravity. The voice acting of Boogiepop and the OP/ED songs are the high points of the production.5/10 for a mystery show with some fun to be found, as long as you bother to pay attention and don’t mind anvilicious preaching (or Pokemon-level artistic license on evolution).

And one thing I will say that how marvelously opening of the anime foreshadows upcoming events is is just flawless. Touka rin is the opposite off the Boogiepop, but she (spoiler alert) is the boogiepop unbeknownst to her. She not knowing that she has (spoiler alert) dual personalty disorder makes things even more interesting, because that is why we see two sides of the single person who are nothing like each-other. This...take on philosophical thoughts is nothing new but boogiepop does things this in a subtle way, things are not that grandiose and everything happens in a small town.Animation on this anime is also something to be praised, and that animation is just beautiful too look at. And you expect nothing less from a guy who directed one punch man. There is a filter or over-lay on anime this anime, which quit catches the over-all mood of the show pretty nicely and that kind small touch is most welcome.Its a philosophical anime but some what differs from the norm, I think you will like it if you plan to it though. take on philosophical thoughts is nothing new but boogiepop does things this in a subtle way, things are not that grandiose and everything happens in a small town.Animation on this anime is also something to be praised, and that animation is just beautiful too look at.

From there we see how these powers and the world, as well as the leading character Boogiepop—a product of these new divergent ""powers"" itself—interact with one another,...with the abilities often being complex and powerful, and with the people, and reality, often changing with them. Due to this, more often than not these powers need to be \'overcome\' by humanity, with each case—other than Boogiepop and a select handful of recurring characters—introducing a new set of characters affected by the power, whose task is to overcome it. The presentation of each case is often non-linear, requiring at least some attention to make sense of, but with a fairly typical story structure despite that—with always a clear beginning, middle, and end.What makes Boogiepop as a story so special and great to me, is that in this world full of such mystical and grand characters, powers, and organizations, it always just comes down to the common people rising above to overcome the threats faced. Despite what it might look like initially, \'Boogiepop\' the character, however powerful they may seem, is quite literally a phantom within the plot itself—without ever really having much of a defining impact on the world or result themselves. They are only ever there so much as an emphasis and guide for the ordinary, everyday human characters of the story to shine and do their part, and to highlight their greatness and potential. It always invariably ends up relying on them, and their actions and qualities.Even with all its dark themes and world—and most of its themes are dark—at its heart \'Boogiepop *and Others* \' as a story is ultimately very optimistic. It\'s a celebration of humanity and our \'possibility\'. On the surface, the author does depict humanity ""evolving"" with these fantastical new powers and abilities, but it is ultimately always in the mundane yet concerted, ordinary and human-achievable actions through which they are overcome, and through which we truly \'evolve\' and move forward as a species. Those powers, much like Boogiepop, only serve to bring these out and shine a light on what is otherwise very grounded human feats.I\'d recommend ignoring the ratings and giving this show a try if this sounds interesting to you, or if you especially love amazing soundtracks (courtesy of Kensuke Ushio of Devilman Crybaby, A Silent Voice, and Ping Pong the Animation fame), heavy atmosphere, and thoughtful, moving thematic exploration. This show isn\'t designed to be loud, flashy, or mass-appealing—the beloved cult-classic Boogiepop novels aren\'t that kind of story—the heights and climaxes of the story are built slowly, often in a non-linear fashion, and are only really going to be rewarding if you\'re following the themes and can empathize with the characters and ideas they present. For me, it was and is a highly rewarding, unique, and emotive show, beautiful in the passion of its writing and execution—and extremely rewatchable with all its amazingly developed thematic peaks and moments.It\'s that type of show you find yourself replaying tracks and moments of, weeks, months—even years after. Certain moments and stories from this I can\'t see myself ever forgetting to be honest. It\'s been over four years now since I first watched it, and I\'m still passionate enough to write this review on another revisit._________________________________________________________-- slight spoiler talk follows from here, where I rant in torrential form, but minor detail, about one of my favourite arcs --__________________________________________________________Perhaps my favourite episodes and story in this, and that which I feel reflects the series\' best, is that of episodes 10 to 13. The arc involves two \'synthetic humans\'—\'tools\' of an organization used to carry out their dirty work, and search for and subsequently eliminate threats—reaching self-realization as they come to critical points in their lives, where the growing \'bugs\' of guilt, doubt and questioning inside them overwhelm and threaten to blossom. It shows us the critical events in their history leading up to this, and the humans that changed them; the humans they killed, and were sent to kill, as well as, in the end—their defining moments—and the humans they save. It is a story that contrasts some of the best of us coming to be the worst, with the worst of us coming to be the best, in each of the characters\' defining moments. It focuses on the messiness of us as beings—and the potential beauty that such things as guilt, regret, and otherwise minor interactions and interrelated events can come to lead to. The unpredictable causal chain of our lives that can lead us from the best to the worst, and from the worst to the best, giving the ever-present chance for us to aspire and grow, and to change directions as people—rising above circumstance history—and achieving a new definition in the story of our lives. How such a simple thing as Nagi Kirima\'s brief but sincere words of enthusiasm and support to Scarecrow, and his aspiration of becoming a crime-tackling hero, can further sprout an invisible but infinitely entangled and complex series of events that end up affecting every character\'s path in the story.*“Would you be able to cast your regret aside and return again? Return to the moment when your heart was at its most beautiful?”*It\'s an incredibly heartfelt and emotive story, and what Scarecrow, and later Mo Murder both come to do in this arc, and the place they get to, represents the most beautiful thing in the world and of us humans to me. In but two such short, brief moments, all their development, history, and lives as synthetic humans come to a head, and they each achieve the most human of acts—they opt for  danger and self-sacrifice for the sake and rescue of another. To do such an otherwise illogical and risky, but *good* thing for another; all in a situation where the other party will likely never even learn about or appreciate it—or they likely won\'t live through to see it blossom in any way. And to get to that result—and not regret it or the loss of everything in your final moments...It reflects us rising above our urges, instincts and base desires. We as animals. To act in such a way against our very selves and self-preserving nature. No other being in the world can manage this, certainly for what\'s little more than a stranger—it is our gift alone. And we with all our intelligence and sentience so rarely manage to achieve anything close. But rarely, every so often, we do manage it.It must be when we listen to that little \'bug\' inside, no matter how small and crushed down it may have gotten over the years, that just wants to do and be something good for another like us. The chance doesn’t come around often, if at all for most of our lives, but when it does—and we manage it—it can only be when our hearts are at their most beautiful point. When we \'break through\' and become something more than just the sum of our animal parts and our history—where our sentience, will and humanity are realized in but a moment. When we do something just for the intangible concept that is the principle.Sure, there are plenty of stories with characters and much greater \'heroes\' in them that put others before themselves, as well as sacrifice themselves. Such a thing isn\'t very unique to this story. But here, it is made especially profound and emotive as with both characters\' stories, you see every beat that leads them to their resolutions, where they start from—very low; flawed and morally troubled, chained to the orders of an organization—and where they end up. That \'bug\' inside them growing and steering more and more their actions.Nothing especially ""big"", different, or dramatic ever happens to the characters to change or set them on this course either. Just a long series of small events, thoughts, interactions, words... It isn\'t clean—their heroism—and certainly not very \'cool\' to watch, it\'s quick and messy, and there\'s not really a happy ending to be found in the story either. There\'s even a struggle with regret and doubt after said heroic acts. And neither manages to \'absolve\' themselves in the story or any of the things they did wrong and the crimes they committed... But it is in this messiness and harsh reality, and in seeing their journeys and inner turmoil play out that something extremely believable and compelling is found. Something that sticks out and stays.It is often said that without fear there is no bravery, or—the more fear that exists, the chance for greater amounts of bravery—and I think that logic holds for acts of greatness and heroism as well. Great characters achieving and doing heroic things is... great, but to write terribly flawed and damaged characters achieving heroic things, and showing that journey believably, I think, is much more special a thing, and Boogiepop does it perfectly here.*“Humans do not possess a single, focused will. They just have countless bugs buzzing around in all directions inside their hearts. It\'s fine when all these bugs are headed toward the same meal as one, but when they split apart... People take actions that can only be described as incoherent.”*There are countless cases one could learn about, throughout all the great conflicts, depressions, and tragedies of history, where everyday people, assuredly flawed people, manage to break through our nature and achieve this, and undoubtedly countless more forever untold; locked away in the everyday noise, or the long and unseen history of the world. Ordinary people sheltering the persecuted and knowingly facing death and torture for it, people running into fires, and firefighters running up burning skyscrapers... Teachers shielding their students with their own bodies, and soldiers jumping over grenades just to save their comrades and friends... Starving brothers giving the last morsel to their starving sisters, and personnel going down with ship or reactor, just to save and protect as many as they can in the role that only they could fill...If there is a God—or an audience of our experience out there—I am sure this is when they are their most proud, shocked, or affected. Like you or me, who watched the brief stories of \'Scarecrow\' and \'Mo Murder\'. It is where our souls and characters are truly seen and shining. A soul developed bit by bit over a lifetime, achieving definition in one tiny, beautiful moment, with the decision to do away with self-preservation, the fundamental law for all life, and to hurt or lose ourselves for another like us. These events are not fiction, flukes, or one-off anomalies, and such transcendent beauty is an irrefutable possibility within each of us. Even in the worst and most hopeless among us—as were the characters of Scarecrow and Mo Murder.If we could control time, and observe with our own eyes our history - the lives of these people, and these events, would surely be the most impactful. It is where I would go. How many journeys would it take, I wonder—being confronted with and seeing first-hand those undeniable acts of purity—to believe and love in all of life and humanity.I think, just one...The \'Boogiepop and Others\' story, as mentioned previously, is about the greatness of humanity. And nowhere does it achieve this focus and message as perfectly as in this arc for me. If nothing else, I am sure the story of these characters and the themes of Boogiepop will stick with me for a long while still. Though I feel I could just as well rant about the other stories and themes of Boogiepop and Others. They are all explored in such a satisfying and rewarding way correlating to the amount of attention you give it, with the right amounts of subtlety and scope to never come across as heavy-handed or convoluted. The ideas presented and the messages contained always feel perfectly complete by the end of their respective arcs, with compelling presentation and, in my opinion, very profound and memorable conclusions. It is a great feat of the writing to be so compellingly positive in such an otherwise dark and murky story and world, with so few if any \'happy\' endings or especially \'good\' characters.In a world now so chock-full of stories and shows of superpowers, heroes, and heroic feats, I think \'Boogiepop and Others\' remains truly special. It achieves the same exciting displays of power, intriguing mystery, and excitingly dangerous \'villains\' and bad guys, but not very far into its heart does it do away with all of it, choosing to focus on none of it, and it is much more special for this—with a far more powerful, memorable, and motivating sense of positivity and hope than just about any other \'super\' story out there. with the abilities often being complex and powerful, and with the people, and reality, often changing with them. Due to this, more often than not these powers need to be \'overcome\' by humanity, with each case—other than Boogiepop and a select handful of recurring characters—introducing a new set of characters affected by the power, whose task is to overcome it. The presentation of each case is often non-linear, requiring at least some attention to make sense of, but with a fairly typical story structure despite that—with always a clear beginning, middle, and end.What makes Boogiepop as a story so special and great to me, is that in this world full of such mystical and grand characters, powers, and organizations, it always just comes down to the common people rising above to overcome the threats faced. Despite what it might look like initially, \'Boogiepop\' the character, however powerful they may seem, is quite literally a phantom within the plot itself—without ever really having much of a defining impact on the world or result themselves. They are only ever there so much as an emphasis and guide for the ordinary, everyday human characters of the story to shine and do their part, and to highlight their greatness and potential. It always invariably ends up relying on them, and their actions and qualities.Even with all its dark themes and world—and most of its themes are dark—at its heart \'Boogiepop *and Others* \' as a story is ultimately very optimistic. It\'s a celebration of humanity and our \'possibility\'. On the surface, the author does depict humanity ""evolving"" with these fantastical new powers and abilities, but it is ultimately always in the mundane yet concerted, ordinary and human-achievable actions through which they are overcome, and through which we truly \'evolve\' and move forward as a species. Those powers, much like Boogiepop, only serve to bring these out and shine a light on what is otherwise very grounded human feats.I\'d recommend ignoring the ratings and giving this show a try if this sounds interesting to you, or if you especially love amazing soundtracks (courtesy of Kensuke Ushio of Devilman Crybaby, A Silent Voice, and Ping Pong the Animation fame), heavy atmosphere, and thoughtful, moving thematic exploration. This show isn\'t designed to be loud, flashy, or mass-appealing—the beloved cult-classic Boogiepop novels aren\'t that kind of story—the heights and climaxes of the story are built slowly, often in a non-linear fashion, and are only really going to be rewarding if you\'re following the themes and can empathize with the characters and ideas they present. For me, it was and is a highly rewarding, unique, and emotive show, beautiful in the passion of its writing and execution—and extremely rewatchable with all its amazingly developed thematic peaks and moments.It\'s that type of show you find yourself replaying tracks and moments of, weeks, months—even years after. Certain moments and stories from this I can\'t see myself ever forgetting to be honest. It\'s been over four years now since I first watched it, and I\'m still passionate enough to write this review on another revisit._________________________________________________________-- slight spoiler talk follows from here, where I rant in torrential form, but minor detail, about one of my favourite arcs --__________________________________________________________Perhaps my favourite episodes and story in this, and that which I feel reflects the series\' best, is that of episodes 10 to 13. The arc involves two \'synthetic humans\'—\'tools\' of an organization used to carry out their dirty work, and search for and subsequently eliminate threats—reaching self-realization as they come to critical points in their lives, where the growing \'bugs\' of guilt, doubt and questioning inside them overwhelm and threaten to blossom. It shows us the critical events in their history leading up to this, and the humans that changed them; the humans they killed, and were sent to kill, as well as, in the end—their defining moments—and the humans they save. It is a story that contrasts some of the best of us coming to be the worst, with the worst of us coming to be the best, in each of the characters\' defining moments. It focuses on the messiness of us as beings—and the potential beauty that such things as guilt, regret, and otherwise minor interactions and interrelated events can come to lead to. The unpredictable causal chain of our lives that can lead us from the best to the worst, and from the worst to the best, giving the ever-present chance for us to aspire and grow, and to change directions as people—rising above circumstance history—and achieving a new definition in the story of our lives. How such a simple thing as Nagi Kirima\'s brief but sincere words of enthusiasm and support to Scarecrow, and his aspiration of becoming a crime-tackling hero, can further sprout an invisible but infinitely entangled and complex series of events that end up affecting every character\'s path in the story.*“Would you be able to cast your regret aside and return again? Return to the moment when your heart was at its most beautiful?”*It\'s an incredibly heartfelt and emotive story, and what Scarecrow, and later Mo Murder both come to do in this arc, and the place they get to, represents the most beautiful thing in the world and of us humans to me. In but two such short, brief moments, all their development, history, and lives as synthetic humans come to a head, and they each achieve the most human of acts—they opt for  danger and self-sacrifice for the sake and rescue of another. To do such an otherwise illogical and risky, but *good* thing for another; all in a situation where the other party will likely never even learn about or appreciate it—or they likely won\'t live through to see it blossom in any way. And to get to that result—and not regret it or the loss of everything in your final moments...It reflects us rising above our urges, instincts and base desires. We as animals. To act in such a way against our very selves and self-preserving nature. No other being in the world can manage this, certainly for what\'s little more than a stranger—it is our gift alone. And we with all our intelligence and sentience so rarely manage to achieve anything close. But rarely, every so often, we do manage it.It must be when we listen to that little \'bug\' inside, no matter how small and crushed down it may have gotten over the years, that just wants to do and be something good for another like us. The chance doesn’t come around often, if at all for most of our lives, but when it does—and we manage it—it can only be when our hearts are at their most beautiful point. When we \'break through\' and become something more than just the sum of our animal parts and our history—where our sentience, will and humanity are realized in but a moment. When we do something just for the intangible concept that is the principle.Sure, there are plenty of stories with characters and much greater \'heroes\' in them that put others before themselves, as well as sacrifice themselves. Such a thing isn\'t very unique to this story. But here, it is made especially profound and emotive as with both characters\' stories, you see every beat that leads them to their resolutions, where they start from—very low; flawed and morally troubled, chained to the orders of an organization—and where they end up. That \'bug\' inside them growing and steering more and more their actions.Nothing especially ""big"", different, or dramatic ever happens to the characters to change or set them on this course either. Just a long series of small events, thoughts, interactions, words... It isn\'t clean—their heroism—and certainly not very \'cool\' to watch, it\'s quick and messy, and there\'s not really a happy ending to be found in the story either. There\'s even a struggle with regret and doubt after said heroic acts. And neither manages to \'absolve\' themselves in the story or any of the things they did wrong and the crimes they committed... But it is in this messiness and harsh reality, and in seeing their journeys and inner turmoil play out that something extremely believable and compelling is found. Something that sticks out and stays.It is often said that without fear there is no bravery, or—the more fear that exists, the chance for greater amounts of bravery—and I think that logic holds for acts of greatness and heroism as well. Great characters achieving and doing heroic things is... great, but to write terribly flawed and damaged characters achieving heroic things, and showing that journey believably, I think, is much more special a thing, and Boogiepop does it perfectly here.*“Humans do not possess a single, focused will. They just have countless bugs buzzing around in all directions inside their hearts. It\'s fine when all these bugs are headed toward the same meal as one, but when they split apart... People take actions that can only be described as incoherent.”*There are countless cases one could learn about, throughout all the great conflicts, depressions, and tragedies of history, where everyday people, assuredly flawed people, manage to break through our nature and achieve this, and undoubtedly countless more forever untold; locked away in the everyday noise, or the long and unseen history of the world. Ordinary people sheltering the persecuted and knowingly facing death and torture for it, people running into fires, and firefighters running up burning skyscrapers... Teachers shielding their students with their own bodies, and soldiers jumping over grenades just to save their comrades and friends... Starving brothers giving the last morsel to their starving sisters, and personnel going down with ship or reactor, just to save and protect as many as they can in the role that only they could fill...If there is a God—or an audience of our experience out there—I am sure this is when they are their most proud, shocked, or affected. Like you or me, who watched the brief stories of \'Scarecrow\' and \'Mo Murder\'. It is where our souls and characters are truly seen and shining. A soul developed bit by bit over a lifetime, achieving definition in one tiny, beautiful moment, with the decision to do away with self-preservation, the fundamental law for all life, and to hurt or lose ourselves for another like us. These events are not fiction, flukes, or one-off anomalies, and such transcendent beauty is an irrefutable possibility within each of us. Even in the worst and most hopeless among us—as were the characters of Scarecrow and Mo Murder.If we could control time, and observe with our own eyes our history - the lives of these people, and these events, would surely be the most impactful. It is where I would go. How many journeys would it take, I wonder—being confronted with and seeing first-hand those undeniable acts of purity—to believe and love in all of life and humanity.I think, just one...The \'Boogiepop and Others\' story, as mentioned previously, is about the greatness of humanity.

The audio design is undoubtedly great. The visuals are on point. It's a fascinating string of events. And yet, I don't think I could in any way rank Boogiepop this highly from an objective point of view. I can see how some people would think that it's needlessly confusing and that the entire experience is overly sparse. The characters don't really get much time for us to understand who they are, and the movers and shakers of the world are left, perhaps, too vague in the background. To engage with it fully, the show is asking a...lot of its audience; perhaps more than it has any right to.However, as my score and initial proclamation indicate, this may be top ten material for me. Something about the experience struck a chord within my soul, a yearning that I haven't felt in a long while. Can I tell you, objectively, what makes it this good for my subjective tastes? No, I cannot. Maybe, in its own paradoxical way, not knowing why the experience has meant so much is one of the reasons it means so much.If you're up for a challenge, give this a watch.

Boogiepop (2019) is the second adaptation of the series and from what I\'ve researched, is more akin to the original source material, whereas Boogiepop Phantom was a sequel to the light novel. Once again produced by studio Madhouse (one of my personal favorite studios) we are re-introduced to the non-sequential story of Boogiepop and the strange occurrences surrounding the ""entity"". Boogiepop from what I\'ve come to understand was the first hit light novel series and one of the first to receive an animated series. So, with a grain of salt, we should be able to...appreciate to an extent what Boogiepop has done for the anime community. Gotta take the good and bad that came from it.We haven\'t progressed too far into the story as it being we\'re only four episodes into the series, but I\'ll at least try to give my interpretation of what\'s happened thus far. More or less Boogiepop has come off as a gray area of multiple possibilities: a split personality, an entity, or ""The Angel of Death"". It\'s completely  shrouded in ambiguity what Boogiepop\'s real nature is at this point. From what I can tell from what we\'ve been given thus far is that it\'s supposedly a protector of the greater good for humanity. As I\'ve personally not read the source material myself it could be up for change, but I guess we as an audience will see what happens. The first arc of Boogiepop mainly revolves around Echoes, another entity that came from space and its rabid clone Manticore, whom feeds on unsuspecting female students of an academy. As we see from the different perspectives in each episode, we witness how these two foreign creatures effect, mostly in a ghastly way, the lives of the students and mystery behind the disappearances.The art itself is pretty good and fits the overall aesthetic the series was trying to achieve and shouldn\'t be too much of a problem for most viewers. The character designs are for the most part distinguishable from each other. My main problem as a whole for this adaptation deals more so with the animation than anything. It\'s seemingly all over all the place, which is downright odd for a studio as renowned as Madhouse is. The frame rate in the first three episodes seems all over the place especially in action sequences and sadly this  damn near ruins almost any atmosphere and immersion for me when it\'s this noticeable. This is a complete contrast to Boogiepop Phantom where its production is where it nails atmosphere in spades. I can see a plethora of people being put off by the way it was utilized in the original show, but that\'s what I adored about that show and it created an atmosphere in production that hasn\'t come close to being replicated except for maybe Serial Experiments Lain, but that\'s a complete different story. The production and usage of filters in Boogiepop Phantom damn near felt like watching a Team Silent made anime series and my god do I love me some early Silent Hill.The OST/sound is what absolutely makes up for the poor animation of the early arc. The composer absolutely hit it out of the park with the music selection. From the various usages of ambient, dark ambient and a hint of dream pop. This will go down as OST of the season, maybe of the year for me. Absolutely fantastic music and this is where the /true/ atmosphere of Boogiepop (2019) comes into play.Describing the characters for Boogiepop is something I personally can\'t do much of, because quite frankly due its nature and the pacing/structure of the show, there\'s not much I can say about them. I\'ve more or less went into detail about Boogiepop already and its clearly, outside of Kirima Nagi, the most re-occuring character so far. Kirima herself is still shrouded in too much ambiguity to fully analyze her, all I can deduce is that she\'s basically the daughter of the author of those murder/psychological books that keep popping up and that she\'s protecting students of the academy. This is the biggest problem of doing a preliminary review, I just don\'t have enough information yet to fully comment on the characters in an episodic series of this nature.Pros-Mildly intriguing mysteryGood art/characters designAmazing OST and OPCons-Harder to follow for casual anime watchers (I watched the first arc like three times before writing this review myself)Animation issuesFor recommendations definitely go check out the original series, it may look dated now but it\'s still definitely an interesting watch, Baccano, and Durarara.

Hope you guys find this review helpful and insightful.', 'If I could describe this anime in one word, it would be ""interesting"".I have not read the Boogiepop LNs, so keep that in mind as you read my review.Also also, the score on MAL basically drove me to write this review.First of all, since you\'ve seen the score that I\'ve given Boogiepop, you must already know that I like this anime. I like it quite a bit actually. So, naturally, the burning question in your mind probably goes something like ""Should I watch this anime?"". The answer is actually not that simple. But I\'ll try to simplify.Let\'s say there are two very different people who...watch anime. We\'ll call these two people \'A\' and \'B\'.A doesn\'t like being confused when watching an anime. A wants to have control of the anime and wants to know what\'s going on at all times. A\'s confusion actually frustrates him and he may drop the anime if it gets too confusing. Most importantly, A does not have the patience to continue watching something unless he fully understands everything (even if the details are revealed in later episodes). To sum up, A wants a linear story with linear progression. A will not fill in the details by himself.B is okay being confused when watching an anime. B allows the anime to give him the experience and watches as it unfolds. B does not get frustrated when new questions arise and instead, allows his curiosity explore possible answers. Most importantly, B has the patience to watch a story unfold in over time and is willing to put it together himself.From the way that I\'ve generalized these two viewers, you probably already understand which type of person is going to enjoy this anime. That\'s right, this is not an anime for A. B is the only type of person who would enjoy this anime. A might be able to enjoy it, when it is completed since he won\'t have to wait for new episodes. However that chance is slim given the structure of the story in general. Boogiepop does not tell you a coherent story in the same way that most anime does. Instead, it presents different arcs with different characters that initially seem to have no connection to one another, but over time demonstrates how they tie in to the larger narrative.The one thing in common between all story arcs however, is Boogiepop. You might not know who Boogiepop is right now, but considering you\'ve stayed this long into the review, I am going to assume you will find out soon.Now what about the rest? How is the animation? How is the character design? How is the soundtrack? Well to put simply, the animation is alright. For the story it tells, it suffices. The character design is just about decent as well. If you are not an experienced anime watcher, you will probably have trouble recognizing some of the faces that are supposed to be familiar, but it isn\'t a deal-breaker. The sound however is somewhat exceptional. It uses experimental tones and often paints a scene in a new light just by itself. I personally believe the opening is quite good. As for the ending, It\'s simply the best ED I\'ve heard in a while. If you absolutely hate the story and you treat the anime itself as a filler for the opening and ending, there is actually a chance that you may find it enjoyable.Some other stuff to keep in mind is the importance of the source material. The Boogiepop LNs have been very influential, and their impact can be seen in many popular works today (ex: Monogatari Series). Basically, watching Boogiepop being adapted as a modern anime is an event to watch just by itself.I\'ve already said a lot so, I\'ll be brief. If you\'ve stuck around for this long in the review, go watch Boogiepop.(Like all the episodes out right now) If you skipped to the end of this review, without reading the whole thing, I recommend you go back and read what I have to say.

Happy Watching!', 'Words cannot describe how good this show is.While it\'s true the plot is inconsistent and and each episode has an entirely different story to tell, I still enjoyed this alot, partly because of that. It\'s randomness shrouded in mystery, horror, kick ass action scenes and fat plot keeps you at the edge of your seat, lost but wanting more. And when you finally put it all together, it just feels so rewarding. The thing is, everything is actually connected despite how lost some may feel. The universe is unique. Definitely do some background research on a Wiki so you can help yourself understand just what\'s...going on for things like; ""What the hell is a MPLS?"" Or ""Who\'s this Towa Organization?"" and then what you just watched begins to make much more sense. The sound, music and animation are top-notch too. I really enjoyed the music especially though. It adds alot and doesn\'t sound like your typical generic stuff. It\'s lovely.So, while I partially agree with every review here, good and bad that raises some factual points, this anime still easily turned out to be a masterpiece for me and I\'ll definitely be reading the original content soon. Some people claim it\'s ""Too High IQ"" or too ""Pseudo-Intellectual"" but it\'s really not. If you could watch and understand Death Note, then you\'re going to have a good time. Please, for the love of god, just be patient with this masterpiece in disguise. going on for things like; ""What the hell is a MPLS?"" Or ""Who\'s this Towa Organization?"" and then what you just watched begins to make much more sense. The sound, music and animation are top-notch too. I really enjoyed the music especially though. It adds alot and doesn\'t sound like your typical generic stuff.

Please, for the love of god, just be patient with this masterpiece in disguise.', 'A good, thought-provoking series, but you may have to hang on for a while to get into it. There are a lot of episodes that retell the same events from a different character\'s POV, and the plot is not linear, but something you have to piece together. It\'s a supernatural / sci-fi / horror / mystery.It centers around a shinigami called Boogiepop, who shares a body with a regular high school girl. Shinigami was alternately translated to “reaper” or “angel of death” in the English version I watched. She only shows up when the world is in danger.The name “Boogiepop” is so goofy that...I put off watching the show for a while. Some high school girl wearing a cape and a stovepipe hat and calling herself ""Boogiepop"" says she’s here to save the world? It was hard to take seriously at first. But I digress.It’s really hard to give a synopsis of this show because it\'s divided into four arcs, each covering one story (1 or 2 volumes of the light novels), so I\'ll review each of them briefly, then give some thoughts on the series as a whole.—————""Boogiepop and Others"" is episodes 1 - 3. This was the most rushed of the arcs, and its pacing wasn’t good either. I honestly had no idea what was going on the majority of the time. Once you watch the whole show and get the characters straight, it makes much more sense. Plus, the ending is pretty straightforward.""VS Imaginator"" is episodes 4 - 9. Boogiepop doesn’t appear in this arc much. You get to learn a lot about the mysterious Towa Organization hinted at in the first arc. There’s a lot of mind-control and memory-altering in this arc, by different parties and for different reasons. The most prominent characters here are Nagi Kirima’s younger brother Masaki Taniguchi, and Aya Orihata, a girl he meets during a confrontation with bullies on the street. Combine this with a guidance counselor who starts seeing a mysterious apparition in the vein of Boogiepop, and dangerous things start happening.""Boogiepop at Dawn"" is episodes 10 - 13. My favorite arc by far. It’s Boogiepop’s and Nagi Kirima’s origin story, and the main setting is a hospital. We learn even more of what the shady Towa Organization is up to and why. There’s assassins and a serial killer running around, and it gets wild.“Overdrive: The King of Distortion” is episodes 14 - 18. Several characters from the first arc turn out to be important in this one. Everyone in a building falls asleep and has to come to grips with painful memories of their past. Who’s causing it and why?—————Complicated though it may seem, each arc boils down to a single philosophical question the villain / antagonist asks: ""What if x didn\'t exist?"" or something similar. Their intentions might not be bad, but the antagonist tries to implement them the wrong way. It gives the viewer a degree of sympathy for the antagonists… except the ones in the first arc.The art was pretty good, but the supporting characters were borderline indistinguishable for me at first. All high school kids wore the same uniform, and there were even a few characters that changed bodies. Sometimes the quality dropped and there were faraway characters who had no face, and similar lack of detail. The setting is kind of gray and bland, and there isn\'t a lot of atmosphere, particularly in the scenes at the school. There were a few cool fight scenes, about one per arc. Boogiepop and Nagi have great character designs. I think the art improved as the show went along, so the first few episodes were underwhelming.The OP and ED were both fantastic, probably some of my all-time favorites. Not only that, but they fit the show perfectly, both the lyrics and the animation. The songs are almost entirely in English. If you want a feel for what the series is like, watch the OP. It’s like that, except for the heavy synth music.The voices and sound design are excellent as well. Boogiepop comes with her own theme music: Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, which she is prone to whistling before she shows up. I watched it dubbed in English, and LOVE Boogiepop\'s voice.The characters—as I’ve mentioned before—can be hard to tell apart, especially if you’re not good at remembering Japanese names like me. Nagi Kirima was a standout, and I’d watch a whole series about her. Boogiepop herself was interesting because she didn’t automatically jump in and save the day, instead she only interfered when necessary. Some of the supporting characters are interesting too, such as Suema, a high school girl who studies criminal psychology based on something that happened in her past.""Boogiepop and Others"" is not going to be to everyone\'s taste. If you like people discussing psychological concepts interspersed with some horrific crime scenes and incidents involving a secret organization interested in evolution, try it. If not, you’ll probably fall asleep because the first two episodes are mostly talking.I’m on my second viewing now, and plan to read the light novels the show was adapted from. I still think ""Boogiepop"" is a goofy name. I put off watching the show for a while.

Please rate accordingly.', 'Welcome to my review on the animated series \'Boogiepop wa Warawanai (2019)\'. Boogiepop, as I will call this series from here on is a remake of the anime with the same name (Boogiepop wa Warawanai) from the year 2000. Just like the older 2000 version this new one is done by the well-known studio MADHOUSE. So instead of the long-awaited sequel to One Punch Man we got this. Is it still any good? That\'s what I am going to tell. Before that, just the added information that this anime consists of 18 episodes total, each with a runtime of approx. 24 minutes. Usual stuff. As...for the genre Boogiepop should number among horror, sci-fi, mystery, drama, and psychological. Those are pretty good genre types for a good and deep story. Does it deliver? We will soon know, unless you solely rely on the general score of MAL.Story/plot: It should not surprise any die-hard seasonal watchers when I say that Boogiepop was not well watched among watchers. The fault for that heavily lies on the first three episodes and the follow-up to the fourth one. The reason for why many people seem to dislike the starting episodes is because the small arc of the first three episodes happens after the following fourth (and more) episodes. Meaning that the order of when the episodes happen is distorted and not linear. Not only that but the first three episodes also have a non-linear course of events. That resulted in many people getting confused over what actually happens, why it does and how. After those episodes of course everything is in the clear, unless the watcher missed something shown.What I am going to talk about now is the general story of this show. To start with, the anime does not have one single plot but multiple ones regarding different events and things that happen. In the middle of all this is Boogiepop a mysterious someone who is called the Grim Reaper why those who talk about it. Who is Boogiepop? That is a spoiler. What does Boogiepop? That...is a spoiler! Let\'s just say that Boogiepop is an entity in the world of this anime that fights against so-called \'Enemies of humanity\'. Those are individuals who according to Boogiepop pose a threat to the entire humanity, thus the ""Grim Reaper"" fights them off and is ready to even kill them.That is basically everything that I can say without getting into minor or major spoilers which I am trying to avoid. The story of this anime is not a psychological sci-fi horror mystery without a reason. There are questions the characters and so also the viewer has reading what happens or is about to. Therefore I can not talk about that. All I can say is that I liked each arc and what it tried to convey.Art: Simple, yet effective. The Boogiepop anime does not have grand and spectacular animations. Except during some action scenes, oh boy. I hear people call it monotonous because of the facial features of thw characters. It seems they are to spoiled. People do have a normal face, most of us at least. A regular human does not look like model or have really recognizable features. The art does not look bad at all and at times when it is more hectic the animation becomes even better.Sound: Pretty good SFX and good BGM, just not something you would remember. On the other side we a great ending and lkng on behold an amazing opening by the legendary Myth & Roid. [shadowgraph] is a song to remember. It is a great song and easily became my favorite opening of the season. Myth & Roid, you have outdone yourselves.Characters: Naming each and every character is not needed, and it would be way to much. The three most important charcaters from my view were obviously Boogiepop but also Kirima Nagi the ""Fire Witch"" and Niitoki Kei. Starting with Boogiepop the name-giver of this show. Boogiepop is a character who at first is mostly for the cause of eradicating the threat that the ""enemy"" is. But throughout the episodes it finds more of its personality, or maybe they were there all along. Kirima Nagi decided after the death of her father to pursue crime and the supernatural. While it\'s always good to get physically and/or mentally strong female characters it not very great to see that you won\'t get a lot of screen time of her, at least not as much as I had hoped for. Niitoki Kei or Kazuko Sue a, whichever of the two you choose, both are mentally strong and intelligent characters who look for the mysterious and the crimes of others. Solving the puzzles in front of them so to speak. Although there is not much that I said about only those charcaters, each and every important one shows what their thoughts are. Or maybe not?Overall enjoyment and verdict: Boogiepop wa Warawanai seems to have a bad reputation. But what I found was a hidden gem. A truly great and interesting mystery with psychological questions and thoughts. Someone like me who enjoys such stories loved it through the end. I would have loved to see more about Boogiepop and how awesome it is. But one can only dream. If you also like psychological stuff and some epsidoes you can think about while watching this will be one you probably like. The core of this show undeniably lies within the thoughtful context of what everything means. What the arc is actually about. I enjoyed it thoroughly and can only recommend it.And that\'s it for my review,see you next time for the genre Boogiepop should number among horror, sci-fi, mystery, drama, and psychological.

I enjoyed it thoroughly and can only recommend it.And that\'s it for my review,see you next time', 'Boogiepop and Others (Boogiepop wa Warawanai) is a compilation cerebral anime series based off of 5 of the 22 light novels in the boogiepop universe. The psychological series is truly one of the most complex shows I\'ve ever seen, if not the most complex. Beginning this series may not be for the faint hearted, but completing it has been HIGHLY rewarding.The anime is made up of four connected but separate story are, which I will rate here-Overdrive: The King of Distortion 10/10, Episodes 14-18VS Imaginator, 9/10 Episodes 4-9Boogiepop And Others, 9/10 Episodes 1-3Boogiepop at Dawn, 8/10 Episodes 10-13.This being said, I have not read...the light novels (though I plan to) and did thoroughly enjoyed the anime. I\'ve heard many liberties were taken in the adaptation. I understand not appreciating these differences, but as an independent work of art I appreciate the technical expertise that went into this series, as well as brilliantly written dialogue.Boogiepop was directed by Shingo Natsume, which is probably enough to say as far as directing is concerned. This is the man who has been hailed as the next Shinichirō Watanabe, and who every almost every animator in Japan dreams of working with. You know him as the director of One Punch Man season 1. He was single handily able to bring together all of Japan\'s greatest freelance animators for One Punch Man, which was a massive achievement in directing and animation. The entire reason Madhouse is not producing season 2 of One Punch Man is Boogiepop and others. Love or hate the series for this, having completed it I fully understand why Natsume chose this project over the second season of OPM (though this has probably hurt the animation quality of OPM, which is yet to be seen at the time of this review). All in all, the only anime television series I have seen with even comparable directing is Erased, (or Boku dake ga Inai Machi) with brilliant cuts and fantastic storyboarding throughout the entire series.The animation is fantastic, as we have come to expect from Madhouse. The character designs are all very cute and the characters keep the coldest fits tbh. The voice acting is great and the Boogiepop voice is easily one of the most attractive voices I\'ve ever heard.""The world is not always moving in one direction. Just like a swarm of bugs, it moves in all directions.""The dialogue can be very complicated at times, but if one is able to follow it, the truth about this series will reveal itself. Boogiepop is easily one of the most philosophical anime series I have ever seen (Some that compete for this title are Shinsekai Yori, Monster, and Death Parade) and developing a good understanding of this series on one\'s own such a rewarding feat in its own right. I will not spoil anything because this is something you will want to experience on your own. Only the prequel arc (Boogiepop at Dawn) sees a slight dip in storytelling, but overall the quality is steadily enthralling.“Do you know the smartest thing you can do when confronted with an enemy?History’s proven this,You make you enemy into your ally.That’s the smartest and most effective method.”Many important philosophical views are presented in Boogiepop, many of them are incorrect, but they are so well written that I constantly found myself pondering these questions and coming to my own conclusions. I will always appreciate this series for prompting me to think so much about so many important human issues.The OP and ED are both 10/10 fantastic.Boogiepop ranks with Dororo and Mob Psycho II as one off the most elite anime of 2019 so far, and I truly wish that Madhouse chooses to adapt more Boogiepop media in the future.Watching this series weekly was good but bingeing it brought about so much thought and understanding, I strongly encourage giving this series a chance and bingeing that shit.The MAL score of this series is very disappointing and certainly a result of the complexities being lost on viewers from week to week.If you take anything away from my words and this review, please understand that this series deserves at least an 8.6 on MAL, and fans of the psychological genre will be sure to love this series. I may one day go back and give this series a 10, but at the moment I must rate it 9/10, because if a few confusing moments and the slight dip in writing fir about two episodes in the middle of the series. if 9/10 is defined by MAL as ""Great,"" than this series certainly has earned a 9/10 from this viewer.#AllHailMadhouse#pleasesaysike the light novels (though I plan to) and did thoroughly enjoyed the anime.

I didn´t realized what’s happening, because the story wasn´t only told in one direction, many strings were connected and entangled in each other. But I thought that the legendary Studio MADHOUSE will find a way for me to enjoy this series and in the end I wasn’t disappointed.The plot is too complicated to break it down in a few sentences, but I will try. In this world it happens that mystical creatures (or not?) exist, one of them made up by legends and others by a special organization. The urban legend about a Shinigami called Boogiepop who kills...people when they are at their most beautiful look is very popular in the society and you will later realize that something is true about it but also many things are turned upside down.However later more and more people with certain powers will show up in the series and we see a lot of fights, deaths etc... But a huge different aspect which puts Boogiepop and Others out of the typical stereotypes is that this series focus on particular topics and focus on the emotion of the people. Questions like what is real? why are we? And what’s the mayor point of all our actions? Are touched on without finding a concrete answer. The rest is up to the spectatorSo how end this review? I would say that Boogiepop and others is a trip with your own emotional world, your thoughts and actions, knitted in an interesting story.Even though the final isn´t something very special and in the end just a stop for the next station (not every chapter in the Light Novel is adapted) it is still worth to watchBut for a series for simple looking, for example, to go to sleep, it is rather inappropriate. It is best if the series binge watched. people when they are at their most beautiful look is very popular in the society and you will later realize that something is true about it but also many things are turned upside down.However later more and more people with certain powers will show up in the series and we see a lot of fights, deaths etc...

This is a mysterious anime and in general, you\'ll just have to watch it for yourself. Seriously. Go watch it. Love it or hate it, you\'ll enjoy yourself.Right, this is a weird anime. The story is not one hundred percent linear, and often uses different character perspectives as well. I think this works quite well, as often times you can figure out the mystery for yourself, as opposed to there being a case of the ol\'...Sherlock Holmes explain-everything-as-the-falling-action. The downside to this is that the show kind of demands that you pay attention to it. I mean... this isn\'t a comedy... so, yeah, you have to use a couple brain-cells while you watch this show. This isn\'t some slice-of-life show to fill the void in your barren, hollow life.That being said, I was hoping for the show to expound a little more on the philosophical themes that it brings up. While the moving parts that form the plot are well oiled and enjoyable, there were times that I was left asking for meaning, not just motive. Don\'t want to spoil, so again, that will make sense when you watch the show.As for the art and animation, it\'s Madhouse. At the time of this writing (April \'19) you only have to look at how people are reacting to JC Staff replacing them on OPM season 2 to get an idea of how good they are. While true action scenes in the show are sparse, they are beautiful, and honestly, so is everything else. It\'s good, y\'all. I\'ve seen a review that called this show gory, and it must\'ve been from the Catholic Mother\'s Organization. This is not Devilman Crybaby, don\'t worry.I also found the sound (Shouji Hata) and music(Kensuke Ushio) to be beautiful. The sound editing and effects (there are dramatic moments where it is cut so perfectly) are great. And the soundtrack is something I can\'t wait to get my hands on, just to listen to it over and over.The characters? Well, they feel realistic, however, some are not quite as fleshed out as I would\'ve liked. Presumably there\'s more in the light novels, however we\'re talking about the anime here. That is the downside of the ensemble style storytelling, after all. Even the titular Boogiepop doesn\'t really appear in some episodes. Well, it comes down to taste and preference, as when you watch your favorite character might be one that gets a lot of screen time. There\'s no ""waifu"" in here for people to jerk off to and then promptly forget about, if that\'s your thing. Hey, I already said it wasn\'t a slice-of-life show...Enjoyment: Well, this is the category that I think most people really get hung up on. As I said before, you do have to be thinking about what is happening while you\'re watching. This is a good show to watch over a week or two, so you don\'t forget what happened in the last episode when starting the next. I imagine this soured some people\'s perspectives on the show. I don\'t want to make this review conditional, but I would also recommend watching the episodes close together. this show is binge-worthy.As for me, I was told it was similar to Serial Experiments Lain, so maybe I could use that as a frame of reference for you, dear reader. This show is similar to, but also far from, Lain. It\'s hard to explain. If you enjoyed Lain, you\'ll have a good time with this show. At the same time, this is not as complicated a show. So if you\'re worried about things in it going over your head, don\'t be. It is certainly not a waste of your time.To conclude, I recommend this show. I recommend it both to my fellow Lain Lovers as well as any mystery fans. I find it hard to give this show a score. Reviews are for products, not art. I personally think it\'s a ""Masterpiece,""(10) however, removing my subjective feelings I\'d say it\'s ""Very Good"" (8). Sherlock Holmes explain-everything-as-the-falling-action. The downside to this is that the show kind of demands that you pay attention to it. I mean... this isn\'t a comedy... so, yeah, you have to use a couple brain-cells while you watch this show. This isn\'t some slice-of-life show to fill the void in your barren, hollow life.That being said, I was hoping for the show to expound a little more on the philosophical themes that it brings up. While the moving parts that form the plot are well oiled and enjoyable, there were times that I was left asking for meaning, not just motive. Don\'t want to spoil, so again, that will make sense when you watch the show.As for the art and animation, it\'s Madhouse. At the time of this writing (April \'19) you only have to look at how people are reacting to JC Staff replacing them on OPM season 2 to get an idea of how good they are. While true action scenes in the show are sparse, they are beautiful, and honestly, so is everything else. It\'s good, y\'all. I\'ve seen a review that called this show gory, and it must\'ve been from the Catholic Mother\'s Organization. This is not Devilman Crybaby, don\'t worry.I also found the sound (Shouji Hata) and music(Kensuke Ushio) to be beautiful. The sound editing and effects (there are dramatic moments where it is cut so perfectly) are great. And the soundtrack is something I can\'t wait to get my hands on, just to listen to it over and over.The characters? Well, they feel realistic, however, some are not quite as fleshed out as I would\'ve liked. Presumably there\'s more in the light novels, however we\'re talking about the anime here. That is the downside of the ensemble style storytelling, after all. Even the titular Boogiepop doesn\'t really appear in some episodes.

It takes a look at the psychology of humans and incorporates these themes into a supernatural thriller.  The show examines the supposed ""inadequacies"" of people and displays how they are an important part of how the world exists.  For example, in the second arc, the Imaginator tries to create a perfect world and remove the imperfections in our hearts.  But Boogiepop, the main hero/heroine, protects humankind.  These imperfections make humans what they are.  So she fights these oddities and people to save the world.This show helps one reflect deeply...about society as a whole and themselves.  It is not easy to follow.  The show does not believe in time as a fluid concept as evidenced by the show frequently fragmenting to different points of the plot.  Also, get ready for a shit-ton of references to split personalities (a major talking point of the show).  The whimsical and thought-provoking nature of the show makes you want to watch more.  Curiosity of the author and the show became my own.  What happens next?  What is right?  What is wrong?  Who gets to decide anything?  Ambiguity is something that the show definitely thrives on.  Boogiepop is a dialogue driven show that does have some action.  The action is subpar and the animation for some of the show leave much to be desired.  But the fighting is made up for with the god-tier plot.The opening is a fucking banger.  I listened to that shit wayyy too many times.  And if you\'re a sucker for character development, this show has more than your daily amount of Vitamin C.  It\'s fun, it\'s thought provoking, and it rarely gets boring.

The first arc, although short, was interesting and fun to watch; I loved it overall. The second arc was fun too, not as great as the first one though. However, what ruined it for me was the last arc. This anime, in general, is very vague and I had no idea what was going on at the time, but the last arc was the last straw for me. During the first section of the last arc, I was like, ""what the fuck is going on,"" and we later found out why people were...asleep, I was already asleep. I kid you not. ZZZZZZZZ. I\'ve rarely fallen asleep watching anime, yet this has succeeded. In case you don\'t get it, the last arc ruined it for me completely. However, if I were to say one good thing about this anime, it would be that I totally dig the Boogiepop costume and I will cosplay as them.- Spacecraft555 UwU asleep, I was already asleep.

Boogiepop Phantom is about various different stories that take place at the same school with each one mainly concerning or involving Boogiepop in one way, shape or form. Each story is quite interesting and tends to involve supernatural elements in a pretty natural world, meaning the world is ordinary like the one you know but all these strange events and creatures keep appearing around this school.Boogiepop is a very interesting idea…or at least that is what it likes to claim to be,...Boogiepop is not one person but an idea that exists to keep normality. If anything appears which threatens normality then Boogiepop exists, you can already guess can’t you…Boogiepop is as its stated a “phantom” and in this case it’s a phantom that acts as a split personality for a girl. You can say that Boogiepop is technically possessing these girl(s) but I don’t think that’s the case. As I said, each story centres on a bunch of individuals. I’m only willing to talk about Boogiepop, I personally think talking about the other characters would spoil too much as each of the stories play very closely to their individual personalities.The animation is very good but at the same time I would not expect anything less from Madhouse. OST fits well too.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Boogiepop Phantom, each of the stories was interesting and the idea that is Boogiepop was interesting to see explored too.(Side Note: Kind of reminds me of Durarara, but just not as good)7/10 Boogiepop is not one person but an idea that exists to keep normality.

The new show has taken as its style an inconsistent timeline to make the overly-congested plot seem more complex and mysterious than it is. Though accurately adapted, the separate novels are crammed into just three-or-four-episode arcs for each. I wouldn’t say each light novel could last a full season, but they could certainly be more fleshed out. Nevertheless, it’s a great time for those who...can enjoy a little pretentious sci-fi in their anime.Our hero Boogiepop is back in action to stop folks from continually trying to immanentize the eschaton; to create a transcendent utopia on earth. Despite the various incoherent metaphors and vague monologues in the show’s dialogue, the conflicts between Boogiepop and her antagonists can essentially be boiled down to that again and again. Episode 11 gives Boogiepop one of the better monologues of the show; she speaks of every human being having the potential to become an “enemy of the world.” She explains that everyone who is too “normal” lacks “resistance” when confronted with a “unique” person or idea. Translated from obscure-Boogiepop-speak, this basically means the world is full of impressionable moral relativists who can easily be set on an evil path despite good intentions. A very timely theme, given the popular political and cultural movements of our day.Simply writing arcs based around the theme above, we could have a great story on our hands that tells all it needs to tell. Unfortunately we can’t have simple plots in Japanese media when we\'re faced with the duties of writing in the ""psychological"" genre. Although this anime actively makes the plot seem more convoluted than it is, Kadono deserves some blame as well. The so-called Towa Organization is an irritating leech weighing down every arc of the show. They’re a secret society searching the world for mutants and just causing a whole lot of destruction for no coherent purpose. Apparently they’re trying to make sure humans don’t get beaten out by “evolved” types and yet in the process create a multitude of synthetic humans to do their dirty work. Seems to me it’s a little counterproductive to exterminate mutants while creating a population of fully sentient androids who cannot be told apart from real humans. That said, I’m not entirely sure that mutant extermination was even their end goal; the exposition is that vague.The overall production is legitimately good and lacks any of the unpleasant CG that’s been inserted into every other anime reboot I’ve watched in the past year. The action scenes are few and far between but always put a smile on my face—the combat animation is heavily stylized and always catches the viewer off guard, juxtaposed against the monotonous scenes that make up the rest of the show. The score is groovy as hell, including the opening and ending tracks. Keep in mind this comes from an individual with absolutely no taste for J-Pop or anything of the sort, yet it’s somehow endearing here. Some background tracks often sound like something you’d find in a “lofi hiphop” playlist; simple computer-generated noises that somehow work to set an atmosphere. I can’t comment much on the Japanese voice-acting given that I don’t understand the language, but Aoi Yuuki is a definite standout as the protagonist. Her soft but jolting voice gives Boogiepop an alien quality that easily separates her from her host: Miyashita Touka.I hope I’ve redeemed myself slightly for my jumbled mess of a review for the Boogiepop light novels back in 2014. It’s worth noting that my first introduction to Boogiepop was Boogiepop Phantom, and not the novels. The source material is worlds different from Phantom in tone, and so is this new show. So if you’ve come to this series as a fan of Phantom, be prepared for a far less absurdly twisted and vile show. The morbidity of Boogiepop is always there to be sure, but Phantom was on another level of horror. Enjoy 2019’s Boogiepop Never Laughs as an often ridiculously convoluted adventure through twisted personalities, but always appreciate the underlying philosophy: mortal man cannot create paradise on earth, and any attempts to do so often result in crimes against humanity. The Tower of Babel is always short-lived. can enjoy a little pretentious sci-fi in their anime.Our hero Boogiepop is back in action to stop folks from continually trying to immanentize the eschaton; to create a transcendent utopia on earth.

The OP and ED songs are pretty awesome!2. The story telling is very unique, definitely stood out compared to other series3. The VA is superb. They did a fantastic work portraying their characters4. I love Boogiepop\'s character....Cons:1. Not enough time to develop each character.2. Too many characters and their designs are very similar so it would be hard to differentiate between each character if you can\'t remember their names3.  The art is meh. It\'s obvious that there\'s a lack of budget for this series.4. Story can be quite hard to follow if you didn\'t pay full attention<Long Ver>I have heard about this anime before it started airing and it was hyped a lot. The light novel for this inspired a lot of talented LN authors nowadays so of course people are going to be hyped for a remake of such a classic LN series. However, after it started airing, a lot complained that the story was very hard to follow and they understood nothing. Some also said that they found it hard to connect with the characters in the series because they are very bland and have no interesting character traits. Well, after finishing the entirety of the anime, I can safely say that those arguments are correct. If you read my cons above, then you would know that I too have a problem with how they handle the characters. It\'s actually quite hard to remember who is who and actually give a crap about them when some of them only appeared for like 2 episodes. However, the strong points about this series ain\'t its characters but actually it\'s story.This anime take a unique approach in story telling which is called a non-linear story telling, which means everything that happens isn\'t in chronological order. For example, what you see in the first arc may not have anything to do with the second arc but it\'s related to the last arc in the anime. Plus they keep on changing character perspective per episode or even in said episode itself, so of course it would be hard to keep track of what is actually happening. That\'s why I won\'t blame anyone for hating on this series for it\'s confusing storyline. It\'s actually very hard to follow. However, if you\'re someone like me who pay utmost attention while watching the series, the story is actually quite easy to understand and I fully respect the authors unique way of telling a story.Now moving on to the art and animation, aka the overall quality of the anime. It\'s quite bland actually. It just doesn\'t seem like it\'s made by Madhouse and some more by the director behind one of the most popular anime for it\'s outstanding quality One Punch Man. If you say that this is made by studios like A1 Pictures or Silver Link, I might actually believe you. So that\'s one of the weak point of this series. It doesn\'t have the visuals to capture us audiences\' attention even though it\'s made by Madhouse.For the sound department, the VA is actually excellent. I have no complaints. Each VA did put in a lot of effort in portraying their character. Both the OP and ED theme are excellent. Of course when the OP is sung by a pretty famous group recently, Myth and Roid. The BGM is quite bland, nothing that stood out too much, however there are still some tracks that are pretty well done.For the characters, as I stated above, their screentime just ain\'t enough for me to give a crap about them. Their designs are bland and similar so it\'s quite hard to differentiate them between each other. However I do like Boogiepop. I love her voice, her designs and her overall personality, however her screen time is just too few although the name of the series itself is named after her. Sadly...All in all, I still thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this anime just for its story itself. If you\'re not a fan of non-linear story telling then I highly recommend you to skip this but if you are then you should definitely check it out.

Unless you’re willing to give it your full attention, it will leave you behind. One measly episode a week is not nearly enough to keep track of such a complicated web of things: to be honest, I’ve spent the last week watching it and even then I was still feeling lost by it all. This is just the nature of Boogiepop: it sets out to confuse, only to unravel from there, but like a particularly tough knot, there is satisfaction to be found in untying it all.Most of all, it...rewards patience: it’s a non-linear series, constantly recontextualising scenes from another perspective as seemingly random side characters suddenly take focus. Slowly but surely, things start to make sense, yet it still leaves us with questions that may never be answered. Where is Boogiepop from? By whom was Echoes sent to Earth in order to judge humanity? How is a Synthetic Human made?That enigmatic quality is a large part of Boogiepop’s charm. The Boogiepop at Dawn story arc begins with Boogiepop and Echoes meeting in a strange place: the sky is red and there is rubble everywhere. Could they be wandering through a post-apocalyptic Earth millions of years into the future? We never find out and it’s probably for the best that we don’t: the truth is never as interesting as what we might imagine.From an anime production point of view, the series doesn’t quite hit the heights I was hoping for. Shingo Natsume and his team are of proven quality: from Space Dandy and One Punch Man to ACCA 13, these are memorable anime with a spark that’s sorely lacking in Boogiepop and Others. It isn’t badly animated or anything, it just looks generic and tired, which only exacerbates how difficult it is follow when every character is so deadpan.This is total speculation on my part, but I can’t help but think that the controversy sparked over (light novel artist) Kouji Ogata’s distaste for the anime’s designs affected director Natsume and his team’s enthusiasm for the project. Imagine being hard at work on a project you hope people will love, only to be publicly criticised for what amounts to a creative difference? It would be hard not to lose heart, and it’s also notable that the anime’s brilliant trailer has action scenes that never appeared in the series itself.Even still, there are moments when Boogiepop springs into life: there’s a particularly evocative scene in the last episode that sees a character falling from a great height, I only wish that the whole anime was as cinematic. However, I’ve no complaints about the soundtrack, Kensuke Ushio’s work is as wonderful as ever: he swept me away into another world and largely saved the series for me.And that’s my take on Boogiepop and Others. It’s a perfectly fine anime that had the potential to be great. If nothing else, listen to the soundtrack! rewards patience: it’s a non-linear series, constantly recontextualising scenes from another perspective as seemingly random side characters suddenly take focus.

It would be hard not to lose heart, and it’s also notable that the anime’s brilliant trailer has action scenes that never appeared in the series itself.Even still, there are moments when Boogiepop springs into life: there’s a particularly evocative scene in the last episode that sees a character falling from a great height, I only wish that the whole anime was as cinematic. However, I’ve no complaints about the soundtrack, Kensuke Ushio’s work is as wonderful as ever: he swept me away into another world and largely saved the series for me.And that’s my take on Boogiepop and Others. It’s a perfectly fine anime that had the potential to be great. If nothing else, listen to the soundtrack!', ""It's a story that won't hesitate to throw you into the deep end as it references events in the past and present with no mercy for the viewer. Yet if you roll with it and look past the occasionally choppy animation, you'll find a tale of growing-up that takes a different route towards the end goal, one that often leaves you both satisfied and wondering just what the hell happened.As I was watching it, I got the sense that a lot of the elements from the LN had to be chopped or moved aside due to time and (I'm guessing) the costs with licensing classic...rock. Shame, because it sneaks in some very cool classic rock references, particularly in the final arc.Still, it was everything I hoped for - an unsettling tale that forced me to watch closely and think critically instead of having everything placed before me. I highly suggest watching this arc-by-arc instead of episode-by-episode. It is so much more rewarding that way. rock.

I found this strange even by anime standards. It’s so criminally underrated. I don’t know how I missed the original series or this show. Specially since it was made by madhouse. I don’t write reviews a lot, nor is this an easy one to describe. I will do my best to give you best idea of what kind of weird and wonderful ride you will experience with Boogipop and others.I guess you would say this is a psychological anime, yet to define it sort of horror isn’t really out of place. It feels a lot like Black...mirror if your aware of that show. The story is the most confusing but best part of the show. It’s intentionally vague. You won’t get your hand held and filled with answers. This explores a lot of mental issues and aspects. I won’t cover them all but you will figure it out soon. As mentioned the story is non linear in parts. Meaning that not everything happens in a straight forward sequence. It’s pretty straight forward at parts and if you pay attention to names you should easily figure it out by the end of the episode/arc.To me the story is the kind that sticks to you. It didn’t make me cry, it didn’t give me depression but it made me think. It made me in some way look at myself at times or wonder if maybe I understood a character a little too much for my comfortability. It’s not a super long story(short arcs) with overarching characters that typically relate to events or characters later. The ending although not what I wanted left me wanting more. There is some light novels although I’ve yet to read them, they are often time mentioned as being master pieces, yet with no experience I cannot say.The next part to discuss is the characters. This is the absolute highlight. Some of the best characters I’ve seen recently. On the surface them seem shallow. I hear alots been cut from the source yet they felt distinctly original. Most operate in a morally grey area so there isn’t a bunch of pure evil people or white knights. Characters are complex and often suffering. Many are dealing with some sort of mental strife. Weather it’s depression, escapism, being a martyr, a messiah complex, or one of many mental states that’s briefly touched upon. No two people are completely alike and all have internal conflict. Even minor characters who appear for a few moments on screen. The arcs are short so the growth seems small for any one character but work often together to form the complex web of whatever arc. I would be a moron to not mention that the Voice actor for Boogiepop is fantastic and incredibly lends to make the character feel  real and leads some credibility to the character making them seem as mysterious as they are.Sound is also fantastic. Boogiepops theme is tone setting and often times very atmospheric. The OP was so good I watched it every episode, which I have only done with a very few select anime. The ending song was not as great but still felt right. The music throughout is so tone setting and perfect that it honestly feels like this anime would drop a whole rank or two if the sound was done by anyone else.Animation is great. The moments of fighting is fluid and fast. This is the people behind one punch man after all. Enough said. The art style I personally loved. Was dark and somber most of the times. It set the atmosphere and made things feel dark, weird and ominous. The character designs aren’t over the top like most anime. They seemed far more realistic, yet they are great enough that it gives a bit of life to certain characters. I would say visually it’s just as good or better than OPM, just set in a far more realistic style.I won’t pretend everyone will enjoy it. The pacing was decent and the story was great but can easily be confusing. Some people can’t handle open ended resolutions or characters. To me with a setting that is supported to be as mysterious as Boogiepop, it adds to the whole thing by having so little definite answers. That’s the part that makes you think and wonder.

You know enough from seeing it to piece together most but unresolved questions will linger.Should you watch? Undoubtedly yes. If you enjoy madhouse, psychological anime, or something that feels distinctively original and different. Nothing you watch will be exactly like Boogiepop. It’s a one of a kind anime in my opinion. It rushes some things and is open ended too much at times but the characters and story are so out side the box that it’s hard to compare it to anything. This is my number 1 most underrated anime. So many people will miss out by never hearing or seeing this anime from lack of word of mouth. Yet I implore you to try it. It’s something you never will know if you may like till you get the taste of it.

Unlike Boogiepop Phantom (2000) which was an anime original, Boogiepop and Others (I will be calling it BaO for convenience sake) is a more faithful retelling of the light novel. Now that some context behind the anime has been given, let\'s get onto the review.Story 8/10BaO has four...arcs and each tells a different story, albeit most of our recurring characters are present with each ""Enemy of the World"" given an arc. The anime follows a non-linear way of storytelling, meaning events are portrayed out of chronological order. A good example of another anime using this would be Kara No Kyoukai (which is amazing). BaO also shifts perspectives quite often, so the same event will be played through the eyes of a different character. This is, in my opinion the greatest strength, and flaw of BaO. By utilizing non-linear narratives and changing our point of view every couple episodes, BaO tries to link everything together creating this convoluted but satisfying web of stories. However, this may just be too confusing for many, and I don\'t blame them as BaO requires multiple viewings to fully understand what the story is trying to tell you, and most people will simply not have the time and patience for that. If you watched the first three episodes and are even slightly intrigued, I suggest you keep watching to see how the story unfolds, but if not, I\'d say it\'s a good indication that you won\'t enjoy the anime that much.Another gripe I have with the anime\'s story is that it is only 18 episodes, and considering the novel had 22 volumes, a lot of the story and characters aren\'t as fleshed out or completely scratched from the anime adaptation. This makes the story feel loose, unfinished, and rushed, so people who have already read the light novel may not taking too much of a liking to how the anime handled the story of the novels. And for the anime onlys, will constantly feel like their missing a part of the story. I would have much preferred if each arc got a 12 episode season instead as all of the arcs have a lot of potential which is unfortunately brushed away due to the time restrictions. However, for someone who is willing to be a little patient with the anime I can guarantee that the story will not only entertain, but leave some food for thought at the end.Overall, the story is worth-watching if you can get past the hurdles and is willing to commit to the anime.Art 7/10I\'d say that MadHouse did a respectable job in terms of art and had some moments of incredible animation, which is to be expected, as MadHouse, whether you like them or not, are responsible for animating many of the most influential anime of the past two decades.Although the art in general is appealing to watch and is consistent for the most part, there are some scenes that leave me baffled due to their subpar quality. One scene that immediately pops up to mind is in episode 17 where we can see two characters with very poor lining, stiff movement, and most importantly, without a face. Albeit it wasn\'t a close-up, it is still noticeable enough to the point where I thought there was something wrong with my internet connection.MadHouse also didn\'t animate BaO in the unique gritty and dark art-style of the novel, giving it a more modernised and generic look to all the characters. This may be to appeal to a newer, younger audience who would prefer to look of the more defined characters, but may be another turn-off for those who have read the light novels. This is a bit surprising as MadHouse showed that they are willing to be faithful to the original art as shown in Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy).To round it off, the art is inoffensive most of the time, sometimes amazing, and pretty terrible in a couple instances.Sound 7/10In regards to sound, I\'d say both the OP and EDs are enjoyable. The OP by MYTH＆ROID is pretty solid, although it\'s not as spectacular as their OP and ED in re:zero, the song is still above average when it comes to anime OPs, and songs in general.There are 3 EDs in the show, with two of them being made specifically for one episode, episode 9 and 18 to be exact. ""Whiteout"" by Riko Azuna is played for the rest of the episodes, and just like the OP, I would say it\'s a solid track. I personally enjoy it, but similar to the anime as a whole, it may not be for everyone.""Sayonara"" by Riko Azuna is the ED that plays in episode 9, and I think more people will enjoy it compared to ""Whiteout"". This song reminds me of Aimer and Milet with powerful female vocals paired with a slower bpm. The fact that Riko Azuna can produce two completely different genres of songs is actually quite impressive and I would say the anime helped me get into her music.""See You, HeartBreakers"" by Kensuke Ushio and Hajime Hyakkoku is the ED that plays on the last episode, and is a track that plays a couple of times throughout the anime. I\'d say that it fits the whole theme of BaO fairly well and it\'s pretty powerful hearing for the last moments of the anime.Speaking of tracks and OSTs, besides ""See You, HeartBreakers"", there aren\'t any other tracks that really stand out neither positively or negatively, I\'d say they did a decent enough job implementing OSTs that don\'t break the flow of the story but not a good enough job in terms of elevating the experience.The Voice Acting was also delivered fairly well, being neither a masterpiece or terrible (I\'m beginning to see a trend here). If there was one thing I\'d like to point out is that Aoi Yuuki did a pretty good job in differentiating Boogiepop and Miyashita Touka without making them sound like two completely different people. I also liked Saori Oonishi\'s performance of Kirima Nagi, and this is important as she is the character we see and hear from the most besides boogiepop.To summarise, the sounds tracks are solid and the delivery from the voice actors are good, especially from the two main characters in Boogiepop and Kirima Nagi.Character 8/10Arguably the anime\'s greatest strength, there were some pretty good characters in BaO like Kirima Nagi, Kuroda Shinpei and the main man/gal Boogiepop. But as the characters are those who are negatively impacted the most from its 18 episode run time, you can expect some characters who fall flat. Having only 18 episodes to complete 4 whole arcs mean a lot of character development is either skipped or rushed. This leads to the ideals of some of the cast not making complete sense as we aren\'t given the time to see them be fleshed out as characters.As the show fits 4 arcs into one, a lot of characters are introduced to the audience without their being ample to time to establish these characters and make us care for them, resulting in a lot of character deaths to be quite meaningless, and lacking the emotional impact it should have. I will be using two case studies from the anime who I think deserved more screentime and character development.Naoko Kamikishiro plays a vital role in the beginning of the novel , yet she has half of her storyline completely scrapped out. While she had numerous impactful scenes in the novel, she barely gets any in the anime in comparison, really losing what made her character interesting in the original work.Kuroda Shinpei, plays a huge role in influencing both of our main characters in Boogiepop and Nagi, paired with his dissatisfaction of his current work, instead wanting to one day fulfill his dream of being a superhero makes him admirable. Many of the characters who met him enjoys his company and it is not difficult to see why. However, Shinpei has a criminally short time on the show compared to the lasting impact he leaves. I wish they spent at least a couple more episodes on him, especially going more indepth on his relationship with pigeon and the a more detailed reason why he made his drastic decision.Another thing to note about the characters is that many people will find it difficult to know exactly which character is which. As so many characters are introduced, with so little time, many of the characters outside our main cast of 8 or so characters are a blur. And when I mean there are a lot of characters, I mean it. Sometimes they introduce multiple characters per episode, and it is really difficult keeping up with all of them, especially because some of the females look very similar (I\'m looking at you Naoko, and those two girls that appear in the last arc). This use of introducing a lot of characters would work if they were all given the time to flesh out their individual personalities.Now to focus on the other two characters besides Shinpei that I liked, Nagi and Boogiepop.Kirima Nagi is the deuteragonist after Boogiepop, and although she could use a little more time to build her character, she is one of the characters the show attempts to flesh out, especially in the ""Boogiepop at Dawn"" arc which primarily focuses on her. Nagi is introduced as a delinquent who\'s up to no good and this is mostly done through the rumours that fellow students have spread about her. These rumours began as Nagi distances herself from others due to her not being \'normal\' having no friends besides Naoko. Although she seems pretentious at first, the show does enough to explain her character. I like that the show doesn\'t show us who exactly the character is until a few episodes in, creating a preconception of Nagi before we even see her for the first time. This is similar to how William Shakespeare uses Iago and Rodrigo to tell the audience about Othello creating an image of the character before they even see him. Even though Nagi appears in a lot of episodes, she is still pretty underdeveloped until the aforementioned ""Boogiepop at Dawn"" arc but after that arc, I believe she is the best character in the anime.I\'m glad that Boogiepop ended up being a fascinating character since they are the other deuteragonist, plus the show is named after them. According to the rumours spread about them, Boogiepop is presented as a reaper of sorts who kills a person when they are at the peak of their beauty, in order to ensure that they can no longer get uglier. Boogiepop, just like Nagi, isn\'t what the rumours says they are, and uncovering their motives and role in life is pretty satisfying at the end. However, it is hard to go further in-depth to Boogiepop\'s character without spoiling the show, so I will refrain from doing so.All things considered, besides the main cast, many of the characters are underdeveloped, and the relationships they build with the rest of the characters seems artificial due to the fact they the audience doesn\'t spend a long time with them enough to justify their ideals and personalities.Enjoyment 8/10Being a fan of psychological mysteries, it was no surprise that I liked the show. As a whole I feel like the show does enough to be entertaining even if you don\'t fully understand what is going on, and uncovering what exactly is going on can be gratifying. I finished the anime in three days, and considering that I haven\'t watched anime besides seasonal stuff for a couple of months, I thoroughly enjoyed the show and will probably rewatch it after one or two years. Although its not one of those shows where you can turn your brain off and enjoy, for those familiar with the supernatural psychological mysteries, it is a show you will most likely enjoy and that I recommend.Overall 7.5/10All in all I can\'t say that the show is a masterpiece. It is far too convoluted and all over the place for the casual anime viewer. However, for those who fit the niche, it is a show that you\'ll remember for quite a while, and for those who don\'t, it\'ll be a major waste of time. Due to the number of flaws I couldn\'t give BaO an 8 or higher no matter how much I wanted to. In my heart the show is a 8 or a 9, but considering that the majority of people won\'t be able to enjoy it, for now, the show is a solid 7.5 out of 10. This ranking may change in the future after my second viewing of the show. In all honesty I wish MadHouse or some other studio will remake it sometime in the future and give it the time it needs to tell such an elaborate story and truly flesh out the characters present in the light novels. Hopefully we won\'t have to wait another 19 years for the next one. arcs and each tells a different story, albeit most of our recurring characters are present with each ""Enemy of the World"" given an arc.

Although its not one of those shows where you can turn your brain off and enjoy, for those familiar with the supernatural psychological mysteries, it is a show you will most likely enjoy and that I recommend.Overall 7.5/10All in all I can\'t say that the show is a masterpiece. It is far too convoluted and all over the place for the casual anime viewer. However, for those who fit the niche, it is a show that you\'ll remember for quite a while, and for those who don\'t, it\'ll be a major waste of time. Due to the number of flaws I couldn\'t give BaO an 8 or higher no matter how much I wanted to. In my heart the show is a 8 or a 9, but considering that the majority of people won\'t be able to enjoy it, for now, the show is a solid 7.5 out of 10. This ranking may change in the future after my second viewing of the show. In all honesty I wish MadHouse or some other studio will remake it sometime in the future and give it the time it needs to tell such an elaborate story and truly flesh out the characters present in the light novels. Hopefully we won\'t have to wait another 19 years for the next one.', ""In my opinion Boogiepop and others is nothing too special. It does not live up to boogiepop Phantom.  Largely due to its lack of incredible soundtrack/design and distinct aesthetic Style that are present in Phantom. Additionally, although Boogie pop and others has more episodes, it is telling four different stories that are only Loosely connected, none of which are as good the single story told Boogiepop Phantom.The whole point of boogiepop is that it is told in an abstract way, it has a bunch of characters and a bunch of different stuff that happens to them, and you aren't necessarily supposed to put...it all together instantly. The characters are also given very realistic designs which means there's nothing visually distinguishing for a lot of the characters. After I finished watching Boogie pop Phantom I was able to make connections that I didn't pick up on while I was Originally watching, for me this enhanced that show by making it all come together,  once I understood what was happening. Although this show was longer it seems as though there is less connections to go back and make, because it's telling multiple stories that aren't really connected.  From my current understanding only the main characters of Boogiepop and the other girl are relevant to stories outside the first and last one. I'm sure there are connections that I missed although I have little inspiration to go and rewatch as it would only help to understand that small section as opposed to the whole story, So the story doesn't all come together, Even if everything is  understood. And the universe isn't interesting enough or explained enough to allow these stories to stand on their own. I know that the original Source material is capable of creating something so much better, as was proven 20 years earlier, I'm not sure why they changed the distinct style to look like every other anime.The intro is kind of odd and only relates to like sort of the Second Story,  it doesn't really serve as a good Overture for the series. Also  Boogiepop kisses with Meeoshta, which is herself, And this is not explained at any point and doesn't really work with the story because Of what is revealed about Boogie pops jealousy.There are certain aspects of the show that I did enjoy, the way in which the story is told, the weird form of Storytelling I often times found enjoyable,  some of the abilities are sort of interesting,  oftentimes character dialogue would point out profound and interesting aspects of the story, There was a fair amount of high quality poetic conversation, often times the way that they talked was cool but what they were talking about was not that interesting Or relevant. I thought the building that the last story takes place in was a pretty interesting original concept, unfortunately it didn't feel like they fully expanded on the building aspect, I honestly wanted the building to start moving, I'm not sure how much this would have helped the story but it would have definitely helped my enjoyment of it, as I of course have an affiliation for anime architecture. I think without Boogie pop Phantom I would have a negative opinion of this show but because this show didn't really take away from Boogie pop Phantom it currently barely sneaks out an average opinion from me.

However, I detest the exaggerated, and often incoherent, cult of anything taken as complex.With that in mind, I decided to write aboutBoogiepop Series, with a greater focus on its 2019 adaptation, but making some comparison to its first adapted anime.In general terms, the story refers to several strange events, sometimes given their mysterious nature, sometimes their supernatural nature, which occur in a certain city. The appearance of a strange and flashy beam of light in the sky of that city, the sudden disappearance of students, a new drug, a serial killer, in addition...to an alleged supernatural apparition, according to popular rumors, of a shinigami: a reaper, a messenger of death, involved in every alleged murder. Added to that, a young girl acting as a vigilante of justice, trying to fight the hidden mysteries of that place.At first glance, Boogiepop Series distills complexity, which is therefore confirmed in its first episodes, out of chronological order, and its constant non-linear writing.But, unlike other works of this follow-up, such as Serial Experiments and Paranoia Agent, Boogiepop Series did not reach as much popularity as these pillars of the genre. In my view, much of the erroneous cult of the complex by parts of people who probably didn\'t even understand about its plots.Without many spoilers that compromise the experience of those who haven\'t watched it yet, Boogiepop, whether in its initial adaptation (Phantom) or in its most recent adaptation (Wa Warawanai), has something very passionate: how much it instigates the listener in the smallest details.The story, in so many moments following a non-linear order, tells us the events from the point of view of different characters. The fact of not being tied to a single protagonist gives us an overview, far from any philosophical-ideological bias, about the functioning of the world and society.Boogiepop, who is more of an observer than a shinigami, a killer of people who reach the height of their beauty (as described in his urban legend). It is a supernatural apparition that manifests itself in Miyashita Touka\'s body to protect the world from the Enemies of Humanity.A dual personality? A strong desire coming from Touka to do something for someone? A strong sense of impunity? We don\'t know for sure what made this supernatural being choose the young student.Contrary to what one might imagine, these enemies of humanity are not just other evil apparitions, with a thirst for world domination, or driven by a strong desire for revenge, as they are in many cliché works that approach the supernatural. Such enemies are any and all beings that, moved by their bad feelings, take attitudes that cause harm to others, including human beings.The human element is what really influences the supernatural aspect. As in Boogiepop Phantom, feelings take physical form through strange insects, in Warawanai, in the arc of the Ghoul of fear, although the doctor is human, she becomes one of humanity\'s enemies due to her committed attitudes.The opposite of this is also valid, when non-humans can be considered defenders and not enemies of humanity.First the Scarecrow who, although he actively contributed to the propagation of the drug that led humans to their evolution, had his moment of redemption, through Boogiepop. Showing us that, even if submerged in such remorse, even in the midst of negative thinking about personal change, if there is a sincere desire, there will be hope.As well as Echos, even though he was an apparition with the potential to be one of humanity\'s enemies, he comes to choose to defend others with the good he received.""Please remember that Suema.

Boogiepop Phantom 2019 pulls off a unique story telling by showing pieces of story and piecing all of them together at the climax consistently. It has multiple arcs that are lightly connected to each other. The downside of this show is, if you are not on the same page with the author with his idea about society, it is really hard to grasp what the villians of the arc abstractly symbolizes in everyday world thus making the show hard to watch. It's uniqueness, different storytelling is a fresh of breath air to those who watched many anime....TL DR: Unique 10/10, but abstract. TL DR: Unique 10/10, but abstract."", 'I’m going to be honest. This show is underrated as hell. Boogie pop was a very unique viewing experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The animation was consistently strong, with a very entertaining story that I loved every second of.Story-8Many people complained that the story was confusing and an incomprehensible mess. I personally understood most of it, even if I was a bit puzzled at times. The story was smart, with a collection of intriguing mysteries. I personally enjoyed the King of Distortion arc. It was trippy, sure, but it was a very unique mystery. It was well paced and interesting. That is exactly what...I want to see from this kind of show.Art-9Consistently strong. The direction was excellent, with some very good action scenes mixed in. It had a few bits that weren’t as impressive as the rest, but overall it was very good. Facial animations near the end of the show were especially impressive.Sound-10I love the music in this show. The opening was a total banger. Myth and Roid never disappoint. The osts used throughout the show were strong, but the opening is still stuck in my head long after my initial watch.Character-6Probably the weakest point in the series. Boogie pop is a relatively interesting character, but many of the villains were slightly.... ah... cheesy. I honestly don’t remember a lot of the characters. It was okay, but not the best.Enjoyment-8I genuinely enjoyed this show! It had a unique atmosphere, plot, and was overall very well executed.Overall-8Definitely give it a watch!

And I had it from the very first episode. Already then I couldn\'t write off some incredibly stupid choices in dialogue writing as mistranslations (by different dubbers/subbers) - and simply by the virtue of some extraordinary authenticity that was radiating even through the idea\'s mediocre execution I was convinced that the author of the source material couldn\'t have been the root of the problem.I can\'t rant about why the show doesn\'t hold a candle to...the ranobe because I never read the ranobe, but some reviews on here do bring evidence into the light, so I wouldn\'t need to anyway. The thing is, that nonetheless, the show was a breath of fresh air.I only started watching the show because I was wondering what kind of show MYTH&ROID\'s \'Shadowgraph\' was an op theme to, but did get invested because something about it stood out from the mainstream inspite of the passable... uhm, everything.

Kind of like in the Bunny-Girl Senpai anime but for different reasons and with literally no other similarities.Even if you will end up noticing that almost none of the characters get unraveled enough for you to care, you probably will care.So yeah, like 8 or something.

If it had been just that though, I would have actually been thrilled to know more and praised the unique directing.What did not convince me was all the rest....The people in the story had this very monotone, uninteresting or frankly ugly design that was coupled with either boring dialogue or jarring statements. From the very beginning there’s a bunch of characters that are thrown to us and swiftly removed before we even begin to recognise their faces.What was most uncomfortable to me was the lack of a main character, or rather the lack of a stable point of view. It’s unclear who the narrator of the first episodes is, and the sense of being left behind only amplifies in the second arc of the anime: new characters out of the blue, unclear character hierarchy (Is this the main character of the new arc? No wait, we’re getting a monologue from this girl now.. But this is all narrated from that other background character’s point of view??), the previous arc and its consequences are as good as gone.I’m not asking for spoon-fed narration but at times it really felt like watching a theatre rehearsal through a keyhole, an incomprehensible, unrelatable sequence of disconnected clips.This to me is an unsuccessful execution of that typical novel structure involving lots of dialogue and slow building before an intense, action filled arc epilogue.Bakemonogatari, for example, comes from and it’s even inspired by the same kind of novel, but it’s worlds apart in terms of anime adaptation. An anime is meant to be watched, and you can’t demand uninterrupted attention and focus from the viewer without giving them a little bit of visual entertainment and pacing. Otherwise you’re be much better off producing an audiobook instead.I get that in the Monogatari series we also see a constant effort in the script in order to be entertaining and light, which does not fit the atmosphere of this anime instead. And yet, I’ve watched verbose, monologue laden mistery-horror anime (such as Shinsekai Yori), that through music, photography, and editing made even the most mind boggling lines go by smoothly and even made you forget about some questionable handling of the storyline.It might be I’m missing the whole point of this anime, but even though I tried, I failed to connect with it in any way, cognitively, emotionally or even just aesthetically, so I’ll end it here.P.S. Huge letdown with the bait PV. Very little connection with the anime stylistically.

It’s unclear who the narrator of the first episodes is, and the sense of being left behind only amplifies in the second arc of the anime: new characters out of the blue, unclear character hierarchy (Is this the main character of the new arc? No wait, we’re getting a monologue from this girl now.. But this is all narrated from that other background character’s point of view??), the previous arc and its consequences are as good as gone.I’m not asking for spoon-fed narration but at times it really felt like watching a theatre rehearsal through a keyhole, an incomprehensible, unrelatable sequence of disconnected clips.This to me is an unsuccessful execution of that typical novel structure involving lots of dialogue and slow building before an intense, action filled arc epilogue.Bakemonogatari, for example, comes from and it’s even inspired by the same kind of novel, but it’s worlds apart in terms of anime adaptation. An anime is meant to be watched, and you can’t demand uninterrupted attention and focus from the viewer without giving them a little bit of visual entertainment and pacing. Otherwise you’re be much better off producing an audiobook instead.I get that in the Monogatari series we also see a constant effort in the script in order to be entertaining and light, which does not fit the atmosphere of this anime instead. And yet, I’ve watched verbose, monologue laden mistery-horror anime (such as Shinsekai Yori), that through music, photography, and editing made even the most mind boggling lines go by smoothly and even made you forget about some questionable handling of the storyline.It might be I’m missing the whole point of this anime, but even though I tried, I failed to connect with it in any way, cognitively, emotionally or even just aesthetically, so I’ll end it here.P.S. Huge letdown with the bait PV. Very little connection with the anime stylistically."", ""Pros:- Voice acting (sub) was very good.  Not only that but the sound design as a whole was very good, also.- Some of the characters (namely Kirima Nagi and her brother) I found to be very well written.  It's always a sign that I find characters well written if I want to know more about them.- Interesting concept revolving around the Boogiepop mythos.  Not quite what I was expecting from this series.  Subverted my expectations in a good way.- The second arc in the series was very good....- Soundtrack was very good also.Cons:- Extremely slow paced, and often very confusing to follow.  Many times I thought about dropping the series altogether because a few times I was so thrown off by how the plot was constructed.  While it does add an extra level of mystery that I could maybe see working in some instances, I don't think it fully succeeded here.- While the artistry was good, but nothing too much to write home about.  It was quite dull and muted most of the time, even when it didn't need to be.  The character designs were alright, though.- Quite forgettable.  I only finished this series earlier this month, and I still can't tell you what happened in some parts.- Too many characters.  This is probably handled better in the light novel, but in the anime they crammed too many characters in before the audience could comprehend who was who.Conclusion:This is a perfectly average psychological thriller series.  Some parts are quite good, but overall there's a lot of better stuff out there in this same kind of genre that you'd have a much better time seeing.  My recommendation is to watch only if you've read the light novel/manga first, and are already a big fan of it.  If that's you, then you may enjoy this more than I did. - Soundtrack was very good also.Cons:- Extremely slow paced, and often very confusing to follow.

I personally have not watched it so I don't have much to add but there's barely any bad reviews with people who have watched the entire show. I heard that once you watch the whole show everything will start to make sense. And I can tell that the people who didn't watch it all the way through were confused and impatient and therefore had a bad take on it.Again, this is coming from someone who hasn't watched the show but by...comparing and analyzing the reviews to the number of episodes watched, you must watch the whole show in order to not only understand it but to enjoy it as well.In conclusion: don't be impatient, watch the damn show. comparing and analyzing the reviews to the number of episodes watched, you must watch the whole show in order to not only understand it but to enjoy it as well.In conclusion: don't be impatient, watch the damn show."", ""Quick take: if you’re looking for an easy going, linear story with easy to remember details, look elsewhere. However, if you like a mystery that takes more than surface viewing, you’ll really enjoy and be rewarded by Boogiepop. It's been a while since I've seen an anime that intrigued me this much.Boogiepop is the type of anime that you need to digest for several hours after you’ve finished it or may even need to view more than once, but I don’t think that's a bad thing . The storyline isn’t linear and often jumps between the beginning, middle and end of an event all while...referencing those moments. It's a knot that you need to unwind yourself to get the whole picture. I, unfortunately, didn’t understand this going in and felt like a kid jumping in the deep end of a pool, unsure how to swim. It was a bit over my head, but coming from a long string of shows that were super simple spoon-fed plots, the complexity of the storytelling is refreshing and reminds me of some of the early shows I watched that got me into anime.Ultimately, you’re immediately thrust into a story all while learning who or what Boogiepop is. As the story unravels, more and more is answered. As long as you can keep track of characters, events and conversations, you’ll find that the nonlinearity is actually a treat and helps keep you interested in the mystery. If I had one complaint about the storyline, it's that the Towa Organization feels unresolved to some extent.The dialogue is important and at times, I felt like I was reading a text book. Every line has some bit of information in it that adds to the overall story and at times, can feel dense. On every level, this show isn’t meant for the casual viewer. This anime needs your full attention.Art wise, I found the show lacking. At times, the animation felt odd and unclean and reminded me of some 80’s anime. While I ultimately didn’t mind it and can acknowledge that it was possibly a stylistic choice, adding to the overall uneasy feeling the show conveys, it just feels unpolished by today's standards. The scenic backgrounds are detailed and enjoyable throughout the anime and make up for a lot of the odd movements of characters at times. Still, the unremarkable characteristics of the characters made it difficult at times to follow who was who. Some of the female characters look similar. Tying this in with the lack of character introduction, it can be difficult to keep track of characters at first.I genuinely love the OP and listened to it every time. It feels so fitting to the overall darkness and atmosphere of the anime. Similarly, the ending theme was enjoyable. The BGM is really good in my opinion, always feels appropriate and isn’t annoying or distracting in anyway. At first you’ll notice that BGM can suddenly cut from one scene to the next going to near silence. This can be unnerving at first, but after a little while, I realized that it makes you feel uncomfortable and I think that it adds to the overall mood of the anime. One thing I realized is that much of this anime centers around being uncomfortable or dealing with uncomfortable things, feelings or emotions. The use of BGM to create that feeling tangibly was brilliant in my opinion.The only complaint I have about characters is that I found some of the females to look similar to each other and that there is a lack of an introduction to several characters. Again, I think this isn’t a bad thing as Boogiepop doesn’t spoon feed a single thing to you. You’re learning as you go along, but it does make it difficult at times to distinguish who is who and who experienced what within the storyline. This is mainly why I suggest a second watch through might be necessary, you’ll gleam more information the second time around. Still, I found the characters to be well portrayed and acting (English) was superb in my opinion. None of the characters are interesting on the surface, but as we learn more, we see that they are all struggling with some type of loss or loneliness, a central theme of the show, adding a depth to their character that makes them feel real and relatable.I really enjoyed Boogiepop. The show isn’t perfect by any means, but added all together, I think there is a brilliance, whether accidental or intentional, that shines through and makes the dark and moody atmosphere tangible. I won’t guarantee that I understand everything about the show, but it had me intrigued start to finish and wrapped up in it's story. That is worth the 18 episodes in itself. If you like mysteries or shows with a central theme that plays out over and over, Boogiepop is an anime for you.This score was rounded up to 9.0.

This series is extremely confusing and fails to help the watcher understand the direction of the story. While some may find the unknown factors of this anime interesting or attractive, I did not. I also found that the pacing of this show was questionable. The setup and execution of the flashback in episodes 2-3 is a perfect example of my complaints. I did not understand the timeline until the very end of episode 3, and had a difficult time understanding the story content throughout...it.The characters were bland, hard to follow, underdeveloped and very cliche.

Well, that's part of it.The original light novel was released in the late 1990s, a time of economic and social hardship in Japan. This may go a long way to explain the novel’s and anime’s darkness and despair, though both are always available in both media. The original series and others...of that era (“Serial Experiments Lain,” and, a few years later, “Ergo Proxy,” for example) begin from a position of crushing hopelessness.Japan is doing better now in many ways, and anime has long since climbed out of onerous anguish as the lone motivation for series in which there is little hope to be obtained. (Yes, there are still plenty of sad anime, but the oppressive overarching idea that all is lost and won’t be found, is no longer high on the list of selling points.) Can a new version of “Boogiepop” find relevance today? more specifically, “Boogiepop and Others” was written in 1998 – can it be tailored to the sensibilities found in the brighter period two decades hence?Yes and no. The 2019 anime seems almost to anticipate the paranoia that would hit the world the following year and the associated lack of preparation of government and science to deal with it, as well as the lingering suspicions that the world has not been told all it needs to know. This mortises nicely with the shadowy organization that figures into the story but that never gets fully explained.In fact, very little gets explained in “Boogiepop and Others,” which employs a little of this – strange spirits – a little of that – zombie clones – and a little of other things – a captured advanced human, evil big organizations, and garden-variety criminals – in its dystopian world building. Oh, and of course an evil genius.The result is a tangled mess, as if they don’t quite know what they’re doing or else they do know but are keeping it a secret from the rest of us, dropping the occasional hint here and there amid all the noise of things that aren’t hints but instead the trappings of the standard school-based anime.The series is brightly colored and well animated, which I suspect kept more people watching when they would otherwise have abandoned it. It is not without its moments, but over all it seems to me to be one of those shows that promises something profound but never delivers it.The one saving grace: After you’ve watched “Boogiepop and Others,” go back and watch 2000’s “Boogiepop Phantom” and learn how obscure and depressing anime sometimes used to be. of that era (“Serial Experiments Lain,” and, a few years later, “Ergo Proxy,” for example) begin from a position of crushing hopelessness.Japan is doing better now in many ways, and anime has long since climbed out of onerous anguish as the lone motivation for series in which there is little hope to be obtained.

The opening is so good and really sets the tone with music, mood, and animation. I love these anime that seek out a cinematic approach like Eden of the East or something of the sort so the budget is of quality (as it should be since this is a reboot). Characters even start realizing they hear the cool music that plays whenever Boogiepop appears. It has style! Now surely the name ""Boogiepop"" doesn\'t sound too engaging and neither does the official premise of ""person who takes girls...away before they get ugly"". And trust me, there\'s a meaning for it, perhaps even a better spelling.Now it IS weird, don\'t get me wrong. I mean this maneater eats people, kisses people to take possession of them (meaning a girl could kiss another girl but they explain it as the maneater being unisex and just switches by taking the appearance of who ""it"" eats.) and a bunch of other powered beings.It\'s a little bit like Durarara in the sense that they tell sort of interweaving stories taking places at different times. Same with Celty being a reaper of sorts with the headless rider and Boogiepop being a reaper of her own merit.Some of it feels like a euphemism displayed through supernatural elements and subliminal (or in some cases, not so subliminal) meanings but I also think that\'s if you choose to view it that way. For example, you could consider this anime to be about girls reaching puberty which can be an overall broad topic as it is but it\'s done like it\'s poetry, through metaphors.

It makes those changes all the more stronger, but I was struggling to keep up with it which is the main reason for why I fell off watching the show and didn't complete it until binging the last third in one sitting just to finally complete it. What Boogiepop and Others (I still don't quite get the title) has going against it is...that its like Full Metal Jacket in that it tells different stories through the runtime even with similar characters, making it feel disjointed. But Boogiepop has even less continuity between the characters that appear or are dropped over the episodes.What I do like is that the confusion does work to give an overall dream-like quality to the show that reminds me of Blade Runner a bit, especially at the end in the big somewhat futuristic looking tower. There are great moments of action and tension building with good lighting and backgrounds, especially from the birds-eye city landscapes. I kind of wish there was more at night from that perspective that the poster and OP hint at. There's all this talk of psychology, emotions, and the human spirit between characters that look alike or are being possessed by a different spirit that makes it hard to focus but it still has moments that hit well and draw me in. There's definitely something here, but I'm too dumb and didn't pay close enough attention to really get it, oh well. that its like Full Metal Jacket in that it tells different stories through the runtime even with similar characters, making it feel disjointed.

The story is about this weird mystery system where good and evil are always fighting, always spawning out of nowhere because one of the other exists. The protagonists are the people seeking to solve these things, until the supernatural trusts itself to beat each other.I have to say, the story was just really mediocre for me. Characters don't follow that much logic, only serving as a medium for the story to continue endlessly until the end. A mystery is established,...with a person following a strange phenomenon in their hearts, or how they're affected by another one with said powers. They discover what's happening, try to fight it, and at the end, the titular, Deus Ex Machina, Boogiepop, appears to set things right. It's a formula, like a monster of the week, with people just doing things to get to the ending. Sure, I cared about some of them, but I can only remember around four characters I wanted to see succeed.The characters, not much to talk about. The third story was probably my favorite, and I have to go on a tangent to talk about that story. A man, whose done nothing good with his life, encounters a person who he can save at the cost of his own. It's such a simple idea, and we see the consequences of his actions taking part on the rest of the series. He's a person who mattered, for as much as he regrets having done something good for the world. Then another person gets involved with that saved one, and it's such a cathartic idea, that good inspires evil to change, and real evil to die. I loved it, and it was the sole reason I finished the anime, since I expected something similar to that story to play out.My interest died after that. I dragged myself to reach the ending, and I didn't get much out of it. If only it was all like the third story, but you know, maybe it's just not my thing. My ADHD brain convinced me that this non-linear structure would tell me an interesting ending to everything, but when they stopped using it, it turned way worse, revealing the real problem. If you can't tell a story unless it's with a gimmick, it's not a good story to tell.4/10. At least the fight scenes are pretty cool. The character designs, though, they really confused me on who was who sometimes.

If you watched the first season, you would feel a bit disappointed. Unlike the first season, this anime doesn't entertain because the story is weird and the pacing is average. For me, this anime is just an alternative story from the main series.Danmachi Sword Oratoria centers the story in Aiz Wallenstein, the sword princess. Sadly, even if Aiz is the main character, there isn't too much information about her past just some sporadic scenes...and the plot centers on her desire of getting stronger. During her adventure into the dungeons, she fought with a person that could know more about her past, and she decides to go into the lower dungeon levels to find the truth. The plot has pacing problems and lacks more information to keep us entertained.While this anime follows the main idea of the Danmachi series, I feel that something is missing. Perhaps some characters aren't well developed and annoying to the point that we could get bored of them. The introduction of some characters is forced or useless, and there isn't enough time to develop their personalities fluently. Maybe the novel is different.The art is standard. Honestly, I was expecting to be better than the first season, but I can say, it is the same.About the songs, the OP is nice, and the ED is passable. The sound mix is good and focuses on the fights details.Finally, nothing is concluded, and nothing about Aiz is told, so in other words, the story failed to deliver any reasonable conclusion, it ends abruptly. It was just a promotion for the novel, buy it to find the truth.Maybe you will enjoy it more if you haven't watched the first season. If you are a fan of the first season, do not expect too much from this or you will get upset, it is just a spin-off. and the plot centers on her desire of getting stronger.

This time around, we\'re going to see the same story from Ais WallenWhatsit\'s point of view, at least, that\'s what I thought was going to happen...Story: In the first, or at least first few episodes, it should be clear that this is in fact the same story of DanMachi. However, instead of focusing on The Misadventures of Bell Cranel, we get to see a different side of things. This spinoff focuses mainly on the cast of the Loki Familia. Yes, the Loki Familia, not just Ais, which is very important to know....Originality: 0/1. I mean, come on now. It\'s like the author suddenly had second thoughts about the original story and how basic it was, so he created this spinoff to add a deeper meaning to everything, just centered around Ais\' character.Potential: 2/2 Although reusing the same story, I\'d say this had a lot of potential. It\'s kind of an interesting thing to see the same events occur from another character\'s perspective; especially the one (Ais) who has the biggest influence over our DanMachi protagonist.Execution: 3/7 :-One of the biggest problems I think this show had was pacing. The first few episodes were a complete drag, and I felt like I was forcing my way through them. The only highlights of the first couple episodes were the moments when Ais came into contact with Bell. Having a slow introduction can really put a damper on the overall feeling of a series, especially one that only spans twelve episodes. I honestly didn\'t even somewhat enjoy an episode until we got to episode four. 3/12 is a fourth of the series. Not a very good start.-I\'d say this show really missed it\'s chance to focus on Ais as the main character. Hopping from her to Lefiya as a protagonist really put a damper on the story. Ais is a big part of the story, but the amount of screen time she missed out on was a sin.-Another problem I had with this series that is a recurring issue from the original was the excessive amounts of fanservice shoved in my face. If Hestia wasn\'t your cup of tea, then Lefiya might make you drop the series all together. Her ""fantasies"" that I\'m sure were supposed to be comedic were way over-the-top and completely unnecessary.- The final episode made zero sense if you have any recollection of the original series and the order events played out. I\'m not going to spoil anything, but there was an event that should have happened but didn\'t which was somewhat aggravating.+ Even amidst all of these negatives, there were some positives. The moments that Ais came into to contact with Bell were just precious, as we got to see a different side to Ais than even Bell got to see. This was exactly what I was hoping for from the series, and I was just a bit sad there wasn\'t more of it.+ The moments the series actually chose to intertwine Ais and the overall story were done pretty well. The motivation for Ais to become stronger is revealed. Best of all, we get to actually see the Sword Princess struggle with some of her battles.Story overall score: 5/10. Although it wasn\'t very original, I\'d say it had a lot of potential. It just chose to execute it in a way that wasn\'t exceedingly interesting.Art:Animation: 2/5. A pretty obvious step down from the original series. The fight scenes seemed far less intense. Their movements were sometimes rough. I mean, seriously. If the best animated scene from the series was taken directly from the original series, we have a problem.Art: 3/5 A serious downgrade, once again, from it\'s predecessor. The setting and scenery were fine. Nothing spectacular. In the scenes with less action the characters were occasionally drawn very sloppily, and it was pretty noticeable Nothing great overall, which is a shame because the first season had fairly decent art and animation.Art score overall: 5/10 Obvious short cuts were taken, but some scenes were pleasing to look at.Sound:Opening: 1/3. It\'s a pretty skip-able opening. Nothing spectacular, certainly nothing I\'d want to listen to on it\'s own. It wasn\'t an opening that got me excited to watch the episode at all, although I guess it was an okay opening for a fantasy genre show.Ending: 0/2. This ending was just bad. Not only was it entirely skip-able, but it didn\'t even make me want to watch the next episode or convey the tone or mood of the show accurately at all.OST: 2/3. The original soundtrack wasn\'t anything particularly special. It had common fantasy instrumentals (you know the ones). There was one track that caught my attention, surprisingly, although it still wasn\'t anything I\'d listen to out of context. The rest of the soundtrack did a decent job of conveying setting and the mood and/or tone of the occurring events. Not a lot of complaints here.Voice: 1/2 The voice actors of the main characters were pretty meh. Lefiya\'s voice was rather annoying and didn\'t really portray emotions well at all. Ais\' actor was alright, but I feel like she didn\'t really conform to the character well enough. Side character voices were decent all around. I\'m a fan of Bete\'s VA, and Finn\'s wasn\'t too shabby, either.Sound score overall: 4/10. Nothing spectacular at all, not that I really expected much. The OST was by far the best part for me.Character: Oh my, here we go. Buckle in, boys and girls, we\'re going on a bumpy ride.Design: 2/2. Not really any complaints here. Their designs are typical fantasy setting, and they\'re easy to tell apart.Enjoyable: 1/3. I did not really care for most of the members of the Loki Familia. I did enjoy watching Ais, Finn, and Bete, but that\'s unfortunately it. Lefiya might be one of the most annoying characters I have ever come across. I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes whenever she came on screen. No, that\'s not an exaggeration. She was that bad. At least the moments with Bell and Ais were fun to rewatch, as were the moments when Ais was fighting. Otherwise, the remaining characters were mostly boring. Although, I have to give it up to that perverted Goddess, Loki. I did enjoy the scenes where she actual showed that she was a pretty cunning woman.Development: 1/5.Shall we break down why?-Lefiya: Oh, hello there Bell 2.0. Lefiya is literally the ""Can I copy your homework?"" meme. I mean, not that another Bell would be particularly terrible, but she was just so much worse. Honestly, combine Bell and Hestia and add in zero character development and an exceedingly annoying personality and voice. There. That\'s Lefiya. Perhaps the worst choice of a main character they possibly could have picked. I can\'t even remember if she was in the first season or not. Not to mention the most annoying aspect of her: It\'s stated that she\'s already has the power of a Level 3 Adventurer, but she\'s /too scared to do anything/ on the battlefield.-Ais: The only reason this got a measly point. I was so glad Ais got at least a tiny bit of character development. Like I\'ve stated previously, the amount of screen time she got was a sin considering I thought this entire season was going to be following her story. But we got her motivation to become stronger, we saw some fights where she did struggle and wasn\'t some OP God being, and best of all we get to see that she seems almost somewhat envious of Bell (who is developing so quickly). We see the reason as to why she agreed to train him in the first place, and that he\'s actually motivating her at the same time. Still no drastic changes in character, but it was a start.-The rest of the cast: Not really any development here. Tiona and Tione were pretty static the entire way through. Although Bete, Finn, and Riveria were enjoyable to watch, they didn\'t change much, either. I will mention Filvis,though. As a new character introduced in this series, I found her pretty interesting and she did get some development. Still, not much.Overall character score: 4/10. Even though they have decent designs, over half of the characters were not even enjoyable to watch, and this series was seriously lacking in the character development departmentEnjoyment: 5.5/10. Despite there being countless flaws to this spinoff, I did kind of enjoy it. If I hadn\'t watched the original series I definitely would not have enjoyed it as much as I did.Overall: 5/10. Although this series can be watched on it\'s own, if you haven\'t seen DanMachi, you\'ll probably enjoy this even less than I did. If you didn\'t like the original season, definitely steer clear. However, if you\'re an avid fan of DanMachi and are eagerly awaiting a true second season, I\'d say you should watch it. It gives a different perspective and a deeper story to the events that occurred in the first season. I haven\'t read the Manga, so I\'m not sure if the storyline here will be necessary to know if we ever do get a true second season, but if you\'re a fan of Ais WallenWhatsit, you\'d probably enjoy this show at least as much as I did. Keep in mind that the latter six episodes are much better than the first six. Or, more enjoyable, at least.Thanks for reading~ Originality: 0/1. I mean, come on now.

Im pretty sure all of you did. But this is my personal opinion and I really dislike lefiya, just overall the way she acts the useless ways she is portrayed kinda pisses me off. When i first saw the release date for the new Danmachi I was really excited for a season 2 of one off my favorite fantasy animes, but when i realized that this was from the point of view of Ais I was kind of dissapointed. Im pretty sure alot you wanted to see a development in a season 2 where we are...able to see Bell the main hero to progress further, but even with that in mind i was fine with having a season 2. But after watching the first episode and encountering one of the ""main"" characters Lefiya I immediately started to realize how FUCKING ANNOYING she was. The story was alright and the fact we got to see Dan machi from Ais\'s view was ok, but the characters really threw me off this season. able to see Bell the main hero to progress further, but even with that in mind i was fine with having a season 2.

The story isn't important because it's the same thing every episode. the main character gets herself stuck in a precarious situation and gets saved by the amazing Aiz Wallenstein. the main because so indebted and obsessed with Aiz she follows her around everywhere she goes and buys her stuff regardless of how rare or expensive because the sword princess is that important. the plot armour is tolerable at least as we get into fights the viewer doesn't really care about each episode.the art is ok. I mean it has to be if it's mostly fighting.the...sound is also ok  but nothing to praise.the characters are either garbage or annoying. we have the great Aiz Wallenstein the girl with no personality yet everyone loves her. she is only good for fighting as she throws herself into fights even when told not to. we have our main character Lefiya which follows Aiz around like a lost puppy as she is weak and hopeless on the battlefield but don't worry like previous main character bell she has something special about her and has a ton of untapped potential.  who cares about the rest of the characters, they're side characters they can't be much better.overall i give this show a 3/10. crap characters, crap story but good fight scenes (that's all it has going for it). things look like they might change pace next episode but they probably won't. unless you're a completionist or someone who just a good fight skip it. and danmachi fans unless you like Aiz (i don't know why you would) you're not going to learn anything you care about. sound is also ok  but nothing to praise.the characters are either garbage or annoying. we have the great Aiz Wallenstein the girl with no personality yet everyone loves her. she is only good for fighting as she throws herself into fights even when told not to. we have our main character Lefiya which follows Aiz around like a lost puppy as she is weak and hopeless on the battlefield but don't worry like previous main character bell she has something special about her and has a ton of untapped potential.  who cares about the rest of the characters, they're side characters they can't be much better.overall i give this show a 3/10. crap characters, crap story but good fight scenes (that's all it has going for it). things look like they might change pace next episode but they probably won't. unless you're a completionist or someone who just a good fight skip it. and danmachi fans unless you like Aiz (i don't know why you would) you're not going to learn anything you care about."", 'TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.I\'d like to preface this review with saying I general don\'t review sequels or side stories, because you\'ll find me usually saying it was as enjoyable, slightly less enjoyable, or slightly more enjoyable than the first or original story. This show has forced me to turn it into an exception.Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria (which is a goddamn mouthful), better known as DanMachi: Sword Oratoria, is a spin-off side-story that shows the main story but from a different perspective. Who\'s perspective?...The Loki Familia\'s, but more importantly from Ais\' perspective.The entire idea of the show started out well, being able to see things from how Ais saw them, but it very quickly degraded into watching Lefiya be the worst tsunyuri girl ever, every episode. For one reason or another, they thought Lefiya\'s ""I have great potential but currently am fucking useless"" mixed with ""I love and look up to the girl that\'s my senior/hero"" was going to end up with a good character. They could not have done worse with her. The constant naivete coming from Lefiya, the constant whining, the constant not being able to do anything remotely useful (until the very end), and the constant frustration that she gave me as a viewer was just horrendous. She alone destroyed the fun that this show could\'ve given me.On the topic of characters other than Lefiya who is probably one of the worst this year alone, every other character has the emotion or depth of a fucking brick, which is painfully tough and flat as an airway run strip. Ais continually acts like a robot whilst showing very little emotion, the twins are just there to be supporting characters and don\'t ever break that trend, Bete is an angry dick, and the three seniors are all very stiff. Loki probably portrays the most emotion, going from trying to cop a feel on anybody, to somewhat serious on certain matters. The best part of this show was seeing Bell and Hestia, which is just painfully ironic in this scenario.The story revolves around Ais and the Loki Familia and how Ais goes from being mistaken as her mother to some darker things that may bring the world to ruin. Or something like that. The story in all actuality was less important than they made the character interactions out to be, and those as previously mentioned was like watching paint dry for 12 weeks. Other than some new characters that you can only see through Ais\'s perspective, Sword Oratoria was made out to be far darker than the original story from Bell. This didn\'t play out well because the original story did well as a lighthearted fantasy/adventure show. The story was like watching an extremely convoluted game of Clue with DanMachi characters, and then some fighting instead of guessing who the killer is.One of the redeeming features of Sword Oratoria was that the art and animation were at least somewhat pleasing to look at in some situations. Some fight scenes were nicely done, some nice screenshots to be taken, but it never went up and beyond the ""average"" level that it had maintained through 12 episodes. The soundtrack was so laughably forgettable that I can\'t even really make a remark on it anymore in terms of whether it was good or not.TL;DR: DanMachi: Sword Oratoria is a waste of 12 episodes that could\'ve been put towards making a second season instead. All you\'ll get from this is how much you realize Bell and Hestia were the best part of DanMachi, and how the characters in this are painful to watch. I would not recommend this unless you really don\'t mind how awful the character and story are.

But I gave it a chance, and I'm sure glad I did. Let me quickly tell you why.This anime follows Ais' story, which goes on in the same time period as the first DanMachi series. It isn't a retelling of the first DanMachi and it isn't the continuation. It's something new (story-wise) but familiar (setting-wise/the big picture). It ended up providing valuable information to flesh out some characters that weren't explored too in-depth in the first DanMachi, and giving a new...viewpoint on the same oncoming disaster that was hinted at in the first DanMachi. Even if you had regarded this anime as a stand-alone, it is really good and really interesting.Like in the first DanMachi, this anime has a well developed plot—good pacing, good foreshadowing, and it effectively shares information (about events, characters, etc) without it seeming fake or boring. In this way, characters are developed naturally. And about the art—of course, it is a favourite aspect of mine (I love DanMachi art).Overall, it was really fun to see Ais' perspective and to learn about where she came from and to watch her develop. She became more than that beautiful human doll I was introduced to in the first DanMachi.In essence, I recommend watching this show—especially if you liked the first DanMachi.

Even as a stand-alone (like I said) it's a great show."", 'Is a spinoff of Danmachi with an alternative view focusing on Aiz, one of (for LA at least) the least interesting harem members to be given a spinoff series a good idea?.<LA breathes in>...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria is an interesting yet odd spinoff from the many many MANY sequels and spinoffs anime to come out of Spring 2017. LA wasn\'t exactly clamoring for a spinoff based on Aiz as LA is one of those fans of Danmachi wanting just more from Bell and Hestia than to Aiz though this spinoff looking at an alternative view of...how events occurred in the original is a nice touch in a ways.<LA breathes in>...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria\'s characterization is focused towards Aiz as well as Lefiya Viridis voiced by Juri Kimura a fangirl of Aiz, though Lefiya is more as a similar Bell but with a similar motive of wanting to protect others by leveling up in this case trying to catch up to Aiz as well as worshiping her. Aiz on the other hand has character development in terms of her backstory and how this links to the major villain of this spinoff. This at least is interesting and gives us depth to one of the least interesting harem member of Danmachi. Aside from that, other characters are typical supporting characters with some personality to them as well as fleshing out the Loki Familia as a Guild from Bete Loga voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto the hair-tempered berserker, Tiona Hiryute voiced by Rie Murakawa and Tione Hiryute voiced by Minami Takahashi, Riveria Ljos Alf voiced by Ayako Kawasumi and Loki voiced by Yurika Kubo the perverted leader of the Familia, which by the end of it, the majority of the supporting characters got fleshed out better than Lefiya did, especially showing us that Bete isn\'t the asshole jerk character or showing the Hiryute twins and especially Riveria a glass cannon badass mage and LA\'s favourite character in Sword Oratoria.Now because this spinoff is having plot beats following the original, this spinoff does have some new material, that one being an interesting plotline that involves Aiz and the major villain, her plans and is probably the only interesting plotline to all the new things Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria does as it integrates both the Gods and behind the scene dealings to connecting to Aiz\'s past and her dilemma about being a powerful swordswomen and what her connection to this plotline has on her. The rest of the plot elements especially the slice of life are kinda a bore to constant running gag annoyance with fanservice moments any chance it gets and is just a guise for the build up and hinting to the plans of the major villain is focusing on, something even it\'s original somehow did quite well (albeit the original\'s major villain never springs into action or goes anywhere as it\'s a more focused look at Bell\'s progression to be a better adventurer, where in this spinoff, the major villain is a HUGE focus and takes a somewhat more serious take compared to the original).Probably one of the biggest gripes Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria does is on Lefiya as a character, at first she\'s the fangirl wanting to be like Aiz and is a shy one at that, but by the end of the anime, she becomes a vindictive psycho lesbian wanting Aiz all to herself (slight exaggeration but the anime frames Lefiya like this and it crosses the line out of comedic effect) and sees Bell as competition. Either way, Lefiya\'s portrayal at first was pretty good and especially when revealed she like Bell is a pretty powerful magic user under that timid nature, but due to her static nature and never evolving or developing outside of these traits, she becomes a character LA would not root for or care one iota about. The only other character annoyance comes from Loki who does the entire yuri groping thing to Aiz or any big-breasted woman -sigh-. The only other lacking aspect Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria doesn\'t have compared to the original is the aforementioned slice of life moments that feels more like build up than progressing with the plot, to it\'s defense due to this plot simultaneously coinciding with it\'s original, it\'s kinda hard to add good flow to the plot when it needs to abide by it\'s original series but then LA can counter it by saying it turns into chess piece story telling with ""some"" substance to it and by LA sees by this later down the anime aside from a few new character development from Filvis Challia voiced by Hisako Kanemoto and Lulune Louie voiced by Hikaru Akao and a bit of world-building through Loki, it\'s chess piece storytelling using the original series as it\'s crux and the major villain egging Aiz on to be stronger or go here or there doesn\'t help.In terms of animation by JC Staff, the animation overall is ok enough though there are some dips in quality at times and although the anime is rehashing moments from it\'s original, LA is glad they just didn\'t copy and pasted it just like that and given us differing perspective of certain events. The battles once again are a standout but again also takes dips in quality at times to. The character designs are polished to a certain level of detail and has the detail to be similar to it\'s original, typical of a spinoff in a ways, LA isn\'t complaining. Overall, the animation is ok enough for LA to neither rage or a praiseworthy mention about.In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is typical fare only with the hugely expanded voice cast. Saori Oonishi as the stoic emotionless Aiz is meh in LA\'s opinion but she ""tries"". Juri Kimura, well LA is gonna compare her to Satomi Arai as Kuroko and say that she\'s not as bad, but she can get annoying when in obsessive fangirl mode and here\'s the thing, LA actually enjoyed Satomi Arai as Kuroko even at her worst of times, Juri Kimura as Lefiya has her annoying moments but LA is more or less projecting with this criticism. But once again, like the animation it\'s ok enough for LA to neither rage (a bit) or praise about. LA\'s favourite voice actors would go to Rie Murakawa and Minami Takahashi as the Hiryute twins AS well as Ayako Kawasumi as Riveria.So Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria has a few problems with it\'s plot beats, some character annoyances and annoying fanserviced slice of life moments but does that mean even with it\'s saving graces of an interesting yet serious plotline and alternative look at similar events from the original means it\'s a good spinoff???...for that LA says that this spinoff is an interesting case of trying to be like it\'s original while at the same time whistling to a different tune, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria is that it\'s not great but it\'s not bad either as it expands the world building of Danmachi, however if comparing to it\'s original, it feels a bit of a step back from it\'s original series, not from it\'s differing atmosphere and characters as even atmosphere had times where it fitted into the serious nature of the major plotline of the major villain of this spinoff and certain outside of Lefiya like Filvis, Bete and Riveria got their limelight moments but because it\'s trying to emulate it\'s original while doing something completely different instead and it does work to an extent but it\'s blunt execution of chess piece storytelling deterred LA from liking this spinoff as much as LA wanted to.Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria, your not a bad or horrible of a spinoff but your definitely one of the more unremarkable spinoffs LA has seen. how events occurred in the original is a nice touch in a ways.<LA breathes in>...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria\'s characterization is focused towards Aiz as well as Lefiya Viridis voiced by Juri Kimura a fangirl of Aiz, though Lefiya is more as a similar Bell but with a similar motive of wanting to protect others by leveling up in this case trying to catch up to Aiz as well as worshiping her.

Staff and is based on a Light Novel of the same title.This is a side story of the original DanMachi, and this review will contain comparisons from the original show, meaning that I presume the reader has watched it.Story: 5The story revolves around... What does the story really revolve around? Our original thoughts about the show was that it would be about Aiz and see things from her perspective, but this is not true for the most part.We instead follow an array of characters through an array of events, and some...of them are the exact same events and frames that were used in the original.The show can basically be summarized into 5 points:""The main plot"" being something mysterious with wild plant monsters.Aiz\' backstory or something similar.Lefiya getting stronger mentally.Shared frames to original to show where the show is on the timeline.Fanservice.The first 3 are obviously the main plot, while the second 2 are pretty much filler material.Nothing stands out as exceptional, and quite a bit of it is low quality.Art+Animation 5The animation in this show is pretty generic, ranging from character design to monsters and ambience. While it\'s not terrible in any way, it\'s definitely not good, and this is year 2017 - if the animation is bad, other parts DEFINITELY have to make up for it. Onihei is a decent example for this.If anything, the art has declined from the original, pointing at a question: Is the budget for this show lower than for the original one?Sound: 5The sound is pretty similar to the art/animation. There are no impressive OSTs, and the OP/ED are both quite bland. There is nothing wrong with character voices, the characters are just not interesting enough to really be able to call it more than decent.I have to lower the score a bit more due to how badly composed the OSTs are, especially in and between fight scenes.Character: 4Here\'s a core problem of the show. The original story had most of our current ""main crew"" as situational SUPPORT characters who showed up in a couple episodes. The only above average characters we currently have are Aiz and Loki, but since they don\'t receive the screentime of a ""real MC"", they don\'t pave the path for this show either.The design for our ""main crew"" is very fitting for the word support characters. Lefiya (MC?) is a completely useless character who will probably save the day in a future episode, the problem is that: Bell Cranel from S1 had the vibes and screentime of a REAL MC even if he wasn\'t too great. Lefiya does NOT have any of these traits, and feels more like a target for future plot armor.Enjoyment: 5I would originally have posted a worse score here, but the last part of Ep4 caught me slightly by surprise, I will have to keep looking and see if they progress it into something good.1 good or interesting scene is not enough to instantly sway me on my score, especially since EVERY SINGLE SCENE prior to this has been low in quality.Overall: 6.8Although the overall score definitely does not add up to the other numbers, this is the ""value"" of this show if compared to other scores on MAL.The show definitely beats everything around 5-6.5, which means that giving it a ranking according to my scores for its\' attributes would be unfair. It would also be unfair to give this show higher rankings for its\' content than it deserves, thus I only raised the overall ranking.Is it worth a watch? I don\'t know yet.Should I watch this if I haven\'t watched the original? - I believe the original beats this in quality, so watch that INSTEAD.Will update this review at 8/12 episodes. of them are the exact same events and frames that were used in the original.The show can basically be summarized into 5 points:""The main plot"" being something mysterious with wild plant monsters.Aiz\' backstory or something similar.Lefiya getting stronger mentally.Shared frames to original to show where the show is on the timeline.Fanservice.The first 3 are obviously the main plot, while the second 2 are pretty much filler material.Nothing stands out as exceptional, and quite a bit of it is low quality.Art+Animation 5The animation in this show is pretty generic, ranging from character design to monsters and ambience.

While i thought the first one was fun and all it just couldn't get my attention that much.  But overall i did enjoy the first season and gave it a pretty good review besides the fact of it having an OP character and almost up to terms of what could be called a haremThis is kind of the same season kind of holds the same opinion as the first one.While in my opinion overall better than the first season it was kind of hard to keep my attention....It doesn't really suffer from the same problems as the first and i'll get into the problems in a minute.~~ Spoilers ~~Gonna try to keep away from the actual storyLefiya: First let me start out by saying that for some weird and unknown reason instead of having the entire story be focused on Ais and herself. The story decided to add a new character named Lefiya. She is a very not needed character. Because she is in this we now have two main character Ais and Lefiya.Lefiya isn't a bad character in my opinion. But she is more of a side character that is in the main character group. All throughout the entire series she has a crush on Ais. This in it's self isn't bad idea but the way they did it was not good. A lot of the time she can come off as annoying as she fantasizes over the two of them going out. Overall she doesn't add anything to the plot and takes up space that we the audience would rather be spent on Ais.Ais: Had really always been the most interesting character from the start. So when i found out she had her own season with her as the main character in the story. Too the stories credit it does give a good story and everything too Ais. I wish that the story focused more on her. But overall it was fun.Something that always bugged me in the first season it had always bugged me that Bell ( MC ) Is super powerful and has these amazing skills never before seen. The entire time i was wanting him to not reach his goal of reaching the power level of Ais. I felt like it would be more interesting for Bell too find out that not everything can happen like he wants. Thankfully in this it kind of elevated my frustration with that. It shows that Ais is still more powerful and is likely to get more powerful and stay like that.Something else that bugged me of the first season was that there was signs of it becoming a harem. Harems are a cancer to stories and annoying. Through out the first season it at times seemed like Ais would be in the Harem. But in this Ais doesn't even seem interested in him. She seem's more interested in being more powerful and spending time with her friends.~~ SPOILERS OVER~~In the end this was something i enjoyed more than the original  even with it's flaws. Would recommend watching the first season first than this but it's not needed. It doesn't really suffer from the same problems as the first and i'll get into the problems in a minute.~~ Spoilers ~~Gonna try to keep away from the actual storyLefiya: First let me start out by saying that for some weird and unknown reason instead of having the entire story be focused on Ais and herself.

Would recommend watching the first season first than this but it's not needed."", ""I would like to state in my review more reasons why the anime is worth watching because, from what I see until now, it is a bit underrated and very criticized.I started watching Sword Oratoria after I saw the original DanMachi, and to my surprise the stories aren't related at all, even though you might see the two story lines intertwining here and there. This anime is focused not only on Ais but the whole Loki Familia, it has many new characters and it provides a different point of view on an adventurer's life.The plot is pretty good, it has a lot of...mysteries in it and it's quite unpredictable, since at this point I can't really figure out how the whole thing is going to end and who's on the good side, and who's with the bad guys. It also has plenty of action, to be honest I wouldn't mind more fighting scenes but it's not boring + if there's no action, it means you get some fanservice.The animation style is pretty similar to the original DanMachi. If you liked that one, you'll like this one too. In my opinion the animation is simple, there's nothing special or unique about it that could draw your attention. It's not bad either but it could be better.The sound is ok, like I mentioned about the animation too, it's plain, not special, nor annoying.The worst part about this anime is that the characters (up to this point) do not show any evolution. In the 1st one you could have seen Bell growing and becoming stronger but here there's nothing. No one really improves, they just reveal stuff about each other and about their past and what made them become who they really are. However, it's interesting to see things from Ais' point of view, personally I find her quite interesting and there are some things from the original series that make more sense now, after understanding how she thinks and how the Loki Familia works together. Plus, I have the impression that the antagonist in this anime might be constructed better than the main character and we don't get to see this often.Overall it is an enjoyable anime. I will definitely continue watching it until it ends. It isn't as good as the first one but it has enough good points that make it worth watching! mysteries in it and it's quite unpredictable, since at this point I can't really figure out how the whole thing is going to end and who's on the good side, and who's with the bad guys.

Although season 2 will be coming out soon. Don\'t expect this to be as comical as the first season either, it has a more serious tone to it (should\'ve read the genres).This is backstory for the ""Sword Princess"" or better known as Ais, it offers her day to day interactions with her familia and how she also meets Bell in her point of view and what she thinks of him. The story also revolves around another character not given a lot of screen time in the main series,...Lafiya, to me personally comes off as annoying and useless, she also has a lesbian side to her when she talks to or about Ais she seems a little too fond of her. This season was meant to capitalize on the character development needed for many of the supporting characters from the first season, Ais is a quiet person who doesn\'t talk much, and is bad at expressing her feelings through words and often , comes off as dull for the most part. Lafiya was barely even mentioned, and her interactions did seem pretty random but this side story really helped explain the trouble that seemed to revolve around Ais. It also makes you appreciate the side characters much more.Story: 7 The story was weak compared to the main stories, it was a little all over the place, but it did offer explanations the main story didn\'t and had a nice pacingArt: 8 Well done like the first seasonSound: 7 I watched the dub and very much enjoyed the voice actors chosen, the music was also pretty goodCharacter: 8 This side story offered a lot of character development that the main story didn\'t, and offered a new perspective of the importance of the supporting charactersEnjoyment: 3 I knew this wasn\'t a season 2 of the show but I was expecting it to have the comedic side which is what made me really enjoy the first season, and I thought I would see Bell a lot more too, the show was too serious for my taste, and even in the parts that were supposed to be funny I didn\'t even laugh all that muchOverall 6.6 but we\'ll round it to a 7 Lafiya, to me personally comes off as annoying and useless, she also has a lesbian side to her when she talks to or about Ais she seems a little too fond of her.

It also makes you appreciate the side characters much more.Story: 7 The story was weak compared to the main stories, it was a little all over the place, but it did offer explanations the main story didn\'t and had a nice pacingArt: 8 Well done like the first seasonSound: 7 I watched the dub and very much enjoyed the voice actors chosen, the music was also pretty goodCharacter: 8 This side story offered a lot of character development that the main story didn\'t, and offered a new perspective of the importance of the supporting charactersEnjoyment: 3 I knew this wasn\'t a season 2 of the show but I was expecting it to have the comedic side which is what made me really enjoy the first season, and I thought I would see Bell a lot more too, the show was too serious for my taste, and even in the parts that were supposed to be funny I didn\'t even laugh all that muchOverall 6.6 but we\'ll round it to a 7', ""Better wait for the return of Belle and company.Aiz is a boring character to be the main in a complete season.It doesn't matter the amount of fanservice that is forced upon the viewer, it won't compensate the lack of character development and plot.The Loki Familia are a really boring cast to root for, since they're supposed to be one of the strongest Families in the series, there's no hardships for them to endure.The only glimpses of hope for this side story, are the scarce moments when it entwines with the main story, but since this moments where already shown in the first...season they don't have the same impact as the first time.If you like the first season, YOU WON'T ENJOY THIS BORING SIDE STORY. season they don't have the same impact as the first time.If you like the first season, YOU WON'T ENJOY THIS BORING SIDE STORY."", 'Personally, I was kind of scared of what they\'d do with this second season after having watched the first, and absolutely loved it, and heard that they weren\'t going to continue with Bell but look at Ais\' perspective but I started watching anyway and it started off not looking great. I wasn\'t really finding what I enjoyed so much about the first season, the ""shonen"" that I\'ve been looking for during all these years of anime watching where the noble main despite having nearly been killed stands up as a shield to protect his nakama (friend ^^) and nearly kills himself in the process like...you find in some of the big anime like One Piece and Gintama (only certain episodes of Gintama and yes, I have simple tastes when it comes to anime, please don\'t judge me :D). Anyway, the character they seemed to be focusing on at the start, which wasn\'t Ais, just made me want to hit my head against a wall. But I endured, seeing a few bits of the intrigue from season 1 develop was making my curiosity grow and after about episode 3 I started to really enjoy it, but not for the same reasons as season 1. The unfolding of the plot that had been put forward in Bell\'s season who had unravelled very little was what got me into it so much, and the characters also became a lot more enjoyable.So there you go, basically, it started off very shaky but after 2-3 episodes, I was fully into it. I think that the shaky start was probably because I was partially expecting to be dissatisfied with it so I recommend that if you enjoyed season 1, go into season 2 with an open mind and once you’re through episode 2, you should be hooked. you find in some of the big anime like One Piece and Gintama (only certain episodes of Gintama and yes, I have simple tastes when it comes to anime, please don\'t judge me :D).

While largely following the events of the main anime series this anime also adds in events that Ains and her friends faced in that time frame.Story overviewThe overall storyline for Dungeon ni Deai Sword Oratoria largely follows the events of the anime that this anime was spin off...from but tells the events of that story through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya and other members of their familia. While largely following the original storyline this anime also adds in several events and story arcs that are unique to Ains and Lefiya. In common with modern anime storytelling methods the overall plot of the series includes a number of sub plots and arcs that are intermingled with the main storyline. The Main focus for the series’ main storyline is on two points which is the evolution of Ain’s personality so that she becomes more human and less cold and for Lefiya it’s to master her fear while also developing her skills as a mage.AinsAins Wallenstein voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Clockwork Planet and Denpa Kyoushi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two heroines in this series. An adventurer of some renown within the world Ains is known as the sword princess to her both her fans and to her fellow familia members for the simple fact that she is both beautiful in appearance and deadly with her blade. Notably Ains develops two different personalities as the series progresses which also serves as one of the main points of the series story. In the beginning of the series Ains was a quiet person that while skilled in combat and having a determination to both win battles and glory for her familia did not interact much with her familia and its members. Though clearly idolized by the younger members of the familia and respected by the more veteran members Ains at this point seems to be content with being quiet and as such she was hard to approach by anyone and not someone that many within the familia got to know well though not from a lack of trying. As a result of putting up walls around herself Ains can be somewhat naive with her manners and how she reacts to situations such as her struggle to apologize to Bell during her arc.As the series progresses however and as a result of interacting more with her friends and fellow familia members especially Lefiya and the twins Ain’s personality starts to change as she starts to open up her personality. Though she doesn’t exactly become more talkative Ains becomes more sensitive to the feelings of others and more understanding of the people around her. More importantly she also began to be more trusting and willing to place her trust in her allies and friends in the familia as well. I felt that Ain’s development from a beautiful but unapproachable warrior to one that was obviously more happy and positive and trusting was done pretty well and it was nice seeing Ains be able to interact more with her fellow familia members. After all, in such a group if you are unable to trust someone with your back in combat then that person is a liability no matter how powerful they are on their own. One of the main plots for the series overall storyline is related to Ains past which I felt was quite interesting and helped determine why Ains personality was like that to begin with. It also explained why Ains is so determined to become strong as well. The character of Ains and her subsequent development as a character in the series I felt was done pretty well and it was nice that Ains at the end was able to have more trust in her allies and friends and that she is now approachable by her fellow familia members. Saori Oonishi I felt did a pretty good job portraying the character of Ains.LefiyaLefiya voiced by veteran seiyuu Juri Kimura of Seiren fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two heroines for the series. A young elven mage of the Loki Familia and a second-class adventurer that due to her immense magical ability is being tapped to replace her master Riveria one day. Personality wise Lefiya is a positive, cheerful and innocent person that in the beginning of the series was a bit of a klutz and as a result got scared rather easily. However, despite that Lefiya perseveres in her attempts to be strong as her main motivation for being in the familia is to be near her idol Ains which she idolizes and views as something akin to a hero figure in her life.Although relatively weak and easy to get scared in the beginning of the series as the series goes on Lefiya like Ains starts to develop into a better person and character after finding the reason and determination that she needed in order to motivate her and start her drive to become strong. As a result of this development Leafiya becomes braver, more determined and more willing to take a stand to protect not just herself but also her friends and allies as well. Lefiya’s most prominent personality trait is arguably her earnest and determined nature and the fact that she is always willing to believe in the best of people. As a result of this Lefiya is one that doesn’t give up easily and once she set on doing something she’s determined to finish it no matter what. The friendship that Lefiya managed to forge with Filvis is a great example of this personality trait of hers.As a character Lefiya was very similar to the original anime’s main character Bell in that both were pretty weak to start with but both began to get stronger as they found the reason and motivation that they needed to become strong. While in Bell’s case it was to help repay the kindness that his patron god Hestia gave him for Lefiya it was her determination to be of use to both her hero Ains but also to the familia and her friends that support her. while Lefiya’s personality improved significantly over the series this wasn’t the only thing that improved as Lefiya’s ability and her true ability also manifested as a result of these changes. While she may have been weak in the beginning and vulnerable to fear and pressure the Leafiya that stood in the latter part of the series was anything but weak as by mastering her fear and learning new spells from her friends and allies have really made her a force to be reckoned with.  I felt that as a character Lefiya was developed pretty well and that her seiyuu Juri Kimura really did a great job voicing her.RiveriaRiveria voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayako Kawasumi of Fate stay night fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Ains and Lefiya’s main allies in the familia. A veteran mage that heads the mage division within the familia and charged with training them Riveria is also a member of the familia’s upper command echelon being old friends with Finn and Gareth. A calm and composed woman that’s also wise and perceptive Riveria serves as the voice of reason and logic within the guild and helps tamper the tendency of her familia members from going wild. Being both a veteran mage and a member of the command echelon Riveria is both a powerful mage and adapt at reading the battlefield and as a result often acts as the second in command to the guild when Finn is otherwise engaged. As a result of her skills Riveria is powerful combatant and seems particularly adept at casting large scale AOE attacks that are both large in scale and powerful to a fault. As a result of being a founding member of the familia alongside that of Finn and Gareth Riveria is someone that is familiar with both Ains past and Lefiya’s struggles which actually enable her to support both when they need help. As the series progresses and as both Ains and Lefiya change and improve both their personalities and their skills Riveria is there to support them and guide them along the correct path. Though only a support character I felt that Rivera had an important role in ensuring that both Ains and Lefiya were able to find their motivations and reasons for getting stronger and guide them so that it helps them the most. I felt that her seiyuu Ayako Kawasumi really did a great job portraying the character of Riveria.RevisRevis voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Ohara of Fairy tail and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the support characters in the series and serves as one of the main villains in the series. A powerful adventurer that Ains and the familia meet during their investigation into strange events on one of the lower floors of the dungeons that lay beneath the town in which they reside Revis is someone that was deeply connected with Ains past and is an important part of that particular sub plot for the series. A formidable swordswoman that is extremely powerful and able to go toe to toe with Ains and still win Revis is a pretty mysterious person who seems to know a great deal about Ains family and seems to perceive Ains as her mother for some reason. While a formidable fighter Revis’s personality is hard to determine due to her mysterious nature but it can be seen that she is a quiet and determined person who is also highly motivated for her own goals. At the same time, it can be seen that she isn’t loyal to anyone but herself and will think nothing off turning against her own allies if the situation turns against them. While Sayaka Ohara did an excellent job in portraying Revis I feel that this character could have been expanded upon a lot more though her role in the series I felt was pretty clear cut in that she served mainly to motivate Ains to get stronger.FilvisFilvis Challia voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Lefiya’s main allies in the series. An elven magic swordswoman with a somewhat icy disposition at first Filvis is somewhat different from the other allies that Lefiya meets in the series as Filvis is from a different familia and they only met by chance when their familia’s cooperated for a mission. In the beginner of the series Filvis was a bit of an enigma to both her familia members and her god that she protects. In the beginning of the series Filvis was shown to be very dutiful to her patron and at the same time very loyal. However, at the same time it’s also shown that she is very quiet to the point of being antisocial. As the series progresses it become clear that this was tied to a terrible battle in the past where out of all her friends and comrades that were dispatched to hunt down a nasty cult she alone survived. As a result of this event Filvis’s which was positive and determined back then changed to one that was downcast, quiet and unwilling to make friends or allies and also resulting in her putting up walls around herself to protect herself from her perception that she brings ruin to everyone that tries to be nice to her.Filvis’s past and her redemption forms part of Lefiya’s plot line and was one story arc that I really liked as in addition to seeing how determined Lefiya is to help a person that she just met I also came to understand and sympathize with the reason that caused Filvis turn into such a downcast and unsociable person.  And in the end, I was that that Filvis was able to take out the monster that was the cause of her trauma and also at the same time be able to strike up a friendship with Lefiya and also help her train and become a better person as well. Filvis’s new personality which is much more positive and cheerful and more importantly talkative was nice to see. She also looks so cute when she’s embarrassed when she’s around Lefiya as well. I felt that Filvis was a pretty well-developed character that was similar to Ains and Leafiya in that she too had something that she to overcome in order to be strong but in her case, it was also to recover from her trauma as well. I felt that Hisako Kanemoto really did a great job portraying her.Arms and animationIn regard to the art that was used for this series I felt that the character designs for the new characters were pretty well done. Although we already seen Ains and Bete in the original anime I felt that the character designs for new characters like Lefiya and Filvis was pretty well done. The environments that were shown in the series I felt were also pretty well done. One aspect of art that I particularly liked in this series was the design of the monsters that the cast faced with the major ones looking pretty cool and scary in equal measure. In regard to the animation I felt that overall animation was pretty good but it’s in combat scenes that the series shines at. I felt that the combat scenes were done pretty well in the series especially the last climatic battle.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done and I felt that each of the characters in the series was portrayed reasonably well by their respective seiyuu’s and voice actors. Particular praise however I felt should go to Saori Oonishi, Juri Kimura and Hisako Kanemoto who voiced the characters of Ains, Lefiya and Filvis respectfully as I felt that they did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. Sayaka Ohara and Ai Kayano who voiced the characters of Revis and Andromeda respectfully also I felt did a great job in voicing their characters though I felt that Revis should have had a larger role in the series.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with the scene music being appropriate for each of the scenes that required it. The opening theme for the series which was Re- Illusion was sung by veteran singer Yuka Iguchi and was actually quite catchy and conveyed the sense of happiness like meeting some old friends that you haven’t seen in some time. The ending theme for the series was day by day which was sung by Kano and had a positive and upbeat tune to it that seems to covey the thought that each day is an adventure and that you should always look forward to the next day and what that brings to you.Overall conclusionIn overall Dungeon Ni Deai was an interesting anime that’s a bit different to what I seen and reviewed before. This comes from the fact that Dungeon Ni Deali is a spin off from an existing anime and takes place in the setting that was established by it rather than featuring a new setting entirely. The strong points that makes Dungeon Ni Deali Sword Oratoria such an interesting anime I felt was its strong story that focused on finding three things which is finding the motivation to improve oneself, finding a place to belong and finding a reason to get stronger, strong characters that were well developed, strong combat scenes and excellent voice acting and animation.The overall story for the show I felt was one of the highlights of the show that when combined with character development really helped in establishing the series two main characters Ains and Leafiya as characters that have evolved as the series progressed becoming not just stronger on a martial level but also in terms of personality and motivation as well. The overall theme for the main story I felt was one that focused developing the characters of Ains and Lefiya by putting not just them but also their fellow familia members into a fight against a shadowy enemy that seems to know Ains on a personal level yet is powerful and well connected enough to also pose a threat to the familia even when they have a core of veterans in their ranks. In line with modern animes the overall plot of the series featured a number of sub plots that I felt did a great job of not just showing the overall threat to the familia but also to Ains and Lefiya herself as well. Of the sub plots I felt that Ains personal quest of fighting against someone that is both more powerful that she is and yet also possesses information on the mysterious past of Ains herself was pretty interesting. Another arc that I felt was done pretty well in this series was Lefiya’s arc in which she was able to break Filvis out of her shell through her persistence and save her from the nightmare that’s been hanging over her like a shroud. Although the main focus of the story was focused on the main characters of Ains and Lefiya and their quest to become not just stronger but also more motivated to both fight and find a place where they can be of help it’s important to note that the members of the Loki familia are also featured in the main plot. These characters though we seen glimpses of them before in the original anime were featured much more heavily in this one and it was nice to see them also fleshed out as well. Watching them care about Ains and Leafiya really reminds you that a familia is very much like a large family as well.One of the main highlights of this show was the characters but more specifically their development as both a person and also as a member of the Loki Familia. The main characters in this series which in this case was Ains and Lefiya I felt were actually pretty well designed and over the series developed into not just powerful combatants but also characters who had managed to find both the motivation that they needed to become strong but also a place and a purpose to their life that was missing before. Back in her base form that was shown in the original anime that this was spin off from Ains while a fearsome fighter was a rather quiet person that while certainly trusted and idolized by members of her own familia seemed to be someone that did not return this trust. Ains was someone that seemed to be someone that lived only for battle and viewed things like friendships and interaction with humans as something secondary to her. This series though did much to dispel that impression of Ains by showing not just what caused Ains personality to be so icy but also started her on the path of recovery where not just her relations with her friends and familia is better but also where her personality also changes to be more human of someone her age. The character of Lefiya though is slightly different to Ains in that while she was certainly in the original anime her role in it was relatively minor. As a result, it can be said that Lefiya is a character that this show actually introduced as a new character. In a way Lefiya’s default personally serves as a direct contrast to Ains as unlike her Lefiya was a talkative, positive and friendly person that while shy still cared about Ains and her fellow familia members. The development of both characters I felt was done pretty well and it was nice that in the end Ains had become more talkative and more considerate of other people’s feelings while Leafiya become braver and more willing to stand her ground and protect her friends.  Im also glad that in the end both managed to find both the motivation that they needed to get stronger while at the same time a place where both can belong and be of use to someone.Spin off anime’s though relatively common usually do not feature the original characters of the anime that spawned it as part of the main plat though there are exceptions to this role.  In this case the featuring of two of the main characters from the original anime as support characters though it made sense from a storyteller’s point of view was somewhat risky as it risked taking the attention away from the main characters. Though in this case because this anime’s main plot essentially told the story of the original anime though through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya this worry was largely unwarranted. In fact the presence of characters like Bell and Hestia only served as another point of motivation for Ains to become stronger.Dungeon Ni Deal had always been famed for the fact that it had some pretty good combat scenes that pitted either lone adventurers or small groups against powerful groups of monsters which though something often seen in fantasy anime is also a sight to see. The combat scenes in this series I felt still managed to do a good job of showing that adventurers even lone ones can still fight on toe to toe with fearsome creatures and opponents. And that with courage and determination even faced with a powerful enemy that was powerful enough to be overwhelming even a small party would be able to triumph if they fight smart that was best shown in the climactic battle in the end of the series.  In particular I really liked the battles that Ains fought against Revis because just as the battle is about who has the most martial might it’s also about who has the motivation to win as well.In the end while Dungeon Ni Deai did have an interesting storyline and combat scenes that tied well with Ain’s past and her bloodline I felt that its main strength and what really made it stand out to me was its strong character development. Both Ains and Lefiya though featured in the original anime that spawned this was then very basic characters that well designed and acted was very bare and had no unique personality or backstory that made them stand out. In this anime, however as a result of both becoming main characters of their own right this was remedied and their development as characters served as the main plot. In this I felt this was where the anime really shined and seeing the journey that both went on and see them get stronger and find the motivation and reason that they want to become strong was what I felt this anime did best. Though Ains may have been as clueless as a ghost in the beginning and Lefiya may have got scared way too easily by the end they were anything but and this was the best reward for me I think. from but tells the events of that story through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya and other members of their familia. While largely following the original storyline this anime also adds in several events and story arcs that are unique to Ains and Lefiya. In common with modern anime storytelling methods the overall plot of the series includes a number of sub plots and arcs that are intermingled with the main storyline.

One aspect of art that I particularly liked in this series was the design of the monsters that the cast faced with the major ones looking pretty cool and scary in equal measure. In regard to the animation I felt that overall animation was pretty good but it’s in combat scenes that the series shines at. I felt that the combat scenes were done pretty well in the series especially the last climatic battle.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done and I felt that each of the characters in the series was portrayed reasonably well by their respective seiyuu’s and voice actors. Particular praise however I felt should go to Saori Oonishi, Juri Kimura and Hisako Kanemoto who voiced the characters of Ains, Lefiya and Filvis respectfully as I felt that they did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. Sayaka Ohara and Ai Kayano who voiced the characters of Revis and Andromeda respectfully also I felt did a great job in voicing their characters though I felt that Revis should have had a larger role in the series.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with the scene music being appropriate for each of the scenes that required it. The opening theme for the series which was Re- Illusion was sung by veteran singer Yuka Iguchi and was actually quite catchy and conveyed the sense of happiness like meeting some old friends that you haven’t seen in some time. The ending theme for the series was day by day which was sung by Kano and had a positive and upbeat tune to it that seems to covey the thought that each day is an adventure and that you should always look forward to the next day and what that brings to you.Overall conclusionIn overall Dungeon Ni Deai was an interesting anime that’s a bit different to what I seen and reviewed before. This comes from the fact that Dungeon Ni Deali is a spin off from an existing anime and takes place in the setting that was established by it rather than featuring a new setting entirely. The strong points that makes Dungeon Ni Deali Sword Oratoria such an interesting anime I felt was its strong story that focused on finding three things which is finding the motivation to improve oneself, finding a place to belong and finding a reason to get stronger, strong characters that were well developed, strong combat scenes and excellent voice acting and animation.The overall story for the show I felt was one of the highlights of the show that when combined with character development really helped in establishing the series two main characters Ains and Leafiya as characters that have evolved as the series progressed becoming not just stronger on a martial level but also in terms of personality and motivation as well. The overall theme for the main story I felt was one that focused developing the characters of Ains and Lefiya by putting not just them but also their fellow familia members into a fight against a shadowy enemy that seems to know Ains on a personal level yet is powerful and well connected enough to also pose a threat to the familia even when they have a core of veterans in their ranks. In line with modern animes the overall plot of the series featured a number of sub plots that I felt did a great job of not just showing the overall threat to the familia but also to Ains and Lefiya herself as well. Of the sub plots I felt that Ains personal quest of fighting against someone that is both more powerful that she is and yet also possesses information on the mysterious past of Ains herself was pretty interesting. Another arc that I felt was done pretty well in this series was Lefiya’s arc in which she was able to break Filvis out of her shell through her persistence and save her from the nightmare that’s been hanging over her like a shroud. Although the main focus of the story was focused on the main characters of Ains and Lefiya and their quest to become not just stronger but also more motivated to both fight and find a place where they can be of help it’s important to note that the members of the Loki familia are also featured in the main plot. These characters though we seen glimpses of them before in the original anime were featured much more heavily in this one and it was nice to see them also fleshed out as well. Watching them care about Ains and Leafiya really reminds you that a familia is very much like a large family as well.One of the main highlights of this show was the characters but more specifically their development as both a person and also as a member of the Loki Familia. The main characters in this series which in this case was Ains and Lefiya I felt were actually pretty well designed and over the series developed into not just powerful combatants but also characters who had managed to find both the motivation that they needed to become strong but also a place and a purpose to their life that was missing before. Back in her base form that was shown in the original anime that this was spin off from Ains while a fearsome fighter was a rather quiet person that while certainly trusted and idolized by members of her own familia seemed to be someone that did not return this trust. Ains was someone that seemed to be someone that lived only for battle and viewed things like friendships and interaction with humans as something secondary to her. This series though did much to dispel that impression of Ains by showing not just what caused Ains personality to be so icy but also started her on the path of recovery where not just her relations with her friends and familia is better but also where her personality also changes to be more human of someone her age. The character of Lefiya though is slightly different to Ains in that while she was certainly in the original anime her role in it was relatively minor. As a result, it can be said that Lefiya is a character that this show actually introduced as a new character. In a way Lefiya’s default personally serves as a direct contrast to Ains as unlike her Lefiya was a talkative, positive and friendly person that while shy still cared about Ains and her fellow familia members. The development of both characters I felt was done pretty well and it was nice that in the end Ains had become more talkative and more considerate of other people’s feelings while Leafiya become braver and more willing to stand her ground and protect her friends.  Im also glad that in the end both managed to find both the motivation that they needed to get stronger while at the same time a place where both can belong and be of use to someone.Spin off anime’s though relatively common usually do not feature the original characters of the anime that spawned it as part of the main plat though there are exceptions to this role.  In this case the featuring of two of the main characters from the original anime as support characters though it made sense from a storyteller’s point of view was somewhat risky as it risked taking the attention away from the main characters. Though in this case because this anime’s main plot essentially told the story of the original anime though through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya this worry was largely unwarranted. In fact the presence of characters like Bell and Hestia only served as another point of motivation for Ains to become stronger.Dungeon Ni Deal had always been famed for the fact that it had some pretty good combat scenes that pitted either lone adventurers or small groups against powerful groups of monsters which though something often seen in fantasy anime is also a sight to see. The combat scenes in this series I felt still managed to do a good job of showing that adventurers even lone ones can still fight on toe to toe with fearsome creatures and opponents. And that with courage and determination even faced with a powerful enemy that was powerful enough to be overwhelming even a small party would be able to triumph if they fight smart that was best shown in the climactic battle in the end of the series.  In particular I really liked the battles that Ains fought against Revis because just as the battle is about who has the most martial might it’s also about who has the motivation to win as well.In the end while Dungeon Ni Deai did have an interesting storyline and combat scenes that tied well with Ain’s past and her bloodline I felt that its main strength and what really made it stand out to me was its strong character development. Both Ains and Lefiya though featured in the original anime that spawned this was then very basic characters that well designed and acted was very bare and had no unique personality or backstory that made them stand out. In this anime, however as a result of both becoming main characters of their own right this was remedied and their development as characters served as the main plot. In this I felt this was where the anime really shined and seeing the journey that both went on and see them get stronger and find the motivation and reason that they want to become strong was what I felt this anime did best. Though Ains may have been as clueless as a ghost in the beginning and Lefiya may have got scared way too easily by the end they were anything but and this was the best reward for me I think.', ""Never forget your roots as they say and its very clear Sword Oratoria has not forgotten its.This show was very slow to start with a character that i detested in the beginning but its one of those that takes those preconceived notions and does a complete 180.

I can guess that if Ais were the main character of this story then it would be over quickly because she was really strong. He had more serious determination than Bell. It's just that at the end I was a little confused as to what the next story would be because it must have collided with Bell's story. But a good ending for their point of view. The fighting scene is also really good and really cool. Lefiya is Bell but the female version, in the future I want to see them fight together. Imagine if the...two of them were already very strong, they could be the heroes of the future. And they did a great job making the intro outro, because it's the season 1 type but with their point of view. two of them were already very strong, they could be the heroes of the future.

I haven't read the manga, but the whole thing just comes off as sloppily structured. There isn't even a definitive main character. You'd think it'd be Azi, but the show spends an abnormal amount of time focusing on a new character, Lefiya and her fangirl crushing on Azi. Lefiya is an incompetent mage who is very cutesy and very quickly got annoying for me. For being such a huge focus, she rarely drove the plot of mainly just tagged along with the team, needing to be saved constantly.Now you can say that Bell needed...to be saved a lot too, but he was also the main driving force of the plot and always got better after each mistake. Lefiya doesn't get better until very late in the 12 episode show. The main plot isn't even about her. Honestly, I didn't understand most of the plot. It was some conspiracy about the Gods we had a lot of exposition for, but that was never resolved.Honestly, most of this anime feels like just set up for what happens in the manga. We learn a bit about Azi and see things connected to her past, but it's never explained and only touched upon in the last episode, because the rest of the time is spent with plots that have no weight to them and that I wasn't really interested in.That being said, I did enjoy the members of the Loki familia and some of the new characters were enjoyable as well.

With the harem/fantasy show’s legacy leaving behind such wonderful memes about its busty loli goddess heroine like the famous boob ribbon and ‘Hestia is Bestia’, it’s no wonder the show had a tough time having a complete positive footing in the anime community due to various aspects about it like its multitude of female characters wishing to breed like rabbits with its main protagonist.  So how can you make a show like that into something that’s similar, but objectively better in comparison?  Well, for starters you could follow the source material.Story: Sword Oratoria is the Danmachi story shown from a...different perspective.  Instead of following the adventures of the Hestia Familia with Bell and his journey to become adventurer that he wanted to be, we follow the story of the Loki Familia and its sword princess, Ais Wallenstein, as she and those in her familia unravel the truth of strange going-ons in the dungeon and uncover a darker plot happening in the town or Oratoria.In contrast, the story of Sword Oratoria is a more serious take on the fantasy dungeon story of Danmachi, as it features an overarching mystery plot that those in the Loki Familia attempt to uncover as stronger and more bizarre monsters appear both in the town and in the dungeon.  As such, the plot feels a lot more serious and more involved, as the story shifts from a generally lighthearted adventure involving a boy climbing his way to the top, to that of a slightly darker story featuring a girl coming to terms with some of her demons from the past.  The overall plot just feels better written due to the fact that it feels like there’re consequences and that there truly are stakes to be had.If that were the case, then we’d have no problems.  Unfortunately, the story falls flat on delivering that darker and weightier atmosphere that the story at first glance seems to promise.  A lot of the heavier and more gruesome moments from the manga are absent, and instead we’re treated to the fangirling delusions of an elf mage desperately trying to monopolize the full attention of the sword princess.  While the story is objectively better from a tone standpoint, the actual content of the series is littered with random moments of our new character Lefiya attempting to be what appears to be a shoddier attempt at being another Bell.  This results in a lot of tonal shifts that draw away from the impact of the main plot, thus not only making things a lot less dire, but also making the new character we’re supposed to support, a lot less appealing to the audience.The ending is a culmination final standing point for progression to the next point of the series.  It’s an ‘ending point’ that only finishes the first part of the story that seems to be real final stakes moment, but doesn’t really feel that way when you look at everything before it.  Arguably it’s not a terrible ending, but when put alongside the journey to get to that point, things could be better.Overall, Sword Oratoria, while considered to be a better story due to the show’s more serious atmosphere involving character exploration and some disturbing aspects about the dungeon that weren’t mentioned before, still falls in its own pitfalls and makes unnecessary sacrifices that resulted in the show feeling less impactful and slightly more irritating to watch.  Simply put, if we cut out all of the fluff involving Lefiya’s obsession over Ais, this would’ve turned out a lot better.Overview:+ Different and better viewpoint of the Danmachi story-  Sacrificed emotional weight for less important fluff aspects-  Changes from source material sufferedCharacters:  Instead of Hestia, Bell, and the rest of their familia, we’re treated instead to Loki and the expansive (and well equipped) myriad of misfits that she has managed to raise and grow.Of course, if you’re talking about someone in the Loki familia, you have to talk about Ais Wallenstein, the mysterious female swordsman that Bell idolizes after she saved his ass.  Several times.  While shown to be a cool and collected girl in the original Danmachi, Ais’s character really shines through in Sword Oratoria as its main focal point.  We’re given a look into her past and her own internal struggle, pushing her away from the idealized sword princess that everyone treats her as, and instead as someone who feels more human and wants to improve based on her current state when we’re introduced to a different side of her character.  We also get to see her interactions and opinions about Bell in a different light, and it’s really refreshing to see who I thought initially was a boring character become something that had more to her with each passing episode.Then…Lefiya…  I’ll be honest; I don’t like this girl.  Lefiya is what I would describe to be everything that’s mostly wrong with this adaptation.  The show initially treats us to her as a compatriot of Ais, as the two of them are in the same familia and are often put on the same team together.  Her entire character can be described as a low level mage who looks up to Ais and wants to be looked at and praised by the sword princess.  However, what sets her apart from a certain rabbit boy is the fact that the show goes so far with her wish that it becomes uncomfortable.  When she’s not busy getting her ass saved by everyone around her, Lefiya spends a good portion of her screentime fantasizing about spending time with Ais to almost disturbing levels. It takes away any potential screentime to be dedicated to the main plot, and it detracts any likeable characteristics that this girl may have had in the first place because obsessive jealousy is not a cute characteristic.Aside from these two, the rest of the screentime is split amongst more commonly known members in the Loki Familia including Loki herself, some new additions to the cast, and a couple other known characters in the series that don’t get as much as a role since they’re not all that important to the story of Sword Oratoria.  In terms of development, the majority of it is dedicated to either exploring the inner workings of the Loki Familia itself and how its members interact with one another, and some of the stories of the new additions to the cast that we’re given.  I lot of it really is more akin to world building, but that really doesn’t serve as much of a problem since it only furthers expand the world and the kinds of people within the world of Danmachi, which is always a nice little extra to have.Overview:+ Ais’s spotlight develops her well+ Side cast aids in providing more of the world to the audience-  Lefiya’s apparent obsessive personality.Art:  Made by J.C. Staff, the art for Sword Oratoria is the same quality as the original Danmachi.  The colors and animation is clear, colorful, and evokes a bright adventurous feel, the action is fluid enough for it to seem like a good enough fight scene/rpg battle for those in the viewing audience, and things are pretty consistent throughout.  It’s standard fare, nothing too amazing or anything worth getting excited over.Sound:  Similarly, the soundtrack isn’t something that’s worth really writing home about.  The OP is cheerful and adventurous sounding, but nothing that memorable or special.  Its ED ‘Day by Day’ on the other hand is a more laid back piece that completely contrasts the supposed more serious nature of the show.  It’s a decent piece, and worth a listen to, but not really something that I’d personally give too much thought on.Personal Enjoyment:  A lot of things I’ve heard from the grapevine about Sword Oratoria is the fact that it was collectively renowned as a spin-off that is superior to the main story.  Poking through it, it certainly was of better quality at least story-wise, as had a much more involved story with aspects that the original was simply lacking.  This adaptation however wasn’t dressed to impress.  While maintaining a slightly more serious tone, Sword Oratoria always felt like it was missing something, and the struggles with the characters in their fights felt too easy when compared to the scale of the creatures they had to fight.  (This ain’t some tiny Minotaur anymore.)  Needless to say, while I really hoped the adaptation met the expectations of the original, it’s unfortunate that things didn’t really turn out that way in the end.Did I like this series?Despite that, I did enjoy the series…relatively.  Aside from the depth with Ais’s character, I really liked what they did with Bell and how they showed parts of his journey in the original story from Ais’s perspective.  It’s strange to say, but I actually liked and felt a lot more involved with Bell’s story when the camera wasn’t focused on him.What didn’t I like about this series?Lefiya.  Lefiya wasn’t like this in the manga, so the upped ante with her admiration for Ais to an almost disturbing, creepy, and downright mean-spirited nature towards anyone foreign who’d want to so much as talk to the sword princess was definitely not an aspect that I was a fan of.Would I recommend this series?If you’re an anime Danmachi fan who chooses not to touch or read any of the source material, than this is probably the show for you.  The contrasts between the source material and this adaptation would make anyone who came from the manga side definitely unhappy.  Despite that, the series still keeps many of the story’s aspects intact, and is still what I would think to be a much better version of the story simply because the core aspects of it are centered more on a centralized story and characters, rather than just one character like the original. different perspective.  Instead of following the adventures of the Hestia Familia with Bell and his journey to become adventurer that he wanted to be, we follow the story of the Loki Familia and its sword princess, Ais Wallenstein, as she and those in her familia unravel the truth of strange going-ons in the dungeon and uncover a darker plot happening in the town or Oratoria.In contrast, the story of Sword Oratoria is a more serious take on the fantasy dungeon story of Danmachi, as it features an overarching mystery plot that those in the Loki Familia attempt to uncover as stronger and more bizarre monsters appear both in the town and in the dungeon.

When she’s not busy getting her ass saved by everyone around her, Lefiya spends a good portion of her screentime fantasizing about spending time with Ais to almost disturbing levels. It takes away any potential screentime to be dedicated to the main plot, and it detracts any likeable characteristics that this girl may have had in the first place because obsessive jealousy is not a cute characteristic.Aside from these two, the rest of the screentime is split amongst more commonly known members in the Loki Familia including Loki herself, some new additions to the cast, and a couple other known characters in the series that don’t get as much as a role since they’re not all that important to the story of Sword Oratoria.  In terms of development, the majority of it is dedicated to either exploring the inner workings of the Loki Familia itself and how its members interact with one another, and some of the stories of the new additions to the cast that we’re given.  I lot of it really is more akin to world building, but that really doesn’t serve as much of a problem since it only furthers expand the world and the kinds of people within the world of Danmachi, which is always a nice little extra to have.Overview:+ Ais’s spotlight develops her well+ Side cast aids in providing more of the world to the audience-  Lefiya’s apparent obsessive personality.Art:  Made by J.C. Staff, the art for Sword Oratoria is the same quality as the original Danmachi.  The colors and animation is clear, colorful, and evokes a bright adventurous feel, the action is fluid enough for it to seem like a good enough fight scene/rpg battle for those in the viewing audience, and things are pretty consistent throughout.  It’s standard fare, nothing too amazing or anything worth getting excited over.Sound:  Similarly, the soundtrack isn’t something that’s worth really writing home about.  The OP is cheerful and adventurous sounding, but nothing that memorable or special.  Its ED ‘Day by Day’ on the other hand is a more laid back piece that completely contrasts the supposed more serious nature of the show.  It’s a decent piece, and worth a listen to, but not really something that I’d personally give too much thought on.Personal Enjoyment:  A lot of things I’ve heard from the grapevine about Sword Oratoria is the fact that it was collectively renowned as a spin-off that is superior to the main story.  Poking through it, it certainly was of better quality at least story-wise, as had a much more involved story with aspects that the original was simply lacking.  This adaptation however wasn’t dressed to impress.  While maintaining a slightly more serious tone, Sword Oratoria always felt like it was missing something, and the struggles with the characters in their fights felt too easy when compared to the scale of the creatures they had to fight.  (This ain’t some tiny Minotaur anymore.)  Needless to say, while I really hoped the adaptation met the expectations of the original, it’s unfortunate that things didn’t really turn out that way in the end.Did I like this series?Despite that, I did enjoy the series…relatively.  Aside from the depth with Ais’s character, I really liked what they did with Bell and how they showed parts of his journey in the original story from Ais’s perspective.  It’s strange to say, but I actually liked and felt a lot more involved with Bell’s story when the camera wasn’t focused on him.What didn’t I like about this series?Lefiya.  Lefiya wasn’t like this in the manga, so the upped ante with her admiration for Ais to an almost disturbing, creepy, and downright mean-spirited nature towards anyone foreign who’d want to so much as talk to the sword princess was definitely not an aspect that I was a fan of.Would I recommend this series?If you’re an anime Danmachi fan who chooses not to touch or read any of the source material, than this is probably the show for you.  The contrasts between the source material and this adaptation would make anyone who came from the manga side definitely unhappy.  Despite that, the series still keeps many of the story’s aspects intact, and is still what I would think to be a much better version of the story simply because the core aspects of it are centered more on a centralized story and characters, rather than just one character like the original.', 'I enjoyed Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria!Keywords: Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Magic, FanserviceThis story mainly focuses on the thoughts and growth of 2 female character (Ains & Lefiya) in Loki Familia (kinda like a powerhouse guild). There\'re lots of strong characters in the story displaying good fighting scenes. There\'s also a good balance of male and female characters. However, with female characters being the main leads, you can expect lots of fanservice (mostly boobs). Overall, it teaches you to overcome your limitations.PROS+ Nice fight scenes (mostly monsters)+ The goddess (Though useless but intuitive leader type)+ Nice characters...growth development and interactions+ Lots of strong characters+ Comical scenes of Lefiya\'s delusionsCONS- Shallow representation of friendship btw Lefiya & Filvis- Not enough side characters backstory and development- Cliffhanger endingThough not all, it was able to answer some question marks from ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"". growth development and interactions+ Lots of strong characters+ Comical scenes of Lefiya\'s delusionsCONS- Shallow representation of friendship btw Lefiya & Filvis- Not enough side characters backstory and development- Cliffhanger endingThough not all, it was able to answer some question marks from ""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka"".', 'An adequate time waister, not too much more.Story- If you\'ve seen the original ""Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?"" You can expect a very similar premise in this take of the show. A vague evil villain behind the scenes causing mayhem leading up the release of their master plan. Nothing much to go off of here. While these events take place, unbeknownst to our hero, Ais Wallenstein and her ""raid party"" set off to run their expeditions into the city\'s dungeon and dive into deeper and deeper levels. It is quite difficult to nail down the cohesive narrative throughout...this story, since there doesn\'t seem to be much of one. I mean you can get a gist of what is going on at a given point in time yet the show has difficulty weaving together the personal story of our protagonist with the many events which take place throughout it\'s world. A few less fan service scenes and girl on girl unrequited romances could have helped, but I digress. You are left with a few curiosities come the end yet few if any questions are answered. Not the greatest story to come around in recent memory.Art- Colorful and vibrant with consistency in character modeling. It has a professionalism to it. Some well animated and fun to watch fight scenes. Not something that really stands out but a solid job here.Sound- Not much to say really. OP is forgettable, though the end song is quite nice. Action scenes sound fine with hard hitting sound effects and your typical fantasy music to accompany it. Though nothing stands out as bad, there are many things that don\'t stand out at all. I was never consciously thinking about the music or sound while watching, lets leave it at that.Characters- Well, with Bell Cranel being the preceding protagonist along with his big ti... I mean Goddess sidekick, the show\'s main character\'s didn\'t have all too much to live up to. Ais Wallenstein is the short spoken and stoic lead who we follow along our journey. The direction can veer off and follow the stories of some of the other characters at times but for the most part Ais is front and center. I come out split on this. On the one hand it is refreshing to see a character who has a brevity to them, and at the same time it is expected to have a character emote and become ""human"" for the audience once in a while so they can empathize. While Ais does have development and a backstory to follow she seems to have only three ways to express herself; happy face, serious face, blank face. And only two of those faces help us! In all seriousness you will be invested enough in her struggle and growth to follow along her story but don\'t expect any Oscar nominations here. To talk about the side characters, one that really left a bad taste in my mouth was Lefiya. A new recruit to Ais\' familia, Lefiya ends up becoming essentially an over obsessive pet to Ais, with nothing to her character but to gain Ais\' admiration and eventual affection. There\'s this kind of yaoi thing going on there... Not much else to say about the rest of the cast disappointingly.Enjoyment- Look, with all the bad said, you can\'t watch the show and not have some fun. Its a fantasy world archetyping off of video game RPGs with overpowered characters and cute girl fan service. I\'d be lying if I said I didn\'t air in to watch the show each weekly new episode.

What we've got from story in the whole 1st season? Bell Crannel defeating a minotaur, Bell Crannel getting one more loli to the harem, Bell Crannel facing some random monsters with the Cheatsgornaut, and a mysterious witch or something like this, that seems to...be about to give her virginity to him (but never actually revealed), and that's about it.Meanwhile, in Sword Oratoria, plot already begins to be developed from episode 4 forward. And even though some episodes were weaker, and some stronger than episode 4 itself in the series, it still didn't disappoint me at all, cause by little it can be, every episode from 4 onwards adds something to the plot. And the mystery instigates you to continue watching it. A mysterious Tamer girl, calling Ais by the name of Aria. Who, or what's is Aria, after all? What's the so spoken of mystery that's hidden on Floor 59? These inputs, in my opinion, were things that turned this series far more interesting than Bell's.I just hope this ending doesn't disappoint me, because running to one episode only with the seemingly many things yet to be explained appears to trigger some kind of let-down feeling inside of me. But even if the end is disappointing, it still won't carry away the exciting feeling I had throughout the series, with the development brought episode by episode after episode 4 (feeling that I didn't have while watching Danmachi 1). Give it a shot, anyways! I bet you won't regret!EDIT: I've just finished Episode 12 now, and like I was expecting already, it wasn't a clarifying ending, but at least it was somehow concluded, and some details added more trama and mistery to the story. Unfortunately, I believe we will never have a second season following this storyline, which is really sad, 'cause it'd be really fantastic, as more things could be revealed. It wasn't, of course, a fully satisfying ending, but I enjoyed it quite a lot, it had a good final battle, presenting some minor, small flaws here and there, but those yet can't take away the quality to it, so I maintain my 8/10! We gotta analyze that it is a 12-episode running, so it's not like every single detail the story has to give can be transpassed in one single season. Again, I really don't feel like we'll get a second season, which is quite depressing, but to me it was a very well builted and scalated season to the anime, and perhaps the best one so far in 2017. be about to give her virginity to him (but never actually revealed), and that's about it.Meanwhile, in Sword Oratoria, plot already begins to be developed from episode 4 forward.

""Warning possible SpoilersNow the main problem I had with Danmachi was Aiz Wallenstein she was a badass, but was very bland so seeing a side series being made for her was actually something good for her character, but that wasn't all I got from this side story.Sword Oratoria is about events during the main Danmachi series except it's being seen by Aiz's perspective and just like Bell she has her own set of adventures.Now I was actually surprised there was story created for Aiz and the Loki familia because even though Bell had his own problems to deal with it seems that Aiz had even...more difficult problems to overcome and I really enjoyed how deep the story went in some ways because we get to see some of Aiz's origins and her family which is why she is linked to this new threat of monsters that have appeared out of nowhere and why these new villains are so interested in her.We also get to see more of the Loki familia and how their reputation affects the other familia's as well as other adventurers along with what they get up to on their adventures and when they are enjoying their free time not fighting monsters.It was also nice to see the moments that were in the main series like Bell fighting the Minotaur or Bell practising with Aiz from Aiz's perspective as we really get to see what she thinks about Bell and the whole situation that is going on around her.Now even though we see most of the characters in the Loki familia in the main series seeing them as main characters was for the most part actually enjoyable because some of these characters are actually really likeable.Aiz does get a lot of character development from start to finish of this series, she does start out bland and only cares about ranking up, but she does slowly start being more open to her teammates and eventually comes to realise that she isn't alone when they are fighting monsters or level bosses in the Dungeons, we even get to see her do a cute expression which was really surprising to see.Lefiya who is the other main character and is an elf mage that hopes to succeed Riveria however Lefiya is annoying as hell, she has a crush on Aiz and hopes to eventually catch up to her much like Bell is trying to do and she just constantly whines about everything making her very unlikable, luckily there are a few moments where she does help out, but that doesn't happen until the last episode.Tiona and Tione are both twin sister's except the only difference is their bust size, these two were pretty much my favourite characters of the show because even though they are sisters their pretty different, Tiona is actually a lot more hyper and active compared to her sister whereas Tione is a bit of a Tsundere sometimes especially when it comes to people either staring at her breasts or whenever another woman flirts with her crush Finn, I really enjoyed these two in the show and luckily they do get quite a bit of screentime compared to other characters.Loki is the goddess of her familia and she is pretty much a lunatic as she is always running around trying to cop a feel with the other female members of her familia especially Aiz and getting drunk however when the time calls for it she can be serious especially when the matter concerns everyone in her familia or Orario itself.Bete is a werewolf of the Loki familia and despite acting like an asshole most of the time he can be a badass when it comes to fighting against monsters.Then we have some of the other lv 6 characters in the Loki familia who are Finn, Gareth and Riveria and each of these characters may not done much throughout the series, but when the battles get tough they turn into badasses and completely overwhelm their opponents.You also get to see some of the characters from the main series and it always felt good seeing them even though their not main characters of this story.Now the artstyle compared to the main series isn't done as well which makes sense since this is a side story, but there were some parts that looked good like some of the new monsters that appeared hell we finally got dragons and there were a few new locations as well, but overall the artstyle didn't look as good as the main series.The battles were pretty good and intense at times, we really got to see the power of the Loki familia's and boy are they not to be messed with, the final battle as well was done brilliantly I was really on edge even though I knew these characters would survive it still felt very hectic to watch.There were some moments of fanservice a couple mainly either the girls having a shower or relaxing in a hot spring, but nothing too excessive just the kind that gives you a little taste, also there was some comedy in here too and it was actually funny sometimes especially when either Loki or the sisters got up to something, but I think Loki was the biggest source of comedy in the series with her constant addiction for trying to molest the girls.Overall this wasn't a bad side story and it nicely expands the characters and world of Danmachi which is what I wanted from this side series, so if you're looking for extra character development for the Loki familia's and Aiz then you might enjoy this if you can put up with Lefiya's annoyance. more difficult problems to overcome and I really enjoyed how deep the story went in some ways because we get to see some of Aiz's

I did not read the Sword Oratoria manga or light novels prior to the series, but I am currently reading the manga.Before people start cursing me inside their heads for my opinion, let me explain why.Sword Oratoria had a beautiful story line. The story itself is far more developed than season 1 of DanMachi, and while I adored both plots, Sword Oratoria displayed to its viewers the cruel reality and wickedness of the Dungeon by constantly challenging Ais Wallenstein. The anime reminds us that...while the Dungeon gives opportunity to fame and prestige, adventurers will be pursuited by anguish and pain, as well as unspeakable evil and corruption that is left out of the season 1 anime. The consequences and seemingly insurmountable trials in the fantasy world is what captivates me and told me to continue.Through this story, we even see development in DanMachi\'s ""stagnant"" character, Ais. We see insecurities in this idolized protagonist, and being “imperfect” ultimately renders her human. Her flaws, once revealed, explains more of her character, her background, and her actions in DanMachi.Unfortunately, people overlook the story and focus on one character: Lefiya. Lefiya is simply irritating and other than apologizing for what she couldn’t have done and telling herself she wants to do more, her fear gets the best of her many times in the show. The problem with Lefiya is that she isn’t challenged enough, and when she barely is challenged, she gives herself up to panic. Her infatuation with Ais doesn’t aid Lefiya character development as Omori has clearly illustrated that Ais is interested in Bell. Lefiya’s imagination is downright creepy when you take that fact in mind.That being said, the cast of Sword Oratoria is very likeable. Since the majority of the cast had appeared in DanMachi a few times, seeing them is delightful and it’s enough to familiarize you to the spin-off. When you see the spin-off’s characters in DanMachi, you’re already intimidated by the fact that they’re perfect. In Sword Oratoria, the creators explicitly emphasize their empathetic and caring side as well as their closeness with Ais. I loved Bete, Finn, and Riveria because they complement and look after Ais when she’s faced with her shortcomings.While the ED is a little off in terms of the tone it brings to the anime, the OP is the pop song that somehow is compatible to the spin-off’s medieval fantasy world, possessing the rhythm and notes that introduces the anime itself. I loved every character’s voice and it matches so well with their respective personalities, and that adds to the likability of the cast. When Sword Oratoria and DanMachi share the same scenes, the spin-off’s voices are much more matured and consistent for their characters. The OST is deliberately composed to evoke the feeling of watching DanMachi, and along with a sense of mysteriousness and fantasy, you can hear familiar tunes in the background. In the OST “Determination to fight,” you can hear “Argonaut” from DanMachi where Bell fights the Minotaur. The OST really reflects the aura of the Loki Familia and their situations, like in the piano song for Ais played in the first episode where it reflects her dispiritedness.One downfall of Sword Oratoria is the art. While it’s still good, it is noticeably a step down from the DanMachi we knew in Bell’s adventures. The manga had better action scenes than the anime itself, and it is disappointing how they chose to adapt the anime in terms of art itself. The thrill of action is lost when I watch Sword Oratoria. Nevertheless, for its story, characters, and sound, you should give Sword Oratoria a chance. while the Dungeon gives opportunity to fame and prestige, adventurers will be pursuited by anguish and pain, as well as unspeakable evil and corruption that is left out of the season 1 anime.

The characters are weak, there is nothing that makes you want to see or learn more about their stories, the stories are repetitive, see a monster(s) kill them,  bad or good,  repetitive, never moving forward. Nothing makes this a story or pulls it together. I had great hopes as I enjoyed the original but i quickly became disenfranchised with how poorly this was done. The characters do not work together they seem empty and not connected which goes along with...why there is no story. why there is no story."", ""This is maybe not the second season of Danmachi I believe, it's the side story, the story of the female lead character 'Aiz Wallenstein'. One good thing is you do not need to see any season to understan anything, it's quite good way to write the script there are glimpse of first season in this side story and also glimse of side story in first season. So, there wo't be any affect which one you see first.Story is not that good but not that shabby. Since the story is of the female lead character 'Aiz', you will see her very short past that won't make...sense at this moment becasue this is fine, it may reavel in future stories. I have no complain in the case of story section. I think it's good enough. It's also has a little comedy times that you might like alsoArt style is fine, no complains there.About maybe two years ago (maybe more than that), when I first watch Danmachi I skiped it because, here is female as a lead role, but as time pass on and as I liking myself bumping into new stories, I wathed this anime in just one day and I liked it.Honestly I like to see second season of this anime.

The animation very well like the first season after except for the elf cover, all the co-stars very good. A very good story to enhance the very well done main story.

Of course that may result in some nostalgic bias but I think that allows me to be just as critical, especially for this spin off.StoryTo begin...with, the story. Before the series started, when I heard that Dan Machi was returning I was so excited. Not knowing the nature of the series and just instinctively expecting just a second season, I was looking forward to a reminder of why I loved the first instalment. I was very disappointed. It\'s important to know that is not a continuation of where season 1 left off, and in fact offers nothing on top of what happened last time in my opinion at least. I feel like the season 1 story wasn\'t by any means outstanding in it\'s story, but the simple idea of a guy trying to become stronger even if that was surpass someone and being so good at it is just a no brainer.This spin off does not follow that, yet I suppose I guess that seemless role has been given to other characters. This series is basically just a viewpoint from outside the POV of the main character, Bell, from the last season. It\'s sort of as if in a game where you\'re third person behind you\'re character you have the ability to go into a sort of camera free-mode and fly around to anywhere in the map to see what the antagonists or allies are currently doing at the time you have paused, and it\'s like that for the progression of this spin off. Yet in this series, it doesn\'t deliver any thing I was looking forward to. We were introduced to basically an entirely new story, because in season 1 there was no real evidence of what is happening in this spin off having an affect on the story so it makes me think even more that this was a pointless addition to the Dan Machi story. Sure, it gave some kind of insight into the thoughts of other characters during the main characters adventures/events but they felt so irrelevant and not even believable that at times I assumed that the writers were held at gunpoint to give these people a backstory or motive. For example, one of main characters present and important to the MC in the first series Ais Wallenstein is now being presented as having internal troubles with wanting to become stronger and although I find this a admirable motive especially alongside Bell, it just feels so out of character when she then later in a more recent episode is, at least my view, been made out to be as if she has to contend with Bell? In their training(to keep it brief and non spoilery), I get the assumption that she is about to scream at Bell and force him to give up his secret to becoming so powerful, yet in the original series we\'re led to believe she\'s just a naive fighter who is seeing something in her time with Bell which I find much more enjoyable. It\'s just not what I was expecting, especially when I had high hopes this was a second season.To put it simply for the story, they\'ve tried to expand the universe or depth of  characters we sometimes see in the main series as side characters and give some kind of reason for problems occurring yet they don\'t even seem to have had any affect whatsoever when looking back over, so it felt almost pointless.ArtIn terms of art, there really isn\'t much to say, yet once again I must refer back to the first or orignal Dan Machi season. Some of the fight scenes were definitely spectacle, and the animation combined with radiant colours during  them made them all visual pleasures. I would reference some of the scenes yet of course that would be spoilers in a sense, but I must say they were very memorable for me especially when considering it was my first anime, and I was enraptured by the sleek and smooth movement on screen. It definitely felt like there were more frames per second per say, as moments felt much more cinematic and higher quality if that makes sense. This is important when comparing it to Sword Oratorio.This spin off can only really be described as lack lustre. I am not sure if this is because I am already holding the grudge of it not being a second season and am naturally pessimistic, or that perhaps it is actually just at a lower quality, but it must be said that the cinematic spark from last time was not present. Whatever fight scenes there were did not feel as vibrant or 60 FPS as before, and can be probably be portrayed as if they didn\'t have as much of a budget to fund the flashy things with. Of course this is understandable for a spin off, but then one has to wonder why you would attempt to replicate the series which I\'d say was popular because of the inclusion of such animation and visuals in general. You couldn\'t really feel the emphasis of blows or movement, and so you couldn\'t exactly get riled up within a battle. That\'s all there really is to be said about art.SoundSound played an important part in, once again, the original series. Battles were made that much more emotional and dramatic with the effort of the score in the background. Most notably, the ""Argonaut/Eiyuu Ganbou"" piece that can be found on Youtube is one the most memorable and tense pieces of art I\'ve actually recognised and felt something from when watching anime. My watch list ain\'t exactly full of work of arts, yet if it\'s only Dan Machi that made me realise that then perhaps the answer is clear that it\'s a fantastic piece of music, just in that one scene at the very least. In terms of diegetic sound effects, blows and clashes of weaponry are again very emphasised, and all adds together to amount to an immersive experience and all feels very weighty behind each act.The spin off again feels lack lustre. It just doesn\'t seem to have the same hit or feeling, and I\'d say is possibly because of the lack of important or engagement in the majority of fight scenes because you don\'t really have any reason to rally for the protagonists present since you don\'t care or understand for their motives, thus even if there was an amazing score occurring during one scene - I most likely missed it because the action on screen did not warrant it and there was no intensity behind the event for the music to be even be engrossing. All of this is most likely down to lack of funding or similar care that was given to the original series, yet with this being an amateur review and not really taking the time out of my very vacant schedule to go check if that was the case and it then turning out the team behind this gave it their all with the same resources available from last time - I would be very angry, as this is a pitiful excuse compared to the prior.CharacterI think this makes up for a lot of the series, as there is an overwhelming lack of it. One part of why many people loved the original was because of the child-like ambition of Bell, the MC, the admirable but cheeky Hestia, and so on and so forth. Yet this time round, those characters from the main cast around Bell were not present at all or at the same quality. Instead, we are given other  side characters who we don\'t really care about and have no character development besides some first-look quirks from their limited screen time from last time, and even now with more screen time they are not being fleshed out at all. It seems the only motives we learn about are Ais, the new antagonists, other people I don\'t care about, and god awful Lefiya.Lefiya is the bane of Dan Machi\'s existence, and is hands down the worst character to have come out of this series. I\'m sure in the manga and other materials she is well motivated and much more likeable, but in this case she is a sorry excuse for a replacement for Bell. We are supposed to believe that she is someone who was always in the background and never covered in the original, yet her affect on the story is so minor that you would have never eve known she was there in the first place. I am not sure if we are supposed to be rooting for her the same way as Bell before, because she just seems so incapable and annoying that it begs the question why she is even in the Loki Familiar(circle of characters basically) in the first place. Her inability to do anything does not make her a subject of pity or compassion, it just makes me think why this is the person that I need to be following when she has some kind of fantasy to impress Ais yet does it with such nativity and obliviousness it\'s not even funny. She just never seems to get a chance to amount to anything, and still feels like a side character with too much screen time. Her affect on the story just makes me so frustrated because she is almost the exact opposite of Bell, and I sure hope she was not given to us as someone to be a rival to Bell because I just want to see someone shout to her our pathetic she really is, lol. She really is a horrible character, and words from my naive mind cannot possibly describe my detest for her so I can only insist you find someone who really has the comprehension to do so.EnjoymentFor enjoyment, it does not have by any means the same spark as the original. To cover what I\'ve said previously, it just feels watered down and at an intentionally lower quality in everything - thus I just can\'t really feel engaged with what is happening. It\'s watchable at a stretch, as there is not much reason to keep coming back each week and the only reason I did was to hope the main cast would make an appearance or there would be spectacle that was being saved up until the end, as if there was a budget was gonna be blown on a single scene. As of 10 or so eps in out of 12, there has not been. *SPOILERS* I cannot continue without saying my main reason for continuing to watch, and that was hopefully to rewatch a paramount scene in the previous/original series. The minotaur scene is by far a pinnacle moment that is the most memorable by I\'m sure many fans, as everything I\'ve referenced to prior with art, character, sound and so on is combined into a scene that even non watchers can appreciate. I just believe it is so well done, but that can not be reinforced or compared to anything that someone else may say is an even better scene from an entirely different anime series because I\'m still quite relatively new to the anime scene - the passion in that single scene and the victory by the end of it is something that happens seemingly so fast but makes you want to rewatch because of the emotion that enraptures the screen. It\'s the cliche of beating the enemy that had beat you down once before, and had overcame the obstacles that prevented you from beating him in the first place, yet it\'s done in a way that can be admired by I\'m sure many people as well as myself.Now let me compare that to the relative rehash of Sword Oratoria. Imagine if someone recreated a favourite scene of yours from any anime but with lego, that\'s what it felt like in comparison. Again, let me remind that this series is basically a view on the same timeline as the original series but that included a different interpretation or sort of behind the scenes of the actual MC Bell but instead with Ais or Lefiya as MCs instead. In this minotaur scene, Bell fights the minotaur while Ais and her group watch on dismay as this supposed rookie is showing true promise and talent despite them all knowing about him previously for being weak and laughable when he was victim to another minotaur which spurred the story on in the first place. Now that we have the view of Ais of that same battle, I was looking forward to this scene being a redeeming factor. It didn\'t really even have to do much, as I would probably would have accepted if they just did a copy and paste of the scene from the original and plugged it into this spin off yet this time around all they\'ve really done is made it feel saturated and so much not like the same. There are times where they cut from the action and not build anything up for when the camera returns to them, so it feels so less energetic. It\'s nowhere near dynamic or dramatic, because they\'ve paced it so strangely by focusing on the onlookers besides the actual action. Maybe it\'s just because of the context that this is not Bell we are now following but Ais and I\'m so used to the scene but this is a huge disappointment and does not offer a sign of good things to come for the remaining episodes of the series or in fact redeem anything that had happened for the 10-odd episodes prior.OverallTo conclude, it\'s just a let down. That it. If they had perhaps released information about the nature of the series before it had aired, then there would be so much hype which was only going to be shot down. If people had known this was a spin off, and made it clear there would be no Bell, and possibly given clues as to if this was just a taster until the actual season 2 which will come whenever (I hope) then maybe I would have seen it differently. I just think this was a poor choice to go, and I\'m sure manga readers may have got some kind of pleasure behind this story and Lefiya too but for someone like me it just felt irrelevant and forced within the context I had already known. At least on the bright side it means that things can only go up from here and that season 2 will either just be better than this or just as good as the original. In terms of recommendations, obviously I wouldn\'t suggest you start the entire series on this and by no means should you go out of your way just to see this because with the original in mind - this just does not amount to it, is very forgettable and you\'re probably better off not watching it at all and just wait for season 2 with the rest of us. with, the story.

Slow paced, with mediocre plot and character development especially when compared to the first season, it was made purely to be an tied-in side story.However, it fulfills that role ably, letting the viewer discover what else is going on in Orario while Bell is off doing Bell things. Indeed, the best scenes are the ones that give context to what we have seen from S1.Again, while alone it doesn't digest as well, if you've seen S1 it's...worth a watch. worth a watch."", ""I started watching the first episode and was a bit confused as to when this was taking place, having watched all 4 seasons (5?) of the original series but was quite excited to see something new as they were on the 50th floor.

As the first episode unfolds I wondered to myself why they were bringing a novice adventurer (Lefiya) so deep in to the dungeon as she is completely useless in battle. It was extremely surprising to me to later...find out that this completely useless person was level 4, something the show has propped up to be an extremely powerful, confident, and rare adventurer however here is a level 4 that is completely useless apparently in battle and probably would have lost in a fight to a level 1 Bell.In this series we also get to know a little bit more about the other members of Ais' famila, which would be great however in the end they essentially are just all lovestruck women who have some type of insufferably horrible personality; loud and obnoxious, whiny, worried about breast size, worried who a man/woman is romantically interested in.

Pretty good, I have no complaints. Just like the first season of DanMachi, everyone has a pretty fitting voice.The English dub? If you have the option, I'd advise against watching this.From here, I'm going to rant a bit about the English dubbing. There are plenty of shows...with solid dubbing, often good enough that I prefer it to the original Japanese. The voice acting in this show feels horrendous, though I feel like blaming the voice director rather than the actors themselves for that. Most of the VAs don't quite fit their characters and a lot of lines are grating enough on the ears that they're reminiscent of fandubs. It gives the impression that the VAs read the transcript for the translation, but were never provided the original Japanese audio tracks for reference leading to ad-libbing the cadence.Second complaint about the English dub, the voice director seemed to think it was a good idea to give background characters weird accents and lisps throughout the series, similar to Log Horizon, though it made sense in Log Horizon given that all the players were dorks, shut-ins and losers, but it doesn't make any sense here because this isn't an isekai and the people of this world are all relatively good-looking and average individuals. It's like having a cast of characters that look like supermodels but everyone sounds like Steve Buscemi, people like that do exist but they're not as common as this show makes them out to be. with solid dubbing, often good enough that I prefer it to the original Japanese.

I really enjoyed danmachi with bell and i was excited to hear about sword oratoria, while it wasn\'t a new season it was said to be from Aiz\'s point of view. I fully believe going into it thinking that was one of the reasons I didn\'t enjoy it as much. While some of the moments with Aiz were enjoyable (for me at least), they were few and far between. Instead this story focuses on Lefiya, a girl in her familia who is obsessed with her and frankly, is down right annoying.Sword...Oratoria is worth the watch is you\'re interested in learning more about the Danmachi setting but before you start be warned, this isn\'t ""The Ais Show"" most fans were hoping for.

They were in a middle of dungeon exploration until an evil organization Evilus came back to reek havoc on both adventurers and the city or Orario. Amidst the chaos, Information regarding Ais Walestine was brought back to her Familia's attention and they would investigate on the matter. Meanwhile, Ais encountered the main character of the original anime Bell and saves him. She would later develop emotions as a result of the encounter. Good concept to explore Ais' character but poorly executed.The relation between...Ais and Bell was already established and there were only few to no new original scenes regarding their relationship as the notable ones were reused from the original anime. This anime would also shoehorn Leifiya, an elf as a main character as she would take up a lot of screen time whether it be her with her yuri nonsense with Ais or the other female members of the Loki Familia notably Tiona and Tione or trying to scare off Bell from getting any closer to Ais out of jealously.This anime was way too focused on Leifiya and her yuri fantasies with Ais. It was supposed be focused on Ais and her perspective alongside the her Familia. All and all, not much can be spoken about since they reused scenes from the original anime and Leifiya pretty much ruined what good there is to me as a viewer of both the original anime and manga.

If you read the Manga, or the original novel, you would see that the later part (or the later half, even) takes place in a much longer time than what is shown to us. Thanks to them trying to speed things up, though I don't know what happened, but they literally killed off the...existence of so many characters with hella good character development. And some deaths that I have to say was so heavy were made light off to the point of none existence. Yes, they cut off some deaths and what comes with those deaths. But well, this happens a lot, and I don't think I can blame the production team for it. Let's say this is inevitable.But then, they made some key characters some shallow shounen-types. The whole struggle, with all 3 Bell Cranel, Ais Wallenstein and Lefiya Vildris get cut short. I mean, the key points are there, yeah, it's good and all, but the one thing showing the struggles of there 3 are nowhere to be seen, not that I can call what was shown as a struggle. Lefiya Vildris' sub plot with another elf too, it lost too many details it's seems too easy to be something as deep as I thought reading the Manga.Lastly, the needless details. Well, I don't mind them that much. Normally, that is. But now, they keep showing some side plot and the obsessive side of characters. Well, it's funny and are services. Let's not take it too hard. But then, they show details that are pretty needless, or are too little to say a thing.  Like the interaction between Bell Cranel and Lefiya Vildris for the first time: A small detail was shown, yet, nothing was said about it from the one character who just said something about it 1 episode ago. And there are humors cut shorts too. What I can't let go is the fact they like to put in more fan services than actual humor and plot line details.

No two way about it."", 'We can summarize this spin off of danmachi with one word: Cancer. It has given me cancer to see this garbage of adaptation.The main reason for my discontent can be divided into 4 parts:1- Protagonist and usurper: The story is supposed to focus on Aiz Wallenstein, on how the world looks before his eyes, but all we see is Lefiya, the elf that lesbian with sister complex that do nothing but suck Camera in each shot as if she were the protagonist and not so Lefiya is not the protagonist, Lefiya is a secondary character, a comic relief that should not even appear has robbed...the protagonist protagonist heroine in his own series. Aiz Wallenstein appeared in danmachi as a character without personality or feelings and stayed like this throughout the series, we hardly see her smile between plane and plane of Lefiya.In the manga, which is centered on Aiz we see a woman obsessed with power due to the death of her parents, it is clear that in her desire for revenge fell into madness and lost her feelings becoming a killing machine until she met To bell, something that in the adaptation is not appreciated by any part. I\'ve come to hate that damned elf because he not only brings nothing to the plot but constantly interrupts it. I do not know what the director was thinking.2- Loki\'s family: this is an interesting part because of how many people is that family? In the manga it is clear that they are many but they are recognizable and you get an idea of \u200b\u200btheir number, but in the anime that is not clear because in a moment you can see the 8 protagonists, in the following scene they are surrounded by a crowd And in the next shot they are back to being the 8 single ones who are those people who were eating with them? Loki\'s family is like a metal bar in the sun dilates and contracts with convenience and above all whenever the rest of the family appear are totally different people than we have seen until a moment what happens with That family Are you casting members and recruiting new ones like going to the supermarket?The other reason for my anger is the lack of chemistry between them, there is no indication of the supposed closeness between people who are supposed to be living under one roof. Riveria is supposed to play the role of mother and sister for Aiz and that can be seen in the manga when he gives advice to surround Bell or when he mocks her for letting the albino escape, they are touching scenes that reveal that Aiz does not Is alone despite having lost her parents and has people who love her and care about her, but in the adaptation Riveria does everything possible to avoid a situation of familiarity, it is more can be appreciated that every time she appears In scene tries to escape of her releasing some serious and cold phrase, there is no interaction neither with Aiz nor with the pallum nor with the dwarf, it gives the impression that Riveria hates the Loki family and only protects them because it seems that its goddess well Has been ordered, that is appreciated in the first minute where green worms are destroying the alleged family and she is left with folded arms, more is sent to Lefiya, a useless elf, to solve the situation but seeing that she can not Ede takes care of all the worms herself in a second what did it cost him to do that from the beginning?But the Loki family is not the only one who suffers this change, so do the Hermes where they eliminate to eliminate the majority of its members, which coincidentally, die in the manga, here do not even show them and above all At the end Hermes leaves saying that he has lost members of his family, to which members he refers? Because they have entered 5 to the dungeon and 5 were the ones that left who are supposed to have lost?3- Cut and recycled scenes: This part goes back to the beginnings, to chapter one, where it most hurt to see how the first chapters of the manga explaining what the Loki family conforms to, what they are Doing in the dungeon at that time and their interaction between them is a form of presentation but as we assume we all have the two sleeves and the novel we know as they are but what if I have not seen anything like that? And if it is the first series of danmachi I see? Not only will not I understand a shit, but the way they are introduced to the characters will give me everything that happens to them throughout the series.The initial battle against the monsters takes place outdoors in a glass floor, the Loki family faces a varied army of monsters. In the anime no, we put them in a corridor and that only minotauros burst and we complained about the bullfights?The appearance of the new species in the manga catches them all by surprise while in anime they appear as if nothing coming out of the cave saying ""hello whats"" and above all they have skipped the battle of Aiz against the final boss has been skipped because yes , There was an end boss leading these worms and for some reason I do not know we skipped that epic scene, then everyone gives importance to the fact that green worms have appeared as if it were something to worry about, when they have been charged at all in the First minute and without effort.Then to recycle scenes of the Danmachi anime as reminding us that this is a Spin off over and over again, that can be noticed in the battle of Bell and the minotaur, it is supposed that that battle must be seen from the perspective of the Loki family and Not in a cut and paste, is that we have literally returned to show the same battle of the child and the bull.The elimination of so many scenes damages not only the characters but the pace of adaptation and above all to their quality.The biggest problem with this adaptation was trying to put 75 volumes of 50 pages each in only 12 episodes what could go wrong? Perfectly could animate only one part and leave the other as a possible sequel, do not call me crazy, but I think a series of quality with sequels produces more benefits than this.4. The enemies: If you have read the manga you will notice that the enemies that Aiz faces are charismatic people, with their own thoughts and ideologies and above all have personality along with a particular way of doing things. Here they miss all this, show Revis as a flat villain who tries to catch Aiz for convenience of the script because in the manga at least has a reason for their actions. Olivas Act is stripped of personality, charisma, intelligence and everything that could be considered interesting in a character of its caliber reducing it to be an enemy even flatter than Revis that on top behaves like a stereotyped villain of the 90s, da Shame others from the moment he leaves and by how he performs things seems that man suffers a severe mental retardation, in the anime Olivas Act is not an antagonist, he is a madman who has escaped from the asylum, is not dangerous is just idiot , But the protagonists refer to him as someone who can beat them but does not do anything what is supposed to be dangerous? And above all besides eliminating the epic scene of fight against Bete, the werewolf, also eliminate his army, where are the suicidal members of Evilus? Did they suppress them only because they exploit themselves in Al Qaeda terrorist plan? Because if not, I can not find another reason.This adaptation is the worst they could have done to the series, when people read the manga will enter a totally new world where almost nothing that was shown will be the same. I have taken a tremendous disappointment because I expected more of something that had potential. I do not recommend this anime to anyone at all because it could not be more generic and unbearable and I do not say it just to see the disgusting face of Lefiya every minute.Thanks to google translation to allow me rewrite this review. the protagonist protagonist heroine in his own series.

Nice intense fightscenes and some pretty good animation in general.The sound is nothing special, i dont really notice it much to be honest.The story had a good concept, but is not really reaching it's potential.

It coincides with Season 1 and tells the story of the Loki family while Bell Cranel had his own journey. Incidentally, it has certain characters and references to season 3, but these have no influence on season 2. So you won't let yourself be spoiled by this season, as it has little reference to season 2.Basically, this season is more plot based than the first and offers more explanation in that area as well. The problem is however,...there is hardly any tension and that many scenes drag on until it finally comes to the point.What I liked, however, is how this season complemented itself with season 1 and showed the transition of the Loki families to all scenes from season 1 and what went on behind the scenes.Other than that, it's Danmachi's second weakest Season.StoryThe plot is a bit more interesting than the previous season, but that's about it. Mostly you only see the adventures of the Loki family while Bell had his own and the stories overlap every now and then. You learn a bit more about the dungeon and otherwise that's it.Animation / picturesAnimations were mostly average, except for a few highlights in which the fights were raised. Apart from that, they were a bit weaker than their predecessor.CharactersYou see a lot more of the Loki family here than in all seasons combined, but not enough. In the foreground of the season is the elven magician who wants to catch up with her idol Aiz. She is, in the sense, a female Bell Cranel. The only difference is that she is unsympathetic, annoying and extremely intrusive. Her character is also quite flat and her ambitions are negligible. It's like a failed attempt to create a second Bell character.The rest of the Loki family also had no depth of character or noteworthy developments. It's like looking at a season from the perspective of supporting characters who are actually eaten into their monotonous roles.MusicThe intro was at rock bottom and I would skip it every time.The Osts were also just average.ConclusionYou can and should watch this season if you are interested in the other seasons.

It's like looking at a season from the perspective of supporting characters who are actually eaten into their monotonous roles.MusicThe intro was at rock bottom and I would skip it every time.The Osts were also just average.ConclusionYou can and should watch this season if you are interested in the other seasons. And if not, then you should get a short summary and can skip it"", ""The anime is basically a sidestory to the original anime and it's nice to see the other side. That being said, this feels incredibly rushed without much effort on the storyline - basically like all the videogames made for disney movies.although the worst part is the character known as Lefiya. Her voice is sooooo high pitched - enough to give you a headache. And for some reason the story revolves more around her, than on Ais Wallenstein or Bell. And for some reason she can't shut up! Ever! Oh, and she is lesbian and in love with Ais for some ridiculous reason because why...not? Without her this would've been watchable. I've never written a review in my life, but this Lefiya is probably one of the worst designed characters you will ever come across. I don't know how old she is supposed to be,, probably somewhere around 13-16 but she reminds me of Ilya from Fate/Prisma Ilya (approximately a 10-year old) without the satire.

It’s not strictly necessary to watch DanMachi S1 before watching this, nor do I think it would make this more enjoyable, but it probably will help in understanding why it was made the way it was. Ultimately, this anime feels it was trying to do three somewhat interconnected things,...but it doesn’t manage to do any of them well, resulting in the anime overall feeling kind of pointless.One of the key focuses in this anime was further developing Ais Wallenstein, the sword princess, a pretty important and very popular side character in the main series. To that end, unlike the plot line in the main series which is essentially a series of entirely unrelated arcs, there is a clear overarching plot line in this season centered around Ais and her background. A villain is enacting some sort of plan, and discovering who the villain is and what they’re planning is the core of the plot at this point. It feels like it’s supposed to be mysterious, and there’s a lot of what feels like misdirection to try to make the viewer feel multiple characters could be the villain.The problems with this are that very little progress is made on the plot line, and though it is nice to see more of Ais, the progress made in fleshing out Ais’s background feels badly implemented. A lot of random things happen, but no real progress is made until the end, where they do discover what the villain’s goal is, but how that is explained is incredibly abrupt. It involves lore elements that hadn’t been explained at all in this or the main series, so there’s just a straight up infodump of those lore elements and how they explain what the villain is trying to do. The lore and world are interesting as was the case with the main series, but this was a terrible way to handle showing it. On top of that feeling like an incredibly messy way to end the season, the cast still have no clue how to stop them yet or anything like that, nor has any progress been made in discovering who they actually are. Furthermore, this infodump also just randomly dropped major revelations about Ais’s past, which similarly in addition to be really messy, is a really bad way to handle things because overall despite Ais being a focus in this anime it didn’t really feel like she was any more fleshed out as compared to the main series.Another key focus was Lefiya Viridis, another member of Loki Familia that had almost no presence in the main series, or the first season of it at least. She’s a character that looks up to Ais and is inspired by her to work harder so that she can stand alongside her. The problem with that is that that’s pretty much exactly the same as Bell, the protagonist the main series, and though she’s not a terrible character their similarities invite comparison and she’s just nowhere near as interesting as Bell. Her personality overall is a lot more dull without any aspects that really stood out, and although she is one of the focus’s in this series, she’s not focused on as much as Bell was in the main series, so far less fleshed out. The dynamics of her interactions with other characters are also a lot less amusing. Combine that with her not being as interesting in battle and it overall feeling like she’s grown way less than Bell, and the end result is that her story just feels like an unnecessary knock off of Bell’s.Lastly, it seems to try to show the events from the main series from a new perspective and highlight Loki Familia’s place in them. It ultimately does show off the scenes from the main series well enough, but the new perspective didn’t really feel like it added anything. It spends more time on showing the impact it had on characters and emotional reactions, but it doesn’t show anything that wasn’t already shown or clearly implied in the main series. Thus, there’s not much value to any of this. There are major issues though, in that the plot events of the main series having nothing to do with the plot events of this series, so whenever it shows the events from the main series, it feels like it’s veering off from it’s own plot which results in the overall flow being pretty bad and the pacing downright terrible. Thus, the attempt at doing this not only failed, but it dragged down the show overall as well.The art and animation are about as solid as the first season of the main series which is reasonably solid. Most of the character designs are from characters in the main series so overall the character designs are solid, but the designs for new characters felt somewhat weak. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable.

Ginga Tetsudou Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1490/Ginga_Tetsudou_Monogatari,"[""It always surprises me when I find a series that approaches perfection. I just finished watching Galaxy Railways, and have to say, if you even remotely enjoy anime, it is easily worth your time to watch it. Obviously Matsumoto Leiji is legendary for Harlock and Galaxy Express, and if you've seen his work in the past, this isn't a huge departure from it. Contained is a relatively typical, but incredibly deep cast of characters, including the obligatory hair-covering-one-eye protagonist Manubu, his Harlock-resembling father, and the beady-eyes-popping-out-of-their-forheads old people that bother me to no end.The story takes place in a futuristic-space setting where the usual spaceship...fare has been traded in for space-travelling trains, some of which look like they could be from the future, and some have the old-school flair of a coal-powered locomotive. These trains are used to traverse people across the galaxy, and there is a military operation called the SDF that protects these people from all the unusual things that happen to the trains they are riding. Manubu happens to join this faction and the series follows the SDF and their escapades across space.This is first-and-foremost a drama, you might feel yourself wanting to tear-up a couple of times. Aside from episode 19 (what's with episode 19?? 0_o) there is very little in the way of comedic relief. Despite that, you won't be crying yourself to sleep or anything. The main impression the series is constantly trying to get across to you is that grabbing a hold of your own destiny is possible with the right attitude.Animation is excellent 99% of the time. There are a couple of spots that appear slightly rushed, although they are brief and barely worth mentioning. There is some CG, however it is mostly used on the trains and is well hidden using cell-shading techniques. It would have been nice to see the trains moving a bit more fluidly in some cases, however this isn't detrimental by any means.My only other minor beef is episode 19, although I enjoyed it by its self, it doesn't fit in with the series at all. For those wondering, it's the overdone hot spring episode where half the girls introduced in the series show up and everyone suddenly digs Manabu, also interspersed with 1500% more comic relief. I'd love to know the story being this episode.Anyway, if you have some time to burn, pick up this series, it should not disappoint, even if you're a somewhat jaded anime watcher like myself. fare has been traded in for space-travelling trains, some of which look like they could be from the future, and some have the old-school flair of a coal-powered locomotive.

The Galaxy Railways has all the things I was looking for. Interesting story, well developed characters. The setup is a bit unexpected, but it works! yes, flying trains maybe something not really of a sci-fi, but that is just the base ground to build up an interesting story around it. To anyone who looks for a bit serious anime, a conclusive ending, a hint of romance and some drama, I would definitely recommend to watch this anime. I wish there were more like this. ', 'As soon as I saw the picture/cover art of this anime I immediately remembered those anime shows of the late 70s / early 80s namely, Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express 999 and all those other shows. Apparently they\'re all done by the same person, Leiji Matsumoto. Most of his stuff are pretty good but it doesn\'t mean that ALL of his works are good. I picked up this title because I like to watch dubs and this one a title that seemed interesting and it reminded me of those old Captain Harlock shows from when I was a kid. This show is....interesting, I wouldn\'t say it\'s...overwhelmingly fantastic or anything but it\'s a nice change of pace to look at a different style of art compared to other types of anime.I like the character design, the rest is pretty standard compared to other shows of it\'s time. I wouldn\'t say anything was particularly impressive, maybe what I like about it is that all the concepts are old-school however they are very much improved upon by the conveniences modern drawing techniques and technologies. The colors are nice, the shadings and blendings are done very well. Most of the background settings are well done and some of the locales appear very exotic. All the lights on the bridge and the LED diagrams have a fantastic glow and 3D effect to them that obviously would not have been available in any 70s anime.This doesn\'t mean there aren\'t any flaws. To me, a lot of the time the characters look distorted or disproportionate. The animation is slow and choppy in some areas, you can see this during the fight scenes  or when they\'re running, the movements seem kinda amateurish. The train sequences are all CGI so those look great.I hate 70s anime music which is obviously what the OP and ED tracks were inspired by, it\'s always some old dude with his warbling voice with a lot of brass in the background, But for some reason, I was OK with the OP maybe because it was upbeat or because I could tell the music was modern or at least digitally processed and recorded and the singer didn\'t seem to be overdoing it. However I can\'t say the same for the ED theme, that one did kinda get to me by the 3rd time I heard it, so I skipped it.  The English dub was quite good, no one sounded hokey or went over-the-top with the acting...can\'t say the same thing about the narrator tho! He sounded creepy as hell, he sounded a lot like one of those narrators from those old horror TV series like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside which made the tone of the series even darker and more depressing.If somebody asked me what this show was about, I would probably say it\'s about flying trains because that\'s the first thing that comes to mind. Can\'t blame me tho, that is the main, constant imagery used throughout the series. Beyond that there really isn\'t any one main story or theme. Some might disagree and say it\'s about Manabu, and to others who want to philosophical about it, they might say it\'s about man\'s ability to deal with death, grief, loss and overcoming one\'s ""destiny"". Both would be a true statement.Most of the stories in this series are told in an “Adventure-of-the-Week” style with each story having it\'s own resolution by the end of the episode. The stories are pretty straight-forward and simple, they\'re mainly about various rescue missions and some side stories. But it\'s not like the characters don\'t get to grow or develop, each story does give a little insight about a character so I would say that the stories do have some purpose, they aren\'t just totally random “Family Guy” type episodes.One thing that took me by surprise about this series is the level of fantasy in these stories, maybe because I\'ve seen that it tagged as “SCI-FI” on some sites including MAL. But I would say this is more like a fantasy series so much so, that some stories almost have a nightmarish element to them: flying trains, ghosts, aliens, monsters that don\'t die when you shoot them, black knights on horseback chasing you down dark alleyways, Grim Reapers etc.I assumed the series was completely Sci-Fi, more along the lines GUNDAM, MACROSS or even Old-School Captain Harlock that had more to do with politics, spaceships and battles and less to do with spirits, ghosts, faeries and the like.....not that it was a bad thing, I just didn\'t expect all of that. This show has a lot of ghosts, but I\'ll venture to say that even though the ghosts and spirits in the show are supposedly “real”, they probably served as some kind of symbolism for the characters\' dealing with “loss” and “grief”. It\'s definitely not supposed to be taken as a Scooby-Doo mystery. If you do get bored of all the rescue stories, this do get exciting after episode 20 way more exciting, even the art seems to look a little better!A good chunk of the characters you meet in this series are melancholy. They all have some kind of past that involves death and grieving so I would say be prepared to deal with that. Most of the stories are centered around the main guy, Manabu, I like him but at the same time he gets on my nerves a little bit. He\'s way too impulsive and emotional, I\'m not saying he should embrace every rule but in almost every episode he HAS to do something in complete defiance of regulation or reason...he just HAS to!!! It\'s like whoa dude, not everything is about you, I\'m sure if you shut up and sit down the captain and the other crew members can solve the issue too! Another character that kinda irks me is Shura AKA “Blue Crystal Ball Chic” all she does throughout the whole series is stand perched over that swirly blue orb and shed that sad-ass single teardrop. OK yeah maybe you see her two or three other times doing something else...like rolling around on the ground and such but that\'s what you mainly see her doing. All the while wearing her blue swimsuit and tassels, yet she is the Supreme Commander of the SDF? LOL yeah, that\'s how you know this shit is fantasy and not sci-fi, there\'s no bikini-clad Supreme Commanders in Gundam or ROBOTECH, not even the comedy ones. Beyond that all the other characters are pretty normal and cool...well, I guess I would still like to know what a sexaroid is? Is that a 6th generation android or just some kind of hooker robot?I\'ve always liked Leiji Matsumoto\'s character designs, the boys with mop-topped 70s hair and the girls with never-ending tresses and super long lashes. The body types in this series are a little fuller, especially the men, compared to his earlier designs. of course this isn\'t everyone in the series but most of them looked that way, I also love the high-collared uniforms of the SDF...this is also another one of his “signature looks”This was a pretty good show, by the end I would even say it was awesome. I\'ll admit I underestimated this series, I was never bored watching it but in the beginning with all the ghosts and rescue missions I simply looked at it as a mediocre series, sometimes even depressing. It wasn\'t until after episode 20/21 that I changed my opinion and got really into it. Overall I would still say this is a sad anime but it\'s not mediocre at all. overwhelmingly fantastic or anything but it\'s a nice change of pace to look at a different style of art compared to other types of anime.I like the character design, the rest is pretty standard compared to other shows of it\'s time.

I’e stated before that I’ll watch anything with that man’s name attached to it and really wanted to watch it when I first heard about it last millennium. And as Leijiverse stuff goes it’s a base line. While the animation is fluid and smooth, the character designs are of Leiji’s era (meaning old) The stories are by the book, which is okay, but Manabu Yuki’s young man pursuing the only dream he ever had thing has been done in...every Leijiverse production to date. The stand alone character driven stories are good but cliché. But there’s this goddess of time thing going on that I scarcely remember because it wasn’t interesting. Also, none of the established Leijiverse character appear. I love space opera. I love watching things blow up in space; it’s one of the reasons I never stopped watching anime. But if you’ve seen any other Leijiverse, then this will offer you nothing new and different. Having said all that, the action is cool, the drama real and occasionally discussed philosophically, and space is just as strange as ever. So it delivers exactly what it offers. I probably would’ve loved it more had I seen it years ago. It’s far superior to OZMA though and more accessible than The Endless Odyssey.

The SDF is a police force of sorts that protects those on the railways.Story 7/10: I liked it for the most part considering like I mentioned the space traveling was done by trains which is different. But the rest of the story was somewhat typical and for half of the series i thought it was slow paced. Towards the end an alien force tries to wipe out the railway system because of angst over there lost planet and they decide it's travelers fault.

His father and brother served and died so you dislike him for assuming he wants sympathy or something? Seems kind of weird. I guess he's just meant to be a cynical pig-headed guy or something.Anyway yup not very good...writing. writing."", 'Story: 3Animation: 9Sound: 7Characters: 2Enjoyment: 1Total: 4Ginga Tetsudou Monogatari does so many things wrong. But this is due to two very important factors. The theme and the story structure. And both are running the rest into the ground.But let\'s start with the setting first, because it is weird. In the future, humanity has advanced space travel to such a degree that most of the inhabitable planets are connected via space trains, which are literally trains in space, varying in technological images. The main cast controls a steam train in all its retro glory. Steam from the stovepipe and connected wheels are predominantly featured in multiple...shots. And the trains start from an ramp on the planet and rise up like dragons into space. The premise alone is weird enough, but when steam is constantly shown in space, not to mention the later fires and explosions, physics wasn\'t considered at all. This makes the visuals far more funny and mind numbing than probably intended.Next it the theme. It run heavy through the whole show and every aspect of it. Fate and the connections people make during these predetermined times are the core of the theme of this anime. Every episode explains an aspect of fate and how the symbolism of the show works. Like how the train tracks represent fate and the train stations the points where we meet other people. After the second time I was already grained of how hand-fed this presentation is. It is like that they really want me to know how important the symbolism is.<Minor story plot spoilers from here on.>Which is heavily undercut by the last few episodes. Until then fate was deemed as this unmovable force and the tracks can\'t be changed once placed, which is not how any train track work, but I let that one slide. When an enemy force from another dimension threatens the whole space track system, the whole symbolism falls apart. In the show this one seer is heavily featured as she seems to have clairvoyant powers, not limited to the present. But when the invaders arrive, her sight got immediately destroyed. Which only suggests to me that everything the show wanted to tell me with its symbolism is plainly wrong. Fate can be altered, destroyed and changed if an outside force is applied. This makes it really frustrating to judge this show by its theme.On the contrary the story is easily to judge. It is bad. It flip-flops between an arc based story structure and episodic episodes and cannot hold its feet still. It starts somewhat promising with 3 introductory episodes about the main character, the legacy he has to uphold and the concept of a returning antagonist. This quickly gets thrown out of the window as up until the last 6 episodes everything becomes detached and episodic. And while there where some callbacks to past episodes, most of them are stupid and confusing. Most prominently the worst episodes are the memory episode early on and the planet evacuation episode. Both deal with some heavy themes like depression and letting go of trauma, but they both handled by the occurrence of magic.And the more one thinks about the circumstances of how the main cast blunders themselves into these situations, it only becomes more infuriating. ""We need to evacuate the planet within 24 hours!"" and the main cast is like: ""Let\'s drive by car to gather the last people around here."" Wh..... Why? Who thought that this would be a smart idea? You have planet-scanning capabilities. And the evacuation order was put out a year ago. It makes zero sense to even be there.And this is the transition for the characters, because it too makes zero sense. Let\'s start with the overall group. We follow a cast of 6 people as they each fulfill a role in a long lasting squad in the Space Defense Force. Yuuki and Louis are new members as they graduated the academy at the same time. What role they specifically do is never really explained. But it seems that they have to do everything. Controlling weapons, flying a space ship, repairing and maintaining the space train and analyzing complex structures seem just a part of all the things they have to do. All while transporting military weaponry. It primarily feels like they are part of a police force, but it got militarized to such a heavy degree that it spun totally out of control. Especially since in the early episodes the actual military force is introduced as another branch. However, they still have to fight terrorists, pirates and rebels as if they were the special forces. And by the way: the whole shtick with the terrorists, pirates and rebels is also never explained. Of why they act the way they do, just don\'t think about it; we labeled them as such and thus they are the enemies.I feel like I already have written too much and too little. I could go on and on about detailed structures and hierarchies within the animes universe, but it only would matter so much.The art is very fine (even tho I only watched a highly pixelated version) and the sound can be catchy and serves the shows weird space western theme.The Galaxy Railways just can\'t deliver with art and sound alone. Characters, and especially the main one, feel very grindy to listen to, not by the voice actors fault, but the stupidity of his sentences. The writing is, for the most part, atrocious and boring at the same time and the space setting isn\'t used at all. It quickly falls into the sci-fi trap of having one planet for one thing. Like the homebase planet and the gothic architectural Europe planet. The throat shoved symbolism is more hindrance than anything and vastly hampered the writers. Most of the episodes are about the expanding character cast and more often than not, they visited new locales in tandem.

The God of High School,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41353/The_God_of_High_School,"['***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***Two words: MASTER-PIECEWhen you thought that your favourite anime had come to your top to stay for a long time, when you conceived that your life would not be enlightened again by an artwork of such caliber, God of Highschool soon came knocking on everyone’s door, what am I saying knocking!, breaking down the door and establishing themselves as the best anime ever.Where should I start? Its pacing and story-telling? Marvelous. Who else doesn’t love when things are so rushed that after 13 episodes you don’t have any idea of what is the main goal of the series...or even the main goal...of its characters? Is it world destruction? God supremacy? Supporting the case of why taekwondo should continue being at the Olympics? No determination whatsoever!As a matter of fact, us members of society can recall that WE ALL LOVE pointless fights without any meaning nor backstory; why wouldn’t we, if I may ask? Devices such as plot twists, showcasing character motivations, displaying impactful moments or executing contrasts properly in order to build up/shift momentum, change characters status quo, conveying emotions through the screen, or just for the sake of having an interesting, meaningful action scene are things that GoH NEVER contemplated, which, in my humble opinion, sets the tone on how things must be done on any anime which places value in providing quality content to its viewers. Greatness.Speaking about greatness, we must ask ourselves about the integrity of the “plot”. It had been awhile since the last time I’ve watched a show which had such an organised, perspicuous and easy to follow plot, with no plot holes or unexplained sudden events whatsoever. For example: Seoul\'s population looks doomed because the good guys seem incapable of dealing with <<Nox>>?  No worries, Alchemist-san saves the day transporting the whole city to a cliff out of nowhere. Already not convinced? What about if I told you that the show has a mysterious aura around it (however I have not been able to grasp it yet)?And don\'t get me started with this show\'s coherence -one of its strengths-, like for instance, when the show it\'s stuck in a cul-de-sac, as they display their marvelous scripting techniques to solve the sticking point masterfully (e.g. kyuubi-power recovery from Ilpyo despite the key being detached from him)And what about the GoH universe itself and its mechanics? Nothing notorious, just a normal society with its ups and downs, a little bit corrupted and all...oh, did I forgot to tell you that it\'s based on Ancient Rome? Such an elegiac tone! I mean, it’s pretty obvious when you notice how people love to rock the dome to see how high school students martial-fight to death...where the lions at? Oh, before I forget! Did you think this was a martial arts-esque show? Nothing further from the truth! By episode 8 you realise that EVERYONE has something known as “Charyeok” -kind of a borrowed power from an ancient God who had appeared twice in previous episodes- and that they are going to fight with it pretty much for the entire time. Greatness.Nevertheless, I personally have to say that the major asset of this series is its originality. A mysterious organization stages a tournament in order to find the strongest high school student in Korea, but apparently it\'s all staged, being their “main goal” to find a “key” (which, apparently, is well-known that has to be inside a highschool student) that will help them fight a more mysterious and darker organization (as you must infer, because it’s never said due to the complexity of the plot and how they play mind games with us) who wants to destroy the world as we know. It is not my role to discern for you, but allow me to say that I had never heard of anything like this. NEVER EVER.And let’s not forget about the originality of our characters! Whether it\'s our MC Mo-Ri, an oblivious, food-lover, meathead, “don’t you dare touch my friends” who just wants to live life fighting strong people, for the sake of becoming stronger; Mi-Ra and her pursue of power to prevent the ostracism of her family’s hallmark or even our s1 antagonist, a guy who wanted to feel relevant by any costs and rejected his personality and liveliness for the likes of a third party. Amazingly unique, isn’t it?Speaking about this, highlight the ability of the writers in God of Highschool to avoid breathing life into their fictional characters. Motivations, backstories, RELATABILITY...the writers could had made the mistake of believing that these would have helped them develop a marvelous, compelling story which made the audience empathise with the cast on a personal level, laughing/suffering/crying with them as different events took place during the show, but, fortunately, they were quick-thinkers enough to avoid using these devices.Backtracking a little bit, talking about the artistic component of the show, it’s obvious that MAPPA made sure that the quality of the animation in God of High School was good enough to support their OFF THE CHARTS job in the plot and characters counterpart. Fluidity and choreography looked, for the most part, good enough -especially during fight scenes-, sakuga animation was carried out surprisingly well, backgrounds were depicted nicely, characters were designed properly...art and animation was quite good, with the only complaint on how camera rotations and 3D movements were often overused, making it, on those specific moments, something really hazy to watch.By the same token, music has had a leading role in the “success” of this season. Good job enhancing the different emotions that were on display during different moments, whether it was hyping up the moment when a fight was taking place, intensifying the sense of urgency, ...yet I really missed a banger as OP. Voice actors did a notable job, felt like it had to be said.So, at the end of the day, I guess that if you\'ve reached the end of this review you\'ll have the same opinion as myself: GoH is a great piece of rubbish.""There\'s a resistance for people to talk about things that make them feel guilty. When natural disasters happen, it\'s easier not to feel guilty about it."" of its characters? Is it world destruction? God supremacy?

When natural disasters happen, it\'s easier not to feel guilty about it.""', ""To summarize the whole show: Generic Side Characters, Generic Protagonist, and Generic Mindless Fighting.Slight spoilers for the first four episodes ahead -This is solely based on the current 4 episodes of the anime and not the original Webtoon (I have not read it).Story: 1There is no plot to be found. To start, a tournament is held to crown the strongest high school student in Korea. The people that join have extremely typical anime character abilities. The prize is that one wish will be granted to the winner. We soon learn that the competition is held by an ominous organization with seemingly malevolent intentions (Wow! So...creative!). Nothing happens after this. People just fight, and the characters are not expanded on. If you like pointless fights with no plot, this show is for you. Some of the fans may say that the story gets better, but there's no explanation for not progressing the plot barely in 4 episodes.Characters: 1Truly terrible characters. Our protagonist Jin Mori is not interesting at all. He has no traits that set himself apart from Son Goku from the popular Dragon Ball series. Jin seems to be the strongest high school student, loves food, is notably oblivious in many situations, and tries to protect his friends. The author just stole all of Goku's personality and changed how the character looked. Just as with Jin, side characters are not unique. They are basic characters that have no personality aside from a single defining trait. Character development is completely void from the show. In addition, their motivations for entering the tournament are nothing special. Everyone has seen these typical reasons before.Sound 8:Sound effects and music are well done. Nothing much to sayAnimation: 10Some of the best animation I have seen. Mappa did extremely well with this and made the fight scenes fluid and amazing to watch.Character Design: 5Basic and average. Not unique or special.Final Rating: 2Overall, the appalling writing and characters can not be redeemed by the near flawless animation. This show seems to have been made with the focus on the story in the backseat. After watching the whole series, I intend to make an update to this review. I hope that The God of High School will be able to change my opinion.Edit: It was too painful to finish this show, so I can't make an update. creative!). Nothing happens after this.

I finished today, what I see as one of the most overhyped, yet underwhelming show of the year. The God of High School represents the type of show that is forced down our throats like the next big thing. Advertised as a Crunchyroll original, this anime has convinced me that there’s little hope for a decent manhwa adaptation in the future. Don’t let your eyes deceive you by the flashy animation and aesthetics. The God of High School is a show I wouldn't dream of recommending.As I sat here wondering what went wrong, my initial impression of the anime...was actually hopeful. The first episode bought out the talents of director Seong-Hu Park as he’s able to craft together some lavishly animated scenes. In fact, it’s easy to say the first episode is an eye catcher of animation with the amount of ass kicking and fast moving action. We are introduced to 17 year old Mo-Ri Jin, a martial arts from the country of South Korea. The free spirited young man has the ambition of a fighter, and seeking out powerful opponents to test his abilities. This is where we are introduced to the God of High School Martials Arts Tournament, a place for fighters all over the world to showcase their skills.Despite being the main protagonist, the story also introduces Mi-Ra Yu and Dae-Wi Han. Both characters also possesses talent in martial arts with their unique fighting styles. It’s why both are also invited to the GoHS tournament although they have different motives. For instance, Han participates in the fight to help his friend while Mira seeks to find a suitable marriage partner. No matter what the reason, it seems GoHS loves pushing the characters’ personalities at every chance it gets. The most prominent examples are when Jin gets excited at fighting a powerful opponent or when he is motivated. Other times, it’s when Jin finds a reason to fight, such as crashing a wedding and helping Mira. It’s motivations like this that sets off an early impression of the show. But with every progressing episode, the show degenerates into a chaotic mess.It seems the more and more I watched the show, the less I feel motivated myself to understand the main purpose of the story. What is it even trying to get us to understand? The main characters? The tournament arc? Or perhaps some sort of reason for God of High School to even exist? The meat of the show remains with the tournament and different fights that occurs throughout the main story. It also seems these fights often feels rushed and lacking importance. Even Han, a selfless man, who fights for the sake of others becomes a chore to watch. How many times do we have to hear his unenthusiastic dialogues? Every one of his fight feels similar and furthermore, it’s easy to say he is the most boring character to watch in the entire series. As the story ventures forward, we are thrown into more chaotic storytelling involving supernatural forces such as the Nine Tailed Guardian, God incarnates, and plot to kill certain divine beings. When you try to make a show spin out of control in such way, it sets off a ticking time bomb of chaos.Outside of the main cast, don’t expect much character development from the other characters. This is advertised as a 13-episode one cour series. To make the story flow, we are introduced to some significant side cast such as IIpyo Park. Serving as a more logical member of the cast, IIpyo is observant and not often the one to rush into battle head on. He appears to be one of the more mysterious member of the cast but unfortunately, the anime doesn’t get the chance to explore the full side of his character. This seems to fall in line with the majority of named characters, including one of the main antagonists, Mujin Park. As being the head in charge of the tournament, you can expect him to be the master pulling the strings. Being manipulative and calculating, Mujin represents the anti-thesis of Jin and the main cast. And to add on to the rogue gallery, there’s Taek Jegal, a major threat who treats almost everyone as worthless. His power hungry personality fees on his ego to the point where he cares for no one but himself. It’s the type of stereotypical antagonist you can come up in less than 5 seconds in any type of anime. Taek’s main rival appears to be Iipyo, but from a storyline perspective, he represents nothing more than a generic villain. With all said and done, background storytelling even falls short with info dumps about the cults, Gods, and other divine powers. Because let’s face it, this anime serves as little more than being an advertisement for a glorified fight show.Well, if there’s one selling point of the anime, it’s the animation. In fact, I can say The God of High School is more about showing than telling. From the first major fight and every other forward, it looks like the anime pushes the boundaries of animation. It’s stylistic and dynamic with fast paced motion. The comic-like art quality also makes the important fights feel like major attractions. When the anime settles for a lighthearted tone, it bounces back into comedic scenery of cartoonish character expressions. Even the music accompanied with the action sequences makes the fights more dynamic. If you wanted to see a visual action flick, The God of High School will be a hell of a ride.Don’t let those flashy animation fool you. This show wanted to be something special and indeed, it some ways managed to do that. But beyond the typical main trio cast and the ass kicking scenes, this is no more than a mediocre story trying its best to sell its product to you. Even with the sufficient funding, The God of High School reminds me to always, and always keep expectations in check for manhwa adaptations. was actually hopeful.

When you try to make a show spin out of control in such way, it sets off a ticking time bomb of chaos.Outside of the main cast, don’t expect much character development from the other characters. This is advertised as a 13-episode one cour series. To make the story flow, we are introduced to some significant side cast such as IIpyo Park. Serving as a more logical member of the cast, IIpyo is observant and not often the one to rush into battle head on. He appears to be one of the more mysterious member of the cast but unfortunately, the anime doesn’t get the chance to explore the full side of his character. This seems to fall in line with the majority of named characters, including one of the main antagonists, Mujin Park. As being the head in charge of the tournament, you can expect him to be the master pulling the strings. Being manipulative and calculating, Mujin represents the anti-thesis of Jin and the main cast. And to add on to the rogue gallery, there’s Taek Jegal, a major threat who treats almost everyone as worthless. His power hungry personality fees on his ego to the point where he cares for no one but himself. It’s the type of stereotypical antagonist you can come up in less than 5 seconds in any type of anime. Taek’s main rival appears to be Iipyo, but from a storyline perspective, he represents nothing more than a generic villain. With all said and done, background storytelling even falls short with info dumps about the cults, Gods, and other divine powers. Because let’s face it, this anime serves as little more than being an advertisement for a glorified fight show.Well, if there’s one selling point of the anime, it’s the animation. In fact, I can say The God of High School is more about showing than telling. From the first major fight and every other forward, it looks like the anime pushes the boundaries of animation. It’s stylistic and dynamic with fast paced motion. The comic-like art quality also makes the important fights feel like major attractions. When the anime settles for a lighthearted tone, it bounces back into comedic scenery of cartoonish character expressions. Even the music accompanied with the action sequences makes the fights more dynamic. If you wanted to see a visual action flick, The God of High School will be a hell of a ride.Don’t let those flashy animation fool you. This show wanted to be something special and indeed, it some ways managed to do that. But beyond the typical main trio cast and the ass kicking scenes, this is no more than a mediocre story trying its best to sell its product to you. Even with the sufficient funding, The God of High School reminds me to always, and always keep expectations in check for manhwa adaptations."", ""Do I recommend this anime? No, unless you really want to watch it.Over the past few years, there have been quite a few shonen/action anime. Some of these shonen/action show flopped and became dreadfully bad, no plot, no reason to fight, and mostly just poorly done. The God of High School is yet another plotless action anime. When it comes to action animes like these there are always fans who will always call it a masterpiece.Story - 2/10Absolutely zero plot. Just fighting. They try adding mysteries and some plot but it's not done properly. Which makes the show even worse. They threw in...a plot to make it better...Art - 7/10I can't get over the fact that they have red noses and red ears. It makes them look drunk slightly and its also giving me OCD. Either way, the art was good, the animation had a little too much motion blur, but overall it was really well done. In my opinion, they also changed the art style for a few seconds for humor too many times.Sound - 4/10I'm going to be 100% honest. I hate the intro and the animation that goes with the intro. The sound effects are a little overdone but honestly, I don't care about that part as long as it isn't cringe.Character - 2/10They overreact on everything. They contribute nothing to the plot. They have no background. They are too shallow. I could keep going on and on, but I'm going to try finding good parts... At least they aren't annoying?Enjoyment - 4/10I enjoyed the mindless fighting. Besides that I hated it.Overall - 3/10I wouldn't be watching this if this season's pick were so bad. It was poor. It was just generic. a plot to make it better...Art - 7/10I can't get over the fact that they have red noses and red ears. It makes them look drunk slightly and its also giving me OCD.

There is no story and that’s what this anime prides itself on, no story and all fighting, just the way everyone likes it… Not. Behold a grand tournament in a universe where Korean high school students look like 20-30 year olds and everyone is just suddenly okay with watching a bunch of “teens” fight to the death. I didn’t know we went back to ancient Rome with the gladiator pit. Jin Mori, a typical generic shonen maincha- I mean typical student who just happens to be very good at fighting. With his power up flashbacks and insane moves he will climb...the ranks and move up in the tournament to be the God of High School. And.. That’s it. That’s literally all you need to know. I’m pretty sure the only plot in this show is the animation, which makes no sense but for some reason fits God of High School perfectly.Art: 8It would be criminal to say the animation of this is not superb. The quality of MAPPA is indeed very appealing and I expect to see this fluent animation throughout the show.Sound: 6The sounds are fine however the dubstep take they play throughout the series is pretty bad. The opening and ending is hard to sit through and unless you are a hardcore techno fan, then you wouldn’t like it.Characters: 3Typical boring cliche troupes of characters that you have seen so many times before. You have the tsundere who I’ll bet you the mortgage on my house falls in love with Jin eventually. You have the typical quiet badass that literally does nothing. You have the typical loud meathead shonen MC who is always hungry and wants to fight. I’m not even gonna say how many times that has been re-done. And… That’s it. Those are the only characters you really need to pay attention to. The rest of the characters are just gonna be there for plot convenience so it’s not worth going over them. Can these types of shows really not think beyond these basic troupes that have been recycled and re-used dozens of times. It’s not interesting or cool anymore, it’s eye rolling and boring.Enjoyment: 6Despite me lashing out on this series, besides having to prematurely turn off your brain before hand, it is quite entertaining. The fight scenes are awesome and the animation to par. If you only care about thrill factor and just want a good watch, go for it. However, if you actually want a compelling and fleshed out series, I’d look somewhere else. Like I said, this anime seems to pride itself on being just action so if that’s what you want, hey go for it.Overall: 2I’ve said what I wanted and I hope this anime can create some type of foundation cause that’s what it’s gonna need if it wants me to stick around. the ranks and move up in the tournament to be the God of High School.

Colour me surprised. While the source material isn\'t the greatest narrative to work from and leaves much to be desired, to go even further and butcher already subpar material to the point of being irredeemable is quite an achievement.One of the most admirable and compelling qualities of a skilled writer is the ability to breathe life into a fictional character. Backstories, motivations, exposition, relatability; there are various tools that are paramount for establishing a connection between a viewer and a character, and that connection is the very factor that spurs a...compelling story. The ability to compel an audience to relate with a cast on a personal level, to revel its triumphs and suffer from its downfalls, to laugh or cry with nothing more than a mere figment of their imagination is what separates mediocre writing from great writing. But unfortunately, to even call God of Highschool \'mediocre\' would be dishonest.The God of Highschool cast is, in a word, completely uninspired. Because like most shounen, the anime is far more interested in constructing one dimensional characters that are effectively the same chaotic conglomeration of incessantly rehashed shounen tropes we\'re forced to witness every single cour than meaningful, relatable characters. Jin Mori, or rather budget Son Goku, fills the role of your typical happy-go-lucky shounen protagonist, Han Daewi has quite literally no discernible personality, and Mira Yu is, unsurprisingly, the token hotheaded female sidekick that effectively serves nothing more than the role of a third wheel. As far as characters go, God of Highschool spares not even a shred of creativity or originality. It has nothing to call its own and provides nothing notably meaningful or interesting in the slightest.Not only are the bases of the cast uninspired enough, but to add insult to injury, any sort of exposition regarding character motivations and backstory are either glossed over or completely omitted, throwing us right into a chaotic disgrace of a tournament arc right from episode one. After all, God forbid MAPPA actually makes an attempt to provide a meaningful and cohesive story, rather than adapting a whopping eleven chapters an episode, glossing over important concepts and providing a half-assed adaptation all for the sake of cramming an extra content that is not even remotely worth watching into a one cour adaptation. There is no attempt to establish and explain Han Daewi\'s relationship with his ill companion. No attempt to shed light on Yu Mira\'s actual disposition, her motivations and her struggles regarding her family situation. And ultimately, no attempt to actually provide a suitable foundation that would allow the events of arc 1 to have any meaningful emotional impact. Is this really worth losing for the sake of extra content?Funnily enough, God of Highschool seems to be revered for its quality of animation, enough that it\'s effectively considered the selling point of the show. While there are particularly significant highlights showcasing great camerawork and choreography, there are far more than enough poorly handled fights to counterbalance the positives. The rotating camera effect is overused and an absolute eyesore. Characters are often just lazily, slowly tweened from place to place, making various fights feel irritatingly slow paced and carelessly executed. A lack of impact frames means many attacks feel like they have absolutely no weight behind them. And the ""single-stroke battle"" trope being used not once, but three times in the Baek Sungcheul fight was laughably bad. GoH animation is nothing admirable, and its occasional highlights and the fact that it\'s able to display slightly more effort than your run of the mill shounen are all it has going for it.Ultimately, God of Highschool provides neither anything of its own nor anything of worth. Rather than the simple but compelling and flashy demeanor it intends to give off, it showcases neither substance nor flavour and is an utter waste of time. If you\'re looking for great animation and choreography, watch Katanagatari. If you\'re looking for a compelling and deep story, watch SnL. If you\'re looking for a great cast, watch Run With the Wind.

It is worth mentioning that I have not read the manhwa of this anime.I hope it helps you to understand all the points of this anime and be encouraged to see it.Remember, all anime / manga can be enjoyed without problems, do not get carried away by bad comments and in case of comparing with another work that is not in order to devalue a job.Story / Plot: 8/10At first glance, history is not the most innovative, but it does not mean that great things cannot be achieved. A tournament full of arts and fighting...styles of all kinds, where the winner will have whatever wishes they have. The goal of the tournament is to find the best fighter in all of Korea.The tournament is sponsored by a mysterious organization and full of strong people, surely more groups will appearAt the moment little else can be said, it is clear that the story will be complicated and will have more aggregates, but for the moment it can be summarized by saying, in this world there are unusual things and people with superhuman abilities.Characters / Personalities: 8/10The protagonist, Jin, Mo-Ri, is the typical student with a very happy character and who conveys that. He is a very strong person who enjoys fighting against others and at all times is looking for someone powerful to face, yes, how Goku. Regarding his past, we know that he was very close to his grandfather and was a person with few friends.Han Dae-Wi is a calm and confident looking boy. As can be seen in fights, it has enormous strength and resistance and uses it to fight, its main attacks being simple fists, but with a lot of power. Not much is known about him from his past, we only know that he participates in the tournament to get money and help a close friend who is hospitalized.Yu Mi-Ra, the waifu from the anime, is a nice and strong girl, who participates in the tournament with the aim of reviving her dojo. As with other people, not much is known about her past, only that her sword is the only thing she has left to remember her father.Animation / Setting: 10/10The studio in charge of bringing us this anime is MAPPA, which we all know in installments like: Kakegurui, Dorohedoro and soon for Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season.The anime is set in a modern and impeccable city, in which the technology is a little more advanced than the current one, at least in medical terms, what it looks like to heal the protagonist\'s broken neck in a matter of seconds using ""nanomachines"", which are found in the bodies of each participant.The animation stays well at all times, from when the protagonist walks to the moment when he confronts someone. Sometimes it seems that they ignore the laws of physics, it can be seen when they perform certain movements where, being in the air they move a lot from their initial position, but this is understandable when remembering that superhuman movements are possible in this world.The physical appearance and clothing of the characters is quite good and is not very far from reality, most characters dress in typical clothing, although in some cases it is observed that certain people dress according to their fighting style.There are also funny details like how most characters, if not all, have red nose tips and even ear tips, which is quite funny, but after all you get used to it. After all, it\'s not a big deal, but it can serve as a way to recognize anime.Sound: 10/10This section stands out a lot in this anime since it has a more than acceptable performance and brings with it two magnificent songs.The opening theme, ""Contradiction,"" is mostly electronic, quite catchy, and blends in perfectly with the anime, as stated in a nutshell it\'s chilling and entertaining enough to keep you in your seat and not ignore it. It is also important to mention that it is very well done, for example, when it reaches the climax it feels ""explosive"" which combines with the theme of fighting in the anime.In the same way, the ending theme is mainly electronic, contrary to the opening theme, this at all times remains ""constant"" and ""calm"", it serves to appease after almost being absorbed by your seat and how excited the chapter was, But it does not make you lose that emotion, it makes you have your feet on the ground and your body relaxed, it creates an atmosphere of satisfaction and tranquility.In terms of setting in all types of scene, the sounds and / or music are according to the situation, it is a perfect way to make you get even more into the story and share what the characters feel. Likewise, in the fight scenes the music used and the expected sounds are adequate. It is worth mentioning that they adequately handle momentary ups and downs of tones at specific times.Enjoy: 10/10This anime is undoubtedly a show that anyone can see without needing to be a lover of anime or a specific genre. Age doesn\'t matter either.It may be your first or 156 anime seen but you will surely entertain yourself and give it a good score. As I mentioned earlier in the different sections of the anime, it does not disappoint in any, it is quite complete and has a lot of quality in between.The anime so far is not exceeded in any sense and / or aspect so you should not fear that it deviates from its main plot or there is much inappropriate content, in every sense. There is almost no presence of NSFW content intended to ""wake up"" the public, or gore or something similar in battles. So far only bruises or light bleeding are seen, which is consistent with the confrontations and blows received by the participants, we must remember that their resistance is superhuman and that means receiving blows strong enough to break walls as if nothing.Seeing this anime I assure you epic moments, fluid and detailed animation, perfect sound at all times and a story and characters that will progress and will result in a more complex story and characters with a lot of background.Thanks for using some minutes of your busy day and reading my review, I hope you liked it and cheer you up to watch the anime.If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to write me, I will respond after an hour or so.Have a nice day styles of all kinds, where the winner will have whatever wishes they have.

And surprisingly I enjoying the comedy here even though I didn’t really love it in the webtoon, it seems they made to push the punchiness of the jokes and made sure to give them hilarious facial expressions, they come and go quick which is always nice. They also make sure to keep a lot of the visual gags like Q getting owned in episode 2 which I superbly loved.Story:9 As for the story, similar to...tower of god this is the first arc of a really long, epic of a manhwa which story becomes far bigger so though it might seem a little slow you should definitely keep with it as long as the concepts and action interest you. Think of it maybe like the first season of Bleach which is more comedy focused and not too much action, though GOH makes sure that there is more than enough action to go around since it starts with a fighting tournament. As it goes on, the comedy elements will be toned down in quantity so if they aren’t your cup of tea don’t worry too much.Adaptation differences: 2 quick things I would like to note are that they haven’t changed much story aspects which is promising only changing one minor detail which honestly doesn’t make to much sense in the long run of the manhwa and a few story beats like how Mori gets the divine pellet or wrestler girl gets genuinely defeated. The one big difference is that they are making sure to hint at the super power aspect a lot more which is good since it becomes the central way of fighting later on.I also like that they make sure that all these characters are somewhat superhuman in their actions with the quickness of the fights since initially that quality was sort of hard to notice in the webtoons.Overall: 10 It’s a fantastic shounen action show that provides beautiful fight animation with a long, epic story with really lovable characters that I promise you won’t regret getting into especially if you’re looking for a good to scratch that action itch. Honestly this and TOG will probably become part of the next big three as long as their adaptation release schedules aren’t too spaced out.Other quicky ratingsArt:10 Gorgeous fight animation with good in-between choreography making the fights more dynamic also loving the expressions and like that they took out most of the chibi comedy focusing on the big jokes.Sound: 9 Love the impact sounds though think some of the explosions are a little over done also didn’t expect that opening theme.Character:10 Loving that they are making sure to push the main trios friendship, making sure to not skip any beats and think they are doing the side characters well.Enjoyment:10 I’m loving this baby tower of god this is the first arc of a really long, epic of a manhwa which story becomes far bigger so though it might seem a little slow you should definitely keep with it as long as the concepts and action interest you.

Definitely say I liked this one better than the previous. God of High School does have some problems no doubt but I enjoyed this anime so damn much. Didn't quite know what was coming with this show other than a big tournament and some cool looking fights. Well we got that in spades and then some! This show didn't let up off the throttle for even a half second! Kept going and going and going jumping the shark at every turn and I loved for doing that. Where we started and where we ended were completely different...places in such a short amount of time but that didn't bother me so much, least not as much as I'm sure it did others.The way I value and rare anime is absolutely themes then characters then story then visuals. That being said I think this show is one of the rare exceptions for me. Because the themes and story aren't quite there imo but holy hell are the visuals amazing to look at constantly and the characters are a lot of fun. There's tropes out the woodwork with this but it didn't seem to bother me. The story kinda shoots itself in the foot multiple times but skimming past things that should probably be explained. This is definitely one that would benefit from being 23 to 26 episodes opposed to just the 13 we got. But not gonna judge something by what it didn't give us since that's dumb. Better to just look at what were got and judge that.So I'll say the characters are awesome and easy to root for. Our main trio of Mori, Daewi, and Mira are all badass who I love to see on screen. They all get great moments to shine throughout the show. Even with Mori being centerpiece the other two still get highlights. The supporting cast with Ilpyo being my favorite of those and the other tournament competitors being pretty cool especially early on. Park Mujin was always a mysterious dude who seemed to be up to his own thing but I liked his style and how he helped the trio out more towards the end. His squad with the commissioners and SIX were cool. Nox as a main antagonist group were kinda meh since they didn't do a whole lot. Jegal however I really liked the more we saw him. An easy villain to despise and want to see the heroes beat. His powers were cool too.Of course I'd be dumb to not rave and gush over the incredible animation. Mappa basically outdid themselves and keep putting out quality work over and over again. Can always trust them to make a show look great with its fights and this amps me up even more to see Jujutsu Kaisen animated later this week! Overall I'd say this is a fun kinda just enjoy the fights type anime with some good characters and a middling plot that coulda just used some more time to flesh out. But I thoroughly enjoyed this show for what it gave us. 85 out of 100. places in such a short amount of time but that didn't bother me so much, least not as much as I'm sure it did others.The way I value and rare anime is absolutely themes then characters then story then visuals. That being said I think this show is one of the rare exceptions for me. Because the themes and story aren't quite there imo but holy hell are the visuals amazing to look at constantly and the characters are a lot of fun.

It\'s soulless and boring. There is almost no plot to understand. 4 episodes and you learn nothing substantial of the main characters, why this fighting tournament exists and the other characters\' motivations, especially the villain who behaves like a typical Korean drama evil business man but with super fighting powers.Seriously, I don\'t know how much harder I could come down on a show lmao. What a disappointment.The show tries...to rely on mystery to keep you interested, but does it so poorly it\'s like dangling a carrot on a stick, but you forgot the carrot. Things just move as fast as possible and that speaks to its pacing. The anime is cutting things from an already shallow manhwa.And what\'s worse is that, since this show has literally almost no plot 3 episodes in, you can just tell that the overall story is shallow and creatively bankrupt. And don\'t listen to people telling you to read the manhwa or webtoon. The source material is actually worse than the anime, and I just ripped the anime apart, so that should tell you something. The anime literally cut out chunks of plot just to jump from fight to fight in breakneck speeds, and you\'re just following along. You have no care for any of these fights because they\'re happening without any attachment from you as a viewer with the characters.For comparison, My Hero Academia isn\'t anything special, but even people who dislike it could admit it has a passable story that follows Hook -> Line -> Cliffhanger (optional) -> Sinker. God of High School has no Hook, a small Line, and then the weakest Sinkers (if you can even call them that) because there was nothing to hook you into the show in the first place! You might be hooked by the flashy fights and the EDM music for the first episode in a half but then its novelty wears off and you\'re left wondering what the hell is the actual story. Oh, the villain is suddenly interested in the MC? Damn, I wish I was too. Seriously, in 3 episodes you couldn\'t have spent more time growing Jin Mori with the viewers rather than showing off as many matches as possible?At least the fighting is flashy enough. At least it was until the show decided to crank up everyone\'s strength as fast as possible without warning and the way the story is paced, you can just tell there\'s no ceiling and characters will just get more and more powerful. On a visual level, they have characters summoning Shaman King JoJo stands, which may just be imagery for the viewers to show off the characters\' power levels, but if you\'re gonna do that you can\'t not give the main character something similar and then have everyone claiming the MC\'s power is not human. The other guy just summoned a giant monster behind him and you\'re impressed by the MC throwing 3 kicks? Where\'s the visual consistency? You just gave the MC a power boost 7 minutes ago.The only good thing in this show was Mah Miseon \'cause she got abs and big anime tiddies. to rely on mystery to keep you interested, but does it so poorly it\'s like dangling a carrot on a stick, but you forgot the carrot.

The opening episode really draws you into the show, and really gets you hooked on the three main characters and who they are. For a show to do something like that, you know it's gonna be good, and worth your while. But what else does GoH have in store for the first few episodes? Let's see...As I touched upon with the characters, the first episode does a great job of building them and showing just who they are, and how fun, and interesting each can be. You'll find yourself cheering for the...three mains because of it, and only wanting the best for them. For a show to have great and entertaining characters, you know it's going to be good.As for the story itself? Just think of your usual fighting game that you love, and how they run their tournaments. Each character having a motive and a story behind from, which stories can range depending on the character of course, and I cannot wait to learn more about them. Much like how they give off that interested factors towards those who are running this tournament in the first place. Well done there.It's art style can be very flashy at points, but also fitting for more darker moments. For it to be done like that, it really is something. Much like the sound through out the show, when it's flashy, it's upbeat and good fun, and fits the tone of the show when needed. Both quality in my book, and will keep you throughout the show.Overall so far GoH is a fun show, that can make you go through the emotions so far, and I cannot wait for more, and you should watch too! three mains because of it, and only wanting the best for them.

The concept of adapting these highly praise webtoon series was amazing as we viewers get to see South Korea based anime. It was frankly a breath of fresh air as the webtoon catalogue is filled with various genres that were produced by passionate authors that cared about their works even if the works vary in quality. Unfortunately, the overall execution has been bad, really, really bad.Tower Of God was released in the Spring 20 anime season in an awful and unfinished state filled with non-existent worldbuilding, laughable power system, empty characters, outstanding...awful production values and horrendous writing. It was a series that I deeply despise to the core it made me wonder if the source material was bad but, I have been told that Webtoon itself was good and the anime was an utter bastardization to the source material. Honestly, if Crunchyroll did not hamfist the living crap of the show right down my throat on social media then I wouldn't have hated it all that much. Sure I still would have heavily disliked, but I wouldn't have it in my top 30 worst anime I've ever completed list.One season later The God Of High School was released, and it sucked. It like Crunchyroll never learned their lesson with Tower Of God and decided to crank up to 11 and that is sad as I really wanted to like it as I love my shounen animes like this.Before I go over all the problems about The God Of High School I will be talking about the good as there's a quite a bit of good in it that prevents it from being in my worst anime list.What The God Of High School Does Right.The art and animation by Studio MAPPA are fantastic as always. Character designs and colourful and distinctive from each other.There were some rough scenes every now especially towards the end with the jarring use of CGI but the show still remains consistent with its art style and animation. This is one of Mappa finest works when it comes to art and animation.The fights scenes are excellent and really gives the fights series justice that they deserve.Special mention goes to the Jin and Hau fight in episode 5 that's filled with a lot of cool sakuga that resembles a comic book.The soundtrack is generally good all around and fits the tone of the series.The opening and ending themes are okay I guess, and they decently fit the tone of the series.Also, both the sub and dub are amazing.That's pretty much it really.What The God Of High School does wrong.Where do I even begin with The God Of High School maybe with the characters?The main 3 characters look very promising and appealing on the surface however the moment, they started talking, my positive expectations went down the drain.I grandly feel bad for both the Seiyuus and the English Dub for wasting their amazing talents voicing these shells of characters.Jin is basically Goku 2.0 who loves fighting. Other than his generic dad backstory, there's nothing special about him, and his character design reflects that.Yu is your typical tsundere glasses action girl that wants to find a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline.Han is the typical quiet hard-working third well of the trio who wants to save a friend life.On paper, the trio had the potential to be fascinating and charming characters but the horrible pacing and especially later on the writing don't give these characters justice, as a result, these main trios feel empty and half baked. I wanted to see these three go past their character traits so I could love them but they sadly don't. This is what happens when you have crappy pacing that moves at a rapid pace where you don't have time to develop your characters.As for the story itself well it has no story to speak off. It's just a bunch of one-dimensional character entering The God Of High School tournament because self insert cliché … backstoriesThere's nothing more beyond that. Now, this wouldn't have been a problem if the characters were fun or at the very least interesting but their not. As I stated before Jin, Hau and Yu bland characters but the side characters are the worst in fact calling them characters would be a massive insult as their actually like robots that are specially programmed to fight while ditching spit out they self insert backstories by inserting robot voice clip. They are that empty. Due to the characters being empty shells the show becomes a depressing slog filled with abysmal writing. Non-existent worldbuilding, a messy power system that goes out of control half way in, endless meaningless flashbacks that only exist to break the pacing of the fights that are happening, unfunny chibi comedy, annoying tonal that are on par with Your Lie in April, consent asspulls, cheap power-ups, lack of overall stakes, tired shounen tropes and cliches up the ass I could go on.Here's a perfect example of this empty writing is how the main three grow a bond with each other. Jin meets Yu by accident during a chase of the thief. Yu yells at Jin for breaking her glasses, A couple of minutes later in the case Hau stops bag thief, and they're all introduced themselves before the qualifiers started in the waiting room. After the qualifiers the main three argue with each other yet again then Jin accidentally throws Yu family sword in the river causing Yu to get pissed off at Jin telling him to back off. Then Jin comes to help find Yu looking for her sword in the river giving her light to make it easier to find it then moments later Hau joins in the search to find Yu's sword by bringing in a big light that brightens the rivers in a large scale.This is on paper is great having our main leads look for the sword as well reconciling with each other through inspiring dialogue that builds an eventually creating unbreakable bond and to its credit the show did that in the beginning but the moment when Hau shows up it that intriguing character-driven scene breaks. Instead of the show actually showcasing the trio finding the sword as spending some decent time to get know each other like most character-driven narratives it transitions into a tournament scene in the waiting acting they are best buds.This is where The God High School School true intentions start to rear its ugly head that simply does not care about substance.I really wanted to like these characters as they appeal to me more than anyone of Tower of God especially Yu and Jin but due to terrible directing the anime totally disregards their character writing in favour of fights and, as a result, the story becomes a tedious slog and the characters become empty shells.When the show decides to have a story at the very end after a series of soulless fights, you find out it's so contrived and convoluted you will wonder if a show was written by a 7-year old that has no understanding of writing and pacing.Speaking of the pacing my god it's a disaster. The show moves way too fast to a point where it became hard to comprehend what is even happening.Keep in mind the target audience for The God Of High School are teenagers who are into shounen's yet they can't do that correctly as this show is that empty that's devoid of passion, effort, and creativity.The final insult of The God Of High School is the hamfisted advertisements. For some reason, Crunchyroll thought it will be a smart idea to splatter their and webtoon logos all over the show especially in fighting arenas. I absolutely hated this every time I saw as it felt I was watching an ad and a lazy one on that. This is immersion breaking at it's finest and it already made the already terrible series even worst.The word empty perfectly to describe The God Of High School. It is a show that has nothing going for it other than showcasing fights that barely has any meaning or substance behind it.Sure the anime had decent moments but they ultimately don't save the anime from being terrible. Even though I ended up kinda hating The God Of High School I actually prefer it over Tower Of God. Least the anime despite having a lot of empty moments thanks to horrible pacing least wasn't completed bored or insulted by it.Crunchyroll please just end this failed experiment. If you're not going to properly adapt your source material then why even bother doing it. You're just making the source material and yourselves look bad.Have some pride of and admit defeat awful production values and horrendous writing.

I also have not read the original work.• A telltale sign of a story with tired tropes and lackluster imagination is when after one or two episodes, you can more or less see where a show is heading in general, which is why I thought writing a ""how-to write this"" after watching the very beginning would get my point across well.• The idea is that if the review and predictions hold up after watching episode 4, I\'ll post this (well obviously if you\'re reading), but if most of what I ramble about misses the mark, I\'ll scrap it instead, and might actually enjoy myself.• If I post this, I\'ll leave some edits in sections that I felt I didn\'t do justice if they come up.• In terms of why I haven\'t outright dropped it yet, I plan to continue to see if it improves (and to see if it plays out how I think it will), but as its start has proven to be quite underwhelming and packed with tiresome clichés, I probably won\'t get much farther.• Given that I’ve only watched 2 episodes, this review is technically spoiler free (outside of the very beginning), but be aware that I do make educated guesses on how the story will end up playing out (very generally) based on the formulaic beginning, so read at your own risk of me potentially guessing correctly. My assumptions could be completely off, but I am fairly confident that my thousands of hours spent watching anime and entertainment in general won’t let me down (hurray for escapism).• To preface; the animation, voice acting, etc. are perfectly fine, if not above average, but as a viewer, I tend to evaluate characters and narrative on a completely different playing field, where the former can only add real merit to a show if the latter follows through first.Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get started with the wikiHow guide!How to write the introductory episodes of The God of High School, or a similarly clichéd series:(1) At the very beginning of the first episode, briefly show the (seemingly obvious) main antagonist-type character of the series, in order to highlight him as being super powerful and awe-inspiring to build up ""anticipation."" <-(sarcasm)• Again, at the start of episode 2, portray him intimidating authority figures with the superiority-complex attitude of an egotistical teenager, to show how much influence/power he has, and more importantly, how cool he is.• 99% sure this character will fit the “all according to plan” mastermind trope, but only time will tell.(2) Introduce the protagonist as an always-bright, simple-minded type whose driving motivation is just wanting to fight and get stronger!• Start off with a flashback from his childhood, where his endearing father-figure/master (who is obviously a badass because of the scars on his hand) is doting on him, and telling him to ""make sure to go to school and make friends, because that\'s what\'s truly important."" The kid of course cries and yells that he promises. And you can\'t have a scene where a character cries unless it\'s raining (perfect example: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, when Mustang is shown crying, it is very obviously RAINING).• This father-figure is probably some amazing fighter or was some kind of legend, which makes the main character all that more special, having been trained or raised by him.• Also, just want to emphasize that nobody would ever expect an exposition dump at the beginning of a show to be just the character\'s dream!

Check!(3) Introduce the second main character as a quirky type who can typically be found brutally assaulting the main character for comedic relief.• Slap that character with the “must keep the family tradition/business alive” cliché motivation and call it a day.• Give her an out-of-character scene where she snaps after briefly losing an item extremely important to her (make sure to slip in the family tradition motivation explanation here, as the sentimental value of the item is directly attached to her motivation). She gets serious about losing something tied to her motivation? Profound.(4) Introduce the third main character as a down-to-earth type, and have him explain his driving motivation to be “for the money;” only being a half-truth, the scene is accompanied by “foreshadowing” visuals that imply something deeper behind that motivation. In general, this character acts much more like an actual human being than the bright eccentric and the quirky domestic abuser.• My guess is that this character needs the money to pay the medical bills for a friend/family member who has some kind of illness that can only be cured for an insane amount of money, but that’s just a theory.• As a note, I don’t believe this character is all that poorly crafted. Sure maybe a bit uninspired, but not necessarily bad. However, the fact that the show makes it blatantly obvious that the money motivation is tied to some kind of medical situation by showing flashbacks of a hospital hallway immediately destroys any intrigue that potential foreshadowing could have produced.- Edit: At the end of the 4th episode, they throw in a bit of an unexpected chain of events dealing with this character, which I actually really liked, and improved my outlook/view of the show from like a 2 to a 3 so far. It\'s good, but it\'s the kind of good that stands out as the one thing that\'s impressed me, whereas honestly since writing this, everything else has turned out even worse than I expected. While the ""guy finally snaps after loved one gets talked shit about enough"" scenario is super common, I still consider this rendition to be interesting.(5) Make all of the God of High School contestants extremely specific with their excessive quirks and fighting styles, to the point where it starts being comedic for all the wrong reasons.• Perhaps include a hyper-intelligent kid (with glasses of course, how could someone smart not have glasses in anime?) who casually reads while beating people up in order to show the viewer just how composed and skilled he is.• Throw in a barely clothed, hair-dyed, bubblegum-popping female fighter, because why not.• The announcer character has to have a notably bizarre-looking character design, especially when it comes to the facial features. He has to be painfully over-the-top, and provide you with way too much exposition!(6) Introduce an initial villainous character (who will eventually become inconsequential) as dark, edgy, and maniacal.

However, after an “unexpected” turn of events, the villainous character “surprisingly” overpowers him, proceeding to flaunt his fearsomeness by psychotically torturing the cannon fodder.• Have the protagonist jump in when he sees this injustice and take on the villainous character, showing just how powerful and serious the supposedly carefree character can be when confronted with such a situation.• Have this interference be “against the rules,” yet the protagonist does it without regrets anyways because of his strong sense of justice. The protagonist immediately proves how much more powerful than the cannon fodder he is, by contending with the villain on a level playing field. However, right as the protagonist seems to have won, the villain snaps and starts to bring out that mysterious dark power, and right as he is about to take the protagonist out with it, a much more powerful third party (likely with a high position in the “system”), prevents the fight from continuing, as the story can’t exactly continue with the protagonist dropping dead in the first 2 episodes.(8) Whenever fighting, you absolutely must have one of the characters watching from the sidelines simultaneously explaining to the viewer exactly what is happening in the fight, what moves are being made by who, and for what purpose. Remember, this is the most exciting part of a fight scene.I can only hope that I’m totally off the mark here, because believe it or not, I actually like when I enjoy the entertainment I consume. However, it doesn’t seem likely in this case unfortunately.I believe the beginning of a show is one of the most important parts, and am not the type to deem a show worth “bearing through” the first sub-par episodes to get to “the good part,” but I\'ll probably watch at least a couple more episodes in the name of giving it a chance. ""instructions,"" on how you can quickly write up a similarly unimaginative story.Disclaimer:• Although I\'ll have watched 4 episodes at the time of posting this, I\'m writing the entirety of the rest of the review after only having watched the first 2 episodes. I also have not read the original work.• A telltale sign of a story with tired tropes and lackluster imagination is when after one or two episodes, you can more or less see where a show is heading in general, which is why I thought writing a ""how-to write this"" after watching the very beginning would get my point across well.• The idea is that if the review and predictions hold up after watching episode 4, I\'ll post this (well obviously if you\'re reading), but if most of what I ramble about misses the mark, I\'ll scrap it instead, and might actually enjoy myself.• If I post this, I\'ll leave some edits in sections that I felt I didn\'t do justice if they come up.• In terms of why I haven\'t outright dropped it yet, I plan to continue to see if it improves (and to see if it plays out how I think it will), but as its start has proven to be quite underwhelming and packed with tiresome clichés, I probably won\'t get much farther.• Given that I’ve only watched 2 episodes, this review is technically spoiler free (outside of the very beginning), but be aware that I do make educated guesses on how the story will end up playing out (very generally) based on the formulaic beginning, so read at your own risk of me potentially guessing correctly. My assumptions could be completely off, but I am fairly confident that my thousands of hours spent watching anime and entertainment in general won’t let me down (hurray for escapism).• To preface; the animation, voice acting, etc. are perfectly fine, if not above average, but as a viewer, I tend to evaluate characters and narrative on a completely different playing field, where the former can only add real merit to a show if the latter follows through first.Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get started with the wikiHow guide!How to write the introductory episodes of The God of High School, or a similarly clichéd series:(1) At the very beginning of the first episode, briefly show the (seemingly obvious) main antagonist-type character of the series, in order to highlight him as being super powerful and awe-inspiring to build up ""anticipation."" <-(sarcasm)• Again, at the start of episode 2, portray him intimidating authority figures with the superiority-complex attitude of an egotistical teenager, to show how much influence/power he has, and more importantly, how cool he is.• 99% sure this character will fit the “all according to plan” mastermind trope, but only time will tell.(2) Introduce the protagonist as an always-bright, simple-minded type whose driving motivation is just wanting to fight and get stronger!• Start off with a flashback from his childhood, where his endearing father-figure/master (who is obviously a badass because of the scars on his hand) is doting on him, and telling him to ""make sure to go to school and make friends, because that\'s what\'s truly important."" The kid of course cries and yells that he promises. And you can\'t have a scene where a character cries unless it\'s raining (perfect example: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, when Mustang is shown crying, it is very obviously RAINING).• This father-figure is probably some amazing fighter or was some kind of legend, which makes the main character all that more special, having been trained or raised by him.• Also, just want to emphasize that nobody would ever expect an exposition dump at the beginning of a show to be just the character\'s dream! And they broke their alarm clock, so they\'re late to an important narrative event?! Genius! Take notes writers!• Exposition with news reports airing on the side of a building, random students on a train, and strangers at a knock-off starbucks? Couldn\'t think of a better way of portraying a setting to the viewer (on top of the dream!).• I also can\'t give the studio enough credit for making him yell constantly, music to my ears.• He is always pulling hilarious dim-witted stunts like driving his bike off a cliff because he is late for school, where we see him being lovingly scolded by a neighboring old lady, who he playfully waves to, showing us how he is known for being the lovable ditz everyone just adores (have never seen a shounen-esque protagonist with these traits, mind-blowing stuff).• To contrast his usual lighthearted attitude, have him get dead serious when he sees some kind of injustice, or someone hurts his friend.• Inexplicably strong, yet thin, agile, and young main characters, who are 20x stronger than people who have been bodybuilding for decades?

They just put in a tournament out of nowhere and managed to ""adapt"" 29 chapters in 4 EPISODES ! ! ! !...They didnt bother with really non important stuff like character introductions,how they even ended up here, details about this tournament, NOTHING. Not only did they cut so many important stuff that happened in those 29 chapters but they even changed the story for no reason.Grandpa was only mentioned in the anime which literaly made people think that he was dead, but in the Webtoon, he makes couple of important appearances(even talks with the MC on the phone)....i can go on and on.All in all, as i said in my opening, GOH is not that kind of an anime...IT\'S FAR WORSE!!i advise all of you who are watching this and u are interested in the story to go read the Webtoon, because you really lose on a ton of information, events that transpire,literaly you need first 3 chapters to realise what kind of baffoonery they did in the anime and see that it\'s ONLY role was to advertise the Webtoon.

With this, last season’s Tower of God and next season’s Noblesse, things might be looking up for webtoon adaptations right? Weeellll...not exactly. Tower of God is good show that’s HEAVILY relying on a sequel season to make it all worth it (which if I’m aware, hasn’t been announced at the time of this review), Noblesse is a wait and see at the moment and this show has been a truly mixed bag. There are some stuff that this show get right and there are some stuff that this show gets...wrong, badly at times. But this show has become the epitome of a phrase that I go by when grading a show. “High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before your story and characters have to hold up their own weight.”Sit back, relax, grasp your own power within you and summon your Perso...i mean Charyeok as I present to you the anime review for the The God of High School. Let’s begin.Story: 2.5/10The God of High School tournament has begun and high school students all over Korea flock to prove their worth as the strongest fighter. This includes our three main proagonists Jin Mo-Ri, Han, Dae-Wi and Yu Mi-Ra, each with their own fighting styles and techniques. However, with the commissioner, Park Mu-Jin, looking for something and a shady group working in the shadows, they will soon learn that there is something more than meets the eye to this tournament.So there you go, a simple tournament with something more going on in the bigger picture. Simple and solid stuff right? Yes, but the execution of this is certainly one to behold because the pacing of this series is utter dogs**t as it is all over the place. It started out nicely in the beginning to set the premise, setting and establishing the bonds between our main leads, but then it blitzes through to get to the big picture. And that is what honestly killed the story for me. This show wanted to get to the big picture as quickly as possible instead of developing what we already got in front of us. It’s almost as if it was obsessed to tell you that there is more to this story than meets the eye, but doing that sacrifices context and some much needed context at that. When the show does explain some things though, it’s kind of blink and you will miss it because good luck trying to understand if you did miss it.But ultimately, it trying to get to the big picture leaves to a lot of, “what the f**k is going on?” moments. We get introduced to this villainous group that believe in god, abilities that can only be described as Personas or Stands for you Jojo nutters and a “key” that holds great significance. This stuff happens with little to no build-up or context to it so it just happens and you are probably left confused. It changes your attitude towards the fights and honestly makes them less enjoyable at the end because you are trying to wrap your head around as to what is going on instead of just enjoying the spectacle.Characters: 4/10There isn’t anything inherently hateful with the main trio as they do a fair job of being characters I can rally behind and they do get some character development. Dae-Wi and Mi-Ra definitely do get some time dedicated to them to get invested into them. But it feels like they get tossed aside by the end and their importance to the plot is dwindled as the show goes on. More focus is placed on Mo-Ri as time goes on as he is the true main protagonist but in my opinion, he isn’t as interesting as Dae-Wi or Mi-Ra in terms of motivation or backstory. He is under the class of Gerenivutus Shounenanatus (aka. Generic shounen protagonist). He likes fighting and getting stronger just so he can fight stronger opponents and get even stronger himself. A tried and true formula sure, but one that has become tiresome and it is no different here. His motivations aren’t really compelling compared to the cast around him and his growth isn’t really as noticeable where it feels like his strength just gets stronger just because at times.That actually kind of relates to the majority of characters at times because they get stronger just because most of the time. This is another side effect of the lack of context and consistent pacing in this show. The lack of natural growth when it comes to getting stronger is obvious when characters do acts that they have shown no signs of before. I think the lack of training montages kind of hurts this show.Going back to the cast of characters, there is one that I think would have made for a more interesting main protagonist. Park Il-pyo is much more compelling than Mo-Ri as he has a much more legitimate and interesting motivation while also having similar generic shounen elements. Probably because he gets the most attention out of the cast of characters in terms of backstory. Sure, it is rather cliched but at least is has depth unlike the majority of the more important characters in this show. The rest of the cast is rather meh. They fall under their roles to do their part of the story but I will say that the main antagonists, Nox, are pretty weak as villains go. Not including Taek Jegal who is decent as an ultimate main rival. But Nox is as uninteresting as shadowy groups get. Their main leader is a literal who and their motivation to summon god into the world to destroy it is as generic as bad guy goals get.In fact, the majority of the cast falls under the cliched shounen troupe and while some do expand on it like Il-pyo, Dae-Wi and Mi-Ra, the rest kind of just fall in line, honestly making the cast shallow in the process.Animation: 9.5/10Is this the best work MAAPA has ever done to date? Probably. There’s no denying that the animation for The God of High School is fantastic. Fights are fluid and pack quite the punch with it oozing with sakuga everywhere to make the fights themselves fun to watch. But it’s not just how it animates, how the show frames the fights with dynamic angles and shots to give it a different feel each time. Watching from a distance as a guy with a straight jacket runs in fast to kick guys in the head, or it zooming out of Dae-Wi as he turns around and blows people away with his fist. It makes the fights themselves that fun to watch and are easily the highlight of the show for me.Art style and character design wise, it’s solid, although I don’t know why everyone have such a red nose. It’s like they all have the sniffles or something, I don’t know. It’s something that particularly bothered me, it’s just something that just looks kind of weird. Each  character have their own unique look that translate well into the fights so it doesn’t become a hindrance and they are rather distinct from one another and the art style translates well into the action. So overall amazing job by MAPPA.Sound: 8/10Honestly, the ost really matches the pacing and emotion of the fights to make them that extra enjoyable from a pure spectacle standpoint. It does what it needs to when you got action like this and enchance a scene that you are most likely engrossed in to keep up with the tone of the scene. The sound effects as well have a nice punch to it to make you feel the force with each hit, knowing that it’s going to hurt.The opening, ""Contradiction feat. Tyler Carter"" by KSUKE, is interesting. I like how it builds up the opening and then flurry it out with action and how the opening is styled, with it starting like it’s an intro to the tournament and the neon filter when it shows off the action. The song is give or take. I’m not the biggest fan of techno music but I do like how it builds up with the visuals on screen. BUT, the opening does lose points for the action being just scenes taken directly from the episodes instead of showing off it’s own action to make the opening more independent from the rest of the show. The ending I like as well. ""WIN"" by CIX, is a nice way to show off the growing bond between Mo-Ri, Dae-Wi and Mi-Ra and is a nice way to calm down after the relentless action. Just a nice solid ending.Conclusion:“High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before your story and characters have to hold up their own weight.” It’s a line I came up with when I did my review of Sirus the Jaeger back in 2018 and it’s always stuck with me when it comes to shows like this. No matter how good your animation and sound is, if your story and characters don’t do as well, then your show will just be a hollow shell of a technical masterpiece. The God of High School is a show had a lot of promise. If it was able to make sure that the story and characters match the quality of it’s animation and sound it would easily been one of the best anime of the year. But it didn’t. If anything, it bought into its own hype and tried to prove that this show was more than it meets the eye but without establishing why. What’s left is a show that feels very shallow and honestly a waste of MAPPA’s best work to date. Poor pacing and context to the story, underdeveloped and shunted characters, a rather boring protagonist and very weak villains leaves a show that feels half full. While the fights on their own are very good, without a good narrative to back it up, it leaves the fights feeling very hollow.I do believe this is a case of 12 episode syndrome where they tried to cram it into 12 episodes to save time and budget and move on to the next. But this show badly needed at least a 24 episode run time to help establish key plot elements and character growth. But it didn’t (probably due to budget) and there’s no changing it now. What we are left with is what we got and what we got is honestly, a show that I am disappointed with.My Personal enjoyment: 4.5/10Overall score: 5.7/10   Recommendation: Consider it (VERY, VERY BARELY, Consider watching it for the action for the first 3-4 episodes and see where you go from there.) wrong, badly at times. But this show has become the epitome of a phrase that I go by when grading a show. “High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before your story and characters have to hold up their own weight.”Sit back, relax, grasp your own power within you and summon your Perso...i mean Charyeok as I present to you the anime review for the The God of High School.

Fights are fluid and pack quite the punch with it oozing with sakuga everywhere to make the fights themselves fun to watch. But it’s not just how it animates, how the show frames the fights with dynamic angles and shots to give it a different feel each time. Watching from a distance as a guy with a straight jacket runs in fast to kick guys in the head, or it zooming out of Dae-Wi as he turns around and blows people away with his fist. It makes the fights themselves that fun to watch and are easily the highlight of the show for me.Art style and character design wise, it’s solid, although I don’t know why everyone have such a red nose. It’s like they all have the sniffles or something, I don’t know. It’s something that particularly bothered me, it’s just something that just looks kind of weird. Each  character have their own unique look that translate well into the fights so it doesn’t become a hindrance and they are rather distinct from one another and the art style translates well into the action. So overall amazing job by MAPPA.Sound: 8/10Honestly, the ost really matches the pacing and emotion of the fights to make them that extra enjoyable from a pure spectacle standpoint. It does what it needs to when you got action like this and enchance a scene that you are most likely engrossed in to keep up with the tone of the scene. The sound effects as well have a nice punch to it to make you feel the force with each hit, knowing that it’s going to hurt.The opening, ""Contradiction feat. Tyler Carter"" by KSUKE, is interesting. I like how it builds up the opening and then flurry it out with action and how the opening is styled, with it starting like it’s an intro to the tournament and the neon filter when it shows off the action. The song is give or take. I’m not the biggest fan of techno music but I do like how it builds up with the visuals on screen. BUT, the opening does lose points for the action being just scenes taken directly from the episodes instead of showing off it’s own action to make the opening more independent from the rest of the show. The ending I like as well. ""WIN"" by CIX, is a nice way to show off the growing bond between Mo-Ri, Dae-Wi and Mi-Ra and is a nice way to calm down after the relentless action. Just a nice solid ending.Conclusion:“High quality animation and sound can only carry you so far before your story and characters have to hold up their own weight.” It’s a line I came up with when I did my review of Sirus the Jaeger back in 2018 and it’s always stuck with me when it comes to shows like this. No matter how good your animation and sound is, if your story and characters don’t do as well, then your show will just be a hollow shell of a technical masterpiece. The God of High School is a show had a lot of promise. If it was able to make sure that the story and characters match the quality of it’s animation and sound it would easily been one of the best anime of the year. But it didn’t. If anything, it bought into its own hype and tried to prove that this show was more than it meets the eye but without establishing why. What’s left is a show that feels very shallow and honestly a waste of MAPPA’s best work to date. Poor pacing and context to the story, underdeveloped and shunted characters, a rather boring protagonist and very weak villains leaves a show that feels half full. While the fights on their own are very good, without a good narrative to back it up, it leaves the fights feeling very hollow.I do believe this is a case of 12 episode syndrome where they tried to cram it into 12 episodes to save time and budget and move on to the next. But this show badly needed at least a 24 episode run time to help establish key plot elements and character growth. But it didn’t (probably due to budget) and there’s no changing it now. What we are left with is what we got and what we got is honestly, a show that I am disappointed with.My Personal enjoyment: 4.5/10Overall score: 5.7/10   Recommendation: Consider it (VERY, VERY BARELY, Consider watching it for the action for the first 3-4 episodes and see where you go from there.)', ""To those who think this anime is good...I'LL BE YOUR CONTRADICTION!Take notes everyone! God of Highschool is a perfect example of how to NOT execute a tournament arc. It introduces this vague organization full of weird looking suits who probably do bad things. Very evil. The tournament itself is as basic as it gets with no originality behind the set up and some of the most bland participants you've ever seen. Very uninspired. The show feels rushed and the story tries to have unique bits complete with a bunch of hocus pocus shenanigans and lore, but it all fails due to horrible explanation and poor...pacing. It's like the author just wanted to make some cool fights but forgot that he needed to make an actual narrative around it. Very smol brain.The three protagonists are some of the worst I've seen in awhile. One just yells constantly and likes to fight...that's it. The other two are entirely reliant on their backstories for half of the show. The girl's emotions are completely dependent on her Moon sword thingy. The dude's mental state is completely dependent on his sick buddy. When things are going well with their sole purposes in life they're happy. When things are going poorly they're sad. This isn't how you write characters. Also, these three randomly become the best of friends out of nowhere and have some of the worst chemistry I've ever seen. Very unbelievable.Just to have some positives, the animation is pretty darn good during fights that are actually shown in full. The episode 5 fight especially was the highlight of the anime for me and would have been great if the build up wasn't so awful. Unfortunately, I don't like the art. Everyone looks like they have a cold with their pink noses and ears and some people are just drawn strangely. Also, the Crunchyroll advertisement on the stage burned my eyes, so there's that. Very shallow. The music is full of rave tracks, which I actually liked. The voice acting was full of ear splitting screams, which I didn't like. Very painful.If you read my other reviews, you'll notice that I like to ramble on a lot since there's always a good amount to say. Not with this show, unless you just want to hear me reiterate why the anime is so bland and poorly conceived. When thinking about this show, My mind is as empty as this anime's plot and characters. If you can enjoy this anime, then great! But for me, there's just two words that come to mind when thinking about God of Highschool.Very bad pacing.

However when professor Utonium accidentally added the extra ingredient in the concoction known as Chemical P for plagiarism, this anime quickly tanked in quality.I can not begin to fathom how horrendous this anime truly is. Many reviewers are quick to jump on the fact that the story is rushed and is appealing to the Manwa readers however as an anime only, I do not want to go through a 100 chapter manwa to ""get"" the obtuse story. With every episode I gradually realized that not only is the...pacing rushed in a insulting way to the manwa, but the wow factors of each episode heavily rely on things I\'ve already seen in other Shonin anime.

It pushes all of the standard battle shounen buttons but is exceptional at nothing, and honestly kind of a drag to watch. Allow me to explain...***As a warning, there will be minor spoilers in this review***Story: 3There really is not much of a story to comment on. Characters are placed into an arena for some nonsensical reason, where they then fight to the death. The big twist? Even when you die, you don\'t actually die because of *magical hand wave*... nanobots in your blood stream. And,...per the title, somehow we are supposed to believe that these are modern day high school students.For a shounen, this is perhaps excusable, however when you compare it to other AAA battle shounen titles of recent years (anything from HunterxHunter to One Punch Man), there really is just nothing going on storywise to even be remotely interested about. This title is 1000% focused on the fighting, to the detriment of literally everything else.  Yet oddly enough, in any given episode, only a tiny portion is actually spent showing any fighting.  Most secondary fights boil down to a sound effect/fade to black or a single attack finisher.As for the humor, it is somewhat slapstick and while it may elicit a giggle here or there, it really is nothing to write home about.Art: 6The art/animation is fairly high quality, and while I generally like the character designs, they again seem somewhat nonsensical when the general theme of the anime is considered. What are supposed to be ""normal high school students"" turn into prototypical, uber over the top master warriors all while wearing tropey outfits that tell the viewer exactly how they are going to behave.This anime also suffers from the ""all important characters look well done and unique, everyone else is bland and expendable"" problem. Simply put, it is lazy.Sound: 7The sound effects are solid, nothing really to complain about here. I think the OP and ED are average, but that is a matter of personal taste.Character: 3To me this is one of the weaker parts of the show. The first few episodes had me openly cringing at how corny the interactions between the main characters were (ep. 2 bridge scene, I\'m looking at you).There is little development here to speak of. Simply, main characters are uber unstoppable death dealing monsters while looking like average high school twerps. Every fight can be summed up with: 1) Main characters get roughed up a bit, 2) Enemy fighter acts over confident and condescending, looks down on weakness of main characters, 3) Main character absolutely kicks their ass in one or two moves, while generally in a weakened state to boot.There is some nebulous background development, but really everything takes back seat to the fighting.  Why does MC fight in an ultimate to-the-death style tournament? To get stronger, of course! Characters are shallow and forgettable, with one-dimensional motivations that make their behavior (and the plot) predictable.Enjoyment: 4I am going to use this section to explain what I think is the weakest part of this entire show, i.e. the lore and worldbuilding. To me, the world of God of High School is fundamentally uninteresting and boring. You may ask yourself, for a battle shounen, why would this even matter? Shouldn\'t is only be about the fighting?! But hear me out...There are two major problems here: 1) The world contains a ""soft"" power/ability system (I will get more into this in a moment) and 2) The world feels like a disjointed mishmash of random ideas that appeared in the author\'s head, with no real sense of history or direction.Let\'s start with the second point. The opening scenes show that the story takes place in modern day Seoul. Fair enough. However, we quickly are let on to the fact that the heroes fight with almost super human abilities that allow them to defy common sense. In the first episode, a major antagonist is shown walking into the situation room of the Pentagon and talking down to the US President, as the secret service look on in awe and shock. Then, we are told this man is the organizer of a fighting tournament between... high school students. As another example, we are told that these ""high school students"" must fight to the death, however they cannot actually die because they have been implanted with magical nanobots that can cure literally anything, while conveniently giving the living characters ""hitpoints"" that the show can use to describe how ""damaged"" they are. It just feels like it was written for the lowest common denominator.As for the first point, the world is built around a ""soft"" power system. What this means is that, there are no predefined rules or systems that characters abilities are constrained by. While this is not inherently bad (Lord of the Rings magic is a famous example of a ""soft"" system), in an anime with dozens of characters and episodes, it can lead to some wildly absurd results. Consider shows such as Full Metal Alchemist or Avatar the Last Airbender. These shows use defined systems that all abilities must work within (Alchemy and Bending, respectively). In FMA, we know that every character\'s abilities must follow the rules of alchemy, and these rules help to prevent there from being Deus Ex Machina moments where characters perform outrageous stunts in order to keep the plot moving. Characters can be powerful, but their abilities are believable within the context of the world.  Additionally, it prevents ""power creep"" and allows the viewer to gauge the relative strength of any given fighter.  Certain abilities are inherently more powerful than others, and so characters must use creativity, tactics, intelligence, and perception to defeat these more powerful enemies (as opposed to ""training"" to increase your powerlevel to OVER 9000, etc etc).God of High School has none of this. Because there is no system to define how characters can behave, characters abilities and moves can be literally anything. We have a guy who reads a book while fighting and beats people with a baseball bat. Katana girl that suddenly becomes stronger when she loses her sword, and has ""swordless"" sword moves (wtf?!? Why fight with it in the first place?). An MC that is the clueless, perfect moral compass, god tier ability average high school student whose single kick can break any character. Similar to My Hero Academia, the show is set up in such a way that the author can literally create any character that he wants with any level of power, since there is nothing that defines what a character cannot be/cannot do (with that said, MHA is still a great show and is very strong in other departments, unlike GoHS). This leads to a bland set of fights that ultimately lack tension, with nonsensical abilities that are only there for the eye candy and feel entirely disjointed from the world.Overall: 4If you are bored and have literally nothing better to do, this may be worth checking out. But for me, the nice animation does not make up for the ultimately boring fights that have no sense of tension or risk, and are generally very short. Seeing random harem girl vs dream chaser sword girl do a couple lame swings at each other while shouting out their moves is not really my idea of interesting. And because I am not invested in the world or characters, it doesn\'t really matter who wins or loses, which is by far the worst part. per the title, somehow we are supposed to believe that these are modern day high school students.For a shounen, this is perhaps excusable, however when you compare it to other AAA battle shounen titles of recent years (anything from HunterxHunter to One Punch Man), there really is just nothing going on storywise to even be remotely interested about. This title is 1000% focused on the fighting, to the detriment of literally everything else.  Yet oddly enough, in any given episode, only a tiny portion is actually spent showing any fighting.  Most secondary fights boil down to a sound effect/fade to black or a single attack finisher.As for the humor, it is somewhat slapstick and while it may elicit a giggle here or there, it really is nothing to write home about.Art: 6The art/animation is fairly high quality, and while I generally like the character designs, they again seem somewhat nonsensical when the general theme of the anime is considered. What are supposed to be ""normal high school students"" turn into prototypical, uber over the top master warriors all while wearing tropey outfits that tell the viewer exactly how they are going to behave.This anime also suffers from the ""all important characters look well done and unique, everyone else is bland and expendable"" problem. Simply put, it is lazy.Sound: 7The sound effects are solid, nothing really to complain about here. I think the OP and ED are average, but that is a matter of personal taste.Character: 3To me this is one of the weaker parts of the show. The first few episodes had me openly cringing at how corny the interactions between the main characters were (ep. 2 bridge scene, I\'m looking at you).There is little development here to speak of. Simply, main characters are uber unstoppable death dealing monsters while looking like average high school twerps. Every fight can be summed up with: 1) Main characters get roughed up a bit, 2) Enemy fighter acts over confident and condescending, looks down on weakness of main characters, 3) Main character absolutely kicks their ass in one or two moves, while generally in a weakened state to boot.There is some nebulous background development, but really everything takes back seat to the fighting.  Why does MC fight in an ultimate to-the-death style tournament? To get stronger, of course! Characters are shallow and forgettable, with one-dimensional motivations that make their behavior (and the plot) predictable.Enjoyment: 4I am going to use this section to explain what I think is the weakest part of this entire show, i.e. the lore and worldbuilding. To me, the world of God of High School is fundamentally uninteresting and boring. You may ask yourself, for a battle shounen, why would this even matter? Shouldn\'t is only be about the fighting?! But hear me out...There are two major problems here: 1) The world contains a ""soft"" power/ability system (I will get more into this in a moment) and 2) The world feels like a disjointed mishmash of random ideas that appeared in the author\'s head, with no real sense of history or direction.Let\'s start with the second point. The opening scenes show that the story takes place in modern day Seoul. Fair enough. However, we quickly are let on to the fact that the heroes fight with almost super human abilities that allow them to defy common sense. In the first episode, a major antagonist is shown walking into the situation room of the Pentagon and talking down to the US President, as the secret service look on in awe and shock. Then, we are told this man is the organizer of a fighting tournament between... high school students. As another example, we are told that these ""high school students"" must fight to the death, however they cannot actually die because they have been implanted with magical nanobots that can cure literally anything, while conveniently giving the living characters ""hitpoints"" that the show can use to describe how ""damaged"" they are. It just feels like it was written for the lowest common denominator.As for the first point, the world is built around a ""soft"" power system. What this means is that, there are no predefined rules or systems that characters abilities are constrained by. While this is not inherently bad (Lord of the Rings magic is a famous example of a ""soft"" system), in an anime with dozens of characters and episodes, it can lead to some wildly absurd results. Consider shows such as Full Metal Alchemist or Avatar the Last Airbender. These shows use defined systems that all abilities must work within (Alchemy and Bending, respectively). In FMA, we know that every character\'s abilities must follow the rules of alchemy, and these rules help to prevent there from being Deus Ex Machina moments where characters perform outrageous stunts in order to keep the plot moving. Characters can be powerful, but their abilities are believable within the context of the world.  Additionally, it prevents ""power creep"" and allows the viewer to gauge the relative strength of any given fighter.  Certain abilities are inherently more powerful than others, and so characters must use creativity, tactics, intelligence, and perception to defeat these more powerful enemies (as opposed to ""training"" to increase your powerlevel to OVER 9000, etc etc).God of High School has none of this. Because there is no system to define how characters can behave, characters abilities and moves can be literally anything. We have a guy who reads a book while fighting and beats people with a baseball bat. Katana girl that suddenly becomes stronger when she loses her sword, and has ""swordless"" sword moves (wtf?!? Why fight with it in the first place?). An MC that is the clueless, perfect moral compass, god tier ability average high school student whose single kick can break any character. Similar to My Hero Academia, the show is set up in such a way that the author can literally create any character that he wants with any level of power, since there is nothing that defines what a character cannot be/cannot do (with that said, MHA is still a great show and is very strong in other departments, unlike GoHS). This leads to a bland set of fights that ultimately lack tension, with nonsensical abilities that are only there for the eye candy and feel entirely disjointed from the world.Overall: 4If you are bored and have literally nothing better to do, this may be worth checking out.

WHAT IS BAD IN THIS ANIME ?. NOTHING.', '“What...Just Happened?” - Jin, Mo-Ri (Episode 12, The God of Highschool.)I vividly remember months before the premiere of Tower of God, and what would eventually be the premiere of The God of Highschool, people in the anime community--especially some of the prominent anitubers--were hyping this two anime nonstop. They touted these two as the anime that would change the landscape of the anime industry and would bring in a “new era” of content. Those were some big claims, even outrageous. For me, the one show that I immediately think back to whenever there’re claims like these is Attack on Titan. Mainly...because Attack on Titan delivered what people claimed it would do back then. It succeeded to usher in not only new anime fans but also changed the landscape of Anime.These two, however, failed miserably.Not only did these two fail to deliver big impacts, but it also failed narratively. But out of these two, the painfully clear one was The God of Highschool. This show hangs on the backbone of animation and fights. Not storytelling, plot, characters, or world-building. And as you can guess, this show was inevitably going to crash and burn before it even got off the runway.Before we get into the “story” of this show, if there’s any, I want to touch upon the pacing and the structure of this show. My gosh, for the first time in a while that I have felt a show’s pacing is this bad. I mean it’s abysmal how they handled the pacing. 90% of this show is constructed in a sequence of fights. The majority of the episodes consist of back-to-back fast-paced nonstop martial art fights, and that’s it. That’s all it offers. It’s a show that gets you hooked then kicks you out the door in an instant. Not giving you much room to breathe and take it all in. And this repeats over and over until you’re just tired of this shit. Funny enough, the fights worked at the beginning of this show because it was invigorating, but after you’re done watching 4-5 episodes of this shit, you’ll be drained. To confuse you even more and add plot holes, the show introduces some of the most overpowered and unexplained power system: Charyeok. This ability is bestowed upon a person when he or she makes a contact with a supernatural entity--at least that was what this show said it would be before going off and randomly granting this power to every single character of this show. This power can be used and shaped by the will of its possessor. Because of how rushed this show is, you’ll just have to accept the fact that they can unlock these powers with no buildups.Now, the plot. If you were going into this show expecting a coherent story, then you’re in the wrong show. This pile of dogshit knows that it lacks plot points, so to try and deceive you from the lack of plot is by feeding you fights after fights. At the time I’m writing this, it was reported that the producers at MAPPA crammed 130 and counting chapters into 13 episodes. A manhwa’s first 130 chapters worth of story and developments were being glossed over in favor of fights. Jesus Christ. The producers and the director must have lost their minds for thinking that they can form a coherent story with this. In anyhow, the story can be summarized in one sentence: Three high school students that were on steroids came together to participate in a tournament and a religious cult is after them because they’re evil. That’s it. No build-ups, no clarification of their motivations, no world-building, no explanations for the power system, no developments for the main casts, and the list goes on and on. Initially, I was going to accept that there won’t be any plot developments and this garbage would end with the main trio moving on to the next stage of the tournament. An okay ending for what this show has presented thus far. But out of nowhere, the last few episodes turned into a clusterfuck. To simplify, the last few episodes turned into Humans vs God. You read that right.Apparently, the evil cult got the ability to summon a horribly CG animated golden statue from the sky that was going to crash on to the tournament dorm. This ugly statue is what they call “God”. Before you get the chance to grasp what was going on, you’re thrown into large scale battles. Everyone just suddenly started brawling at each other and initiating chaos within a city. As you watch, you see people being slaughtered left and right, you see a group of lunatics chanting battle cry, you see the buildings on fire, you see the city being blown up, you see the main trio battling against an underdeveloped main villain, and you probably will see a couple having sex in the middle of this chaos and wondering what the fuck is going on.The character writing of this show painfully displays its old generation of shounen. And I don’t mean your Narutos, Luffies, or Ichigos. I meant the worst aspect of the main characters of the old generation of shounen: characters that drive on fighting. Jin displays the character traits of early Gokus. They have no other motivations or personalities besides their love for combat. That’s why they don’t influence the story and their environments much. Characters like Luffy, for example, are the main component that pushes the story forward. Or characters like Naruto that have a clear motivation and they’re the story. The story and everything else revolves around them.What’s Jin? If he’s taken out of the story, nothing changes. He could easily be replaced by a nobody, and the story would remain the same. That being the main character participating in a tournament and meets a couple of friends, and they fight together. He doesn’t influence the story because the plot has been set for him. That being the tournament. He doesn’t even have much of an impact on characters around him.Dae-Wi and Mi-Ra’s motivation to participate in the GoH tournament ended way too early. After Dae-Wi’s friend died, he lost his purpose in the show. The only reason he still participated in the tournament in the first place was that he’s part of the main trio. And the same problem applies to Mi-Ra. As the series progressed, it lost its characters’ purpose. What once was a mildly interesting trio turned into a one-dimensional lunatics that love punching and kicking.The only thing that kept me from giving this garbage a score of 1 is the animation. The fights, choreography, details in character designs, lighting effects, and the smoothness of the animations were great. There’s clear evidence that the animators worked their asses off for delivering the fights in this show, unlike the staff who worked on Tower of God. The camera movements were smart and helped to deliver the impacts of these fights. The color effects of the background and stage were reflective, the smooth animation of hand to hand combat was mind-blowing at times, and the overall animation style makes the show feel alive. Unlike the paint animation of Tower of God. It at least showed that the animators cared about what they were animating even if they knew this show was doomed to fail. But that still won’t excuse this show’s overall problems.At last, I want to end this review by saying that I wanted The God of Highschool to succeed. I wanted Tower of God to succeed. Just like I stated in my ToG review. I genuinely believe that Webtoons can be turned into a major adaptation field for future anime projects because I believe Webtoons can bring something new and fresh. But, the adaptation of The God of Highschool and Tower of God proves that there needs to be a big commitment put into these adaptations. Because clearly, the anime industry doesn’t know how to adapt Manhwas, yet.Score: 2/10 because Attack on Titan delivered what people claimed it would do back then.

But, the adaptation of The God of Highschool and Tower of God proves that there needs to be a big commitment put into these adaptations. Because clearly, the anime industry doesn’t know how to adapt Manhwas, yet.Score: 2/10', 'PROLOGUEThe God of Highschool is the second Korean adaptation after Tower of God that is unlike anything we’ve seen before, because it’s from Korea. It really stands out from all other anime that came out so far by being exactly like every other anime that came out so far... Seriously now, anyone who thought we entered a new era for anime, because manhwa will be the new fad after isekai, was an idiot. There is nothing that sets this anime apart from Baki the Grappler, or Kengan Ashura, or any other show that is just about teenagers fighting each other.ARTWORK AND ANIMATIONIt is well animated...and if pretty colors are all you want, you will get them in spades. Just shut off your brain and watch stuff exploding on screen. You will like it that way. But in case you cannot do that, because you have a functional brain and you are not enjoying eating shit by forcefully losing your sense of smell and taste, then don’t bother.CHARACTERSThe characters are one note, have very shallow motivations, and are apes in level of intelligence.-They can wish for anything they like, and the best things they can think of are some money to save their dojo, or a reverse harem.-They realize superpowers exist only when they see many contestants using them. It’s something they should have known since all previous tournaments were airing on television and were very popular. They weren’t hidden from the public, they were broadcasted worldwide, therefore they should have known about the superpowers.-The protagonist says he doesn’t want to borrow powers from others and wants to instead get stronger on his own. And then proceeds to get a cheap power up by eating a devil fruit and never points out his hypocrisy.-Most land devastations by superpowers are covered up by the media and are labeled as invasions from the north. And by north, they mean North Korea. Which means every time a mountain blows up it’s just North Korea nuking the country. And that is enough for nobody to panic. What a great cover up.-Contestants are constantly injuring their opponents outside the tournament, and yet nobody reports them so they can be disqualified. Not even the victims. Which means the tournament is so just you can win without having to follow any rules or play fair. I mean, why would they say they got attacked when it’s just going to be covered up as an invasion from the North Korea? No reason to panic.PLOTThe reason the characters are so mentally challenged is because there is no logic in the plot. There is an evil cult that wastes a whole episode on a marriage that came out of nowhere and was over in 10 minutes. Then imposters replace the real fighters and take their form just for fighting someone on the arena when they could fight her is the middle of the street whenever they wanted and avoid doing all this nonsense. Every single scene is as dumb as that and it constantly makes you eye roll.PACINGEven if the plot was a masterpiece with no plot holes or conveniences, the show would still be bad, since the geniuses at the storyboard decided to adapt 10 chapters per episode. As a result there is close to no build up for most of what is going on, and nothing feels rewarding because it’s over before you know it.-There is a grampa who is said to be undefeatable in battle, yet loses in the very first fight we see. So we feel nothing over his loss.-One of the rivals has a haki-like aura that always causes his opponents to faint, yet fails in the very first fight we see it being used. So we feel nothing over its failure.-The key of the gods is supposed to be powerful enough to destroy the world, yet it gets defeated in the very first fight it’s used. So we feel nothing over its failure.ACTIONEven the action part, the highlight of the show, is far from the best thing ever.-There is a power scouter of sorts that measures one’s endurance and battle power. Those numbers never play a role in the fights, because if they did there would be no point in the fighting. They would just declare the winner based on the bigger number. Thus the numbers are useless and every victory comes down to ‘because plot said so’.-The way people obtain superpowers comes down to randomness. Some never get them no matter how much they train, and some get them without doing anything. Wonderful! It basically works however it suits the plot. Which is also why people get power ups in the middle of the fight without prior knowledge of what they gained.-There is close to no teamwork in the battles, and even when there are numerous combatants it feels as though the strongest ones need no help because they can steamroll everything. The main character in specific is broken as shit. He’s constantly plot armored so that he is never punished for breaking the rules. He’s somehow durable enough to withstand super poisons and nuclear explosions. Gets stronger very fast. Can copy someone’s ability by just looking at it. Creates new special attacks with minimal training. Pulls out hidden powers that not even demigods stand a chance against. Manages to run faster than light and get to the tournament in a few seconds despite being tired and injured. There is literally nothing he can’t do and acts like a brat the whole time. He is annoying and ruins all the fun in the fights.-Most battles don’t have meaningful tactics that would make them a bit more interesting through mind games. It’s just who fires the bigger energy blast or does the craziest shit. There is a scene where a guy turns nuclear missiles into a statue and teleports millions of people to safety in a few seconds. How did he do that?-Most lesser fights are really short or are skipped entirely, which can be very annoying when they hype them up and then show nothing. And because of the brilliant idea of shoving 10 chapters in every episode, there are MANY fights per episode and they are all either short or skipped, therefore none of them is satisfactory.-Injuries mean nothing since there is instant healing technology and wish-granting ladies. Basically, there are zero negative consequences when you lose a fight.-There are constant interruptions that quickly become annoying. Many of them stop when someone jumps in the ring to interrupt the fighting before it gets brutal and ruins the fun. There is no tension, much less stakes.-There is a lot of fake suspense regarding characters that seem like they can lose or die, but not really since they could do a lot of weird shit all along. For example, the family of the referee didn’t die because they created copies of them. What a great strategy. If only we had seen the fake family die, if only we had spend time with the real family for giving a shit, and if only the power to create copies had already been established earlier instead of coming out of nowhere.-New special attacks come out of nowhere and you have to just accept that the characters were holding back the whole time. Even if there was no indication that they could do all that before using them for the first time.-It can be very confusing to follow what is going on, since there is no narrator for explaining the superpowers. The viewer has to figure it out on his own. And even then, he won’t have a clue as to why did someone win in a fight. A guy for example summons a huge hammer out of nowhere, and as soon as it’s blocked he falls unconscious. What happened? From where did that hammer come from? How was it blocked? Why did he fall unconscious? Without explanations it’s just random bullshit.-If the fighters are not jumping around with kicks and punches, they are standing still and summon Jojo stands that do all the work for them. What is the point of learning martial arts if they can stand still and let shit happen all around them?EPILOGUESo yeah, the show is a trainwreck. The only reason it got hyped up as part of the new era of anime was because many shills were paid to lie about it. You see, Crunchyroll wanted to sell subscriptions so it tricked a lot of casuals into consuming Korean products and being excited for more Korean products. Because, at the end of the day, isn’t that the meaning of life in this modern world we are living in? and if pretty colors are all you want, you will get them in spades. Just shut off your brain and watch stuff exploding on screen. You will like it that way. But in case you cannot do that, because you have a functional brain and you are not enjoying eating shit by forcefully losing your sense of smell and taste, then don’t bother.CHARACTERSThe characters are one note, have very shallow motivations, and are apes in level of intelligence.-They can wish for anything they like, and the best things they can think of are some money to save their dojo, or a reverse harem.-They realize superpowers exist only when they see many contestants using them.

So we feel nothing over its failure.ACTIONEven the action part, the highlight of the show, is far from the best thing ever.-There is a power scouter of sorts that measures one’s endurance and battle power. Those numbers never play a role in the fights, because if they did there would be no point in the fighting. They would just declare the winner based on the bigger number. Thus the numbers are useless and every victory comes down to ‘because plot said so’.-The way people obtain superpowers comes down to randomness. Some never get them no matter how much they train, and some get them without doing anything. Wonderful! It basically works however it suits the plot. Which is also why people get power ups in the middle of the fight without prior knowledge of what they gained.-There is close to no teamwork in the battles, and even when there are numerous combatants it feels as though the strongest ones need no help because they can steamroll everything. The main character in specific is broken as shit. He’s constantly plot armored so that he is never punished for breaking the rules. He’s somehow durable enough to withstand super poisons and nuclear explosions. Gets stronger very fast. Can copy someone’s ability by just looking at it. Creates new special attacks with minimal training. Pulls out hidden powers that not even demigods stand a chance against. Manages to run faster than light and get to the tournament in a few seconds despite being tired and injured. There is literally nothing he can’t do and acts like a brat the whole time. He is annoying and ruins all the fun in the fights.-Most battles don’t have meaningful tactics that would make them a bit more interesting through mind games. It’s just who fires the bigger energy blast or does the craziest shit. There is a scene where a guy turns nuclear missiles into a statue and teleports millions of people to safety in a few seconds. How did he do that?-Most lesser fights are really short or are skipped entirely, which can be very annoying when they hype them up and then show nothing. And because of the brilliant idea of shoving 10 chapters in every episode, there are MANY fights per episode and they are all either short or skipped, therefore none of them is satisfactory.-Injuries mean nothing since there is instant healing technology and wish-granting ladies. Basically, there are zero negative consequences when you lose a fight.-There are constant interruptions that quickly become annoying. Many of them stop when someone jumps in the ring to interrupt the fighting before it gets brutal and ruins the fun. There is no tension, much less stakes.-There is a lot of fake suspense regarding characters that seem like they can lose or die, but not really since they could do a lot of weird shit all along. For example, the family of the referee didn’t die because they created copies of them. What a great strategy. If only we had seen the fake family die, if only we had spend time with the real family for giving a shit, and if only the power to create copies had already been established earlier instead of coming out of nowhere.-New special attacks come out of nowhere and you have to just accept that the characters were holding back the whole time. Even if there was no indication that they could do all that before using them for the first time.-It can be very confusing to follow what is going on, since there is no narrator for explaining the superpowers. The viewer has to figure it out on his own. And even then, he won’t have a clue as to why did someone win in a fight. A guy for example summons a huge hammer out of nowhere, and as soon as it’s blocked he falls unconscious. What happened? From where did that hammer come from? How was it blocked? Why did he fall unconscious? Without explanations it’s just random bullshit.-If the fighters are not jumping around with kicks and punches, they are standing still and summon Jojo stands that do all the work for them. What is the point of learning martial arts if they can stand still and let shit happen all around them?EPILOGUESo yeah, the show is a trainwreck. The only reason it got hyped up as part of the new era of anime was because many shills were paid to lie about it. You see, Crunchyroll wanted to sell subscriptions so it tricked a lot of casuals into consuming Korean products and being excited for more Korean products. Because, at the end of the day, isn’t that the meaning of life in this modern world we are living in?', ""[Note: I have not read the original source material so I will be reviewing it just based of the anime adaptation. And it contains spoilers]The God of High School is the second manhwa to get adapted into anime. Even after Tower of God utterly disappointed me I had pretty high hopes for God of High School adaptation.I was expecting a shounen anime with great premise , world building better than ‘One Piece’ and ‘Hunter x Hunter’ ,  characters so well written that  will put characters of ‘Monster’ and ‘Ping Pong‘ in shame , twists so unpredictable that will keep me shocked for a...whole month and visuals and action so great that will make ‘ Fate / Zero ‘ look like a low budget work.Did it lives up to its hype ? What did I get ? A bad anime with only redeeming factor being its fine animation. A show which probably 14 y/o kids will love because it has cool looking fights but everything except that is below average.First let’s talk about the premise. The God of High School is set in Korea where a tournament is held in order to crown the strongest high school student. Whoever wins the tournament will have his/her one wish granted. People from different places with different abilities gather there in order to become ‘The God of High School‘ and one of those person is our main protagonist Jin Mori. On his way to the tournament he finds and befriends Han Daewi and Yu Mira and they participate in the tournament.After that the only thing that happens is FIGHTs and that’s all. And the fights are there because…..…. Why not ? kids will obviously appreciate cool fights not because it’s actually necessary to that extent. The pacing for this show is awfully fast. I heard they tried to adapt 11 chapter of Manhwa to single episode which is actually absurd in any case.Writing characters with great ideology , respectable motivation and backstories which led them to their current situations , relativity etc is most admirable quality of an skilled author. Sometimes great characters can even overshadow the weak premise of the show. But this anime fails at this category even more than any other.  It is filled with boring , generic and one dimensional characters. I will talk about our main 3 cast individually because they deserves it.1: Jin MoriHave you ever watched Dragon Ball ? If you have then you will probably know Goku and if you know Goku then you even don’t have to watch this show to know Jin Mori as Jin is A to Z copy of Goku.. Jin is carefree kid who is obsessed with fighting stronger people so is Goku.. Jin eats a lot and has bottomless stomach so does Goku.. Jin was raised by his Grandpa so was Goku.. Jin at first seems to be some normal guy with some martial art ability but later he turns out to be some overpowered dude who isn’t aware of his own strength so was Goku.. Jin is loud , funny sometimes but acts dumb most of the times so is Goku.That’s all. This is the entirety of Jin’s character. His motive in joining the tournament is as bland as his character. He interferes into other people’s affair when its none of his business, Why you ask ?  because he is shounen protagonist and the author wanted him to make as generic as he could possibly make. Did you guys find him interesting ? If you did then fine by me but I really couldn’t find him interesting at all even tho I wanted to.2: Yu MiraYu Mira is your typical tsundere girl who is there just to annoy the living shit out of the viewer. She is a hot headed girl and gets pissed at everything Jin and Han does. And Jin and Han will say nothing, Why ? because they are good friends.She joined the tournament in order to revive her late father’s Moonlight Sword art which was his dying wish. And she will possibly do anything to grant her father’s wish even if she has to marriage some unknown guy and quit the tournament. But after hearing our main character saying ‘’ Oh you are so strong you can do it by yourself. Why quitting after we came this far together in the tournament ’’. She will change her mind , Whyyy ? If your only reason on joining the tournament was to revive your father’s sword style and if you marry to that guy your wish would have been granted then why not do it. What’s the reason for not doing so ? That’s something I hated about her only character arc ( more like character episode.) which was supposed for fleshing out her character and maybe bless her with some character development, which was the only way of changing my feelings for her after I got annoyed by her the entire time. But they failed to do so. She is still just another generic annoying tsundere girl who has to be there just for sake for some fan service and to annoy the viewer.3: Han DaewiHan Daewi easily is the best among 3 bad written characters. He is your everyday ‘’ Oh I am quiet mouthed yet badass character ’’. And I always had a bad time liking these kind of guys. He joined the tournament in order to save his friend who is hospitalized and is in verse of death. Which is something that I can’t possibly criticize about. After he finds about that his friend died ‘’ He beats the living crap out of his another friend Yu Mira whose marriage he and Jin just spoiled some minutes ago. ‘’. But his friend wasn’t even actually dead. His whole backstory and his character arc was wrapped up in 1 single episode which negatively affect’s on how me as a viewer can care about his relation with his old ill friend. Due to its extremely fast pace, I just found it being forced for the sake of his development and I couldn’t care less about his relation with his ill friend.To wrap everything up. Just like Daewi’s relation with his ill friend, the relation of our main 3 cast felt kind’a forced, they met and became friends for the sake of story not because they had enough interactions with each other. Side characters in this show are more uninteresting than the main casts. Everyone of them have no personality other than one single trait that defines them. Motivation of the most characters are left unexplained because the show focuses on mindless fighting instead of fleshing out the characters while the characters whose motivations are explained are most of the time UNINTERESTING.And how can I expect a shouen anime to not have the shounen’s most powerful weapon which can beat 1000’s years of villain’s training and battle knowledge aka ‘’Power of Friendship’’. Yea did you expect The God of High School to not have that shit here ? Then you will be disappointed. When an opponent beats our main casts because they knew their weakness and after getting few hits or so our main casts will overcome that weakness for the sake of story not because there is any logical reason behind it.There is one fight between Jin Mori and Park Ilpyo.Park Ilpyo being Jin Mori’s senpai. He had more battle skills and was overall stronger than Mori but for some reason Mori beats him and the moment after he beats him Ilpyo unlocks a new power which seems similar to Naruto’s sage form + Nine Tails and starts beating crap out of Mori and he actually overwhelms Mori in the fight but for the sake of being Protagonist he had to win that fight. How would you do it ? Give him some unknown power ups baby. For some reason Mori unlocks an power that he himself isn’t aware of and beat the shit of out of Ilpyo and he isn’t aware of his power even after the fights. And was left unexplained.There is another fight between Yu Mira and Lee Marin.For some reason Lee Marin annihilates Yu Mira for majority of the fight. And then ‘’ She gets some flashbacks , she yell ‘ Oh I will catch up to them’, I am weak that’s why I want to get stronger, I have to win’’ and all those bullshits and as expected she unlocks new unexplained power and then she one shots Lee Marin. Like WTF ? I have seen this shit 10000 times in shounen anime. Stop this shit already. Just explain the power ups logically or just let the character use some insane battle IQ’s to beat the opponent rather than relying on asspulls.Talking about its character designs. It’s actually pretty decent but the red nose and ears doesn’t even fit and it just looks awkward to watch. They just looks drunk because of the red nose and ear. Props for that unique yet bad idea. But talking about my issue with almost every anime is that the personality of a certain character can be predicted by his/her outfit and his/her physical looks. And that’s something I always had issues with. And God of High School does it too.If a character has evil intent and is threat to our protagonists then, why not give them scar in his face ? It will make them look more evil.If a character is smart ass then, why not let him wear glasses and carry books even when he is going to shit ? It will make him look smarter.If a girl is bad bitch then, why not let her wear half jean pants and chew gum the entire time ?Fuck that! Just show me about their personality through their activities not their physical looks. I know at this point I am just nitpicking but it’s something I personally can’t outlook. It’s okay if its fine for you guys but it’s just not for me. If I can predict someone’s personality just through their looks then I just lose my interest on them for the most part.Now about its animation which is easily it’s only redeeming factor. I actually never focus more on the animation so I have less knowledge about what makes good animation and what makes bad. But The God of High School has pretty good animation atleast in the fights. Maybe they used most of their budget in the fights that anything except for the fights has underwhelming animation. And the backgrounds art get affected the most. Except that the animation is pretty cool. Fight are well choreographed and looks cool to see. The whole reason to have a good animation is to make viewer have better experience and MAPPA did pretty good job on that.The soundtracks in this anime is forgettable. To be exact I have already forgot most of the soundtracks. The only 2 that I remember is it’s Opening and Ending. And I have complete different opinion on both of them. I never thought I would even talk about the opening and ending of an anime but let’s do it.Opening : I actually didn’t liked the opening song. It failed to impress me in both visual and audial department. It tried to pull the song that hypes the fuck out of the viewer after listening it be it from the cool looking visuals and sound. But completely failed to do so. Not to mention the only thing that happens in the song is fights and I am not even kidding.Ending: The Ending song for this is actually really great. It has catchy song with great visuals. And actually shows something other than fights. It shows the relationship between our main 3 characters with their closed one. Mira's being with her family , Han being with his friend and Jin being alone he is shown to just sleep at the roof. Which really impressed me and it also shows the interactions between our 3 protagonist , how they have fun and how they spend time with each other. Which I have nothing but respect and love for.Even after shitting in it the entire time. I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoyed it at all. I didn’t enjoyed it enormously but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really enjoyed the fights , I enjoyed some comedic moments and I enjoyed downloading and listening to the ending song for straight 100 times. But I still ended up having negative feelings about it.Overall if you watch The God of High School expecting only good fights and nothing else it won’t disappoint you. If you want to turn off the brain and watch cool fights and can ignore issue like fast pacing , poorly written characters , weak premise etc then The God of High School is good anime for you. If you want anime with great cast then, watch ‘Ping Pong’ or ‘Monster’. If you want to watch anime with incredible animation and choreography then watch ‘Fate/Zero’, if you want an anime with compelling story then watch ‘March Comes in Like a Lion’. If you are going to watch The God of High School looking for these then you will be wasting your time.TL;DRStory: 2/10 : Nothing much only mindless fighting.Character: 2/10 : Generic , boring , one dimensional.Artstyle / Animation: 6/10 for artstyle and 7/10 for animation: Good choreographed fights and animation aside from fights are underwhelming.Enjoyment: 4/10 : Has some cool fights , decent comedy moments, pretty enjoyable.Sound: 5/10 : Ending is great. Opening is bad. Rest are forgettable.Overall: 4/10 : Watch this if you want only good fights.Thanks for reading.Have a good day/night. whole month and visuals and action so great that will make ‘ Fate / Zero ‘ look like a low budget work.Did it lives up to its hype ?

The humor is not appalling, but is not something you really laugh about.Everything indicates that the story will be poor, but it's expected since the focus are the fights.The only remarcable thing is the art and animation, wich are pretty good but sadly this are opaqued by the quality and content of the fights.Something that kinda pissed me off is how they represent martials arts, tbh it's a bit cringy.Also, ep 4 is super random. Actually I laughed a couple of times bc how weird it was....In summary so many people are just blinded by the hype.

However, each new episode makes this anime more confusing and illogical.My main problem with this anime is how new information is added to the story. In a show that knows what it is doing, the narrative will add new information that will leave the viewer curious about what will happen and what is the secret behind the plot.In the god of high school, however, it is the opposite: the more the anime explains, the less interest I have and the less sense the story makes. The...show wants to go from a simple tournament arc to a big conspiracy about gods and the fate of the world, but it just doesn't know how to do that and makes one of the most complicated and messed storytellings I've ever seen.Besides that, the fights are fun to watch and the animation is great. show wants to go from a simple tournament arc to a big conspiracy about gods and the fate of the world, but it just doesn't know how to do that and makes one of the most complicated and messed storytellings I've ever seen.Besides that, the fights are fun to watch and the animation is great."", 'Never watch this anime *if you are a snob that can\'t watch anything without nitpicking for the smallest flaws in something*Honestly?

I like that the MC also has this quest of finding his grandpa which was his only family since he was born, which gives him a satisfying motivation....Small spoiler for the end of the anime, we can\'t even predict if Mori will actually save him because of the last words we hear from his grandpa while he is chained up ""I hope will be strong enough to defeat me"".The action scenes are 100/10. Most of the early fights were actually motion captured which makes them so much better. Later down the line, we get more DBZ style of fights while maintaining the initial weight of the hits in the beginning, so I don\'t really mind it.Cons are the constant backstory in the middle of the fight that I didn\'t really mind THAT much, but it was noticeable and bugging me around episode 4-7. In the later episodes, I didn\'t get bothered that much so I am pretty sure they toned it down a bit.Overall, 10/10 due to enjoyment. I usually rate anime based on more technical criteria but it simply wouldn\'t be fair for this one. I strongly recommend you watch it if you are a fan of shonen and you want some semi-mindless fun with a little nostalgia thrown in there (if you are like me).

The rule...of cool permeates the very fabric of this adaptation; it is comparable to allocating one\'s skill points solely to one attribute. What should be a mere experience enhancer is mistaken for the main dish and is thence expected for one to stomach a plate filled with naught but condiments and spices. Needless to say it doesn\'t make for a particularly hearty (nor tasty for that matter) meal. Vague conceptions and aphorisms aside, I shall get on with the meat of the discussion.As far as any work that features action compounding with fantastical elements go, what is paramount above all else is establishing what exactly those elements ARE, how it ties into the world and its mechanics, as well as the capabilities of the characters relevant to the story. And GoHS has NOTHING, and by that I mean not even a SEMBLANCE of this very rudimentary understanding of how stories work in its arsenal. Gigantic swords are conjured from the sky, otherworldly creatures resembling Stands are summoned, anything ranging from elemental magic, cathode ray guns, regeneration, and even teleporting whole cities goes in this story with no apparent explanation to what even is the source of this arbitrary and inconsistent litany of distinct skill sets. Eventually, in episode 7, they chalk all of it up to a mystical power that transcends human knowledge borrowed from the Gods. This helps absolutely nothing; it\'s still impossible to gauge what our heroes/heroine are capable of, thereby obscuring the level of danger they face at any particular time. It\'s unimmersive as it is anticlimactic, why should you care about a battle that you cannot make anything out of? Anyone can survive anything, some random god can decide on a whim to bestow you powers. It successfully kills off any excitement one can have over analysing how the tides of battle can potentially change in either combatant\'s favour. Shows that aren\'t too keen on building the combat system from scratch tend to instead use internal monologues to give us a sense of the state of battle. This, while not being nearly as satisfying as deducing so yourself by extrapolating from visual cues, works absolutely fine. Too bad they decided not to do that either. As audience, you\'re but a detached onlooker, witnessing an alien occurrence play out, furrowing your eyebrows at what you\'re supposed to feel.The cast is a reskin of the stock characters you\'ve seen a couple of hundred times by now. You got the hot-headed and bubbly mc who just loves fighting for the sake of fighting, the stoic and taciturn kick-ass going at great lengths for the people he values, and lastly the uptight and more ordinary tritagonist who mostly assumes the role of the Straight Man in the comical scenes that ensue. On the supporting cast too, the trends naturally follow, but with the added handicap of not being explored at all, unlike the mc\'s, whose motivations we at least were allowed some minimal disclosure of. There\'s the enigmatic rich businessman whom we have as much insight on in the end of episode 13 as we do in the beginning of episode 1, some deranged cult leader who just wants to see the world burn, an antagonist who wants to crush people and have as much power as possible because... uhh, you know what forget it, they\'re stock characters, perhaps better suited for theatre. Though it should be mentioned, my remarks here oughtn\'t be construed as claiming a uniquely realized cast is a prerequisite for a successful anime, that is not necessarily the case. If the narrative is gripping by itself, inoffensive and simplistic surrogates may very well suffice. But when it\'s already nothing to be proud of on those respects, this could only be seen as an aggravating factor in inducing head scratches.There are two subplots seemingly interconnected with the motivations behind the tournament and the fate of the heroes of our story, but it is too unbaked to the point where even addressing it feels like giving it more than its due. ""There is a cult-like organization discontent with the usage of charyeok?"" Okay... ""Mori\'s grandpa is constantly moving because baddies want him, also he has something to do with NK?"" Sure... ""Park Meijin and the commissioners have a plan involving the GoHS to awaken the key?"" What it is, what it is for, how GoHS helps it manifest, why everyone and their mother is vying for it, these are all great questions; but well, how about more flashy animation instead? It\'s all a bunch of vagueries in an attempt to hold in place a series of action sequences, they could be more accurately described as passing remarks than plot points, given that they\'re mentioned once and never elaborated on again until they\'re literally at your doorstep. In the unlikely instance where you do get some expository direction, it\'ll be by means of brief info dumps that are unrelated to the scene in question. I legitimately had to look up the episode synopses in order to remind myself of these plot elements, not because the storytelling is too dense to take in, to the contrary, because there is so little info to go on when interpreting what the hell just transpired that it isn\'t a feasible nor a worthwhile endeavour.In short, this is a well-animated fighting compilation that would work perfectly fine as a long-winded trailer for a fighting game.

As a full-fledged narrative building up on itself it is an absolute joke.', 'The show seems to have a huge budget, the animation and action scenes are really detailed and astonishing. Sound effects and all that are also good. However. The story this far couldnt be any less uninteresting, and to put the cherry on top of the show, the characters who are portrayed as the main characters, are so bland, that i couldnt care less about their outcomes.. They all seem like a bunch of side-characters in my opinion. I might sound a bit harsh in this review, but man, the only thing the show got, is their piece of art, animation. ', ""I'm not a huge anime fan, I've watched like 10-15-20.. Therefore, this is not a weeb's review.You'll see people complaining about the story, about characters and so on and so forth. However, it would be a pity if you didn't watch it. I already recommended it to all my friends.I just loved it. It made me sit at the edge of my chair. I got goosebumps countless times. Such fluid and outstanding animation, such lovable characters and protagonist. Such badass abilities, super powers, new moves etc.Yes, the protagonist is invincible. But.. Aren't they all?I finished it in 1 sit.If you...are looking for good fights, music, characters this is a go to. are looking for good fights, music, characters this is a go to."", 'Do not watch this anime. Instead, go into your kitchen, put on some dubstep, and start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and imagine the most generic fighting anime possible. Well done. You have created an experience almost as horrible as The God of High School.Allegedly, this anime is about high school students fighting in a tournament to win a wish. After watching it, I do not think any part of the synopsis is correct. Everyone is supposedly in high school, but none of them show the slightest signs of brain activity. Only a few of the contestants are actually students. There...is a bodybuilder, a 30-year-old construction worker, and an army sergeant, to name a few. It seems like the author forgot his own premise. Calling this show a tournament would also be a lie. The main character, Jin Mori, is wrapped so tightly in plot armor he is invincible. A bomb could explode right beside him, and he’d be unscathed. Amazing logic! His entire personality is limited to being loud, annoying, and comically overpowered. Occasionally he is drawn with chibi artwork to highlight just how obnoxious he is. Someone had the genius idea to add comic relief chibi-art at random times while people are fighting and killing each other. But who cares about tonal consistency when you have sakuga?Jin breaks the tournament rules all the time, and nothing happens. Even though the angsty committee who run the show are supposed to be threatening, they rarely punish him. He doesn’t deserve his wins. Jin gets stronger incredibly fast with no training too. I can’t cheer for a protagonist who never struggled for his powers. Why would anyone root for a hero who is given everything? Jin had a one-minute training montage, now he can heal any wound by poking it with his finger. No joke, this really happens. Jin always holds back his powers because he has a secret plan. He reveals his cool new moves, but it’s not impressive. We’re never allowed to see his strategies, so there’s no build-up. It’s the same trite formula every fight. All we get is mindless back and forth of punches and kicks. It’s equivalent to removing a WWE commentator. In the manhwa, there were fighting style explanations. All of them were removed from the adaptation. There’s an announcer for the tournament who contributes nothing except enthusiastic introductions.In the first episode, Jin met his friends Mira and Dae-wi. The first fight scene is one of the best in the show. The bike chase that began the episode was very well choreographed. The voice acting was frantic, and so was the music. Everyone fought together. The characters interacted with the environment in ways they never do again. The campy comedy felt sincere—afterward, it was nowhere to be seen. Mira and Dae-wi are the most powerful competitors, but somehow they’re more underwhelming than Jin. Mira is determined to be a worthy successor to her late father by carrying on her family’s sword and combat style. Other than a few scenes to herself, Mira gets virtually no time at all. Her fights are shorter, and sometimes all we see is the beginning and end. Dae-wi had one motivation in the whole show. His entire reason for being in the tournament became irrelevant, but he still stayed in. His backstory was interesting, but he became obsolete after a couple of episodes. The three of them have no chemistry at all. They only seemed like friends in the outro credits (Where they do friend stuff together). The opening provides some “character development,” too, but that’s if you can listen to it. Listening to the OP is like getting stabbed in the eardrums with rusty knives. Imagine mixing dubstep and the sound of nails scraping a chalkboard.The only reason why I kept watching the God of High School was the fight scenes and sakuga. It really pissed me off when they gave people a backstory moments before they would lose. It’s pointless. With every passing episode, more characters were added. There were increasingly more plot-lines. The pacing became so fast it felt like a 50 episode anime was beaten with a shovel until it fit in 13 episodes. We were told that important fights happened without getting to see them. They’ll show us the beginning and end but skip everything else. They just show us the outcome. We’re told The God of High School tournament is broadcasted worldwide, but it’s never incorporated into the setting to build up the fights. Even the main characters lose track of the new powers their opponents are fighting with. This puts them at a disadvantage, but why should we care? They’re in a tournament, but they’re too stupid to watch their upcoming opponents on TV? How am I supposed to believe they are THIS dumb. I can’t enjoy God of High School if it makes no sense to me. What am I supposed to do? Stare at the sakuga with drool dripping down my face? Pass. Is this the future of anime? God, I hope not.The characters move from one fight to the next without existing in the setting. They don’t know what’s happening beyond their red clown noses. The author churns out new characters like a cardboard cut-out printing press. People blow themselves up, summon spirit sharks and giant bazookas. It’s like Looney Tunes, except bloody and boring. The rules of this world don’t make any sense. The fights never affect the setting. They fight in public, damage property, and kill people, but it rarely explains how this affects actual citizens. The author could’ve avoided this gaping plothole with a simple solution. If the tournament took place in an alternate dimension, it would explain why the setting is empty. Even Hand Shakers, the infamously terrible anime from 2017, got this right. Somehow God of High School is even stupider than that shitshow. Calling GoH a shit show would be insulting to both shit and shows. At least after a shit, you feel better. After this, I just felt dead inside.The fight choreography makes the fight scenes even less comprehensible. Jin grazes his opponent in one fight, but the sound effects are so impactful you could mistake it for a fistfight. The same punching sounds are repeated in rapid succession. It’s like One Punch Man 2 all over again. Did the sound editors even communicate with the director? God of High School’s animation gets a lot of praise, which is deserved for specific action sequences, but for two-thirds of the show, it looks very average. The visuals are spectacular… in a couple of scenes. Due to the clusterfuck of a script, the editing lacks continuity. We skip from one place to the next in less than thirty seconds. It’s difficult to follow any of the storylines. There are so many details lost between stories. Attempting to catch up with everything that has happened makes it impossible to just enjoy it.Fights take place in the streets, and buildings are destroyed… but no one seems to care. Are there police officers? Military? Firefighters? DOES ANYONE EXIST IN THIS WORLD?! It doesn’t seem like it! I guess the author just didn’t finish that part! I have no idea why the author added magic to this show. They cut out every explanation of the magic when adapting the script. Magical circles are copied and pasted everywhere like you’d see in a generic isekai anime. Massive swords fall from the sky, and people literally have Jojo’s stands.In other, better fantasy stories, the world would look much different from magic. It would advance technology, architecture, science, and change the media. God of High School didn’t bother. It is a lazy cash grab. Rather than being original, it regurgitates tired genre tropes and cliches. There is no artistic integrity in this script. The pacing flies at breakneck speed, making it hard to follow along. All I could do was try to make sense of what I was watching. If you want to understand what’s happening, you need to read the Wiki.God of High School was filled with unnecessary advertising for Crunchyroll and Webtoon. Their intentions were obvious--to advertise the webtoons and convince people to buy them. It’s unclear if they will make sequels to these anime. I thought it was just an Easter Egg the first time. Anime studios often subtly integrate their name into their shows. Unlike artists, Crunchyroll does not care how obnoxious their logo is. Their advertisement is plastered on every side of the God of High School battle arena. Sponsored by Crunchyroll! Sponsored by Webtoon! They make sure you never forget who paid for what you’re watching. How ironic that they attached their name to the shittiest anime they’ve funded. How embarrassing. Even though this anime isn’t high art, it is slimy to put your company’s name all over the show. Does the anime take place in a world where Crunchyroll exists? No, they are just comprised of greedy investors who don’t give two shits about anime. Crunchyroll messed up this adaptation. They chose to adapt 118 chapters, that’s 9 chapters every episode. What we have here is a shitty 13 episode trailer for the webtoon. This is an embarrassment for MAPPA, a studio filled with passionate artists.The God of High School is a burning dump truck stinking up the entire anime industry. This catastrophe can never happen again, but I know it will as long as they keep making money. This is a genuinely baffling piece of animation. They tried their hardest to entertain us but failed miserably.

I’ve never seen an anime with a budget as high as The God of High School’s that can be compared to the worst action anime ever made.', 'I never wanted to make a review, but I tired my friends with my complains, so here I go. Sorry for my bad englishWell, I think this is the perfect example of good idea and bad execution.I haven\'t read the manhwa, and that\'s why I don\'t criticize the story itself, but the adaptation.Story: 1This is the worst pacing EVER, so rushed and incoherent. I\'m not only talking about the story as such, i\'m also referring to the tournament and all the fights. Everything happens in a matter of seconds, a lot of things and power-ups unexplained got out of nowhere. In the first episodes no...one says that the story is placed in a ""super powers world"" or something like that, but suddenly they come up with all the charyeoks?The first episode seems to be a little bit attractive with a basic humor, but the next 4 episodes are very disappointing, and after that it just gets worse. In episode four the main femenine character meets a guy in the first 15 seconds of the show, and by the middle of it they are getting married FOR A STUPID AND LOOSE REASON; of course, the reason is SO WEAK that by the end of the episode she realizes how ridiculous it is and changes her mind in half of a minute. Disastrous.By the eigth or nineth episode we get to see kind of an organization OUT OF NOWHERE, AGAIN, that appears with no logical reasons to destroy everything. The first thing you wonder is WHY, HOW? Guess what, none of this response will get to you.And after that, they step aside and you get leaded to the main villain, another pathetic character with a superiority complex and that is violent in excess. That\'s all. A lot of things around him are questionable. There\'s a mysterious ""key"" that everybody wants and that was inside a kyuubi guy, a character that has nothing to do and is quite similar to the MC, not to say that is the same cliche thing.This is only the edge of the iceberg, but I think is enough to comprehend my point. And most important, a lot of plot holes, and A LOT of plot benefits. I can\'t recall how many of the fights in the anime are meant to end in a way, BUT GUESS WHAT, THE THREE LITTLE FRIENDS ALWAYS HAVE A TRICK UP THEIR SLEEVE THAT HAS NO PRECEDENTS NOR SENSE.Art: 8I think is the only positive thing about this anime. Mappa is a studio that I really love, and the animation is fantastic. The fights are the best 20 seconds in every lame episode, lol.Such a shame that this is the only thing that I save and that prevented me from dropping this ridiculous anime.Sound: well, 5.I would say this is average to me. Not a big deal, not bad, not good.Good VA, that I can say.Character: 3MEDIOCRE af. Every character is 2d, with just one or two motives to be where they are and to do what they do. They all are pretty forgettable and also the relationship between the 3 MC is soooo forced.The main character is kind of likeable, but that\'s it. Typical shounen protagonist, and i\'m not complaining on that specifically, because i\'m really a shounen fan, but Jin Mori is only that. A likeable character that goes unnoticed and has no merit. All you can say about him is that is the stereotype of the good kid who defends the weak and doesn\'t allow unjustice. And, of course, PRETTY BUFFED WITH A LOT OF POWER UPS THAT NOT EVEN HE KNOWS HE HAS.Daewi, the quiet friend, is the only thing I kind of liked here. His story is the only one that makes sense, at least a little bit. Is kind of likeable, a calm person with a gray past and that is quite powerful too. Even though he doesn\'t have much development, he is okay.And the girl, Yu Mira, is an annoying character with double moral that has an objective and a flimsy determination to do it.

I love art marcial animes an so, but this was a disaster.I always watch an anime from the beggining to the end, I try so hard to not drop them, and so I did with GOH. I always tend to give it another chance to see if it can get any better, but this anime only made me suffer the episodes since the middle of the show.Overall: 2DON\'T WATCH IT UNLESS YOU HAVE GOOD REASONS TO DO IT one says that the story is placed in a ""super powers world"" or something like that, but suddenly they come up with all the charyeoks?The first episode seems to be a little bit attractive with a basic humor, but the next 4 episodes are very disappointing, and after that it just gets worse. In episode four the main femenine character meets a guy in the first 15 seconds of the show, and by the middle of it they are getting married FOR A STUPID AND LOOSE REASON; of course, the reason is SO WEAK that by the end of the episode she realizes how ridiculous it is and changes her mind in half of a minute. Disastrous.By the eigth or nineth episode we get to see kind of an organization OUT OF NOWHERE, AGAIN, that appears with no logical reasons to destroy everything. The first thing you wonder is WHY, HOW? Guess what, none of this response will get to you.And after that, they step aside and you get leaded to the main villain, another pathetic character with a superiority complex and that is violent in excess. That\'s all. A lot of things around him are questionable. There\'s a mysterious ""key"" that everybody wants and that was inside a kyuubi guy, a character that has nothing to do and is quite similar to the MC, not to say that is the same cliche thing.This is only the edge of the iceberg, but I think is enough to comprehend my point. And most important, a lot of plot holes, and A LOT of plot benefits. I can\'t recall how many of the fights in the anime are meant to end in a way, BUT GUESS WHAT, THE THREE LITTLE FRIENDS ALWAYS HAVE A TRICK UP THEIR SLEEVE THAT HAS NO PRECEDENTS NOR SENSE.Art: 8I think is the only positive thing about this anime. Mappa is a studio that I really love, and the animation is fantastic. The fights are the best 20 seconds in every lame episode, lol.Such a shame that this is the only thing that I save and that prevented me from dropping this ridiculous anime.Sound: well, 5.I would say this is average to me. Not a big deal, not bad, not good.Good VA, that I can say.Character: 3MEDIOCRE af. Every character is 2d, with just one or two motives to be where they are and to do what they do. They all are pretty forgettable and also the relationship between the 3 MC is soooo forced.The main character is kind of likeable, but that\'s it. Typical shounen protagonist, and i\'m not complaining on that specifically, because i\'m really a shounen fan, but Jin Mori is only that. A likeable character that goes unnoticed and has no merit. All you can say about him is that is the stereotype of the good kid who defends the weak and doesn\'t allow unjustice. And, of course, PRETTY BUFFED WITH A LOT OF POWER UPS THAT NOT EVEN HE KNOWS HE HAS.Daewi, the quiet friend, is the only thing I kind of liked here. His story is the only one that makes sense, at least a little bit. Is kind of likeable, a calm person with a gray past and that is quite powerful too. Even though he doesn\'t have much development, he is okay.And the girl, Yu Mira, is an annoying character with double moral that has an objective and a flimsy determination to do it.

The characters, to me personally, they are packaged...carefully and the anime adaptation did a good job at handling them.There's nothing really else for me to say, but I can tell that I enjoyed this anime, and overall, I think it's amazing. carefully and the anime adaptation did a good job at handling them.There's nothing really else for me to say, but I can tell that I enjoyed this anime, and overall, I think it's amazing."", 'A pandemic has hit the world.

"", ""Usually, when someone writes a review, for some reason we tend to overcomplicate it.

The episodes are full of Sakuga and most of the fights are well...choreographed(though most are anti climatic).The story seems to be much deeper than what was shown until episode 7 (although several twists have already been shown), but the anime script leaves a lot to be desired, leaving several loose ends, parts that feel forced and a BIG feeling of rush(in a nutsheel->the anime has SAO level of writing,  a great concept begin wasted by poor execution).The main trio is cool and interesting, and has good chemistry, but the rest of the cast is forgettable.The worldbulding and the power system seems to be well made, but I haven't seen enough to give an opinion(and if I'm sure about it, the writing of the anime certainly won't be able to demonstrate it).Overall it is a fun anime, but you are forced to ignore a lot of things to enjoy it. In the end it all depends on how much you can turn off your brain to watch it. choreographed(though most are anti climatic).The story seems to be much deeper than what was shown until episode 7 (although several twists have already been shown), but the anime script leaves a lot to be desired, leaving several loose ends, parts that feel forced and a BIG feeling of rush(in a nutsheel->the anime has SAO level of writing,  a great concept begin wasted by poor execution).The main trio is cool and interesting, and has good chemistry, but the rest of the cast is forgettable.The worldbulding and the power system seems to be well made, but I haven't seen enough to give an opinion(and if I'm sure about it, the writing of the anime certainly won't be able to demonstrate it).Overall it is a fun anime, but you are forced to ignore a lot of things to enjoy it.

That’s what propelled God of High School (GoHS) off to the races from the get-go. Everything from the early-2010s dubstep of a bombastic OP to the cast of manic martial-artists were engineered to deliver fist-pumping fun. Oh, and the action was spectacular too. For some audiences, such hype was all that they could ever ask for in a show. But for others, the train goes by oh-so-fast with far too little room to breathe. One has to ask if the ride was worth all that...much to begin with. Mild spoilers ahead regarding the premise of GoHS, so feel free to skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you’d prefer to go in blind.Welcome to Korea, home to the biggest mixed martial arts tournament the world has ever seen. Fighters from all over the country stake their lives in the ring, all for the prestigious title of God of High School. Not that it’s actually affiliated with a school or anything, I’m not sure what academic institution would sign off on having minors battle in a no-holds barred cage fight. And these fights really don’t hold back; competitors are pushed beyond their human limits thanks to nanobots that act as augmented “hitpoints,” repairing the body mid-combat and ensuring that brawls leave fans on the edge of their seats. This was essentially an underground fighting ring getting the widespan attention of a major sports championship. Sounds looney as all hell – and I was all for it.The first episode strode with confidence, with a pilot putting ass-kicking adrenaline action on full display. Lesser studios would kill to pull off this level of “sakuga” just once in a season; MAPPA staged those setpieces every odd week. A lot of those scenes weren’t all style and no substance either; creative visual storytelling choices, expressive key frames, and even motion-capture techniques were incorporated to deliver scenes that got audiences hyped and talking. Sure, there were definitely concessions made in giving backgrounds or in-between frames the same degree of attention, and secondary characters were written like those of the fighter video game campaigns GoHS took inspiration from – one-note, deranged, and ready to jump into battle faster than you can say “Fatality.” But hey, I like awesome animation as much as the next weeb. I won’t complain if the show asks me to turn my brain off and revel in the chaos. Unfortunately, as engaging as the action was, that’s not exactly what the show’s going for.Maybe I started this off wrong, let me try again.GoHS follows the story of Jin Mori, a scrappy taekwando pro eager to prove his strength and reunite with his long-lost grandfather. He meets a couple of friends in the tournament: Mira, a martial arts student hoping to breathe new life into her antiquated fighting style, and Han, a bare-fist brawler participating to keep his friend alive. Perhaps this Korean WebToon was well-suited to get the traditional anime treatment after all. It’s your classic shounen – the show is literally built around a tournament arc, for Pete’s sake. I’ve been meaning to find a shounen title I could get invested in, and it seems like I could do a lot worse than GoHS. Our main trio were gonna be the underdogs, training hard to be the very best and learning the importance of friendship along the way. We see shades of this in what is probably the series\' high-point, Episode 5. Han and Jin\'s duel was a great blend of character growth and epic action. It\'s a little more serious than I previously expected, sounds good to me.Except… that’s not what the show is going for either. An entire tournament arc that could have taken place across the entire cour was rushed out in the span of 5 episodes. How? By having little-to-no meaningful buildup or development take place outside of the fighting. It really is just fight after fight back-to-back. The show throws countless punches, but none of those blows carry weight behind them. There’s no time to show our cast struggle from the very bottom as they work their way to the top. No training montages or hard-earned lessons against tough opponents. As the ED goes: “All we do is just win,” and it’s incessantly boring.The show also does the core relationship between Jin, Han and Mira no favors. While GoHS preaches the importance of friendship, the close ""bond"" chosen to represent this ideal boils down to our trio travelling to the stadium and threatening to beat the shit out of each other every 10 minutes. Sure, somewhere in those death threats is an endearing interpretation of this competitiveness, as they urge each other to overcome their hurdles. And I’d be inclined to agree, if these characters could demonstrate their connection in any other way. The writers are rarely capable of showing this “friendship” outside the context of sweaty combat. Every helping hand offered always comes with a caveat that reads: “The only one who beats you in a fight will be me!” Their connection in the anime is two-dimensional and repetitive. It’d be too much of a stretch to deem this relationship as negative or toxic^, that implies some risks taken in portraying our three stooges.Oh, and all three of them are immediately the best fighters of the preliminary rounds, diffusing most of the tension for a good half of the season. The author threw in a magic power system into the mix, one that only 4 of the ""martial arts"" preliminary\'s competitors tapped into. Guess who three of those fighters are. I actually laughed when Mira, having been disarmed, won the fight by slicing the air as a ranged attack, leaving a flesh wound (this happens multiple times in GoHS.)Wait, this magic system is part of the lore… of course! So that’s the point of the show.Ok, I think we’re finally getting somewhere. Third time’s the charm?Things really heat up in the second half of GoHS as it pulls back the curtain to reveal a more complex setting than one would have initially imagined. A world defined by a massive power struggle – a battle of godly proportions. Two factions are deeply rooted in conflict over a mythical Key that possesses power to rival that of deities themselves. These factions tap into a magic system known as “Charyeok” for their uncanny abilities. The God of High School tournament is really a front to handpick Charyeok users and hopefully trigger the awakening of the Key. It sounds overwhelming and way more complicated than what I signed up for, but we’ve seen this storytelling work before. Calling GoHS “the next Evangelion” would be a stretch, but there are parallels between the two. A charismatic leader (Park Mujin) goes up against a shady organization (the cult) in taking control of a mysterious force through taking advantage of mentally unstable teenagers. Heck, it’s even got some complicated worldbuilding of its own. Surely this has to be what GoHS is going for?Nope, really missed the mark on that one. Normally alongside this large chaos in the background, you’d get a more focused character conflict in the foreground. GoHS does attempt to maintain this balance but fails to derive anything meaningful from its convoluted context. This show is so hell-bent on one-upping itself in its lunacy because it barely gives the audience any reason to care about the characters experiencing these events. What then occurs is a perpetuating cycle where the crazy plot has to compensate for its shallow character interactions by going all-in on its silly ideas, further sidelining the cast and making their appearances on-screen comedically asinine. They didn’t even make this magic system a new hurdle for our already-OP heroes to overcome; each of them master their abilities roughly two episodes after these powers were formally introduced. Jin grows so quickly capable that he can perfectly replicate new combat moves after seeing them performed once. None of this makes sense to me, nor do I have any incentive to care. In Episode 9 Han’s entire arc was to get anxious over the missing Jin, getting ready to leave the stadium in search of him, getting jumped in the bathroom by a crazy competitor who picks a fight, getting kissed by that same lunatic, and forgetting why he was about to leave the stadium in the first place. The main cast’s importance to the story is cut-down to the point where most attempts to give them screen time are plain stupid. I made a comparison with Eva earlier, and that’s a story that knew how to balance its “macro” lore with its “micro” internal conflict. There was a thematic and symbolic interplay between these ideas, making them important in the grand scheme of things. May I ask how introducing “Charyeok,” Jojo Stands/Personas, ancient relics, a stereotypical cult, clones a la “The Matrix,” the Sharknado villain, CGI Buddha & King Kong falling out of the sky, and teddy-bear-laser-guns are important or meaningful in any way?If the idiom warns against “having your cake and eating it too,” GoHS buys out the whole damn bakery and goes just about bankrupt in its self-indulgence. It simultaneously wants to be a goofy action anime and a more serious show. It wants to tell you how powerful friendship can be without putting in the legwork to making that relationship look remotely convincing. It tries to be this overstuffed blockbuster while falling comically short of having its disparate elements say anything. This whole review I’ve asked what the point of GoHS is, and the only answer I’m satisfied with is that it’s a glorified commercial. A soulless adaptation speedrunning through the highlights of its source material. This series feels about as haphazardly paced as the live-action anime remakes we as a community have come to detest. Both give off the impression that they’re checking off corporate boxes, well-aware that none of what you’re seeing makes any semblance of sense unless you read the manhwa. This approach to storytelling means that even the few strong moments in the series are tainted by the suspicion that what you’re watching is just another “item on the list.” These are quite heated accusations to lob at the show, but all signs point to this mismanagement of story. Why else would this single-cour attempt to adapt more chapters (roughly 100) than most 23-episode seasons, when just the first arc alone could have been enough for viewers to get invested for the long-term?Tl;Dr:God of High School is an action-packed extravaganza. If you’re willing to invest your time under those grounds alone, go for it; but don’t expect the show to do anything else. GoHS got the “live-action anime remake” treatment; with its horrible pacing, laughable drama and two-dimensional characters. As much as GoHS puts in admirable effort into making its fight scenes some of the best you’ll witness all-year, the team behind the project can’t quite erase the fact that it has “READ THE MANHWA” written all over it in bright bold letters. There is reason to believe that this was a corporate cash-grab, but with an abysmal second half the show fails at being a commercial too. Because having sat through this painfully stupid anime, I’m now even less likely to give the WebToon a read. 4/10~STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):-- ^Actually, I take that back. Han actually DOES beat the shit out of Mira in Ep 4, leaving her heavily injured and unconscious. While this story choice does lead to the only good arc in the show, I find it uncomfortable how quickly the three swept this under the rug and moved on. No one in the group ever acknowledges the fact that one of them almost murdered another. I guess whatever happens in the ring, stays in the ring? Yikes.-- The BIGBANG segment is the Korean knockoff of ""Big Shot"" from Cowboy Bebop.-- I’ve heard a lot of people saying that GoHS was pulling a “Tower of God,” and I don’t think that comparison is fair. Whilst ToG could be pretty hard to follow, it handled its worldbuilding far better than GoHS ever did. Having seen both WebToon adaptations so far fall below expectations is something to worry about, so here’s hoping Crunchyroll keeps its act together for Noblesse.-- “How you do drama or how you create tension… it’s very different in anime versus manga… so how do we make it so that people won’t get confused when they get into it? And how do we not lose certain aspects of the story that really mattered?” Joseph Chou, producer of GoHS12 episodes in and I don’t think either of us have the answer.-- BEST GIRL: Maybe Seungah. A lot of the secondary characters felt like clones really, but she seemed pretty wholesome.-- That’s it from me! This review was admittedly more harsh than others I’ve shared so far. But I hope that, unlike the show, the points came across clearly.

Here's why:First the ost, op and eds: they in contrary to popular belief a total letdown and not harmoniously made to make it feel a refreshing anime at all.The story: this show even the comic has so little content of storytelling. Its more of an illustration of edgelords trying to outdo one another. Typical GoD comicCharacters: badly designed and poorly executed in the showAnimation and art: here we see how much Dedicated points...the studio has for this edgelords showoffs. Not a Great Balance!Nothing else much to say but just stop with this adaption of oversaturated and stale manhwas. They are not worth a mint of effort to begin with. the studio has for this edgelords showoffs. Not a Great Balance!Nothing else much to say but just stop with this adaption of oversaturated and stale manhwas. They are not worth a mint of effort to begin with."", 'The God of High School, the newest action anime to grace the world and (to my knowledge) the second Manhwa adaption after Tower of God. This, like many other animes of the same genre in recent memory, has had super, almost mind-blowing animation, but a subpar plot.Let\'s start off with the worst parts and save the best for last.Story: 3I have not read the manhwa so it may change further in but the story falls under a specific pattern that a relatively good amount of tournaments fall under (Sponsors doing bad stuff, protag tries to win to stop them, a bunch of one-off characters)...Our three characters rise the ranks while developing friendship along the way. That\'s it.Characters: 3Jin, our protag, is an excitable hungry high schooler that\'s really good at fighting and always wants to fight stronger opponents. Yu is the girl who won\'t admit it but likes the protag. And Han is the quiet one. There isn\'t really much personality to the last two and Jin\'s character has been done more times than I sighed whenever anyone said anything. But those are really the only characters that really matter right now.Art: 9MAPPA, like with most shows they do, does an extraordinary job with the animation here. Its smooth and feels like a lot of love and hard work was put into it. Fights feel fluid and you can tell where the characters are relative to each other.Sound: 8As a big fan of dubstep and techno music, the op, ed, and ost feel really good to listen to. Every song feels like it fits the situation it\'s being played in and the overall ""feel"" of the show.Enjoyment: 5Despite my ripping on this show for like half this review. I will say that the show isn\'t unwatchable. This show doesn\'t make me want to stop watching. Although fights in anime aren\'t my thing they are done pretty well here. I have a feeling I would have liked it more if I was unfamiliar with tournaments in anime or just action anime in general. So if this is your first, you\'re gonna like this a lot more than I am.Overall: 4In summary. The animation and music make this show bearable to an extent, but that doesn\'t excuse the severe lack of a good story or characters that have been done to the ground.I really want to like this and I hope it picks itself off the ground somewhere in the future.

Likely due to the fact that they tried to fit 100 plus chapters of a Manhwa into a 13 ep anime, it really sets itself up for failure. Though the fights and animation are god tier, as expected, so that's a redeeming quality. I feel like this show was only made to hype and please Manhwa readers, though it succeeded at the hype it failed miserably in the latter. Manhwa readers are most definitely pissed with this sub par adaptation. "", 'Crunchyroll´s aggressive marketing did it again. And I was actually disappointed. You surely also watched the first two episodes and thought “Wait what? What is this? I love it!” And yes, animation was freaking awesome. They really made awesome fights, with incredible dynamism and excitement, and made us thing this series could be the next 10 (Masterpiece) shonen. The problem was… exactly that… there is nothing else on the series.Characters were ok, not gonna lie. But they maintained a minimum acceptable level (barely). We are shown character backgrounds that are completely irrelevant. They try to give a story to, for example, rivals that we will...see for ten minutes top, while the actual point of the story is lost in the way. I only found Jin´s backstory as acceptable, being actually well done and showing us why he is like that. Sadly, it doesn´t happen with the rest of the story. Sad.If we have to talk about sound, Contradiction is a complete BANGER. One of the best Ops of the season without a doubt. Also the ED, Win, is a great song and pleasant to listen. The fact they are both sung in English maybe winks us to anime globalization (and adapting foreign novels and stories? Yes please). I think I never actually skipped any of them.It´s an actually enjoyable series to watch 20 minutes per week, so I can´t say I got bored. Really nice and sometimes funny.Episode 11 update: Now the series lost the great animation. There´s nothing else in here. It´s like going to the Velez Sarsfield Stadium but there is no Luis Miguel or Pumas in there.Story: 3/10Art: 8/10Sound: 8/10Character: 5/10Enjoyment: 6/10Overall: 5/10Should you watch it?

That was God of High School for me.This review will have some spoilers, but not that this is a hindrance, since the anime itself is a mess and exposing everything it has does not imply anything in the public\'s entertainment.I started to see the July season two months late, with Peter Grill and Gibiate.  I soon had two disappointments, with works that missed more than they got right.  I went through a ""rest"" time and came back just now.  Still ... It was a waste...of time to see GOH.However, let\'s start talking a little about the beginning, which was what held me most to finish the work.  GOH tells the story of Jin Mori and his future friends, Mira and Han Dae-wi, who enter the most anticipated tournament in the world, The God of High School, which gives the anime its name.  The proposal is interesting from the beginning: whoever wins will have any wish granted by the event leaders (Where have I seen this? Tower of God?).I really felt a good taste to start the work.  She seemed to be very entertaining and focused on high quality tournaments and matches, both strategic and lively.  And here we have a giant problem in GOH.  The animation works, it is well worked at all times, with few errors.  But strategy is a factor that I want to pay special attention to.GOH failed in its own powers, consequently failing in the way the struggles developed over time.  In the beginning we have students, with acceptable and even well balanced powers.  But when the work started to emit the powers in a more exaggerated way, I was feeling discomfort.It\'s not like Kimetsu no Yaiba, who uses his breath for power, nor Hunter x Hunter, who has Nen as his main source of power.  In both works we have a fanciful way of presenting the power of the world to the public, but that does not harm the plot itself, since there is a sense, a faithful understanding in most cases and that knows how to maintain its limits of creation.However in GOH, we see a mess without proportions (I repeat, NO PROPORTIONS).First, we have the introduction of stands, through the green-haired Commissioner, who fights with Jin Mori.  At first I didn\'t criticize it, it seemed like an attractive and cool idea.  But as the limits were broken, I gave up giving the anime a chance.  Gods, Kitsunes, ancient cultural references, animals, weapons, fighting styles, apuncture, a key that unleashes even more powers, unexplained physical energy, among others.  All of this mentioned above intensifies with the field of diversities regarding strength and its origins.  In many cases, the characters don\'t even know the source of their powers.  And yet, they evolve in a convenient way, during fights, as if that doesn\'t bother everyone.Going back to the little bit of existing history, the second part of the anime focuses on a confrontation between the group called NOX and the leaders of the event.  NOX plans to use their powers to annihilate those who idolize other gods and entities.  Another serious problem: there is no rationale for what they really want.  It is literally a boring and useless exposition of something that, instead of being created with the aim of following the story, made it less and less attractive.I don\'t know if it was the way the anime was created, or if the problem already exists in the web manga, but I certainly had a deep sadness at having this incredible loss of potential created.  An anime that came to start the legacy of the morning with Tower of God, was a disappointment, for not knowing how to handle even those who watch it.And as if that were not enough, we have a mess in the city, where more Gods and Entities are shown.  The ending actually got it right in showing the origins of Jin Mori\'s power, in addition to what really is the key (and its bearer), but all of that should have been better presented earlier.  The protagonist\'s own search for his grandfather and his training with a wise man are cut short, turning the story that would keep the anime into widespread fights of unlimited powers.Finally, GOH was a bad anime that I liked.  I don\'t completely reject your experience, but you can\'t deny that this beginning was nothing more than promotional videos for a future that is yet to come.  Let\'s see if the chaos will subside and if anything will be resolved.  For now, my anger and a night\'s sleep is lost with this beautiful popular work of 2020. of time to see GOH.However, let\'s start talking a little about the beginning, which was what held me most to finish the work.

However, after 4 episodes, I got super disappointed seeing the speed they are going.Usually, in other shonen there are too many fillers, but this is the complete opposite, which isn't better since you don't have time to meet and care for the protagonist.This is something the manhwa does a lot better, but it seems they want to put a full arc in 13 episodes, which is too much.If you like the concept, read the manhwa.

I have not watched since the time of the anime. From the first episode is enthusiastic. I liked the acquaintance of the characters in the first episode. The story of the anime is a high school that includes supernatural strength and martial arts. And whoever wins in the competition will get the wish he wants. Events from the beginning of the seventh episode, I think the high school competition ended and the national competition began, bringing together a lot of countries. I liked drawing and animation. Frankly, the studio was creative at this point,...but I did not like the acceleration of events. I wanted the anime story to be approximately 24 episodes. I think that 13 episodes were not enough for some People and me to understand the rest of the events well but I did not like the acceleration of events.

It's predictable, jumps straight into action, the main character has no character develpment, he's way too cocky and you just know he's going to win every single time.

Just watch some highlights on youtube instead.The sole reason why I picked up this anime is that I highly adore MAPPA since Dororo. To give some background. this is an adaption of a Korean webtoon of the same name. This and Tower of God, both, are pretty popular on webtoons and possibly why Crunchyroll picked up both for an adaptation. And boy was it a trainwreck. It was quite evident from the start that they were in it just for cash grabbing their popularity. From here on out I literally have zero expectations from them and...will try to avoid them at all cost.Now on to the adaptation.Story: 2Don't bother with it. Anime did a very poor job in laying out the worldbuilding. Everything is so fast-paced that you just have to accept whatever is happening. You can't question it because everything changes in literal seconds and there is no background given. 90% of the whole series is just people fighting. Although, it's not like MAPPA didn't try. They had to cover 100+ webtoon chapters in 13 episodes, so all they could do was add some very condensed bits n pieces here and there to give some context. But trust me, it doesn't work. It's only when I read the first chapter in webtoon I realized how many cuts they had to make. So yeah, don't expect any plot at all here.Art & Sound: 10Beautiful. This is the only reason I watched it. But again, for you just go watch some highlights and don't waste your time.Character: 1You resonate more with an anime when you understand the characters. Their background, motives, developments etc. If any of this is done correctly anime become 10x better. But none of that exists here. There is some background given here and there somewhere in that 10% which doesn't really work. Development is absolutely zero. All characters except main protagonists have no motives (at least in the anime).Overall: 5It's a bad anime. But I am giving it 5 because it's a bad anime with really good animations and I don't want to leave it out. Definitely looking forward to more of MAPPA's work. will try to avoid them at all cost.Now on to the adaptation.Story: 2Don't bother with it.

Also I didn't read the webtoon.Story:The story is garbage. It's terribly paced. I've actually never seen a story as badly paced as this one. It's almost like each episode is its own season. There's nothing good to say about the story. Poorly paced, badly written (from what I've witnessed with the anime), and jumps all over the place.Art:I like the art. It's not amazing but it is certainly good enough....Sound:I like the sound for the most part. I like the OP but it doesn't really match well with the OP video. Voice acting is decent as well, no weirdly voiced characters.Character:Closely related to story development. AKA garbage. It is only episode 4 at the time of this review but these characters are acting like Gon and Killua 80 episodes into HxH.

Not having read any before, I was curious as to how they could differentiate from manga and how they could be translated into anime. However, after having finished Tower of God and giving The God of High School a few episodes, I don't think I will be looking into manhwa anytime soon, at least into the anime adaptations of such.Considering that my concept of the show is created by what is solely portrayed in the anime adaptation, I still recognize that the manhwa itself...could be a lot better in terms of story-telling. Still, my point of view of the series is that from only having watched the anime.Story: 2/10When it comes to the story, you can grab a tournament arc from any other shōnen, put it into a blender along with some mediocre characters and you will have The God of High School. Even though there is an obvious underlying plot that relates to the power system of the series, the fact that the central plot revolves around a literal UFC fighting tournament with high schoolers using crappy super powers takes away any interest that could have been built around such. I don't mind shows that require you to turn off your brain to actually enjoy them like JJBA or Kaguya, but The God of High School takes itself too seriously to even do so.Art: 7/10The best part of the anime is most likely the art, sadly in this case it just makes it another show that puts all of its effort in making fights visually appealing. I've looked over a few chapters of the manhwa and its cool how the animators manage to keep the art style of the author fresh while properly translating it to anime. Fight scenes are clean with good visuals, but it almost feels like the anime acknowledges that fights are its only strong point as its pretty obvious most of the budget goes into the 5 minute fight from every episode and then average animation is used for the rest.Sound: 6/10Despite the sound is mostly what you'd expect it to be, the OST manages to sneak in a few tracks that stand out. It is not usual to hear EDM in anime so I felt it was pretty original in that sense.Character: 3/10The characters are as cliche as they can get. Jin wants to fight because he wants to become stronger. Mira wants to defend her family's honor. Daewi wants to save his bedridden friend. The main cast is composed of refurbished shit that you can see in pretty much any other shōnen except it works even worse as the show itself doesn't even attempt to create a setting/plot that tries to reel in the audience. Outside of the main cast there are a few characters that look interesting but practically all of the screen time is used on the previously mentioned trio so it feels like they are the only participants of the tournament.Enjoyment: 4/10Even though the characters are mainly one-dimensional and the plot is truly just the tournament itself the anime can still be semi-enjoyable due to the fights that are part of it. The fights tend to be pretty fast paced and keep you entertained while they last. Aside from that, however, there isn't anything that would keep you excited for the next episode.Overall: 4/10If you are looking for a show that has visually appealing fights and ONLY such then I would recommend watching The God of High School. Otherwise all you're gonna get is a pretty lackluster tournament anime which fails to even bring up a cast of characters that you would like to follow as the show progresses. Any other popular shōnen might not provide you with fights animated as well as the ones seen in The God of High School, but at least they will provide you with content for the remaining 15 minutes of the episode. could be a lot better in terms of story-telling.

The fights tend to be pretty fast paced and keep you entertained while they last. Aside from that, however, there isn't anything that would keep you excited for the next episode.Overall: 4/10If you are looking for a show that has visually appealing fights and ONLY such then I would recommend watching The God of High School. Otherwise all you're gonna get is a pretty lackluster tournament anime which fails to even bring up a cast of characters that you would like to follow as the show progresses. Any other popular shōnen might not provide you with fights animated as well as the ones seen in The God of High School, but at least they will provide you with content for the remaining 15 minutes of the episode."", 'Jesus, talk about all fish and no barrelThis is not an anime, this is an overhyped, underwhelming series of shitty generic characters, plotlines and excuses, a mishmash of idiocy that wouldve been directed by michael bay if every female character had to have a wet tshirt scene.The plot is impossible to explain in a review, it moves to one trend to another like an ADHD manchild and somehow only keeps the worst parts of anshounen seriesWant an annoying ""quirky"" goofball main character that becomes unfarily op with no effort?

The story reveals itself as it goes on and gets better with each episode. I started this series and gave it a 6, however after each episode I was progressively starting to enjoy the show more and the amazing art! The beginning is seemingly simple and not that outstanding, but it does become way more than the simplicity it seemed. The characters brought in and the dark tones with an intriguing art style make this show all the more lovable. The story stays consistently positive in most cases and makes you feel good...while watching. The designs for the many abilities displayed in this anime are very exciting! I really recommend a watch of The God of High School, you won't regret its freshness and 2020 appeal. while watching. The designs for the many abilities displayed in this anime are very exciting!

As an anime-only, the story has to get a 1/10. The dreadful development is only tolerable because the animation is amazing. Some of the best fights I have seen animated in the last few years for sure.However, what is the point of good fight scenes when:1. Skill progression makes no sense.2. Extremely poor development on antagonists.3. Lack of background on all abilities/moves/powerups coming into play.GOHS could have been really good with slower pacing (and more episodes) however I guess that would have meant lower quality as the budget is spread out more.I actually don't...even mind watching some fast paced, mindless fighting and I'm a huge fan of tournament arcs in anime but wow, this took it way way overboard. Episode 12 in particular was 20 minutes of what the fuck. even mind watching some fast paced, mindless fighting and I'm a huge fan of tournament arcs in anime but wow, this took it way way overboard.

My god does the anime just gut the story of the webtoon. Compared to the webtoon, the anime does a really poor job of telling why these characters are fighting for. Most of the plot from the anime (if it even has a plot) you have to piece together yourself and make assumptions on what the plot even is and in between episodes.Art 10/10. The best thing about this show is the art. Animation is fluid and you can feel the impact when two characters are dueling it out. I know a lot of...people don't like who the character's nose and ears are red but that doesn't bother me. Characters look crisp and clean.Sound 7/10. The OP and the ED are some of my favorite things to listen to now. From the hype opening to grab you into the show and the peaceful ending to know that it is over. For the OST, I find it forgettable.Character 3/10. The only points I can give to character is that Yu and Han have a backstory that drives them to join the G.O.H. It's not the best but it at least gives us somewhat of an explanation and a slight backstory.Enjoyment 5/10. The action and the fighting are an absolute beauty in the show and that's all about it. It feels like a lot of key parts of the plot is missing (cause it is missing) and when you go into the next episode, it feels like you missed one but turns out you didn't.Overall 4/10. If you want fast paced and exciting action, it's a watch. If you want actual plot structure and actual weight on why these characters are fighting for, read the webtoon. Imagine trying to to put the lego death star set into a match box, you can't fit every piece in it so you have to leave some out. That's what it feels like when you are watching this show.TLDR: The anime is a poor imitation of the webtoon.

After all, not all anime advertise the same point where they pull out all of its stops. Take Hunter x Hunter for example which arguably doesn\'t move on from being good to a masterpiece until it\'s in its 40\'s. Sometimes the writer can also improve like in Sword Art Online. Other times, a series can have an amazing first 3 episodes only to fall off later on.I think the argument being made here is that after 3...episodes, you should have a good idea of how well the characters or story will become in the future. If the way something is written in the first 3 episodes pisses you off to no end then the show will most likely continue to piss you off later on, spiraling out of control as the series\'s past mistakes start piling on each other and compounding until each little mistake becomes a giant pile of crap. That\'s the feeling that I got when watching the first 5 episodes of God of Highschool.Keep in mind that I haven\'t read the God of High School manwa. You can give the TOG argument about how the manwa is so much better (if it is) but this is an anime review for the anime.Story: 2 / 10I just want to get this out of the way: throwing all of the characters into a ring and telling them to beat each other up within 10 minutes of the first episode is NOT a good plot. Why would anyone start a series that way? Where is the build-up? Where is the gradual release of power scaling, the power system, the setting, and the characters? Where is the introduction of the tournament, why it\'s being done, and how it works? Most importantly, where is the RESTRAINT? I\'m going to bring up HxH again but imagine if the first arc of HxH was the 2-minute hunter exam that Killua partook in during Greed Island instead of the actual first arc that took over 20 episodes. The examiner forgoes all of the tests of wit, of spirit, of passion, of teamwork, and just throws them in a room to fight until one person is left standing. We would\'ve never gotten the introduction to the otherworldly powers of Nen, the characters and their dynamics with each other, how the existence of the exam affected the world around it, a brilliant showing of what it takes to become a hunter, and the implementation of a cast that would become important later on.I realize that I shouldn\'t expect that in just 5 episodes of screentime, but I also realize that by jumping the tournament ahead so quickly and revealing everyone\'s abilities within 10 seconds of one another, the show killed any subtle momentum it had going for it. Like I said, it\'s because this show has no restraint. They just want to get to the ""good part"" where bodies are flying in tornados as sakuga blitzes through the screen in a furry of limbs. The freaking Pokemon anime has more tact than this.The actual premise of the show has potential, I\'ll admit that. It just sucks that half the potential it had was killed so early on. Not ruining every dreg of potential it had in the first 5 episodes is nothing to brag about. However, that deserves some credit which is why I didn\'t give it a 1 / 10. At the same time, based on following the trend of how this anime has been handling its story so far, I can\'t give it any higher than 2 / 10. People are only watching for the fight scenes and the ones creating this anime know it.Characters: 1 / 10The only characters worth talking about so far are the main three since all the side characters are pretty much garbage. Mori is about as generic shounen protagonist as you can get. He wants to ""get stronger"" by ""battling more people,"" he has a half-assed ""rivalry"" with one of the recruits that is teased and hyped up way more than it really deserves, he\'s ""kind-hearted"" to the point of influencing other people with talk-no-jutsu, he\'s overpowered, he has some deep dark unknown nine-tailed fox / son of Dragon / descendant of Vongola Primo / actually just god heritage, and his goal is to ""chase his grandfather."" You see what I mean? There is absolutely nothing unique about him. And that would be fine and dandy if the execution of his character was genuine and heartfelt, but the anime loves doing this thing where all of his big moments get shrouded by either slapstick humor or manly shounen hype.Don\'t even get me started on Mira. She\'s infuriating. That\'s the best way I can describe her. Remember back in the early 2000\'s when anime were rampant with girls who scream at a spilled drop of milk, blamed everyone for their own mistakes, and were so violent with the males around her that it\'s borderline assault / murder yet the series played them off as being ""strong female tsundere protagonists / waifus""? Yeah. She\'s that girl-- that troupe that\'s been outdated for at least 10 years now. In episode 2, she slapped Mori and cut off her friendship with him after he dropped her sword in the river. But here\'s the kicker: it was HER freaking fault that he dropped it because she was doing her violent tsundere shtick. He even apologized right away and said he\'d go get it for her. Let\'s not forget how she BROKE his NECK in the previous episode when he was just trying to help her. She literally killed him. Then she has the gal to wear a short skirt to a freaking fighting tournament but blames other guys, calling them ""perverts"" for seeing her underwear when she kicks it up in the middle of a move. Is she just incredibly dumb or am I missing something here?And I swear, the anime lasted THREE EPISODES, a whole THREE before pulling a waifu and putting her in some girly outfit to show how feminine and cute she can be. Look, this isn\'t anything new. If there\'s a headstrong tomboy character then by law of anime, she\'s going to be put in a frilly doll outfit at some point. But I thought the series would at least know to wait until she actually does anything of significance as testament to her ""tsun"" side before baiting people in with her ""dere"" side. This is what I meant about the story having absolutely zero restraint. I can\'t stand female characters like her. This is a long rant but honestly, I was initially willing to bear with the mediocre writing and watch another 5 episodes to see where it went but Mira was the one who convinced me to drop the anime.The saving grace of this disastrous cast is most definitely Daewi. At first, he comes off as the silent cool guy with a heart of gold. He\'s trying to earn enough money to support his best friend who\'s in the hospital. It\'s generic, it\'s bland, it\'s forced. So I appreciated the twist that his character took later on. However, the change was WAY too abrupt and unbelievable. They could\'ve gone down the route of having his character gradually break so then when he reconciles with Mori, it\'d feel more natural since they would\'ve spent more time together and they both would\'ve had time to grow apart. But OF COURSE because the anime doesn\'t know what restraint is and has to play all its cards in the beginning, it\'s resolved within an episode. So Daewi is pretty much only as good as the worst character-of-the-day in a show like Avatar or One Piece. I think it says a lot about the character writing in this show when he\'s the least badly written out of everyone so far.Art: 7 / 10It\'s Mappa. The animation is great and the only reason why this series is getting as much praise as it is and why my score for this anime isn\'t in the absolute trash level. For gosh\'s sake though, what is with that shaky camera? It didn\'t work in movies, why would they think it would work in anime? I feel nauseous watching some of the fights. I can\'t tell what is happening sometimes. However, I do commend them for trying something more dynamic. If the fighting animation was garbage, I can\'t imagine a lot of people caring about this generic shounen adaptation at all.On the other hand, the character designs and background images are bland. This feels like a reverse Tower of God. TOG had pretty horrible animation but great character designs, personalities, and gorgeous backgrounds. GOH has amazing animation but no substance in any of its designs to back it up.Sound: 4 / 10There\'s not much I have to say about the sound. I find the opening grating on the ears. The only other standout track for me so far is the sad ""woe is me"" OST that was playing after Mira slapped Mori and was being angst in the river as badly cut flashbacks of her past blinked in the background. So yes, the only two tracks I remember are the ones that I hated. I\'m still giving it a 4 because the other songs are pretty unobtrusive.Enjoyment: 3 / 10This is the part that gets me. Contrary to popular relief, I did not go into this anime hoping to review-bomb it. I never looked at its score, read any information about it aside from the introductory summary, or interacted with the fandom at all when I started the series. It was almost comical how my bright-eyed excitement when Mori first shot out of bed and was chasing the thief with amazing animation slowly died out with every minute of this show that passed. I genuinely decided to drop this anime of my own volition.Once again, the fight scenes are entertaining enough. I suppose if you don\'t get car-sick easily, watching people punch each other is satisfying. You\'re best skipping any of the scenes that don\'t involve adrenaline-packed shaky cam recorded beat downs. I know that I was tired of any non-fight scenes already by episode 2 simply because of how badly written they were. Even then, don\'t expect any substance, strategy, or emotional tension in the fights either.Overall: 3 / 10If you like this anime, you like it. I didn\'t. I really don\'t know if I\'ll ever try to pick this show back up. episodes, you should have a good idea of how well the characters or story will become in the future. If the way something is written in the first 3 episodes pisses you off to no end then the show will most likely continue to piss you off later on, spiraling out of control as the series\'s past mistakes start piling on each other and compounding until each little mistake becomes a giant pile of crap.

But OF COURSE because the anime doesn\'t know what restraint is and has to play all its cards in the beginning, it\'s resolved within an episode. So Daewi is pretty much only as good as the worst character-of-the-day in a show like Avatar or One Piece. I think it says a lot about the character writing in this show when he\'s the least badly written out of everyone so far.Art: 7 / 10It\'s Mappa. The animation is great and the only reason why this series is getting as much praise as it is and why my score for this anime isn\'t in the absolute trash level. For gosh\'s sake though, what is with that shaky camera? It didn\'t work in movies, why would they think it would work in anime? I feel nauseous watching some of the fights. I can\'t tell what is happening sometimes. However, I do commend them for trying something more dynamic. If the fighting animation was garbage, I can\'t imagine a lot of people caring about this generic shounen adaptation at all.On the other hand, the character designs and background images are bland. This feels like a reverse Tower of God. TOG had pretty horrible animation but great character designs, personalities, and gorgeous backgrounds. GOH has amazing animation but no substance in any of its designs to back it up.Sound: 4 / 10There\'s not much I have to say about the sound. I find the opening grating on the ears. The only other standout track for me so far is the sad ""woe is me"" OST that was playing after Mira slapped Mori and was being angst in the river as badly cut flashbacks of her past blinked in the background. So yes, the only two tracks I remember are the ones that I hated. I\'m still giving it a 4 because the other songs are pretty unobtrusive.Enjoyment: 3 / 10This is the part that gets me. Contrary to popular relief, I did not go into this anime hoping to review-bomb it. I never looked at its score, read any information about it aside from the introductory summary, or interacted with the fandom at all when I started the series. It was almost comical how my bright-eyed excitement when Mori first shot out of bed and was chasing the thief with amazing animation slowly died out with every minute of this show that passed. I genuinely decided to drop this anime of my own volition.Once again, the fight scenes are entertaining enough. I suppose if you don\'t get car-sick easily, watching people punch each other is satisfying. You\'re best skipping any of the scenes that don\'t involve adrenaline-packed shaky cam recorded beat downs. I know that I was tired of any non-fight scenes already by episode 2 simply because of how badly written they were. Even then, don\'t expect any substance, strategy, or emotional tension in the fights either.Overall: 3 / 10If you like this anime, you like it. I didn\'t. I really don\'t know if I\'ll ever try to pick this show back up.', 'So I\'m going to keep this short and sweet. Don\'t watch this anime unless you\'re already a fan of the webtoon, and I\'d advise even webtoon readers to proceed with caution since you WILL witness the source material being butchered.To put it simply, the problem lies with the fact that the anime adapts the first ~110 chapters of the webtoon into a mere 13 episode season. I don\'t think I really need to go into much detail on how this is problem, but let\'s just say that ""pacing issues"" is a massive understatement when we\'re talking about the narrative continuity and character development. Just...to give one small example, the anime COMPLETLELY cut the scenes showing why the main protagonist, Jin Mori, even decides to participate in the God of Highschool tournament which is funny because these scenes are literally THE FIRST SCENES YOU READ IN THE WEBTOON. So, if they\'re skipping out on fully explaining the main character\'s backstory and motivations, then you can damn well expect that they do the same with every other character.That being said, there are two reasons that webtoon-readers might enjoy this: the sound/music, and the animation. The music is pretty awesome, and at times it can give off some similar vibes to Samurai Champloo\'s soundtrack. Furthermore, the animation is extremely on point for some of the fights that you see. Granted, a good portion of the fights from the webtoon are either skipped or rushed, BUT the ones that aren\'t are pretty dope to watch. So there\'s that I guess.Just to re-iterate, I really don\'t recommend this anime. It might sound like a meme at this point, but anyone considering watching this should just read the webtoon. It can come off as some generic shounen story-telling, but there\'s nothing necessarily wrong with that especially when you just want to chill and turn off your brain from all the serious shit going on in the world.Story: 3Art: 8Sound: 9Character: 2Enjoyment: 4Overall (average): 5.2 to give one small example, the anime COMPLETLELY cut the scenes showing why the main protagonist, Jin Mori, even decides to participate in the God of Highschool tournament which is funny because these scenes are literally THE FIRST SCENES YOU READ IN THE WEBTOON.

The characters themselves are pretty one dimensional, and what's presented as a martial arts anime quickly transitions into a series about fighting with mystical powers, throwing energy rather than fists. The art itself is decent and the fight scenes, when they use hand-to-hand combat, are well executed. But that's the only positive to this show.GOHS can be summarized as generic shonen battle content.

I've read much of the Manhwa and think that the anime has totally destroyed what was in the manhwa, skipping many scenes and making some of their own.Story: 3The story is straight-forward. There are multiple fighters competing in a fighting competition and the winner will get any of his wish granted. This is not a small-scale tournament as there are fighters winners from each area/zone and they compete with winners of different zones. The anime is set in...the real world yet the fighters have supernatural fighting abilities and powers.Art: 8The art is amazing, animation is fluid although the character designs are a bit weird. There are many fight scenes which are not correctly animated to that of the manhwa.

Nothing special.Characters: 2Now this is the weakest point of GOH. As you progress into the manhwa, you will meet characters left and right, each one with a long name and different abilities, goals, zones, back-stories and such. It is hard to keep track of all the different characters. They are also very disposable as most of them act as fodder and waste for the progression of the manhwa. The main cast is also made up of very annoying and generic characters. Jin-Mori is an annoying version of Goku. Yuu Mi-ra is a very hate-able character as so many of her choices and actions are stupid.

After being coerced by some friends to give it a shot again to see if my view has changed (given myself growing a little older) I decided to give it another shot. Again, this show has left me with nothing. In fact I think I like it worse than I did earlier.In order to describe my dislike of this series; close your eyes and imagine the most generic fighting show. Now picture...some construction work that is making a ton of noise down the block. Normally, you would be upset as its distracting you from enjoying a series you are really invested in due to the loud noise outside, right? Instead, for this show, you would be well better served taking a camping chair and watching the work being done outside your house. It is generic, and flat out uninteresting trash. In fact I dislike this show enough that I would rather watch another equally trashy show known as ""Isekai cheat magician"" BEFORE I watch this.....I think my main problem is with the delivery of the show and its story. It is formulaic, and lacks any drawing characteristics. I\'ve watched many shows where I was genuinely kept up all night because I wanted to see what would come next. Those shows kept me on my toes. This show lacked that draw in its entirety. In this show they have this really bad habit of bringing up the backstories of characters mere seconds before they lose in a battle. Honestly, what exactly is the point of this? You fail to capture anything regarding the character before crushing their dreams. That is something even DBZ does a little bit better. Coupled with the predictable nature of the fighting scenes, I knew who was going to win from the second that the fight started. Once again, its like watching DBZ, knowing that Goku is going to win almost every fight and never loses. Jin is very much the same. Also what is with Jin all of a sudden becoming this omnipotent god? He starts from being strong, to becoming pretty much unstoppable, and with no effort being placed in at all. It makes zero sense.Next the art style is actually pretty good, so I\'ll give them SOME credit; but once again being a generic show they did not get great use out of it. Honestly the same could be said of the soundtrack, which wasn\'t that bad either, but coupled with a bad storyline it serves no point.To be fair with this review I will mention I have only watched this anime and I didn\'t read any material, but this poor showing actually makes it where I\'m not interested or invested in any way to find out how this story ends.Being that this is one of the first few Crunchyroll exclusives, I honestly thought they would put on more of a performance, but I was sorely wrong. I guess it goes to show that CR is mainly focused on getting our money instead of putting on a good show like Tower of God. Can\'t say I\'m all too surprised either....In any event save your time doing something productive instead of watching this garbage.

The issues that the manhwa came across for about a third of its chapters was that the story-telling...was all over the place, the pacing often being slower than fast. I was on the verge of giving up on the manhwa but slowly trudged through anyways. That being said, the story-telling and pacing has drastically improved, with the sixth part/season of the manhwa being some of the best things I\'ve read in a while. The author, slowly but surely, improved and has become someone that I can respect.When I learned an anime of this was going to be released, I was ecstatic, as this gave the story a chance to rectify itself: It would be able to alter the dreadfully slow pacing of the first few parts, while still giving it the detail that it deserved. As I learned that the anime was only going to have 13 episodes, and it was supposed to cover all of season 1 in the manhwa (which is about 100 chapters..), AND after seeing how they handled Tower of God, (which, compared to this was amazing, but in reality also did not give the series justice), I was afraid.My fears were confirmed, as, again, the pacing was all over the place. This time, however, the pacing was far too quick, having literal arcs be covered in 1-2 episodes. Characters that would have chapters of development would be brushed upon, and while the main cast, in the manhwa, weren\'t that developed in its first season, the anime pushes this lack of development to its utter limits by having them feel like cardboard cutouts of archetypes and shounen stereotypes, more then just characters that could have more development. I feel like episode 10 was meant to be the equivalent to Demon Slayer\'s 19th episode, as they both gave off similar vibes: high stakes, great music, an almost theatrical performance, and yet one masterfully delivers whilst the other painfully disappoints. Why, you may ask? Because the build-up, and the explanations of what as going on was non-existent. My friends, who did not read the source material, were completely lost, and were unable to feel a smudge of joy from what was being shown. This is the first time I\'ve ever heard them say ""I don\'t know what\'s even going on"", and it truly is disappointing.Their goal of pushing forth a new era of anime through flashy visuals and amazing fight scenes have failed due to their utter ignorance and lack of a single thought in the actual story and pacing.

Also, is the first time that i do a review so is a little short that i want it but i think that reflect my opinion about this anime very well.Well, the series had potential, but unfortunately everything fell apart when they decided to start moving forward in the story without any kind of explanation, that is, practically, everything that happens since chapter 4 or 5 more or less is an epic moment after another but without any explanation of why that happens. This...leaves the characters very empty and you do not feel any empathy with them and with what happens to them with the passage of the chapters. This turns those epic moments into mere parts in which it is seen as a character wins a power up completely out of nowhere.If I talk about secondary characters, things are even worse. The secondary in this series do not have any development. Characters like Park Mujin, the ""referees"" (that\'s how they call themselves, at least in the spanish subs) or the man with the hat who appears dancing in the last chapters (who has so little participation in the series that I don\'t even know his name) are not different from the Generic characters that appear among the public or the weak fighters who are defeated in 2 hits. I even have to say that the main characters, Jin Mori, Daewi and Mira, are not well done and their charyeok come out because yes and in 5 seconds they already dominate them as if they had had it all their lives.For the animation part I have to say that in this case it is totally great, a great animation in the fights where each punch and kick has a great intensity and power, the battles have a good direction and the soundtrack accompanies (although I will talk about this more further on), also, no much CGI has been used which makes them much more remarkable and good for the eyes, without a doubt this is the strong point of the series.In terms of sound I have to say that it is fine, the soundtrack, created by Arisa Okehazama, complies but it is nothing to write home about as the Fate Zero or Shingeki no Kyojin soundtracks are, however it is well used and there is a good variety of songs. As for the opening I like it even though I\'m not a fan of electronic music and the ending is a meh. The voice acting is very good, as always Japan above the rest of the world in this section.Rounding out a bit, GOH is an anime that is good in the technical section and the synopsis suggests that it can be a great series, unfortunately if you don\'t have a good story, it doesn\'t matter how good the animation or soundtrack is, the most important thing, the narrative, ruins and even overshadows all the good of the previous sections.In my humble opinion, this series gets a 3. leaves the characters very empty and you do not feel any empathy with them and with what happens to them with the passage of the chapters. This turns those epic moments into mere parts in which it is seen as a character wins a power up completely out of nowhere.If I talk about secondary characters, things are even worse.

As for the opening I like it even though I\'m not a fan of electronic music and the ending is a meh. The voice acting is very good, as always Japan above the rest of the world in this section.Rounding out a bit, GOH is an anime that is good in the technical section and the synopsis suggests that it can be a great series, unfortunately if you don\'t have a good story, it doesn\'t matter how good the animation or soundtrack is, the most important thing, the narrative, ruins and even overshadows all the good of the previous sections.In my humble opinion, this series gets a 3.', ""The god of High school , an adaptation of a korean manhwa with the same name that got a lot of hype because of crunchyroll's advertisement and some prior readers that hyped it up.i won't say too much about the show to not spoil anything since it's not over yet, but man after watching 7 episodes i thought to myself how can GOH be this awful ? the pacing is garbage and the characters are so goddamn generic ( yes again we have a main character that is going through all this shit just to get stronger apparently).this show makes me want to turn off...my brain because nothing makes any sense , the fights are so predictable and follow a certain pattern that always decides who the winner is ( Aka the special move that no one knows about), but the source of my most frustration is the super powers that they appeared from nowhere and they don't even make sense, sometimes it's just a weapon that is used in a combat,sometimes it's an animal stand-like monster that attacks for whatever reason.the good things about this show are literally animation/sounds and a little bit of comedy here and there that makes me comeback each week for an episode, otherwise i would have dropped it long time ago. my brain because nothing makes any sense , the fights are so predictable and follow a certain pattern that always decides who the winner is ( Aka the special move that no one knows about), but the source of my most frustration is the super powers that they appeared from nowhere and they don't even make sense, sometimes it's just a weapon that is used in a combat,sometimes it's an animal stand-like monster that attacks for whatever reason.the good things about this show are literally animation/sounds and a little bit of comedy here and there that makes me comeback each week for an episode, otherwise i would have dropped it long time ago."", 'Mappa: ""Okay so we are adapting this show where it\'s mostly high-quality action with just enough story and character moments to give the fights some context""Average MAL user after watching: ""IT\'S DUMB.

This show's been one of the most hyped anime this season, and I gotta say, it's a bit disappointing how much this anime falls short of my expectations. While the animation can be impressive in some of the fighting sequences in this shows, it fails to compensate for the sloppy storytelling in this anime adaption. A lot of people are going on about how good this anime is, but it's obvious they're mainly talking about the animation and are...overlooking glaringly obvious flaws. I haven't read the webtoon, but I'll probably give it a try if it's any better than the story in the anime. Let me know if it is.(STORY & CHARACTERS) Like I mentioned earlier, the story is just not very good, and that's my biggest gripe with this show. Usually, I can power through an anime with mediocre writing, but I just couldn't go past episode 4. The show starts with a martial arts tournament high school students are entering in order to have their wishes granted should they win, and we get to learn some of the wishes from our main protagonists—Jin Mori, Dan Hwai, and Yoo Mira. Our trio's personalities seem distinct enough, but their backgrounds are just all a bit cliche. We have the goofy martial arts enthusiast, the young swordsman trying to reignite their dying swordstyle/dojo, and the boy who want to the save their dying friend's life. We've seen it all before, but that wasn't enough for me to drop the show just yet. We start to move away from the tournament and into the lives of our trio, and the story is just nonsensical and way too fast. I get the main point of the show is fighting, but don't focus solely on that at the expense of the storytelling.  It's just leads to laughably bad writing which has been the case in this anime.(ANIMATION & SOUNDTRACK) The best part of this show is its smooth animation and upbeat soundtrack. This anime has an appealing art style that keeps me interested unlike most of the anime being pumped out each season. While it's not the most unique art style, it's definitely not mediocre. Each character design is unique, making it easy to distinguish characters from one another. The fight scenes, as expected, are where the animation stands out the most for me. The fighting choreography is pretty well-done and you can see that each hit has some clear weight when striking characters or the even the environment. It's clear whoever animated the fighting scenes, knows something about martial arts or consulted someone who does. Unfortunately, there are some frames where the animation seems sloppy when contrasted with the well-drawn ones, but is hidden in the fast pace of the fighting sequences. It's clear they passed some of these frames as it grants more fluidity in the movement of the characters, but I feel like more care could have been taken in these scenes when your story already sucks. While the soundtrack does not quite match the quality of the animation, it's  interesting enough.(WRAP UP) Basically, if you're just into an anime with lots of fighting, you'll probably like this show if you just turn your brain off  However, if you're hoping for a compelling story, you won't enjoy this show. I know people keep saying that the story is deep and gets more interesting as the show/webtoon goes on, but I honestly don't care at this point. From what I've seen so far, I don't think this anime adaption is for me. The pacing of this show seems way too fast or maybe the webtoon is just this sloppy.

I see people hating it or loving it for various reasons, some for story, characters , art etc. some people say that story and story elements are generic and some people say it's not as good as it's webtoon.I think the reason for the polarizing review is that people hate or love too much of certain aspects of this show too much and exaggerate it way out of the proportions.Sound/Music - 10For me sound and music was one of the best aspect...of this anime, the opening in amazing and the ending is fine. The osts are really good, enhancing the impact of the scene and are good enough that you can listen them even on their own.Art - 9I personally thought the art was great and the animation amazing with fight scene choreographed impeccably. I have seen people shitting on it's art generally because of blushing nose and ears which even I didn't like much but at the same time it didn't bother me enough to say that the art is bad.Story - 6.5The story is generic and the execution is certainly not the best, the few elements of story we have seen done way better in other animes (for eg Charyeok , concept similar to stands in jojo). I see a lot of people complain about the story but I don't find it absolutely worst , definitely the world building is weak and the title isn't appropriate but I think it does its best to setup action scene for most part which are the real meat and bone of this show. I do definitely think that the world could have been explained better and more context to be given to the things happening in anime to make it more impactful and understandable.Character - 6Now the characters according to me are the weakest part of the series because their is no proper character development given to most of the character besides the main 3 in which I am not the fan of our protagonist Jin Mori and find him not so interesting. Character builds are not great as well but most of the things aren't absolutely horrible either.Enjoyment 7 -Considering the fact that the story is not something new, the world building not very impressive and character development not being most amazing either, I was still able to enjoy god of high school because it's very entertaining and I think achieves what it sets out to do and do them very amazingly, I do understand why people won't like a show like this but at the same time I also think that a lot of criticism it gets in wildly exaggerated. of this anime, the opening in amazing and the ending is fine.

Plot is way too generic and the story is way too rushed for the viewers to get invested in anyway. I don't know how good the source material I.e webtoon is and so maybe I would give it a try but honestly, for how much hype this show generated, it flopped pretty badly for me.The only reason I made it through the 4 episodes is cause I am a...sucker for good animation and the show actually has a pretty great 1st episode. The problem is, it just goes downhill from there. I had a bit of hope that the story would get better but it just keeps rushing and rushing and it was pretty difficult to keep track of everything happening in the 4th episode itself. I might continue to watch it to see where it ends up but it is totally not a show I would ever recommend. sucker for good animation and the show actually has a pretty great 1st episode.

When the previews first started to air, I grew extremely excited for this show. The artstyle looked great, it was being done by MAPPA, and it was the second big adaptations coming from WebToons. Things looked very promising. However, things in actuality fell apart extremely quickly.Story: 1/10The story is abysmal for a myriad of reasons. I didn't read the source material, but my friend that did told me that for the anime they cut a billion things; and it shows, it shows a lot. The first episode is probably the strongest part of this...show. The pacing is fluid in it, the characters are introduced in ways that make sense, and it is enjoyable with both humor and action. That feeling though doesn't last at all. Once we hit the 4th episode, there is a really random and out of place wedding episode? It doesn't really end up having any meaning at all except for like one extremely tiny second long clip later on in the series that makes it feel pointless. But granted, things are still pretty good. Episode 5 hits and they finish the first tournament with a bang, and you think where on Earth can they go from here? Well, funny thing is I'm sure this is also what the writers were thinking. After episode 5, there is a severe nosedive in pacing that is so bad that after episode like, 9 I wanna say; nothing makes ANY sense. You cannot follow a single thing because there are 3 to 5 things happening per episode. Jin gets a training arc, but we never get to see him train and we only see the ending of it? They kind of just throw their god-like superpowers on us in an exposition dump, and then expect us to completely understand the power system in the next episode? Like, really God of High School? The story is so bad that there is a crucial scene in a hospital that our main Jin is in, talking to another character. The building starts to shake and then a really important fight happens that shapes the next 2 episodes, but Jin, who was just in the room talking to the person and is explicitly shown panicking while the building shakes; magically, disappears. They never comment on where he goes. We never find out why he disappears. He just... poofs. This is probably one of the best examples I can find of this show having horrible pacing and a story that just doesn't make sense.Art: 9/10While the story was terrible, the art was actually probably the absolute best thing about this show. The character are extremely nice to look at, besides their like huge noses. The environment is extremely modern looking and adds to a bit of realism (that is of course later broken by the terrible story), but the art is eye candy. Every character looks extremely unique and is easy to distinguish from one another. It just felt good. The animation was easily the best thing about this show. MAPPA really went all out on the animation and it really added to the visual appeal, with imo the best anime fight scenes since One Punch Man.Sounds: 8/10The sound design was pretty good, it enhanced the environments the characters were in and really added to the grit of their punches. The soundtrack was also really strong in this series, giving off a very complimentary hip-hop vibe. Doing dubstep-like music for the opener of the show is bold for anime, but I think it worked out well in their favor this time around, and the outro for the show is very nice to listen to. The voice acting wasn't the most special thing in the world with most of the cast being newcomers, but I still think they all fit their characters very well.Characters: 1/10Besides their designs, these are probably some of the blandest anime characters I've ever seen. Our main character literally just wants to fight people just because, with no motivation at all outside of that really. Han Daewi is at first a very interesting character, but his motivation gets killed in like the 4th episode and after that he becomes an extremely hollow character that's only concerned with friendship. Honestly I feel like Natsu from Fairy Tail is more interesting than Daewi. Out of all the characters, the only one with real motivations is Mira, but she makes questionable decisions and goes on all the time about how she's going to perfect her sword technique but we never see her practice after like episode 4. The entire secondary cast is boring and uninspired. I just don't understand how characters can be so visually appealing, but so incredibly boring.Enjoyment: 4/10I found myself not caring about any of the characters, I ended up not even attempting to follow the story after like episode 10, and I just overall found myself pausing multiple times and taking breaks to get through episodes. The fight scenes made up for it sort of, but you never really care about the fights because you don't care about the characters.Overall: 3/10How this shows script was ever greenlit is beyond me.

On one hand, the animation and fight scenes are top-notch. Seriously, it\'s like watching a martial arts tournament on steroids. The moves are flashy, the battles are intense, and the animation is just quite gorgeous.On the other hand, the pacing can be a bit rough at times. It\'s like the story is in such a hurry to get to the next fight that it forgets to slow down and give the characters a chance to breathe. And speaking of characters, there\'s definitely a lack of development there. Sure, we...get to see their fighting styles and some glimpses of their personalities, but it never feels like we get to know them on a deeper level.One thing that really stands out in this anime is the music.

From the opening theme to the background tracks during fights, the music adds an extra layer of excitement to the already intense action.So, with all that said, I\'d probably give GOH a 6/10.

I don't know what the hell was happening in the later half but I've only met like 2 dudes that could do something like they were doing with the demons or whatever. Looked super cool, but I had no idea what was going on by the end....Fights were dope and reminded me of how I fought a guy from New Jersey at 3 AM outside the Walgreens parking lot.Music went hard (i think):OP bangedED bangedThey got some cool characters at leastJIN MORI GOAT!!!HAN DAEWI GOAT!!!

And I tell you, this first season is just the beginning. It will about to be go even crazier and hype after this.Art and Sound: The anime is so pretty. The animation is smooth and lit! 🔥OSTs...are so amazing specially in episode 5, 10 and 13.Characters: Others say the characters are bland in anime. I cannot relate to them, maybe because I have read the webtoon that I totally understand everything on what is going on. 😂 Jin Mori, Ilpyo and Daewi are badass and adorable characters.Enjoyment: The fast pacing somehow disappoints me, specially when you have read the manhwa...

Yes, It is a fighting anime, but everyone knew that going in, and as far as fighting animes go, the fights are great. They are suspenseful and well choreographed. Another thing we must remember is that goh is part of a larger webtoon, and we can not expect the characters to gain the depth of a larger work through 13 episodes. I think Jin Mori already has depth and will continue to gain more. I appreciate the artwork and the characters and I really love the plot....My favorite part is the animation, and art. I think the characters are beautiful and Jin Mori is wonderfully drawn. I hope everyone watches this. My favorite part is the animation, and art.

However, in my opinion, this show fails to live up to its hype, even though it was carried by MAPPA\'s animation. Let me explain why.Story- This is probably the biggest issue with this anime. The plot is very lacking and is very rushed. I have no idea what they were thinking when they adapted 130+ chapters into 13 episodes, but this is more rushed than the Tower of God....This story would be fine if it just was a tournament arc the whole way around, but they chose to bring in gods and monsters in as well as a cult. The number of characters and lore made this anime convoluted and plenty of things are often unexplained. If they do choose to make a season 2, I wish they would try and explain things better and also adapt less material.Art- This is one of the only reasons I chose to stick with the anime. The fight scenes are amazing and I must give MAPPA lots of credit for this. I think the final fight scene is the best for the Summer 2020 season.Sound- The sound is also quite decent. I like the fact they tried to blend in Korean music for the OST, and the fight scenes were improved because of the battle music. The ED is also incredible, and I have no complaints about the voice acting either.Characters- This here is another major issue with the anime. The anime rushed all the main character\'s backstories and then chose to add in like ten more characters. I think there are three characters that we should discuss. First is Jin Mori. I wanted to like this character, but I really can\'t. Jin is a character that is entirely protected by plot armor, and he is strong not because of his training, but simply because he is himself. It is not rewarding to watch someone get super powerful without struggling for their powers. Other than that, he is loud and obnoxious. Another character is Yoo Mira. I honestly think she isn\'t a bad character, and she does have an interesting backstory, but she is used too little in the story. I quite like her determination and her humor. The final character is Han Daewi, and I also like him a lot. His work ethic and his view on life are intriguing and fun to watch. Other than those three, however, others are barely given a backstory and are used very little. This is understandable because the whole story was crammed into 13 episodes, but that is the problem. You shouldn\'t cram 130+ chapters into 13 episodes, and even out of the three main characters, only Mori\'s backstory is even explored well. There were so many captivating characters like Park Mujin and Park Illpyo, but they were not able to develop well. Even worse, as the story goes on, the story chose to add in around ten more characters, instead of focusing on the ones that already exist. Overall, I want to see better character development in the next season.Enjoyment- I really enjoyed the fight scenes, but the story was too confusing and too rushed. In the end, I only watched it because I wanted to see the fight scenes. However, I liked some of the characters and the ost is also hype.Overall- I don\'t recommend you watch this if you like a good story and character development, but if you are a fan of well-animated fights, then this is the anime for you. I seriously hope the next season will be better, but this one has let me down.

Well I felt like I was doing to much homework trying to enjoy the series.Let me explain.The story is not very original but, being fair there\'s not a lot of originality out there, however that\'s not where I had a problem. My problem begins with how weirdly it is presented. There are several points where a world changing event happens that\'s is a clear indication of the rules of the world the protagonist and by extension us as the audience are yet to learn but their reaction is just ""Huh, weird."" And...its droped!! ITS JUST DROPPED! I can\'t tell you how many threads the first six episodes open (cause there are many) but I can tell you how many they follow... NONE. That\'s what I mean when I say I\'m doing to much homework. After the billionth story thread is opened in the story without furthering any of the existing ones all I can do is open the wiki and try to understand and boy, oh boy does the wiki makes it look fun.Animation-wise I really liked it and the battle although short are pretty entertaining to watch. its droped!!

I have read plenty of Webtoons before, so the thought of what one adapted would play out like, had me attentive. I have read a lot of this webtoon before, though not all of it. Therefore, I had a good grasp of what to expect heading into the animated series. Nevertheless, I gave it all my attention and watched it all as it came out.Firstly, I think that the story for the most part was bland. It’s super cookie cutter. I mean as a webtoon it works quite well because it’s a...webtoon but transcribe that into an anime and I mean it really gets mixed in with the crowd. It has all the typical tropes, so I am not really surprised at all one bit when things happen in the story. I don’t think that it is at all a bad thing though. Sometimes when you know what is going to happen then things feel familiar and therefore it is easier to get into or immerse yourself into the story.The art is kind of weird in a good way. I find the colour scheme and the linework intriguing. It’s like they transcribed the appearance of the webtoon and really went one to one with it. It feels so familiar, and I like it. It’s colourful, and vibrant. It evokes a positive atmosphere to it. Sometimes I do feel like it is lacking in some scenes where I find it too simplistic and therefore it takes away from being immersed in the story, but I am not going to scrutinise the series for it.The characters were truly uninteresting. Everyone is like another character trope that I am all too familiar with and therefore it is hard to like one character. All the characters also feel so series all the time which is something I don’t enjoy. It’s like they are all friends and come across as not being friends at the same time. If I had to pick a character that I liked, then I suppose I would have to pick the main one. I kind of like he’s personality and he’s the main one you really follow I suppose.Where the anime truly shines is when it comes to the fighting scenes and let me tell you. There are plenty of them. This anime is all about that. They are big, long and action packed. If you are a fan of Shonen anime, then this is something I think you are going to find enjoyment out of.

Not a very good adaptation, everything was very rushed and the things that were cut to make up for time simply butchered characters like Yoo Mira.Bit of a nitpick, but it really doesn't sit right with me that the voice acting is japanese when the original comic is in korean.But at least I can say the anime made me interested in the original comic, so maybe that's enough. I'm aware many...comic fans didn't even think they'd ever get an animation, so I'm not too harsh on  the anime, I still had a good time watching it. comic fans didn't even think they'd ever get an animation, so I'm not too harsh on  the anime, I still had a good time watching it."", 'The God of High School (GOH) is a great anime. I am enjoying every moment of it.GOH does not have the best characters. If you watched some anime before, you may be able to predict many of the plots (like the final form of the protagonist Mori) since most of the Borrowed Powers are based on some form of mythical stories. Adopting character traits from mythical stories is nothing new, and I do think the growth of characters leave a lot to be desired, but the gained power of the female protagonist Mira is surprising. Yet, I personally find the antagonists confusing. I kind of...lost track of how many bad guys are in the story in Episode 10. However, each character has clear motives and acts naturally.GOH is a battle-focus anime, so expect a lot of ""mindless"" fight scenes, which I personally enjoy quite a bit. The fighting animations are fluent and beautiful, and are comparable to that of BONES. The 3D background and 2D hand-drawn characters are well-blended most of the time.The music is nothing remarkable but the opening is quite powerful and energetic (what do you expect from a battle anime :P). The background music drives the story forward and ending is relaxing, great cool-down from the busy story.I don\'t think GOH needs any plot, since you should be watching this anime for its fight scenes, and the producers delivered exactly that. I am glad it has a passable plot. In this particular time, I think the world more mindless animes like this. Crunchyroll, good job. lost track of how many bad guys are in the story in Episode 10.

So in the last episode the big bad guy gets beat in 8 minutes, he transforms, beats the main characters around for a minute or two, and then the MC just beats him in like another minute.

This is evident in the most recent 4th episode (as of the moment i'm writing this review) where 유미라's (Yoo Mira) wedding arc was told...very, very poorly.The only redeeming feature of this anime adaptation is its amazing production quality.The opening and ending sequence are fantastic and the music from featuring Tyler Carter and the K-POP boy-group CIX are catchy.The animation itself, from MAPPA studios, is like eye-candy. They did an almost perfect job of translating the WebToon artstyle of 박용제 (Park Yongjye) and a great example of this would be the red-shading of the nose and ears of important characters.Story: (5/10)The only reason I have it a 5 (average) is because the actual original story of the WebToon is great. It's the only thing holding it up.Art & Sound: (10/10)It gives the viewer eyegasms and get the blood-pumping.

They did an almost perfect job of translating the WebToon artstyle of 박용제 (Park Yongjye) and a great example of this would be the red-shading of the nose and ears of important characters.Story: (5/10)The only reason I have it a 5 (average) is because the actual original story of the WebToon is great.

So what makes this anime so bad in my opinion?God of highschool has an ok start. Its about a big tournament to determine the best highschool fighter in Korea. But the animes biggest problem is the pacing. It is just HORRIBLE. When the final episode ended i understood about 20% of what was going on. There is no context or explanation to whats happening...and the characters have no depth to them. The opening is ok but nothing amazing. The thing that carries this anime is the good animation made by mappa. The fights are good but too short.

So most of what i\'m going to review will be the overall story and not just the 5 episodes which have been released as of now (But don\'t worry, I keep it spoiler free and specific to the anime.)Story:Firstly, I read other reviews saying there\'s no story and it\'s just ""mindless fighting.""It is true that the anime has by far (until episode 4) taken the least time to explain the story. But considering how big the story actually is, I think it is a considerable pace.All they\'ve done...so far is given some hints to the story which will all connect together in the upcoming episodes, and they\'ve only just begun to explain the character\'s back story.As for the fighting, a lot of work was put into creating or adapting real life fighting techniques into a part of the story. And MAPPA did a great job of making them into anime, although I wish there was a bit more blood and impact in some scenes.Characters:I also read some reviews saying that the characters were not unique, but hey, after almost a century of anime we\'ve seen all types of characters. At this point any new anime character will definitely resemble some old character. It\'s pointless to whine about it now. So I ask you to look at character development instead. It was brilliantly shown how Mira found her resolution and the meaning of her father\'s words. On episode 5 we saw how dark Daewi can get and how he came to terms with it and changed.Sound & Visuals:The most impressive part of this anime is the soundtrack and its visuals. I was thrilled to hear Contradiction and Fly (op and ed songs) for the first time. And of course, the visuals were top notch as expected of MAPPA.Overall, GoH is a decent anime and is worth a watch for those who are into martial arts/fighting anime. so far is given some hints to the story which will all connect together in the upcoming episodes, and they\'ve only just begun to explain the character\'s back story.As for the fighting, a lot of work was put into creating or adapting real life fighting techniques into a part of the story.

I already had low expectations from reading the first few chapters of the manhwa and from Tower of God, so I feel very biased, but I'mma share my opinions anyways.Story - As you guys have probably already read from the other reviews, there is barely, if at all, any story. There's a high-school fighting tournament(for some fucking reason) run by shady people(wow how original) and the winner gets any wish they want granted(sounds very familiar).Art - Again, the animation is the only saving grace of this anime....Mappa did incredibly well on the fights, and I'd be lying if I said that the visuals are anything less than stunning.Sound - I don't pay attention to sound, but I'll tell you one thing, the opening is fucking garbage. The first 15 seconds sounds hype as hell, but then it turns into flashy techno garbage. It's literally the musical equivalent of that one kid who tries way too hard to be cool.Character - Jin Mori and Mira have zero personality. The only character that has any interesting story is Han Daewi, but they literally wrapped up his entire arc in a single episode.Enjoyment - I enjoyed this anime decently, but only because of the fantastic fight scenes. Everything else is lame.Overall: 4 - Not the worst anime I've ever seen, but this entire anime is the definition of all style and no substance. Would not recommend unless you want to see cool animation.

It is amazing how bad this show is, yet due to strong art and sound, and combined with hype from a popular webtoons series, is not seen as complete trash. This review contains vague spoilers.I was hopeful for this series at the start, the art was crisp and it dives into a tournament arc. Who doesn\'t love a tournament arc? First episode did a decent job setting a premise that this was a huge sporting even for Korea with something more sinister behind the scenes....We get introduced to the main characters that fill in basic anime tropes. Mori as the dense guy who loves food and wants to get stronger with the power of friendship! Da Wei is probably the best character of the show, the extent of his character is that he wants to save his friend with some kind of terminal illness. I don\'t know what to say about Yu Mira, her character motivation makes little sense. None of the characters are fleshed out or create any real emotional or logical development. I found myself laughing at how bad the characters were several times an episode. One episode, one of our main characters decides to break character in order to show he was in a difficult emotional spot. I appreciate the effort, into trying to provide any kind development and motivation for the characters, but it felt extremely forced and to me it just didn\'t make sense.In my opinion, the sound for this show was strong. It\'s nothing I would buy or even remember the name of to listen to, but it was definitely something that i enjoyed. The themes, along with the animation, let us know when the ""climaxes"" were happening. Since the story was so bad that there would be no other way for us to know. Unfortunately, there is only so much music and sound can do to boost a series like this. The music created no emotional impact because the characters were so bad that nobody cared what was happening.The art for this show was also good. I thought it was crisp and very standard. However, they went so far overboard for some of the fights that is was laughable. Once again, when you don\'t have anything backing up your huge explosions and graphics for the fights, they leave no impact. In the last episode. they threw everything they had at the animation, but it was just so overboard. Even if the story were good, you can\'t just throw huge colors and explosions at the screen and say, ""this is so hype!"". For a show that seems to want to rely on hype and emotion, it does a terrible job getting the audience to care in anyway about the fight. I guess the thought they could create hype without any substance by relying on flashy animation.The story for this show is so bad. Usually I am pretty good and suspense of disbelief and saying, ""well that happened and its okay that it doesn\'t make sense."" But this show doesn\'t explain anything. It scales from hand to hand combat to pulling gods from the sky and destroying cities in a single move. Not only does to scale in this stupid way, the scaling of power makes no sense and is not even explained. And even though there was this huge scaling going on throughout the show, it feels like nothing happened the whole time. It felt like nothing was explained and nothing was accomplished. They attempt the explain a power that they borrow from gods and people just awaken it. This was the furthest the explanation got and the next thing we see is Mori with a sharingan copying people\'s moves. Nothing about the powers of the gods are explained.  Absolutely nothing. When about half of your show is animated action without dialogue relating to the story, there is something wrong. One fight tried to build a promise someone made a long time ago, a typical anime cliche, but it still somehow fell short and made no sense. If only this show was able to properly replicate typical anime tropes and cliches then it would be so much better.Normally trashy anime shows consist of some op protag with a harem or ecchi shots and over sexed characters. But this show doesn\'t even give us those as main plot points. Instead it gives random, unexplained, extremely uninteresting bullshit as its plot. There were twists and turns in this series, but they don\'t even matter because nobody cared about them except to laugh at them.This is the worst anime I have ever watched, but it did make me passionate enough to write a review.

Don\'t get me wrong this is actually nice in sort of way but again, it needs more time to tell the story.The story is surrounded by gods and martial arts, something that mix well and it\'s a pretty know formula but here it lacks of tempo.

But again, the tempo, you want more, the short amount of time makes every fight dull and you can\'t empathize with none of the rivalries.The bad thing are some special moves like the Jin Mori specials, they look so bad and then you see it in the manwha and looks awesome but in the animation looks meh.The sound is nice, I wish they use something more electronic like the OP or some Hip Hop like the cuts to ""pause"". I think fits better than your typical rock hype up.The characters are ok, simply has that. I\'ve mentioned that the lack of time hurts the characters and make them don\'t care too much.

Sorry if it's bad.So, God of Highschool, one of the few webtoon adaptation animes. I had high expectations set, as this was made by Mappa, who in the past, made many good animes, and will continue to do so.I didn't hate this anime, I was just, disappointed. As there were many cuts from the original webtoon. The power system was horribly depicted from the webtoon, and overall it was RUSHED.Story: 9/10The story is unique. I love the power system and the tournament setting. (Tournament arcs, animes, mangas are my favorite.)  It was very enjoyable to say the least.Art:...10/10The art was IMMACULATE. I love how they didn't change the art style from the webtoon. It looks identical. And I love the shading of the noses, they were very cute. But the thing I loved the most was specifically, Jin Mori's eyes; they're beautiful.Sound: 10/10The voice acting was great, the opening and ending was amazing. Yet alone, the sound effects were nice. They weren't too exaggerated, but not too shallow and weird. They fitted the story and animation well.Character: 9/10I liked everyone in this show. I thought everyone was cool, and strong. I especially love how it wasn't too cliche where the MC works hard to be strong. No, Jin Mori was already pretty op in the beginning. He just became stronger.Enjoyment: 9/10I quite enjoyed this. I was hyped every Monday when I saw a new episode came out. I also got my dad to watch this with me, and he thought it was enjoyable as well. The storyline, characters, soundtrack, everything, was fun. I was hyped every episode. And the fights were great. Especially the Judge Q vs Nox fight in episode 8-9 (I think.) That fight was omg.Overall: 8/10Yes, I loved it, but it was rushed, and there were some plot holes, but in general it's a good anime and I recommend it! :) 10/10The art was IMMACULATE.

As a reader of the Manhwa myself, I was plenty excited to watch this anime to see the pretty visuals and fight scenes animated by MAPPA of all studios.And what should I even say? It was very, very, very, very, very terrible. Even from a manhwa reader’s perspective who knows what’s going to happen, I was still plenty confused about what was going to happen. I got confused about why some arcs didn’t get...adopted, why some backstories were covered and not others, and, more importantly, the age-old question of “can we fit 113 chapters into a 13 episode season?” The fact that MAPPA botched a decent and fun manhwa read into the car crash that is GOHS is beyond me.How does it stand against my five pillars of anime rating? Oh, probably not very good.Story (1/10): Oh god, were the stories and characters a train wreck. We were promised a tournament arc, a good tournament arc filled with plenty of backstories, fair fighting, and emotional moments packed with each punch. But no, all the fights were lackluster, no backstories were gone into, which might’ve been a good thing because when MAPPA did decide to go into a side character’s backstories, it just felt sickening that we got to see a potentially good character to disappear for the rest of the series. And as for the actual fights themselves, there were no “solid” fights. All the battles had no direction at all and just throwing punches and swinging swords with no thought into them at all besides the occasional power name scream. One of the most hyped fights I read in the Manhwa was over in like, what, 10 seconds? And the ones that don’t matter and take an entire episode of runtime with have no impact on the rest of the story or characters.But the worst, the ABSOLUTE worst part of GOHS is that they shatter the first rule of making a compelling story, which is following your worldbuilding. It’s clear to see that everyone fights with superpowers with all the “power naming” shenanigans you see in typical fighting anime. But no, they deemed all of that NORMAL without explaining anything, and when they do introduce superpowers, it just feels so out of place and comes out of nowhere. To the point where the story no longer follows the tournament arc and just goes to random bullshit God fighting or whatever.The story and worldbuilding is absolute dogshit. Nothing is believable, I don’t even know what the hell is going on half the time and even the fightsCharacters: (2/10): Part two of the story building trainwreck that is GOHS. God of HS’s characters doesn’t make sense. Their powers don’t make sense and their actions don’t make sense. We see this especially later in the series where new characters come out of nowhere and all they act is the one-dimensional friend or villain to our protagonists. The only thing I do believe MAPPA did right were our protagonists’ backstories, fleshing them out and them acting accordingly and some even wrapping it up nicely throughout the story. But again, the amount of inconveniences and character holes that exist are so massive, I can’t even tell if they told this in space, or in the writer’s room.Art: (6/10) I’m probably not going to be the first to say this, but the art is definitely very nice, since, well of course, MAPPA of all studios did it. HOWEVER, although the art did look very nice, it just didn’t feel anything special at the same time. MAPPA does follow the artstyle and the battles are very nicely animated, but it just didn’t feel up to the standard I expected from an anime like this.Sound: (5/10): Yea the OPs and EDs were unique and maybe good? The rest of the soundtrack was typical fighting shounen battle sequence songs and also a lot of songs and sounds that were inappropriately placed. Sometimes a happy go-lucky song would be playing in fight scenes and sometimes the largest punches’ sounds made the fights as convincing as a 8-year olds fist-fighting.Enjoyment (1/10): I think it’s clear to say that I didn’t enjoy this anime one bit. The story and characters are abysmal at best, and even the art and sound are pretty lackluster compared to the hype it got in the beginning of the season. Even though I haven’t kept up with the Manhwa in a while, I think I’ll keep at that instead of watching more of this hot burning garbage pile of anime. They even hinted at it at the last episode, but I really hope that it doesn’t go that far.Should you watch it? Oh god no, go watch something else.Overall: 2/10 adopted, why some backstories were covered and not others, and, more importantly, the age-old question of “can we fit 113 chapters into a 13 episode season?” The fact that MAPPA botched a decent and fun manhwa read into the car crash that is GOHS is beyond me.How does it stand against my five pillars of anime rating?

After episode 2 I thought to myself ok it's pacing feels a little off but it could be just a bad episode. Ep 3 was like ep 2 and I began to lower my expectations for the show and turn off my mind and enjoy the fighting. Then there came the legendary episode 4 on of the most boring and out of left field episode I have watched in anime series. It was at this moment I knew GoH was gonna...be a bad show and beyond redemption. I kept watching to see how bad it was gonna get and surprisingly it got a little better up til like ep 10 where it was watchable. But then ep 10 came and was another out of left field no build up or anything and it was one of the most confusing things ever and just looked like someone decided to write a fan fic. When I got to ep. 11 I watched the first 9 minutes and thought to myself is this worth the torture I am putting myself through and I dropped it then and there.Story - 1:High school fighting tournament. And people have some from of power in the form of chareyok. Show has awful pacing and leads you wondering what is happening there are so many ex machina's and plot twists they don't even make sense because there is a lack of build up.Art- 5:Honestly kind of ugly at times and the fight scenes are boringSound-7:The op is the best thing about the showCharacter- 0:Everyone is underdeveloped and generic. Daewi is just generic nice guy but with a dark past. Mira is just a generic person who needs to carry on her fathers legacy. Mori is just goku's character. No side character got any development what so ever dont pay attention to barely anyone in the tourny because they don't matter. Every thing about the characters are unlikable and so generic that I've seen the crowds at the goh tournamnt with more personality.Enjoyment -0:I hated this showOverall 1:Only reason why I watched it up to ep 11 was because there were very few anime in the monday slot. Don't watch this show its just a worse fighting anime go watch dragon ball z if you haven't seen it and if you have seen dbz go rewatch because you need to be grateful to good fighting anime be a bad show and beyond redemption.

First of all the protagonist. I dont know if it\'s only me but I can\'t stand it if the protagonist is pathetic and weak. It makes me feel like good guys always have bad things happening to them. Luckily this isn\'t the case this time.\tJin Mo-Ri\'s jolly attitude with his ""Do whatever you want"" motto was something different and I liked that. The close quarters fights where they go out all ""hand on hand combat style"" was good and the animations of those scenes were good too. Comedy...wasn\'t anything special but I had some chuckles here and there....I did not like the way they animated the nose and the ears. At first, they stuck out like a sore thumb to me. But to be honest midway through the anime I stopped noticing it so that didn\'t bug for long. But I still wish they animated the character differently....The way this show was marketed I had high expectations for the fight scenes. I was thinking it\'s all going to be all hand on hand mixed martial art style fights. And If you are going into the anime with the same mindset you are going to be disappointed. Because there are more ""stand using, Lazer flashing, air combat"" than actual martial art. The action scenes were nice though but its nothing like the way it was marketed. Nothing about the fight scene blew me away. So it was ok at best....The thing I hate most about this anime is that they invest so much time into making the villain look so bad and mean and then don\'t give a satisfying conclusion to it. They gave him a sob backstory and all the bad things he did suddenly doesn\'t matter. I mean come on...In anime that has so many bloody violent scenes, why would anyone be so ""buddy buddy"" with the villain? I wanted to see the villain suffer more, I wanted to see the revenge that would make him feel what his victims had to go through. This jolly good ending to the villain disintegrating while having a smile on his face really pissed me off. It felt like all the characters that had to suffer because of him didn\'t matter at all....They didn\'t put enough effort into the supporting characters. I just couldn\'t empathize with them. and they would put a sob backstory behind all the opponents when they were about to lose. That didn\'t worked out well. All I was thinking during those flashbacks was how much I dont care....And lastly, there were just too many mysteries left undiscovered. To me, it felt like the anime was screaming go read the source material. As an anime-only watcher, I hate it when an anime does that.

I can confirm that this anime has no story. A change in the course of the story may occur in two minutes, repeated dialogues, weak characters in writing. This anime reminded me of myself, when I go to the refrigerator, look and search, but I do not see moldy cheese that is not eaten and it takes 299 minutes to eat, and after eating it you must drink water.

As a very big mythology fan I absoulutely love all the references to some of the mythologies I know, it is definitely my favoutite part of the anime. Everything else was Ok i guess.One thing i dislike is that on some parts I felt like they basically threw the main characters under the bus except for Jin Mori, and the only time they were used was when they get hurt to basically just make Jin more op. And the ""rely on your friends part"" was stupid, first of all, why did the golden...fillet (his headband thingy that suppress most of his power for all you not well-versed in mythology) not activate earlier?  That\'s because the director wanted to include a very forced ""ohh your friends are very important"" scene. And even then Jin was the guy that did the most damage to the forgetable blue haired guy.Anyways, Everything else but that was pretty alright, the music got me hyped on some parts and the animation was also pretty good. I definitely enjoyed my experience with this anime and hope that season 2 entertains me more. fillet (his headband thingy that suppress most of his power for all you not well-versed in mythology) not activate earlier?

However, currently I'm loving it. Loving all of it! And I'll explain why while trying to remain spoiler-free.Characters:The introduction is quick, making sure that we get a feel on the main characters in the first episodes and using the following episodes to add upon them, giving them more details. From what I gathered we have three, distinct main characters. Each with their own unique backstory which the anime slowly unfolds naturally, allowing you to take in small amounts of new information. Without, mind you, disrupting the flow of the story...as a whole. Which brings me to the second pointStory:We're early on given a premise of the story and in every episode we're given situations/events which adds the universe which TGHS (The God of High School) plays in. These frequently occurring situations/events that are brought up during each episode balances between explaining boundaries of the universe and introducing plotlines/questions that makes you want to learn more about TGHS in general. For example, a fight between two character introduces what's feasible to accomplish in, say, Taekwando while also suddenly throwing in monstrous demon (?) clowns. You get a feeling on the boundaries of combat but you're also hit by the question: Wtf is that and how is that happening?!Art/Sound:I greatly enjoy the art and the sound quality, especially for the combat scenes (which there have been plenty of so far). Each fight, each attack and each movement feels unique. Meaning that should two characters have combat styles focused on kicking for example, they're both given a plethora of ways to do their kicks, further cementing how unique the characters are. To also give an example of the opposite: Dragon Ball Super. Now I love DBS as well, but if you look at any fight you'll notice that these fast punches and kicks are just a few simple animations that are put on repeat and sped up by a hundred.Nevertheless, there's one thing with the animation that up to now keeps nagging me, and that's their noses. Why are all the noses red? WHY?! For me personally it hasn't damaged my enjoyment of the anime but it distracts because it stands out for me. More so than the fact that some people have cross-shaped, yellow pupils! as a whole.

The way they fought and everything, it's so well drawn! The camera work and art was so beautiful this anime... but sadly that's all I can say. The plot is everywhere.... it's like jumping from 0 to 100... it's just too hard to follow. Most anime will build up their world first, but this one kinda just force you to jump right into the middle of the plot and try to figure out what's going on? It's kinda of hoping that people will stay...to want to find out what's going to happen and have to wait for like season 2 or 3 to explain, this is all that's happening or why all this is happening.It's a total mess in my opinion, but if you just want to kick back and not really have to think and just watch cool animation and action. I will say this is by far one of the best animation for hand to hand combat I have seen. I mean people who say DBZ has good fighting scene... which I honestly don't really think so because half the time you're just seeing line lol... I thought this was well drawn out. It's more of just don't think about it and shut off your thinking cap and guilty pleasure. That's all to it, nothing special about it, if you're trying to make sense of the anime, you'll end up hating it. Because it just isn't that great. Characters are meh.... there's no real build up to their relationship, just kinda happens. It's not the best friendship anime and it's just jumps all over the place... but as I said, if you just want a anime to watch casually, go for it. It's not bad to just enjoy it, I watch it just for the heck of it but I won't put anywhere near my top or in my favorites. to want to find out what's going to happen and have to wait for like season 2 or 3 to explain, this is all that's happening or why all this is happening.It's a total mess in my opinion, but if you just want to kick back and not really have to think and just watch cool animation and action.

Does it have a complex and gripping story? No, it’s just a bunch of high school kids beating each other up. Is it fun nonetheless? Yes, it’s a bunch of high school kids beating each other up. It’s mindless fun. A good comparison would be the fast and the furious series, it’s not clever, it’s not well written, but it still has that annoyingly dumb and entertaining appeal. And much like the fast and furious series,...the best way to enjoy GoH is to: sit back, turn your brain off and watch the pretty animations punch each other.The best part of GoH is by far the animation; where the story falls short due to being simplistic if at all existent, or the characters fail to resonate with you for being too 1 dimensional, the animation will be your saving grace. A lot of effort went into creating these fight scenes, and that’s evidenced in the anime itself.Overall: if you want a plot that’s going to drag you in for a beautifully crafted and intelligent story, you’ll be sorely disappointed and left with intellectual blue balls, but if you want a show that you can put on the in background or you just want to watch some guys go ham on each other’s faces with their fists..... this anime will be a more than a satisfactory time filler for you. the best way to enjoy GoH is to: sit back, turn your brain off and watch the pretty animations punch each other.The best part of GoH is by far the animation; where the story falls short due to being simplistic if at all existent, or the characters fail to resonate with you for being too 1 dimensional, the animation will be your saving grace.

The plot points are established and put to rest so fast I don't know how I'm expected too.

A tournament arc seems pointless when I don't even feel like the characters are in danger.I hope they stick with something soon or I wont have a reason to watch a second season, and I think the characters have a lot of potential.

Obviously taste is subjective, but people give shows as decent as this ""bad""s and say it\'s not worth watching. It\'s weird to me, it\'s as if they think they are the be all and end all of anime watchers, and that they decide what people legitimately should and shouldn\'t watch. I thought this show was very good. Most of the fights were clean and the animation was pretty damn smooth.

Now God of High School, this one is really hard to tell about because there are people who like this anime and at the same time there are some who absolutely hate this. I understand both sides and have their reasons but now I am saying my review. Now I am not one of the manhwa readers to talk about the actual story and all. Now let me tell about my experience with this season.Talking about the story. It is absolutely horrible to be honest. There is no definite sense for what they are doing and at one time you...see a giant statue falling from the sky and at the same time there is this tournament going on. Sounds stupid right, but seeing is more horrendous. I don't blame MAPPA for this because they tried their best to squeeze almost 100 chapters in 13 episodes. But come on crunchyroll this is bullshit.Now the animation and fights, MAPPA absolutely killed it. The only reason I was able to watch this season is because of the animation and dope fights.Based on character development , nobody is so good like the typical shounen characters like luffy, naruto , gon and many more. But pretty fine character development.So overall this anime is absolutely shit based on story. Dont expect anything from the story. Fucking Boruto has better story than this shit.The only reason I give this season a 7 is because of the studio MAPPA and their hardwork to create dope fights and animation. Or else this would be 3 rating to me.In the end all I want to say is watch it just for fun. DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING CRAZY HAPPENING IN THIS ANIME.The anime is just for marketing purpose where crunchyroll is just promoting manhwa and THE WEBTOON. Keep this in mind while watching and you might end up liking it. see a giant statue falling from the sky and at the same time there is this tournament going on.

I\'ve heard a lot from this show as it was quite a popular manhwa a few years ago, so I had high expectations. However, those expectations were quickly shattered and the way the plot is progressing, I doubt it\'ll get any better soon.The story of the god of HS is as typical as any generic shounen show could be. You have your tournament arc, flashy fighting, underground conspiracy organization, and supernatural powers. Does this sound familiar? Then you\'ve probably...already watched BNHA, H x H, Naruto, and Black Clover to name a few. The only difference is, at least those latter shows had the initiative to tweak the setting (e.g. BNHA was a society of heroes). The god of HS lacks any novelty in terms of setting and plot, as it\'s strictly a martial arts show at its core with some supernatural elements that interestingly resemble JoJo stands.The characters in the show are also unimpressive. They more resemble cardboard based on the 4 episodes I\'ve watched. You have the prodigy taekwondo MC, who\'s only goal is to eat food, fight strong opponents, and save his friends. His friends are equally unimpressive as the karate part-timer is unexpressive and ""cool""; while the kendo practitioner is your female hot-headed companion.

And I know it\'s not easy to put as much plot as goh has into an 13 episode Anime, but they could at least have tried to not make it all about the fights. They changed a lot of the story, but in my opinion this didn\'t help to get the story better, but it made everything even more confusing. They actually don\'t explain anything.

They engaged hyper drives to warp speed. The season really should have ended at episode 10.

The fights are hype and for once an anime is using the rule of show don't tell.My score may seem high but let me explain......Characters - 7/10I absolutely agree the characters are simple, but that doesn't make them bad. Mori is your typical shonen protagonist, but that doesn't stop me from finding him funny and cheering for him. Daewi's character arc over the first few episodes was absolutely fantastic and almost made me cry at the end, but it was still simple. We don't really have much info about Mujin Park but the little bit we've gotten has been fantastic. Also, the series only has 7 eps and a lot of negative reviews watched even less which is not a lot of time to flesh out characters.Story - 9/10Again, the story is simple. It's a tournament with a mysterious organization running it with an unknown goal and some mysterious bad guys. But it's how the series handles the storytelling of simple components that makes it great. The fighters don't stop and talk for 10 years to explain character motivations and powers. A few flashbacks and previous scenes provide plenty of context for the fights and then everything is showed within the fights. The storytelling has built much greater emotional stakes in a few episodes than many other shonen have done for me.Sound - 9/10I personally love the hip-hop soundtrack. It gets me hype for fights and gets me emotional. This is more personal taste so that's all I'm gonna say.Art - 9/10Fights are animated beautifully. Animation style changes sometimes for comedy or to illustrate a certain aspect of a fight. A few cool shots of the city to establish the setting. Red noses are weird tho but very minor.Enjoyment - 10/10This series is just pure entertainment. Amazing fights that aren't bogged down by explanations and long flashbacks. The flashbacks only add to fights. The comedy actually hits which is rare for me in anime. I can't help but love the simple characters and there camaraderie.

The only reason this isn\'t a 1 or 2 is because the source materials story is quite good and I have some amount of hope they will adapt it...better in the remaining episode. There are also many changed scenes and plot points within the adaptation that differ greatly from what was shown in the Webtoon/Manwha, such as Mira Yoo\'s fight with Ma Mi-Sun.Art: 6/10The Art in the show is quite well done, although not exceptional by any means and pales to the Webtoon/Manwha, which can be clearly seen quite well in the Daewi vs Mori fight in both the Webtoon and Anime, with the anime clearly falling behind in its adaptation of one of the best fights in the entire series. There are also some smaller nuisances with the adaptation of the art, particulary with Mori Jins ""Triple Kick"", or as Webtoon readers would know it, the ""Three Stage Hoechook"". The Anime Adaptation completely fails at showing how this attack even works to the audience, along with many other techniques in the show.Sound: 8/10The Sound in the show is honestly great and is done excellently. It stands out as one of the best parts of the show, especially compared to the now lackluster fights and horrible story decisions.Characters: 4/10The Characters aren\'t too different from the source material, however they seem to have become slightly more bland than their were in the source material, although this may be because of the authors more energetic portrayals of the characters in the earlier chapters, which the anime didn\'t exactly adapt well.Enjoyment: 2/10As a huge fan of the Webtoon, I had really hoped that this would be an adaptation at least on par with the Tower of God Adaptation, which was done OK, however this was far worse than I could have ever imagined. Mappa couldn\'t even do justice to the fights for this adaptation, and as such, I couldn\'t even enjoy them at all compared to the thrill and energy of the Manwha\'s FightsOverall: 3/10To put it simply, this adaptation of the great source material is garbage, and I would not recommend it if you have already read the Webtoon/Manwha, however as a stand alone anime, I would most likely not recommend it either, unless you want to watch the anime before starting from the start in the Webtoon. Forgive me for my very biased review, but I feel that I need to vent my frustration with what could have been an amazing anime if it was in the right hands (not Crunchyrolls). better in the remaining episode.

There are also some smaller nuisances with the adaptation of the art, particulary with Mori Jins ""Triple Kick"", or as Webtoon readers would know it, the ""Three Stage Hoechook"". The Anime Adaptation completely fails at showing how this attack even works to the audience, along with many other techniques in the show.Sound: 8/10The Sound in the show is honestly great and is done excellently. It stands out as one of the best parts of the show, especially compared to the now lackluster fights and horrible story decisions.Characters: 4/10The Characters aren\'t too different from the source material, however they seem to have become slightly more bland than their were in the source material, although this may be because of the authors more energetic portrayals of the characters in the earlier chapters, which the anime didn\'t exactly adapt well.Enjoyment: 2/10As a huge fan of the Webtoon, I had really hoped that this would be an adaptation at least on par with the Tower of God Adaptation, which was done OK, however this was far worse than I could have ever imagined. Mappa couldn\'t even do justice to the fights for this adaptation, and as such, I couldn\'t even enjoy them at all compared to the thrill and energy of the Manwha\'s FightsOverall: 3/10To put it simply, this adaptation of the great source material is garbage, and I would not recommend it if you have already read the Webtoon/Manwha, however as a stand alone anime, I would most likely not recommend it either, unless you want to watch the anime before starting from the start in the Webtoon. Forgive me for my very biased review, but I feel that I need to vent my frustration with what could have been an amazing anime if it was in the right hands (not Crunchyrolls).', ""I've never written a review before, but I felt like I should with this show. GOH isn't a bad show, not by any means, it's just hard to follow.I hadn't read the original Webtoon (can't say I'm planning on) and the first half of this show had me really intrigued! 'Martial Arts contest to find someone who will be strong enough to defeat an evil cult' is a cool premise to me, and the charyeok power system was also interesting to me. I could get along with the characters and understand them, it's just that halfway through this show went off the rails AND...DIDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING!!Maybe answers will be given in the future, but I can't say I'm going to be that interested in getting them... DIDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING!!Maybe answers will be given in the future, but I can't say I'm going to be that interested in getting them..."", ""*SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST 5 EPISODES AHEAD*The God of Highschool is a messed up anime. It's mediocre at it's best, it's not a bad or good anime, just mediocre. Just like Tower of God, TGoHS is an extremely overhyped anime that didn't live up to the expectations the manwha readers set up. Ofc the anime is still only 5 episodes in but I can give my insight into it so far and I do plan on watching the whole thing.Story(3/10): There's not any. It's a fighting anime with a fighting tournament as its setting. They try to expand the plot by making a god-like character...manage the organization that's also responsible for the tournament, but so far we didn't get anything aside from the fact the leader is a crazy person that loves to see people kill each other.Art(8/10): It's great, there's not much to say here. The animation is amazing and it's the one redeeming factor in this show, that is the reason why it is so popular. All the characters have red ears and noses which is a bit weird, but it's not a big deal. The animation quality also drops sometimes even though it's overall great.Sound(6/10): Nothing too memorable, I don't particularly care for the soundtrack but it's not bad. The opening is catchy but the animation in it is unoriginal because it's mostly scenes taken from the first episode.Character(3/10): Generic and cliche. Every character is someone we have seen somewhere else. The MC Jin Mori is Goku, he is oblivious to many things, is strong for no apparent reason, loves to eat food and cares for his friends that he met a few days ago more than anything. The other characters are mostly the same, they have one trait that distinguishes them from each other but they are not worked upon or developed any further.Best example is Han Daewi, rival and best friend to the MC. His character arc consisted on trying to save his dying friend by paying for his treatments, which was the reason he entered the tournament. This is cliche but still could have been handled better. What happened was that his friend died and so his resolve now doesnt' make sense anymore because he doesn't have to take part in the tournament anymore. Then he proceeds to knock the floor with the girl MC he befriended in episode 1. This was kind of explained in the next episode when the god like leader asked him to do so, but it still doesn't make much sense either. Then it appears that his friend is actually still alive, so all that happened so far was dumb. They talk about their backstory, which also doesn't make any sense, where they became friends by fighting each other. And then the dude actually dies for real, but not before leaving a note saying he leaves no regrets behind, which makes Daewi happy to fIgHt fOr hIs oWn sAkE. Then they become friends again, even the girl he almost killed the day before is now happy to hang out with him again for some reason. It's really cliche and dumb.Enjoyment (5/10): Like I said in the begginning, it's not a bad anime in the sense that it's enjoyable to watch to a certain degree, but the only thing going for it is the crazy good animation. The battles themselves are not great either aside from how well animated they are. It's supposed to be a martial arts tournament but they introduce forms, magic and stands from JoJo without even explaining who can get them and how or what they exactly do.Overall (5/10): The God of Highschool is an anime I will recommend for people that are only looking for good battles, but nothing more than that. The anime is cliche, generic and boring sometimes. If it wasn't for the good animation, this wouldn't be so popular, but I mean, that's what most casual anime fans are looking for in an anime manage the organization that's also responsible for the tournament, but so far we didn't get anything aside from the fact the leader is a crazy person that loves to see people kill each other.Art(8/10): It's great, there's not much to say here.

If you can tolerate bad character writing and worse storytelling for a few sakuga scenes go for it.Art and animation - 9/10The animation quality is the only good thing about this, as I said. The art itself is fine, although I'm not the biggest fan of the red noses and cauliflower ears.Story - 4I only saw 4 episodes, which is why I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and giving it a four. The anime has gone for a breakneck pace for the story, which I can only assume is...to try and reatain audience attention - I'm not sure this was necessary, because the Webtoon adaptation hype would've drawn eyes regardless. The first three episodes did nothing special - it had a fair share of continuity errors and logical breaks, but the fourth episode was when it really snapped with the child marriage plot. The intention was to obviously introduce some kind of character conflict to show Mira's commitment to her (cliched) backstory, but boy the anime lost me with that episode. Why are they called highschoolers at all, other tan for younger viewers to self insert? If she's in school, she's probably a minor, does Korea have some weird marriage laws I'm not aware of? And the whole thing is done in so many quick scenes that it never manages to convince me of the character's motivations - its an intriguing idea, but its only used to manufacture some cheap tension that's going to go away by the end of the season. For the rest that we see, it's the usual shonen stuff - mysterious orgnaization, mysterious powers - I can only hope that they define those powers better in later episodes than they do in the first few.Character - 4Have you watched more than two shonen anime ever? You've watched all the characters in this anime.Music - 5The EDM opening wasn't bad; not a fan of the ending. to try and reatain audience attention - I'm not sure this was necessary, because the Webtoon adaptation hype would've drawn eyes regardless.

If they had stuck with the slice of life style plotline this show would have been great. What I think happened was that the creator decided to abandon that and make it an over the top fighting, shonen style anime. And it bombed.  It's like they completely rewrote the characters after the first episode and the more I watched the less sense it made. And it's not like it just left things ambiguous, it was like they were adding new completely random, unrelated plot elements every 10...minutes and then not explaining anything. I was really confused most of the time and I was thinking that maybe I missed some context but I hadn't, the plot just makes no sense. It's cliche, unoriginal and cheesy (not in the charming way.)

While GOH wound up being an average anime that did not live up to the hype it created.The passion that went into creating GOH is obvious and abundant.  The animation and artistic style are fantastic, the fight scenes are fluid, the characters all look unique and interesting, the voice acting is stellar, and the ending song Win by Cix is SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD (I added it to my workout playlist instantly) so I always stayed for the credits.  Daewi is...my favorite character.  He has the coolest fight scenes, the best fight scenes, and motivation.I was excited to see a good looking anime focused on martial arts and enjoyed the first few episodes so much that I went ahead and read the first volume of the manhwa, but by the time I got halfway through GOH I realized... it sucks. The story is all over the place just a couple of episodes in and it doesn't get any better. This lack luster story telling is easily the worst aspect of the show. Also, the cool martial arts that the characters have spent their whole lives mastering are wasted, once they get to the tournament all that matters is the amount of magical affinity they were born with.  Because of this, the world building and story seemed very rushed.  There is seemingly little balance or rules to limit what the characters are able to do with their powers.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with focusing on magic instead of realism, but GOH missed a big opportunity to precisely build its world, set its rules, and develop its characters (for an example of an anime that does this well look at Hunter x Hunter).  Additionally, while they are enjoyable, the characters can be pretty easily put into generic stereotypes.GOH wound up being pretty a boring and nonsensical magical action/adventure anime that happened to have really good art and style and I can tell you from reading the source material that any future seasons won't get any better. my favorite character.

That first episode displayed The God of High School’s biggest strength, fight choreography.The choreography, good art style, and fluid camera work make the fights the most interesting aspect of this anime by far.

The story makes no sense because they don’t take the proper time to exlain and develop it. But if they do explain it and the story is just bad, then that time would have best been spent on some nice action which would have at least been entertaining.As a result, the anime has a very low ceiling because it is soley relying upon the action to keep people interested while abandoning proper story and world building.

There will be an explanation at the end if you didn’t understand my intention.---------------Story - 3Art - 8Sound - 8Characters - 3Enjoyment - 5...Right into it. So what’s the story? The story, you ask? What story, in fact, who cares? Sliding in a ton of friendship cliches like it was something out of Yu-Gi-Oh for the first few episodes is apparently the best thing to do. Though with GOHS being an original source 400+ chapter webtoon, then surely you ask yourself that this couldn’t possibly be the only plot device used. Luckily, you’re correct. Nox, a developing tournament, other characters suddenly doing stuff also happens. Is it done in a good fashion? No. It is very rushed. Stuff happens without any good explanation. As for characters, they too are very undeveloped. They have one episode of dedication to them and then boom, they exist as if there were a side character. That is for everyone who isn’t Jin Mori though, his mysterious background with a mysterious grandpa causes him to get some good development, or at the very least redeeming qualities to make him stand out at least a little. Yeah? Not really. Even he has some questions still left in the dark. All in all rushed story and characters.Audiovisuals. They are actually very good. A wide variety of fighting styles are used, although it is not on a level like something out of ufotable, it is indeed worth the watch, it is quite fluid and doesn’t try to skip out on any frames, with the added bonus of random shots of good art to convey the power of the character in a said moment in time. The art style is slightly questionable, characters looked drunk with their red noses, not too sure why but apparently that was a good idea. OSTs were good, with their electronic music, same with the OP. ED was chill however and not as lively as the other sounds that show has. The VCs did a good job but I did actually question if there were Korean accents as opposed to the Japanese ones used, and after surfing the incredibly helpful YouTube got a few cringe videos and came to the conclusion that VCs probably could have made for a somewhat Korean accent to go with characters, seeing how this is set in Korea. Overall, very good audiovisualsEnjoyment. This isn’t enjoyable if you are someone like me who gets easily confused, though I am sure that even the most understanding of people will have trouble understanding this story. The visuals make up for it, however, great action all around, even if nothing made sense.

I feel like the story is indeed very rushed but the audiovisuals made up for it. Though even with pretty good audiovisuals, they clashed with the storytelling and ended up cancelling each other out. Forming a blank slate, not good, not bad. Incredibly balanced.Maybe webtoon adaptations are just unbelievably hard to pull off, maybe the licensors are bad, maybe there is some other force at work. But all that is known so far is that as of now, webtoon adaptations are not in the best positions they could be in. I remember watching 4 episodes of Re:Zero S2 in one go and then going back to GOHS a few hours later, and the quality drop was genuinely felt. I don’t like to compare one anime to another especially when the two aren’t similar. But it was my way of showing one of the cases where GOHS really felt dry.

The anime had some pretty good fight scenes here and there, but due to only being 12 episodes and crunchyroll testing the waters out a little bit for the first season, the story felt convoluted and out of context, a lot of things where left out of the webtoon like when Mujin sent them underground and Jegal's storyline gettting cut a little bit, but honestly even without the less episodes and if crunchyroll took adapting it seriously I still think it would not be as great storywise, the fight scenes and the powers are cool, but even in the weebtoon a lot is unexplained and some characters and abilities are just op for no apparent reason, the main character is literary the monkey king and the almighty god of the universe man, I get that the creator based it of the Dragon Ball franchise , but still come on man the mc and his friends are op it just takes out the fun for me, but besides all that the anime was entertaining and the fight scenes were pretty good.Pros:-Epic fight scenes-Not really a big fan of the dubstep OP but I did like the ED-Cool powers-Very entertainingCons:-Plot is not well executed and feels convoluted-Is your generic shounen with some epic fight scenes and shallow average story-Characters are op for no reason-Generic backstories everywhere-Characters are underdeveloped and not memorable-Characters are out of character, people are supposed to be in high school but that doesn't appear to be the case since they all act retarded and feel like have not been doing anything in their life but just fighting their brains out, hell I can't even believe these characters going to school at all.Overall The God Of High School's plot was not well executed, and at its core its your generic shounen with a shallow story that heavily relies on fight scenes to salvage itself, it was entertaining tho I'll give it that. I give The God Of High School a 6/10 for my overall anime rating. mysteries of Nox and the mysterious God Of High School universe.

That's the only good thing about this anime.Rest of it is pretty much trash. Better read the Manhwa /web-comics from webtoons. Most  of the story is confusing as many of the content that was covered in the manhwa were not covered in the anime, causing a lot of people to drop the anime in between.

First seasons aren't usually made to make you care enough about an anime with its in-depth character development or intense worldbuilding (there are exceptions of course), but rather to hook you in with the potential for it to be something worth watching and supporting. The anime itself has insanely stupid good animation. The fighting choreography was incredible, good effects and sound design. There really isn't any complexity to the story, it's just a good show to turn brain off...and see epic fight because why not. It's only 1 season so it's not terribly long, definitely worth the watch. and see epic fight because why not.

The characters get little to no development, there\'s this whole plot about ""cultists"" that I barely understood and a power system that wasn\'t exactly explained properly.Story- 1/10The story makes no sense. It starts off with our main characters attending a fighting event where the winner gets to ask for 1 thing - that ""1 thing"" could be anything they want. Pretty normal so far, right? Then, out of literally nowhere, the series introduces a power scheme that is explained really briefly and  then completely brushed over. There\'s also this random...subplot about a cult wanting to kill anyone who can use these powers... and they try to kill them off using other powers I guess?Art- 8/10I don\'t have any problems with the art - in fact, it\'s one of the only good things about this anime.

The soundtrack and the opening are really cool. The whole reason I found this anime was because I watched the opening on youtube.Characters- 2/10The character development in this anime is possibly the worst I\'ve ever seen. The characters get 0 development which makes them just about as likeable as a CG backround chracter. In other words, they bring nothing to this anime.Sure, the fight scenes are pretty cool sometimes - but that doesn\'t make up for the rushed storyline. This anime gets a 2/10 from me.

The characters are stupid, the god thing is dumb the story is bad but the fights and animation are top 3 so it still stays enjoyable and it only really gets bad to the last few episodes.

The same cannot be said for the anime adaptation, you see while the anime is only 13 episodes long, the amount of chapters those 13 episodes include is 112 chapters, you can now see why the anime is so rushed and the characters and story aren\'t fleshed out.It\'s like trying to compress all of One Piece into less than 100 episodes and still getting all the major characters to show up (not even mentioning every comedic part), it\'s gonna...suck for everybody.What Crunchyroll and Webtoon were trying to do by making this anime is to just get a quick cash grab and advertise each others platforms to other groups of people like how on Webtoon on The God of Highschool page is says that there is now an animated version and when the anime was released it was on the front page, and on Crunchyroll it obviously has to have the Webtoon logo in it.So all in all, the anime sucks but if there is spare time have the time, try to read the webtoon version, trust me, its way better. suck for everybody.What Crunchyroll and Webtoon were trying to do by making this anime is to just get a quick cash grab and advertise each others platforms to other groups of people like how on Webtoon on The God of Highschool page is says that there is now an animated version and when the anime was released it was on the front page, and on Crunchyroll it obviously has to have the Webtoon logo in it.So all in all, the anime sucks but if there is spare time have the time, try to read the webtoon version, trust me, its way better.', 'I watched this upon release and this is dog shit.The characters are extremely unoriginal, generic, bland and copy+pasted from other shounens, but I cant blame it, this is just the natural cycle of many shounens that use rehashed and recycled personalities; its a continuous loop of shit characters with shit backstories with shit designs and shit overused tropes because thinking of original ideas is too hard for these goo goo gaa gaa cry babies in their executive CEO meeting.This show thinks quantity is more important than quality, I was once fooled from the start thinking this would be a slapstick comedy that didn\'t take itself...too serious because look at the title ""The God of High School"", it presents itself like it\'s about to be some cringe humour, rather similar to \'Watamote\'.

Man this show just hits different. From the amazing art work and animation to... nothing else really. The show is just packed with - what I can only describe as - one of the best animation and art ever to be seen in anime history. Not only that, but we get fun characters that are able to put this artwork to work and utilise it to its full potential. But what makes this art style so special?Art style and animation - Well we first have to cover...why the art style separates itself from other art styles. When designing characters, its important for the character to match their movements. Example: the Hulk has big, fierce, powerful, movements much like a gorilla. When illustrators were drawing the characters, they\'ve clearly thought about the characters movements and how that would look with their appearance. This ties in how they must make the characters. Each character distinct to each of their movements, while making the animation smooth and easy to follow and showing each style of fighting, each character has. All the moves - the magical ones - have linked to the characters fighting style. Having art style and animation is the key to most action and many fail. Such smooth animation, almost like I can feel every blow, sending chills down my spine, this really is something special. ""If its so good, how have you only given it a 9 then?"", you may ask. Well, with all the animation and fabulous art, you always need one thing in every anime. A plot, and with that, you need to be able to make the plot interesting, you need to be able to tell a good story.Story - This story is the anime\'s biggest, yet pretty much, only flaw. The anime cannot tell a story. From backstories to the main story, the anime fails to hold a good story. Character development too. There has to be a story, it doesn\'t even to be amazing, just something that can hold the anime together. Honestly, not much left to say for the story. Its just weak.Opening - God. I love talking about opening, because they really do a lot for anime. One thing they can always have over manga - or just the OST in general. The openings should match up with the anime - exceptions for anime\'s like Death Parade, where they make the opening and anime ""contradict"" each other. ""Contradiction"" is a head bopping, uplifting, spine chilling opening that slots into the anime perfectly. Perfectly representing what ""The God of High School"" is, a hype, exciting, fast paced anime that doesn\'t hold back and will always push each punch to its limit.Statement - ""The God of High School"" is a heart pumping anime that will take you to the limits and show you what great animation should look like. MAPPA once again created absolute bliss animation and a breathe taking art style. The story really needs fixing, but this was so binge-able. The art style, animation, and opening have carried this show making it one of the best action anime in my list. Although, JJK did it better :).

I\'ve finally finished ""The God of High School"" and I don\'t really know how to feel about it. Let\'s get right into the anime basics.Story; Students of all ages gather up in Seoul Korea to take part in the ""God of High School"" tournament to see who is the strongest student of all and be granted one wish of any kind. You mainly follow the trio Jin Mori, Yu Mira and Han Daewi as they get to learn about each others past, their current struggles and why it\'s important to trust the friends closest to you. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS: My favourite episodes were 1-5...(especially 4 when Mori and Daewi go to save Mira from a horrible ass decision she made), but... the moment we get into the part of the series when all these gods, chareyeok and keys get involved kind of messed me up? I realize God/Kamisama is in the title of this anime, but I wish they introduced everything a little better instead of just suddenly throwing everything in there (When ilpyo suddenly became some kind of key/six tailed fox spirt I was so damn confused, and I understand it was an important scene but it felt erupted/weird at the time). Art and Sound; no doubt, and I hope no one would disagree that it\'s ten out of ten... I love listening to the OST, and the animation is so unique (I LOVE THE RED NOSES!!!). Characters; I\'m happy they went into the main trios past that way we can understand their wishes and why they\'d go into the GOH tournament, but I also felt they never talked about the side characters enough. It also disappointed me that we never got to learn about the side characters from the beginning of the of the anime opening (girl chewing gum, guy with glasses fighting WHILE reading a book, etc.)Overall, I\'m happy I watched this anime. I\'m not as satisfied as I thought I would be after finishing this... but i\'m kind of interested in reading the manhwa now (maybe this whole confusing series was made JUST to get people to read it?!)

Did I ever read the webtoon? No. So this is my opinion without knowing the webtoon.So far, there doesn\'t seem to be any particular main plot. Just the ML who loves fighting and would want to fight lots of strong people. His friends who are considered MCs I guess, have some background story but somehow, the way the anime is directed doesn\'t make the background story seem emotional in any way when it is supposed to be emotional. I have to say that the anime fail in applying the emotions needed except for the hype in fighting. I...am not sure if there will be any real plot in this story but I guess there will be a need to explain how some people have incredible powers and for what purpose the tournament was made, as well as who\'s behind it. I am continuing watching in a hope for it all to be explained in the future.I personally do not mind a ""no plot"" anime as long as the animation is great especially the fighting scenes, and fortunately, this anime has a really good animation. I guess seeing from the trailer, the animation is really the main selling point of the anime. I am just hoping that the animation continue to be great and won\'t be failing in the middle like Dororo lol. One thing that bothers me though, is the artwork, I am not sure why their noses and ears are red, its kind of distracting especially when some of the mob characters do not have red ears and noses.(This part may contain spoiler)The other thing that bothered me is that I feel that the story seems to be moving forward too fast? Like there is an episode where the conflict lies in Yoo Mira getting married but it really got solved in one episode and somehow the way the anime is telling Yoo Mira\'s story and the way the story made the conflict solved is really rushed and weird. Again, it fails to rouse my emotion and kinda feels abit irrelevant? Like if the anime doesn\'t have that episode/conflict, its also fine lol. The fights are also really fast, in this pace, I am guessing that most characters that are shown in the opening and had fight with the MCs will disappear just like that and only appear in the first few episodes (I might be wrong but it feels like that since there is only little to none background story on those characters in the anime, most only has a little interactions with the MC before the fight and no interaction/story at all after the fight).In conclusion if you want some emotional or real plot, I recommend you to not watch this. However, if you just like action movies with a lot of fighting even if there is no plot, then this might be for you. Do i enjoy it? Yes because I don\'t mind a lot of fighting scene with no plot especially when the animation is good. The score that I gave is purely due to my preference in which I enjoy the show.Story 3/10 - No plotArt 8/10 - Good except for the red nose and earsCharacter 4/10 - Decent design but no developmentEnjoyment 7/10 - As I said I do not mind no plotOverall 6/10 - It\'s good that I enjoy it so it got a pretty high score despite the story am not sure if there will be any real plot in this story but I guess there will be a need to explain how some people have incredible powers and for what purpose the tournament was made, as well as who\'s behind it.

But yeah, God of Highschool one of the most disappointing anime I saw last year and an example of shounen done bad.Don’t get me wrong. It’s not the worst shounen there is but it presents some of the worsts aspects of the genre. There was a lot of hype for God of Highschool when it was announced as a Crunchyroll original done by the highly acclaimed Studio Mappa (Yuri on Ice, Dororo). In the end though; it’s been completely forgotten. No one’s talking about it only...a year later. And there’s a good reason why.The ‘Plot’Do you like tournament arcs? This is just a giant tournament arc; there’s a tournament and people fight in it. A huge tournament in South Korea called the God of Highschool. Here, High Scholars as you can imagine fight in various styles of the honor of being the champion or the hokage or something like that. At first, it’s kinda fun as you watch the main characters take on different martial artists with different fighting styles based seemingly on real-world martial arts. However this is going on and on and eventually, those real-world martial arts get replaced with magic. It’s losing even that.The show has pretty much nothing else to offer. Also bullshit happens. There’s a conspiracy theory about the tournament being used by a cult to someone a demon but the show rushes through exposition so quickly, I honestly couldn’t tell you the details.The pacing and plot of the anime are terrible. The first few episodes are completely taken up by the fighting, with no character, and pretty much no plot. It’s just fighting, after fight, after fight with the occasional exposition dump to abruptly inject some plot into the show.Shounen Done BadYou could argue that fighting is the point, it is a shounen after all. The thing is though good shounen like My Hero Academia, Hunter X Hunter, or Rurouni Kenshin realized is that you need to take some time off the fighting and better define the characters and world. Those are the things to make people invested, so they care about the people doing the fighting.When Deku and Bakugo fight in MHA, the tension doesn’t just come from two different dudes in silly costumes slamming fists against each other. It comes from watching a kid who’s been bullied all his life finally stand up to his bully and prove his worth and whether or not he’ll be able to do so. That internal conflict makes the fight seem real. Without it, the fights would be empty and nonengaging.The ‘Characters’God of Highschool’s cast is more or less catchphrase spewing sock puppets they’re such nothing characters. On our main character, we have Jin; the hot-headed lead. Han, the more reserved responsible member of the group, and Mira, the girl. They really aren’t anything more than that.Even when it tries to slow down and give the cast more development, it feels rushed and shallow. You have so little time to get to know the cast that you’ll barely remember their names. This means when they start getting up on their soapbox about their feelings and dreams in typical shounen fashion, you can’t help but yawn. Yeah we know they can punch good but we know little of their personality. Just popping their backstory in doesn’t give us a reason to care because we know so little about them as people.Our main dude is as stock as it gets. He wants to get stronger and loves his friends, you’ve seen the song and dance a thousand times if you’ve watched any previous shounen and nothing is done to make it feel unique or enduring.The EndingIf that’s not enough by the end of the series, the plot starts really shifts gear to the mystical bullshit. There’s this great conspiracy behind the tournament about people trying to summon a god and the characters have stand powers or something and a couple of them might be demons, idk, it kinda just happens. So now that one good thing it had of well-animated realistic martial arts (even if it started getting stale) is gone as well.The main characters are themselves are too busy with the fights to notice this stuff until the last episode. You’d think something this batshit would be exciting after all the repetitive tournament fights, but it comes right out of nowhere. It feels less “holy shit this is awesome” and more “really, this is what we’re going for”. The plot starts non-existent and ends stupidly.The main character turns out to a reincarnation of a famous literary character without any prior build-up (at least non that I can remember). It happens. It just happens.A lot of shounen try to have complicated lore and ideas but most of them spread it out over like 50 eps. This tried to cram them into 13.The Animation (Ok I’ll admit, it’s good)With all this being said, this show might have some of the best action scenes this year. The choreography for the martial arts combined with extreme dynamic shots makes it is a feast to behold. It even helps the characters feel more unique as you began to recognize their different fighting styles just through the fighting itself. Even the final episode which reaches new levels of the dumb plot reveals has an amazing fighting scene that takes advantage of the protagonist’s newfound power up.It really is a shame there was nothing else to flesh out these fight scenes. By the end, there’s also less of them than before with the focus going more on the supernatural powers.Final ThoughtsI’ve heard that the original manwha is better. That Crunchyroll and Mappa heavily rushed through the first arc which is what caused the pacing problem. This however doesn’t change the fact that The God of Highschool anime is bad.Even if they’re the highlight, you can do a shounen with nothing but fights. There’s need to be substance underneath; proper characters, world-building, and just overall personality. And they need to be done without being so rushed and sloppy. As it is God of Highschool just feels empty. a year later. And there’s a good reason why.The ‘Plot’Do you like tournament arcs? This is just a giant tournament arc; there’s a tournament and people fight in it. A huge tournament in South Korea called the God of Highschool. Here, High Scholars as you can imagine fight in various styles of the honor of being the champion or the hokage or something like that. At first, it’s kinda fun as you watch the main characters take on different martial artists with different fighting styles based seemingly on real-world martial arts. However this is going on and on and eventually, those real-world martial arts get replaced with magic. It’s losing even that.The show has pretty much nothing else to offer. Also bullshit happens. There’s a conspiracy theory about the tournament being used by a cult to someone a demon but the show rushes through exposition so quickly, I honestly couldn’t tell you the details.The pacing and plot of the anime are terrible. The first few episodes are completely taken up by the fighting, with no character, and pretty much no plot. It’s just fighting, after fight, after fight with the occasional exposition dump to abruptly inject some plot into the show.Shounen Done BadYou could argue that fighting is the point, it is a shounen after all. The thing is though good shounen like My Hero Academia, Hunter X Hunter, or Rurouni Kenshin realized is that you need to take some time off the fighting and better define the characters and world. Those are the things to make people invested, so they care about the people doing the fighting.When Deku and Bakugo fight in MHA, the tension doesn’t just come from two different dudes in silly costumes slamming fists against each other. It comes from watching a kid who’s been bullied all his life finally stand up to his bully and prove his worth and whether or not he’ll be able to do so. That internal conflict makes the fight seem real. Without it, the fights would be empty and nonengaging.The ‘Characters’God of Highschool’s cast is more or less catchphrase spewing sock puppets they’re such nothing characters. On our main character, we have Jin; the hot-headed lead. Han, the more reserved responsible member of the group, and Mira, the girl. They really aren’t anything more than that.Even when it tries to slow down and give the cast more development, it feels rushed and shallow. You have so little time to get to know the cast that you’ll barely remember their names. This means when they start getting up on their soapbox about their feelings and dreams in typical shounen fashion, you can’t help but yawn. Yeah we know they can punch good but we know little of their personality.

Due to Myanimelist rules they didn't let me review before the season was finished, but now it has, and my axe is sharpened. Are you ready, God of High School?I'm reading a lot of hype for this series, apparently from fans of the Webtoon, but as a viewer approaching it fresh, believe me when I say there is a lot of fan hype going on. Blind, unfounded, bigoted fan hype. Now that it has finished hopefully people are seeing it for what it is. Trash.My first criticism will be leveled at the art. It affected my enjoyment of...the show immensely because there was something salvageable here. The hand to hand fights were long and had great animation. But the character designs just took me out of the moment every time.The art is appalling. The character designs are a genuine crime against humanity. The original author clearly has a gripe against the human form, because the monstrosities that he draws are nauseating. It isn't a matter of talent or sloppiness, the hideousness was intentional and makes me question the authors mental state. Why would you subject yourself to watching the whole series you might ask? Because I was hoping some of the other elements would be enjoyable, and I am a sucker for action.The fights are animated very well, and look cool, but the writing of them is trash. It goes like this, protag opens fight against opponent. Opponent comments that the protag has no chance because their skill is better. Protag is beaten to a pulp by opponent with fighting moves. Finally as protag is about to lose, protag begins using magic power. Magic power is so OP that opponent is easily beaten. Just terrible writing.So there is some enjoyment of pretty action, at least during the actual tournament that kept me watching, but the character designs disgusted me so much I couldn't really enjoy it. So aggravating.Aside from the art, the story, characters, and writing are also trash, and completely obliterate any chance of enjoyment. The 3 main leads are the least likable characters in the series. It didn't have to be that way, but the writer suffered from a bad case of fan fiction, and made the leads get through the story beats without struggle. They never earned their victories. I say it didn't have to be that way because the writer wrote compelling characters and arcs for the other competitors destined to lose. In a matter of minutes, other characters were developed with enjoyable arcs and struggles to get where they were in the tournament, but the writer then had to have them all lose to the leads because he just had to have the leads always succeed. The leads never earned their victories. There was no chance for them to win, but the writer would have them win anyway, crushing the actually interesting characters along the way. That might be worse than the art actually.I address a little of the fan fiction nature of the story and characterizations, but little did I know just how far it went. I knew initially the main lead was a rip off of Goku, but while Goku was based on the Monkey King, but was decidedly different and had a totally different story, the author here made the MC the actual Monkey King. Thats right, the actual Monkey King. Worse still, its clear at the end the series is going to go on to full on rip off Journey to the West. Not to mention ripping off the dragon ball make a wish at the end of the arc cliche.I suppose some enjoyed the manga in the way that some people pretentiously like when someone rehashes something that has been done before, but to me, I look to the truly creative, the new stories. Borrow some elements from other works, go right ahead, but to recover famous stories again? Creatively bankrupt in my opinion. the show immensely because there was something salvageable here.

Creatively bankrupt in my opinion."", 'I wrote a very nitpicky rant on the pacing and leaving out parts of the webtoon that made the ""story"" better. I got shat on.Story: 3/10 The story is not there. They just left out every bit of exposition, especially the half assed adaptation of the recruitment. That part of the webtoon was enjoyable and made us understand the characters more. A little break from the action would be nice once in a while. Deciding to cut out all of the exposition and replacing them with still images was so annoying to look at. At the moment it\'s just fight fight fight. Exposition serves a...very good purpose and cutting that out is so dumb because it makes the story look stale.Art: 8/10 Animation is good, as expected of Mappa. Beautiful fight scenes. The red noses don\'t actually bother me, but the announcer\'s red nose does lol. But one complaint is that, once again, they don\'t take things slow. I\'m nitpicky here, but the three phase kick was so bad. It was 3 quick shots in the anime, but in the webtoon it looked like it was in slow motion and had bright colors on a white background. In the anime they did neither of that and it looked so unimportant.Sound: 7/10 I like the techno sometimes. It fits with the chaos and the teenagers and city setting. Sometimes it\'s a little overwhelming. Opening was good in the beginning with the good vocals, but towards the end it was kind of noisy. Ending is perfect, it was chill and pleasing to listen to. Unfortunately people don\'t appreciate endings. Voice acting is okay, but the main cast are all relatively new voice actors, so the voice acting wasn\'t mineblowing, which is a huge disappointment. At least add a veteran like Kana Hanazawa, but instead they made a veteran (Sugita Tomokazu) voice a character that appears in like 2 episodes and never again. Wasted potential.Character: 3/10 Characters are meh. People cried at Daewi\'s childhood friend in the anime and in the webtoon. I didn\'t cry in both, and believe me I\'m the type to cry in every type of entertainment media. I cried in every single episode of Violet Evergarden, that\'s how emotional I am. But this one failed to strike my heartstrings. The only bit of empathy I showed was a single ""aww. That sucks."" ONCE AGAIN! I cannot stress this enough. Half assed exposition. Just a random backstory. Daewi is a meh cool bro character, Mori is a wow hyperactive kid character, Mira is a omg hotheaded tsundere determined serious character. The commissioners are meh, except that Park Mujin guy. A bit more interesting.Enjoyment: 5/10 It was fun watching Mappa\'s animation. But the constant leaving out stuff from the webtoon really annoyed me at times, making me annoyed for the rest of the episode.Overall: 5/10 Why did you have to make the pacing so bad? What makes a good shounen is the build up, the exposition, the building of characters so the audience can sympathize. Instead what we get is a show filled with mindless fighting. I was waiting for years for an adaptation of one of the first webtoons I read, but instead I get a half assed adaptation. All of the points went to the animation, opening and ending, none on everything else.

And I\'ll start by saying this: it\'s good but it could have been amazing.Crunchyroll really dropped the ball by not making this first ""season"" of GoHS a 24-26 episode cour. Not only would the absurd powercreep progression felt more natural, but they would have been able to devote some more time to fleshing out the characters (I\'m so fucking...mad they didn\'t adapt MuBONG and ManDEOK being fully grown adults and mocking each other about their names). It would have also been more well-received by the majority of people who watched, as the #1 complaint seems to be the pacing and how quickly it jumps from set-piece to set-piece. But I guess that\'s what CR wanted to focus on with this adaptation, i.e. ""put every set-piece from the beginning to Mori Jin\'s big reveal, and just cut the fat where necessary"".The fat is what would have made the series feel more substantial, and would have added some much needed depth to the characters as well, which is the #2 complaint I see on these boards: the characters are bland. If I\'m honest with you anime-onlys, the characters aren\'t that deep in the Webtoon either, and if anything this beginning tournament sets them up for the development later on down the road. The comedy is fine, it fully copies the style from the Webtoon, but there\'s not much character context as to why the gags are happening. For example, Il-Pyo\'s female teammate gets a nosebleed when she sees him in Fox form. I feel this joke lends itself a lot better when you have the context of the characters from the Webtoon, rather than just shoving the joke in there and assuming the audience will pick up on why she\'s getting horny.To MAPPA\'s credit, they did a fantastic job with what they had been commissioned for by CR. The animation is slick, the OST is great, and the seiyuus did an awesome job bringing the characters to life. It\'s just such a shame that they didn\'t have a bigger timeframe and budget to work with, because then I doubt this anime would be receiving the stupidly absurd levels of criticism it is facing at the moment.Oh, and for everyone who\'s saying; ""It\'s just a mix of shounen troupes and cliches with only good animation to save it"", that is Kimetsu no Yaiba to a capital T and that somehow got to the top 50 on MAL.

Hyped up because it doesn't come from traditional source material and because it is really good.God of highschool is the name of a fighting tournament with highschoolers. If they win, they get whatever they want. That's really all you need to know about that. The plot itself a little fast paced though.

And since the characters all have similar goals of pushing the goals and philosophies of their masters/ those before...them.

There are quick flashbacks for like 1 ep per character but it feels so out of place, and...it just feels rushed.Putting the bad pacing and story aside the fight choreography and animation for the first few episodes really blew me away, i would go to say the best Martial Arts animation I  have ever seen in anime.

This had a lot of potential, but it clearly just didn't work.Beginning with the story. We start off at a martial arts competition to see the best fighter in Seoul, and then in Korea. Seems simple enough, and if it were just a tournament anime, then I would be fine with it. But then there's so much lore that gets introduced in a short period of time. Charyeok? Let's put that in. Political warfare? Sure, that fits in fine. Mass destruction? Somehow gotta slide that in. It's just...a convoluted mess. There's no cohesion on what happens in the story. It's just action, action, emotion, action. There's no actual storyline - just stories.The art and animation was one of the highlights here.

If anything, this makes me hopeful for future titles directed by this person, and with MAPPA.The soundtrack is so weird. On the one hand, it feels unique and fun, but on the other hand, it feels super generic. Some of the tracks sound like a discount My Hero Academia, or a discount Hiroyuki Sawano track; they sound really similar in style. Other times, it sounds really great, and actually unique.

So much so that I'm unsure if I would change my ratings or not, considering I do think I'm giving this show a little too many points but I can't really give it too much of a low score either.First of all, I did read the source material, so watching this feels so different. A lot of content was skipped or changed to make the 13 episode runtime while probably covering over 100 chapters, and boy does that show.Any lore, techniques, or basically any information about the characters or the world around them are basically skipped and...only show the fighting, which, while animated quite nicely, cannot hold the show by itself. And when I mean skipped, I literally mean skipped. There are people close to the main character who despises his grandpa, but whoops, you don't get to see that nor will it be built up so whenever a scene would come up, it would have no emotional backing.I can definitely see why people are just calling it a stereotypical fighting anime because fighting is all that they're basically adapting. Occasionally they cover the main character's past and motivations, but even that is severely missing some parts. All I can say is that this is a poor but well animated adaption that you should honestly read the source material to get more of an enjoyment while only watching the fight scenes of the anime (which is basically the whole anime). only show the fighting, which, while animated quite nicely, cannot hold the show by itself.

Sadly this show is not one to watch for its story. It starts off promising for the first 2 episodes but then devolves into a trashy mess of incoherent twists and ill defined powers. Nothing is developed on, everything is left off vague. and in the end you're left with way more questions to even bother having the slightest interest to delve into trying to figure anything out. Instead of flushing out what's already on the table from the first 2 episodes and explaining why highschool students...can break concrete with their bare fists, they keep introducing new character with new powers that don't solve anything. Nothing makes sense, characters are one dimensional, loose ends galore in the end.People criticize Black Lagoon for being a dumb action show but I believe this is a real example of what a dumb action show looks like. Black Lagoon had its flaws but in the end it had a very multidimensional relationship between the two main characters that the show was based around. It just didn't hold your hand so people might have missed it. But there's no hand to hold on this one, the hand doesn't even exist because this show has no story, its a bunch of random events happening and you're just along for the ride. It's hard to express my disappointment with this one.My score of 2 is all given towards MAPPA at doing an amazing job with the animation and visuals. The rest is pretty trashy with no merit what so ever. can break concrete with their bare fists, they keep introducing new character with new powers that don't solve anything.

Unfortunately, I\'m sober and can string two words together to make a sentence, which is not the right way to watch this.For one, it was already rubbing me the wrong way at the start because the premise was far too similar to a lesser known Chinese-based anime called Hitori no Shita. Super special kid grows up with badass fighting grandpa who leaves him behind to...protect his safety and everyone is searching for the kid to exploit his powers and kid ends up fighting in a series of tournaments. It\'s slow, meandering, and mediocre, but at least some of the fight scenes were entertaining.

What I\'m trying to say is it is Eastern inspired crayon vomit.There is zero plot. Something something world domination, gods, nanomachines, guns, secret societies, high school students, stuff blowing up, magical powers spewing everywhere, cataclysmic events, the rapture, and the faintest of martial arts. It\'s a fast-paced, rollercoaster of vomit. A vomit comet. I actually first heard of this anime from a worthless anime youtuber that I happened to stumble across. He had read the manwa and said there wasn\'t enough good martial arts anime, that the Japanese weren\'t into martial arts, and that this was going to be AMAZING, with technical skill and physical mastery of the body, and you know, actual kung-fu. What he meant to say was, OMG they are going to be shooting lasers out of their ass, slicing the air with their fingertips, and pulling disembodied spirits and mountain-sized godly apparitions from their nether regions to armageddon the ring during each fight. Needless to say, he was full of shit. The actual ""martial arts"" is just some flailing and streaks of paint for limbs before a million different powers, spells, and magic bombs get triggered. The horrible CGI Baki on Netflix is more martial arts than this.We have phoenixes, we have nine-tailed foxes, we have giant buddhas falling from the sky, we have the f--king monkey king and his extendo stick (god damn original!), we have grim reapers, we have wizards, we have divine dragons, we have everything AND the kitchen sink vomited onto one show, all flashing by exceedingly quickly, with no rhyme or reason, with the fate of the world at stake, and mindless characters fighting and trying to act cool. There is no system. No rules. No limits. No boundaries. Let your imagination run wild! Not a single thing consequential. Not a single moment of tension or display of ingenuity at overcoming some obstacle. Because there are no obstacles. It\'s a drunken party baby!And thus it\'s so ridiculously boring I would stare off into space as random fight scenes flashed by and they jibber-jabbered about nonsense.

Is it just a bad anime adaptation? Was God of High School never actually that good? I really couldn’t tell you, all I can say is that in my opinion, GoH has been the most disappointing anime this season.Tl;dr -- I don’t recommend you watch this show, everything about it is disappointing, the art, the characters, everything. That being said, if you take what everyone was saying about this show before it aired with a grain of salt, the webtoon was pretty good.Story: 6 TOURNAMENT A---wait a second you call this a tournament...arc???One of the great appeals of TOURNAMENT ARCS or TOURNAMENT shows is the idea that you don’t know who’s going to win a fight. The feeling of rooting for a certain character and watching them fight in interesting and unique ways, overcoming obstacles, and eventually winning is absolutely great and is the main reason why I love them. GoH has absolutely NONE of that, in the beginning of the anime you were absolutely certain who was going to win because there was no character balance. You had main and established characters going up against some goofy goober they introduced last episode where they had one cool moment beating up faceless extras and expected you to be excited about the fight. It’s not exciting but again, it probably doesn’t have to be, as long as the rest of the show is cool it doesn't really matter. I will admit there were about one or two decent fights, and the story wasn’t absolutely unbearable but it's a show where the characters actively bring DOWN the story instead of carrying it.Art: 7 I won’t pretend to be a connoisseur of art but everything about the art is lackingGood art doesn’t make an anime, there are plenty of examples of shows with pretty lackluster visuals that ended up being absolute bangers. MAPPA has already established themselves as a really good studio which makes the inconsistency of the show’s visuals even more confusing. Sometimes it's great, something it looks like trash and where it really confuses you is that you can never tell when or where the quality is going to drop so you’re occasionally either pleasantly surprised or woefully let down.Sound: 7 ngl that opening and ending was pretty sickThere really isn’t much today about the sound, which is probably a good thing, sometimes anime will focus too much on the audio and it ends up overshadowing the animation… unfortunately as I said earlier the animation is pretty lackluster anyway so it kind of needed a really good soundtrack.Character:6 Boring, bland, unoriginal, and horribly balancedAs I said earlier, the characters in this story are really unbalanced, the main characters will get in fights where their opponent just got HAM on them, wholloping on them from head to toe, using their final moves on them and the character barely gets hurt. They pull one of their secret moves and win, while this isn’t exactly uncommon, especially in anime, it's super repetitive in this show and really really adds to the idea that you’ll always know who’s going to win in a fight.Enjoyment 3: Not very enjoyable, I leave every episode… at least after episode 3 thinking: “this is what everyone was excited about?”I don’t think webtoons have a real chance in the medium of anime and not because they’re bad, people have to be excited about these webtoons for SOME reason. I feel this way because there’s too much the anime has to cram for a 12 episode anime. Tokyo Ghoul had the same issue, where the story was condensed in order to fit the entire story into something that just ended way too quickly. Maybe I’m wrong though, Noblesse is coming out soon and I’ll take whatever I can get at this point.Overall: 6Despite what I said earlier, I’m not against Korean Webtoons getting anime. Getting more influence is the genre of entertainment that is anime gives up an amazing opportunity for a greater range of shows that, in turn, may even bring more people to start watching anime. That being said, GoH in my opinion has NOT been a step in the correct direction, it's forced and leaves a lot to be desired. I’d recommend you skip out on this anime. arc???One of the great appeals of TOURNAMENT ARCS or TOURNAMENT shows is the idea that you don’t know who’s going to win a fight.

I will admit there were about one or two decent fights, and the story wasn’t absolutely unbearable but it's a show where the characters actively bring DOWN the story instead of carrying it.Art: 7 I won’t pretend to be a connoisseur of art but everything about the art is lackingGood art doesn’t make an anime, there are plenty of examples of shows with pretty lackluster visuals that ended up being absolute bangers. MAPPA has already established themselves as a really good studio which makes the inconsistency of the show’s visuals even more confusing. Sometimes it's great, something it looks like trash and where it really confuses you is that you can never tell when or where the quality is going to drop so you’re occasionally either pleasantly surprised or woefully let down.Sound: 7 ngl that opening and ending was pretty sickThere really isn’t much today about the sound, which is probably a good thing, sometimes anime will focus too much on the audio and it ends up overshadowing the animation… unfortunately as I said earlier the animation is pretty lackluster anyway so it kind of needed a really good soundtrack.Character:6 Boring, bland, unoriginal, and horribly balancedAs I said earlier, the characters in this story are really unbalanced, the main characters will get in fights where their opponent just got HAM on them, wholloping on them from head to toe, using their final moves on them and the character barely gets hurt. They pull one of their secret moves and win, while this isn’t exactly uncommon, especially in anime, it's super repetitive in this show and really really adds to the idea that you’ll always know who’s going to win in a fight.Enjoyment 3: Not very enjoyable, I leave every episode… at least after episode 3 thinking: “this is what everyone was excited about?”I don’t think webtoons have a real chance in the medium of anime and not because they’re bad, people have to be excited about these webtoons for SOME reason. I feel this way because there’s too much the anime has to cram for a 12 episode anime. Tokyo Ghoul had the same issue, where the story was condensed in order to fit the entire story into something that just ended way too quickly. Maybe I’m wrong though, Noblesse is coming out soon and I’ll take whatever I can get at this point.Overall: 6Despite what I said earlier, I’m not against Korean Webtoons getting anime. Getting more influence is the genre of entertainment that is anime gives up an amazing opportunity for a greater range of shows that, in turn, may even bring more people to start watching anime. That being said, GoH in my opinion has NOT been a step in the correct direction, it's forced and leaves a lot to be desired. I’d recommend you skip out on this anime."", '(SPOILER FREE)Recently the trend for the past two seasons has been ""Crunchyroll Webtoon Adaptations"". Now, God of Highschool is by no means a great anime adaptation and at this moment in time I wouldn\'t recommend wasting time on watching it.Whilst GOH isn\'t an inherently awful, this anime fails to capture the intensity and well written story from the original source. The first 5 episodes are extremely mundane but after that the story shows off more flashy techniques and actually starts to shape up what the anime has to offer for the future....Until you realise that this is only 13 episodes long and will suffer...the same fate that \'Tower of God\' faced- a rushed story that struggles to encapsulate its viewers- at least in TOG there were some decent characters that were built up from the get go and as viewers we had the relationship of Rachel and Twenty-Fifth Bam to focus on.On a positive note, we can see that anime as a medium is having a massive overhaul, webtoons are going to be more common and as they experiment with anime adaptations such as GOH they can only get better with future releases. the same fate that \'Tower of God\' faced- a rushed story that struggles to encapsulate its viewers- at least in TOG there were some decent characters that were built up from the get go and as viewers we had the relationship of Rachel and Twenty-Fifth Bam to focus on.On a positive note, we can see that anime as a medium is having a massive overhaul, webtoons are going to be more common and as they experiment with anime adaptations such as GOH they can only get better with future releases.', ""I watched the first 3 or 4 episodes and was delighted. I liked the opening very much, and the fights and history were engaging. I had nothing to attach to.BUT after the 4th episode, I heard someone's review (I don't remember whose) that it is completely different from the original, that the fights are weak and the story is cut short.And that someone WAS right. I started reading the manga (which I had on my reading list) and my rating went down. Dramatically. The story does not so much deviate from the original, as it omits and twists many things from the original manga. The...fights are good, but it's definitely not the manga level. Many characters have lost their stories.However, this does not mean that it is not worth watching. The animation is nice and well done, better than the first chapters of the manga. Combined with the music, it creates great moments, I still remember the fight from episode 10.My recommendation would be to watch the anime before reading the manga and not touch it until the anime is finished. fights are good, but it's definitely not the manga level.

The initial goal was to win the tournament and have a wish granted, then WHAM!! A religious cult makes it\'s presence known. We meet more characters that eventually play a big role later on, but everyone appears out of no where and does quite little. But they do influence the sequence of events, I suppose.Later we learn about the odd power most of the characters of wield. This power allows...them to manifest a spirit, in which they are able to control and abuse the abilities it comes with. The spirits are called, Charyeoks. Upon the first Charyeok encounter, we\'re greeted with this ""Joker"" spirit summoned by Q. An ominous presence that takes everyone by surprise (and the beginning of Q\'s salary reduction). In the beginning, it was a pretty neat concept, then it started to get confusing. When other fighters would reveal their Charyeoks, we clearly witness their opponents feel the effects, bleed, and even die. But seconds later, they\'re completely fine. No blood, no wounds, and life given back into their carcass. But some people do end up losing their anatomy and autonomy? It may be nothing more than a visual error, however, it may as well not.The ending of this show went into a direction I was not anticipating. Honestly, all I was hoping for was a tournament, not... all that.(To avoid spoilers, I shan\'t say more.)Art - 8The art style was pleasing. I really liked the design and palette for most of the characters. They all have their own unique styles and looks, nothing too similar. However, there were some characters with resembling features.Animation- 8MAPPA did a great job animating this piece of work. The choreography was excellent, the lighting was great, the use of color (especially in the OP) was appealing. Some scenes were a little bland and the change in animation during the battle between Daewi and Jin was a bit jarring. Pretty cool, but jarring.Sound - 7The opening was pretty good, not something I\'d add to a playlist nor listen to regularly, but good enough for what it was.The ending receives the same treatment, it\'s a bit too poppy for me.The voice acting was solid and great choices for the characters (I watched the Sub).The supporting tracts were great, I especially enjoyed what we received in episode ten.Characters - 6In terms of character development, there\'s not too much to speak of.Frankly, Daewi has had the most ""development"". While we don\'t much about him, we\'re aware of his goal, and we see how he changes due to the dire situation he was placed in, thus increasing his despair and desperation.Mira was something I didn\'t expect. Episode four changed my perspective of her, but I understood it, in a way. She was desperate and knew what she wanted, and was willing to obtain it no matter the cost. But it was very random. Also, Mira loves muscles, I was kind of hoping that would play out as a hindrance at some point; but, it went no where.Jin didn\'t change at all, he had a small moment where he shifted his character, but it didn\'t last long.The others, well, there are only few important characters who are talked about and given backstories. We know nothing about the judges, we knew nothing about Shim, and know nothing about Mujin. Is he a villain, maybe, he sure looks and acts the part sometimes.Overall, Han Daewi is the best character.Enjoyment - 7When Mira face planted into the Highway sign, I knew this was a show I would most definitely enjoy, and that I did. While I would not have minded a show where I could simply spectate challengers dueling in a way that is not only entertaining, but accompanied by stunning visuals, I do appreciate and wish to follow the presented story line. In all honesty, the team portion of the tournament wasn\'t as engaging as the one on one battles. It\'s at this point where when we started to get the shounen features (such as flashbacks). The story kept jumping from one thing to another, introduced characters only to have them mentioned no more, and by the end, my enjoyment dwindled a little. For me, my overall enjoyment wasn\'t deprived due to the story, rather the action. I wanted more Taekwondo and less...anime. It came to a point where their spiritual abilities overshadowed their spiritual in-dominance. The story was pretty wild, however.Overall - 7In conclusion, The God of High School is an anime following Jin Mori, Daewi Han, and Yoo Mira. They willingly battle akin challengers to make it out on top, for the winner receives any one wish they so desire. It\'s an action packed show that, believe me, does not stop moving. The story may seem confounding, but it is nevertheless, a good watch.I very much enjoyed this anime. It has some of the best animated fights scenes I\'ve observed in a while, It made me laugh, the characters are likable, and it\'s very interesting.

So far, there is little in the way of an actual narrative besides the fights. There's been implications, build up, some set up of certain things, but it's hard to tell where all of this is going or leading to. Sometimes the series just throws random new developments at your face, and episodes later still hasn't explained them, so you're left wondering wtf is going on.While it can be interesting and good for pacing, hopefully the series will deliver on all of this rather than just keep blowing through itself full speed. The first 2 or so episodes were good at both...giving consistent quality fights and developing the characters well, but the recent episodes (4 especially) were honestly garbage. 5 has been a return to form in some ways, but seems to also exacerbate problems like the power scaling.Art: 10/10. Great looking show with amazing fights and choreography.Sound: 7/10. Decent enough, gets you pumped but not a lot of memorable tracks.Character: 6/10. Ok so far, will need to see how they develop. As mentioned already, it feels like empty promises right now and a hint of something better to come. The characters right now range from forgettable to going in a good direction and might be interesting later on.Enjoyment: 7/10. It's a fun series to watch, I look forward to it every Monday.Overall: 6/10. Barely decent, does things well like the fights, and handles the pacing well enough except for Episode 4 which was a catastrophe and should've just been skipped (funnily enough that episode alone brought the user score down from like 8.2 to 7.9, that says enough about how bad it was). Has potential to be a good 7 or even 8/10 if it can develop its characters, start making use of its world and actually for once explain its power system. As it is now though, the only thing propelling this series to above mediocre is the awesome animation and art style, fresh pacing that doesn't bog itself down too much and the potential the series has for more.EDIT: After a few more episodes, I am revising my rating:Story: 5/10 -> 4/10Art: 10/10 -> 9/10.Sound: 7/10 -> 6/10Character: 6/10 -> 3/10Enjoyment: 7/10 -> 5/10Overall: 6/10 -> 4/10Series definitely is below average for me, as this deep in we have a very lazy cast of characters with little depth, the plot is mushed together and severely lacking, episode 4 was a pace killer and I'm baffled as to why it was an episode, the power system is nonsensical and will probably lead to egregious power creep with no reason, etc. It's a good series to watch if you want to just have eye-candy, even then though I'd say there are better series out there with phenomenal art AND actual plot and memorable characters.Edit 2: Now that the anime is ending, I am revising my rating ONCE AGAIN.Story: 4/10 -> 3/10.

I haven't read it, but it’s an anime about martial arts, should be cool, right?Well, let's start with what did not impress me.>>>CONS:PACING: The pacing in this show is messed up. It’s so ridiculously fast that you can’t bother to care about what happens next. There is no build up or anticipation for fights, drama, or anything. It just happens--sometimes before you’ve even processed what happened right...before. Fast pacing can be good for some animes, but for this storyline it made the show feel like somebody wrote plot points without writing the transitions between them.PLOT: Speaking of the storyline, not only is it messed up by the pacing, but it is also generic. A competition of “who is the best fighter” with (who would have guessed it?) ulterior motives. I won’t spoil anything, but as mentioned before, plot points zip by one after another, and yet none are unique. If you write down a list of generic shounen plots and tropes and string them together, you have God of HighSchool.CHARACTERS: When I see a bad plot with good characters, it instantly lifts my spirits. This is not the case in GoH. Our three main characters have no depth to them. Each has one specific motive and nothing else. The pacing of how we get to know them and how they get to know each other makes them unrelatable, and even makes their friendship feel forced. We are essentially introduced to 3 generic tropes (the goof ball but strong protagonist, the silent type, and the female trying to prove she’s as strong as everyone else) and are told they are friends despite very few interactions together beforehand. They have little chemistry together and are not interesting on their own.So what’s good about this anime? Two things and two things only.>>>PROSSOUND: If you are a fan of EDM, this anime has a great track. The opening is an epic dubstep that fools you into thinking the rest of the show will be as good. This is, of course, a lie, but the song is still great. The ED is also pretty chill.ANIMATION: The true gem of this anime is the animation. Despite how bad everything else is, the animation is the reason I do not rate this show lower. Certain fight scenes are flawlessly smooth and intriguing with the martial arts. The problem here is that, first, the pacing is so fast that these fights are unsatisfyingly short in the first 6 episodes (I’m talking 2 minutes long). Second, after the first 6 episodes, the fights do not have the same martial arts choreography and lose some appeal. Third, since there is no attachment to the storyline or the characters, it’s difficult to get attached to the fight scenes. The best fight scenes have great background, buildup, and context to hype you up for it beforehand; GoH has none of these.>>>CONCLUSION: The only thing GoH really has going for it are the animation and sound. My recommendations are to either 1.) look up just the fight scenes and soundtrack, 2.) watch the show without being sober so you don’t care about it having no context or 3.) Skip the show altogether because there are far better shounen animes out there. before.

Normal-ish humans to some Fate Zero levels in 13 episodes.The fighting was enjoyable though. The plot wasn't great but not terrible either.It didn't like giving answers to questions created, which annoys me. I think that's due to the length of the webtoon it's based on though.If you're some anime snob that only watches the best of the best, you'll probably be disappointed.For a more welcoming viewer looking for entertainment, give it a go....I prefer short and to the point reviews with less flowery words to detract from the actual opinion, but myanimelist doesn't allow for short reviews.The more said, the less said in my opinion.

I thought they were done well. However, I wouldn\'t have continued if it weren\'t for how much I liked the characters, especially the protagonist Jin. Because unfortunately, the part that bothered me the most was the plot.The show depicts a group of villains called ""Nox"" but doesn\'t ever explain how or why they came to be, much less their purpose. They say they want to end all humans essentially, but that\'s not...enough of an answer to me.Also, the show is literally called God of High School, but other than the characters who are participating in the tournament being teenagers, there\'s no point in saying the term ""high school."" They never show them in a school, ever. Maybe that\'s me being picky, but genuinely there is never a scene where they are studying in school OR even fighting in a school. Like, it\'s all at an arena - so why mention that or have it in the title?Even more so - what is the point of finding this ""god of high school?"" They never explain why the tournament happens, and other than getting a wish granted when you win, there\'s no discussion of what else it means for the winners. Like, do they win and then go back to being school students? That would be an odd transition. But, the end has the kids wanting to tour around and find certain things, so again - are they even in school? Why not just say God of Japan? That way, they could have more than teenagers fighting in this, and then it wouldn\'t confuse me so much that school isn\'t involved in some way if they were 23 and not 15/16.Last, the cheryok. So...once again, a plot device that had no justification for its input. Essentially, these are god figures that humans can ""borrow"" power from. But how? How can humans do this? Why would Gods let the humans do this? I didn\'t understand the relationship between these two one bit. While I often don\'t mind suspending my belief, I think because this show had so many other questions, I couldn\'t let go of this one either.With all that said, this show really has some great potential -  AS LONG AS -  they begin to answer these questions/plot holes going into the second season and so on.Do I think it\'s worth watching?

It's even worse than Overlord. I can't believe I even took the time to write up this review. Some slight spoilers below.It's a giant power fantasy (something I'm all for), but it's not even a good one. It had epic battles, but they were completely meaningless, hollow, inconsistent, terribly paced, and lacking any sense of importance or stakes, and thus entirely unsatisfying. It...utilized biblical, religious, & cultural themes & references and esoteric symbolism (another thing I really appreciate when done right), but in no meaningful or impactful capacity, in no way comparable to the profoundly genius use of these things in something like the masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion.The art style is unappealing, especially with all of the unnecessary red noses. All the fights and nearly all the characters and their developments are generic tropes, not even done well. There's no consistency in character abilities or the rules of the world, which make suspension of disbelief impossible. Everyone is flinging around new abilities with arbitrary names that don't actually differentiate in presentation or impact from any other, and none of these new 'skills' are earned in a meaningful fashion, so all the 'moves' are generic and pointless.Every single action and fight scene is filled with major logical plot holes. The inconsistency of wounds is particularly jarring, such as where some people can get impaled with blood spurting everywhere while in the next shot they're completely fine with no wound or blood; meanwhile others get critically wounded with simple actions. The whole world disregarding all of the insanity and supernatural things that take place right in front of them just adds to how logically flawed the whole thing is. Even towards the ending, which inexplicably involves nuking other countries, occurs with no consequence or recognition on a global scale as it actually would. There's a 'god' fight here with evolving abilities, but it's pretty terrible and meaningless, and involves next to no tactical depth, emotional weight, or impactful stakes. For examples of an epic god-tier, final-boss fight done right, see Naruto, Bleach, One-Punch Man, Seven Deadly Sins, Gurren Lagann, and practically any other power shounen.The keyframe animation is impressive, but the camera angles and quick cuts left a lot of room for improvement in presentation. The vast majority of the fighting animation was unsatisfying and uninteresting because of how it was presented, with many actions being unclear or straight-up illogical and spatially impossible. Cool characters, but next to none of them are developed in any capacity. The series as a whole is disrespectful and a slap in the face to actual martial arts - if you want something that actually respects martial arts while telling an incredible epic power fantasy, go read Gamaran or Veritas instead. The whole series is a giant mishmash of intriguing ideas, all of which are poorly executed. There were only a few real, meaningful moments and moments of character development early on in the series, while it completely mishandled all its topics for everything else. It also broke its serious moments with tonally deaf injections of playful humor.The concept of the tournament itself makes little sense, same with the core plot. Plus the fact that the presenters, referee, and public are completely ok with straight-up abuse and murder happening right on the stage in front of everyone is baffling and entirely unrealistic. Same with the scale of the fighting stages in comparison to the characters and their abilities, where it seems to 'grow' as is convenient for awesome fighting shots. There's no barrier protecting the audience in these stages either, which makes no sense, considering people and abilities often get flung far out of bounds of the stage. Plus the referee idiotically and unrealistically stays within the stage when the fighting starts, fully aware that these people will be using powers with wildly far-reaching impacts that would hit him too. It is also a straight-up representation of what NOT to do for a tournament-based arc or series. With next to no focus on the fights in a meaningful way, everything falls flat and comes across as pointless. Battles are won in inconclusive and unsatisfying manners and actions. It's just a straight-up terrible tournament, easily the worst tournament I've ever witnessed.And this is only scratching the surface of everything wrong with this series.

Not only are their tournament arcs given more thought, but their characters are actually characters and not just walking reactions.The so called power system in this show is non-existant. It\'s supposed to be based around martial arts, but around episode 3-4 they introduce stands?? Which just makes no sense. It\'s like they\'re pulling all the most famous action anime tropes out of a bag with no understanding of how it works or why other stories use them. It\'s so infuriating to watch.They also do this with...the characters. The MC is just a Goku clone with no charm or traits to speak of, the other leads are boring run-of-the-mill side characters who ""only participate to help/honour a close friend/family member"".

'Talking from experience, this anime is for people whom have just finished a night shift round - the closest experience to being brain dead must be being sleep deprived - and wants something on the easiest side to swallow.Which is clearly its strongest point. Everything in this anime is a pretext to a fight scene (which are numerous), to the point...that it makes everything else - character dev, plot, dialogs (the worst part to me), you name it - looking absolutely awful.We've seen this kind of animes before (e.g Baki ONA, which I think is even worse than this one).But since animes come with all shapes and sizes, I can't dismiss the possibility that this show will found its audience among the people who needs a good fight, carefully avoiding ANYTHING relatively close to a conscious thought.If that's all you're asking for, The God of High School might be not so bad ...... maybe ? that it makes everything else - character dev, plot, dialogs (the worst part to me), you name it - looking absolutely awful.We've seen this kind of animes before (e.g Baki ONA, which I think is even worse than this one).But since animes come with all shapes and sizes, I can't dismiss the possibility that this show will found its audience among the people who needs a good fight, carefully avoiding ANYTHING relatively close to a conscious thought.If that's all you're asking for, The God of High School might be not so bad ...... maybe ?"", '-Bit of a disclaimer, but this anime is based off a webtoon manhwa, but i personally think that an adaptation should hold up on its own in terms of storywriting.There are things you should considered tweaking when it comes to adapting something and the anime having a good or bad plot should not be the fault of the og material. “But honestly you can\'t go wrong with a simple tournament story right?” YES YES YOU CAN,There is no sugar coating it, the writing in this anime is not just dog shit, its cat shit, its apeshit, its alllll the shit of every species...on earth combined into one huge form that is called GOH.As a matter of fact everytime i see a plot that fails on almost every basic rule of telling a story, it should be considered “GOH”d.At first it started out okay, it had fast ass pacing and sloppily told backstory, but i thought they would just commit to focusing on the tournament alone. And then that filler episode happened and everything went downhill, to the ground , through the crust and into the fiery depths of hell.The anime has 13 episodes worth of pacing but it feels like a lot of stuff was cut out and glued together in the first five episodes and then it just becomes borderline unwatchable afterwards.Shit just happens with no foreshadowing, people just pop in and dont show up again, the other stuff that happens is thrown in to happen at the same time that the tournament does, and the plot is basically all the elements of other anime but chopped up, put in a vitamix, and thrown into a warehouse fan.The tournament makes no sense either, people basically break rules and the tournament makers are just fine with it, so the tension of being kicked out of it is just not there.Also the unbalanced powers make no sense, some ppl have powers, some don\'t, but they still fight. ,it\'s like the equivalent of putting a mma fighter against a demon summoner. It feels like a child made it. Even the fights which are the only thing that puts this anime on the map (besides it being a webtoon adaptation) have no emotional weight to them. The factor that made them fun at the beginning was that they were fought by people themselves using only their bodies and minds, but that gets thrown out the window when people start summoning stands and getting possessed by demons and such, why? I don\'t know, GOD just gave it to them i guess.It tries to make every single fight some big grand final episode worthy fight, but since the stakes aren\'t there and the characters suck , the fights are just loud, lengthy, and bombastic with no substance to them.After that, the new powers that are introduced are just straight up nonsense and people including the mc automatically just have them now out of nowhere. Not to mention that some episodes, including the final one, are just nothing but fighting for half of it.To be honest everything else is just a combination of irrelevant characters and non- foreshadowed retcons , it got so bad that when the final episodes reached End of Evangelion levels of absurdity, i was just baffled how an innocent sports tournament anime turned to the absolute mess that it is, it honestly gave me more respect for anime like ikkitousen because at least it had a story, with rising action, a climax, falling action , and a conclusion. GOH on the other hand is just rising action,and one of those “stay tuned for season 2” endings, there is no climax because the anime doesn\'t know which climax it truly wants, from the grandpa situation, to the cult thing, to the rival childhood person, to another dude who is just possessed by demons now, to that one dude with the shark powers, to a bunch of other things.There is no excuse for a plot to be as messy as this.-Alrighty then, the art and animation.Basically the two things that made GOH relevant in the first place is the good looking animation and the fact that it\'s a webtoon comic. These are basically the only two selling gimmicks that crunchyroll advertises constantly and the hype is basically coming from people who either read the manhwa or people who saw episode one and immediately called GOH the “animu of 2020”. But in reality the animation only looks good in fight scenes, and then again it\'s not a consistent thing, some fights look really good while others look alright.I appreciate the times where ink styles are used and the choreography sometimes is impressive.Sometimes the cinematography was impressive.Some of the demon persona stand designs looked super sick too. I wish the fights incorporated more use of the actual environment since the setting that they are fighting in is super dim,bare,and bland.Most of the fights basically turn into explosions and concrete breaking and then not breaking and sometimes the arena looks normal size and other times it looks like a football field.Also I think its hilarious how MAPPA was so proud of the fights they made, they had to reuse them in the opening sequence but with some seizure inducing color schemes. The animation outside of fights is average tho because barely anything happened outside of the fights.I absolutely HATE the character designs, they are so fucking weird. Every and I mean EVERY character ,no matter what skin color,has this weird blush around their noses that is ridiculous,and they all look like they have the flu or something, their noses are so red that they can even make Rudolph the reindeer jealous. Also, the ears man, holy shit.what species of humans on Haruhi’s green earth have ears like those?They are all puffed up and out of proportion, they look like bees stung them. I thought I would get over those features, but they just got harder to stop looking at later on. It got to a point where I went to look at the actual style of the manhwa to see. It turns out that the blush is still there, BUT it\'s treated more as a flesh tone and there are other parts of their skin that balance out the color. And the ears aren\'t as puffy as the anime, so there is no “its following the original artstyle” debate here.Another thing i really don\'t like is the eyes on the mc, he has no catchlights in them and the other characters do so he looks dead sometimes, and the star things look like asta in black clover when he\'s acting funny, but in GOH, his eyes are always like that.it\'s just weird.-Music was whateverthe op as i said before was dank, despite it sounding like super awkward and trashy EDM with nonsensical lyrics, actually the lyrics of the God of Highschool OP are some of the dumbest lyrics I\'ve ever heard. let me give you some written example of this fine piece of art:  ""You make it look easy...….I\'m thinking hard right now"".....""You got me speachless.....im running my mouth"", and my favorite is ""cuz i know you want me, from the inside out,"" LMAO Linked Horizion, eat your heart out.  Despite how awful the op sounds, I couldn\'t stop listening to it. The ed is just generic millennial pop, the soundtrack was overbearing and inconsistent, and the audio mixing is weird at times.-*gag*Characters.The one phrase i ended up saying the most while watching was three simple words”who are you”Yep, this anime from episode one to thirteen introduces characters that you never even seen and if you\'re lucky, you might see that character more than once.But the true jackpot you need to look out for is a character that has some personality , with sensible screen time, development, and also happens to be a antagonist(that totally won\'t end up being a side character later because lol story telling ).I root for the antagonists because the main characters are pretty sloppy. They are your stereotypical characters, they become OP many times because they have to, the development they have with each other is forced, they are super smart but act really dumb when the plot allows, and they change their mindsets at the drop of a hat but the power of forced friendship causes them to basically be background characters for the rest of the show.The main guy, Jin Mo-Ri i really didnt care for. The three things about him is that he is obnoxious, he likes food,and he can get superpowerful , not by training  because thaaaat would be stupid,lol what is character development? he just has powers suddenly because he is the God. of. highschool i guess. The only thing i can think that is original about his character is that he might have deep , dark, and secret passion for his grandfather because he makes really stupid decisions for the sake of some guy he hasnt seen basically since he was a child, and he wakes up to a 60inch photo of his grandfather on his wall, and thats the only thing in his room too. When it comes to villains, it started out establishing some villains, and then the villains had villains, and then those villains fought other villains , it\'s such a mess. It got to a point where every single character introduced happened to be a villain but you would or would not know because lol what is pacing. And it doesnt help anything when almost every villain by the end just automatically doesn\'t become villains anymore since they don\'t do anything and a lot of them just end up being side characters for the side characters. I feel like this confusion could easily be remedied by having the audience sympathise with the side characters that don\'t stand a chance with OP main characters, but sadly, say it with me now “The pacing in the anime is ass”.-my experience with GOhI think my enjoyment of the show is the straw that breaks the camel\'s back. Because I\'m struggling to find a single moment outside of the first two episodes I enjoyed watching. Watching this weekly was such a pain. The one thing GOH had going for were the fights, sure they looked good but there is no risk or reward since the tournament just makes up rules as it goes.Sometimes the fights were just nonsensical ,none of the powers were explained going into the fight or during for that matter.And the fights feel like they last an eternity, there are times where i just mentally check out and think about other things like the Made in abyss movie or what i\'ll have for lunch, or my cringey ass MAL profile page i need to change. Meanwhile some main character with an asspull overpowered move is wrecking some irrelevant side character( oops i mean villain) that will never get more screen time.Outside of the fight scenes though, it\'s just incoherent exposition, flashbacks, forced chemistry with the main trio, unfunny comedy,and other meaningless stuff, i wanted to die.I kept getting flashbacks of watching Listeners where people you don\'t know would explain stuff but you still did not know what they were talking about.I either found myself bored out of my mind or looking at the swollen ears and the red clown noses.Honestly the best way to enjoy this is by watching all of the crunchyroll clips of the fights on youtube.Even if you do or do not watch the full anime, you will get the same amount of context for the people and the power dynamics in the fight(which is almost none by the way) I know there are people out there who are just satisfied looking at epic fight scenes, and all power to them, but for me if i wanted to watch an anime with a terrible story, terrible characters,and supah kewl fight scenes, I would just forget the story mode and watch anime fight compilations on Youtube.Overall-3I think the best part of my GOH experience was falling for the hype at episode 1 and wanting it to be good ,but watching the hype for the anime implode and see all my friends dropping it left and right. I wasn\'t kidding about my mal profile page, pls dont look at it, it\'s so bad. on earth combined into one huge form that is called GOH.As a matter of fact everytime i see a plot that fails on almost every basic rule of telling a story, it should be considered “GOH”d.At first it started out okay, it had fast ass pacing and sloppily told backstory, but i thought they would just commit to focusing on the tournament alone. And then that filler episode happened and everything went downhill, to the ground , through the crust and into the fiery depths of hell.The anime has 13 episodes worth of pacing but it feels like a lot of stuff was cut out and glued together in the first five episodes and then it just becomes borderline unwatchable afterwards.Shit just happens with no foreshadowing, people just pop in and dont show up again, the other stuff that happens is thrown in to happen at the same time that the tournament does, and the plot is basically all the elements of other anime but chopped up, put in a vitamix, and thrown into a warehouse fan.The tournament makes no sense either, people basically break rules and the tournament makers are just fine with it, so the tension of being kicked out of it is just not there.Also the unbalanced powers make no sense, some ppl have powers, some don\'t, but they still fight. ,it\'s like the equivalent of putting a mma fighter against a demon summoner. It feels like a child made it. Even the fights which are the only thing that puts this anime on the map (besides it being a webtoon adaptation) have no emotional weight to them. The factor that made them fun at the beginning was that they were fought by people themselves using only their bodies and minds, but that gets thrown out the window when people start summoning stands and getting possessed by demons and such, why? I don\'t know, GOD just gave it to them i guess.It tries to make every single fight some big grand final episode worthy fight, but since the stakes aren\'t there and the characters suck , the fights are just loud, lengthy, and bombastic with no substance to them.After that, the new powers that are introduced are just straight up nonsense and people including the mc automatically just have them now out of nowhere. Not to mention that some episodes, including the final one, are just nothing but fighting for half of it.To be honest everything else is just a combination of irrelevant characters and non- foreshadowed retcons , it got so bad that when the final episodes reached End of Evangelion levels of absurdity, i was just baffled how an innocent sports tournament anime turned to the absolute mess that it is, it honestly gave me more respect for anime like ikkitousen because at least it had a story, with rising action, a climax, falling action , and a conclusion. GOH on the other hand is just rising action,and one of those “stay tuned for season 2” endings, there is no climax because the anime doesn\'t know which climax it truly wants, from the grandpa situation, to the cult thing, to the rival childhood person, to another dude who is just possessed by demons now, to that one dude with the shark powers, to a bunch of other things.There is no excuse for a plot to be as messy as this.-Alrighty then, the art and animation.Basically the two things that made GOH relevant in the first place is the good looking animation and the fact that it\'s a webtoon comic. These are basically the only two selling gimmicks that crunchyroll advertises constantly and the hype is basically coming from people who either read the manhwa or people who saw episode one and immediately called GOH the “animu of 2020”. But in reality the animation only looks good in fight scenes, and then again it\'s not a consistent thing, some fights look really good while others look alright.I appreciate the times where ink styles are used and the choreography sometimes is impressive.Sometimes the cinematography was impressive.Some of the demon persona stand designs looked super sick too. I wish the fights incorporated more use of the actual environment since the setting that they are fighting in is super dim,bare,and bland.Most of the fights basically turn into explosions and concrete breaking and then not breaking and sometimes the arena looks normal size and other times it looks like a football field.Also I think its hilarious how MAPPA was so proud of the fights they made, they had to reuse them in the opening sequence but with some seizure inducing color schemes. The animation outside of fights is average tho because barely anything happened outside of the fights.I absolutely HATE the character designs, they are so fucking weird. Every and I mean EVERY character ,no matter what skin color,has this weird blush around their noses that is ridiculous,and they all look like they have the flu or something, their noses are so red that they can even make Rudolph the reindeer jealous. Also, the ears man, holy shit.what species of humans on Haruhi’s green earth have ears like those?They are all puffed up and out of proportion, they look like bees stung them. I thought I would get over those features, but they just got harder to stop looking at later on. It got to a point where I went to look at the actual style of the manhwa to see. It turns out that the blush is still there, BUT it\'s treated more as a flesh tone and there are other parts of their skin that balance out the color. And the ears aren\'t as puffy as the anime, so there is no “its following the original artstyle” debate here.Another thing i really don\'t like is the eyes on the mc, he has no catchlights in them and the other characters do so he looks dead sometimes, and the star things look like asta in black clover when he\'s acting funny, but in GOH, his eyes are always like that.it\'s just weird.-Music was whateverthe op as i said before was dank, despite it sounding like super awkward and trashy EDM with nonsensical lyrics, actually the lyrics of the God of Highschool OP are some of the dumbest lyrics I\'ve ever heard. let me give you some written example of this fine piece of art:  ""You make it look easy...….I\'m thinking hard right now"".....""You got me speachless.....im running my mouth"", and my favorite is ""cuz i know you want me, from the inside out,"" LMAO Linked Horizion, eat your heart out.  Despite how awful the op sounds, I couldn\'t stop listening to it. The ed is just generic millennial pop, the soundtrack was overbearing and inconsistent, and the audio mixing is weird at times.-*gag*Characters.The one phrase i ended up saying the most while watching was three simple words”who are you”Yep, this anime from episode one to thirteen introduces characters that you never even seen and if you\'re lucky, you might see that character more than once.But the true jackpot you need to look out for is a character that has some personality , with sensible screen time, development, and also happens to be a antagonist(that totally won\'t end up being a side character later because lol story telling ).I root for the antagonists because the main characters are pretty sloppy. They are your stereotypical characters, they become OP many times because they have to, the development they have with each other is forced, they are super smart but act really dumb when the plot allows, and they change their mindsets at the drop of a hat but the power of forced friendship causes them to basically be background characters for the rest of the show.The main guy, Jin Mo-Ri i really didnt care for. The three things about him is that he is obnoxious, he likes food,and he can get superpowerful , not by training  because thaaaat would be stupid,lol what is character development? he just has powers suddenly because he is the God. of. highschool i guess. The only thing i can think that is original about his character is that he might have deep , dark, and secret passion for his grandfather because he makes really stupid decisions for the sake of some guy he hasnt seen basically since he was a child, and he wakes up to a 60inch photo of his grandfather on his wall, and thats the only thing in his room too. When it comes to villains, it started out establishing some villains, and then the villains had villains, and then those villains fought other villains , it\'s such a mess. It got to a point where every single character introduced happened to be a villain but you would or would not know because lol what is pacing. And it doesnt help anything when almost every villain by the end just automatically doesn\'t become villains anymore since they don\'t do anything and a lot of them just end up being side characters for the side characters. I feel like this confusion could easily be remedied by having the audience sympathise with the side characters that don\'t stand a chance with OP main characters, but sadly, say it with me now “The pacing in the anime is ass”.-my experience with GOhI think my enjoyment of the show is the straw that breaks the camel\'s back.

I liked those scenes a lot.And of course, who can forget the fight scenes. Animated beautifully, as I'm sure many would agree. They weren't completely overpowered and showed growth alongside their fighting, and not in a way that was suddenly gaining a mysterious power (not that much, anyways).I only...got confused when we got into the later parts of the anime. Obviously it is difficult to turn a 450+ episode manhwa into an anime show. Season 1 seems to cut at after the fight with Jegal, which means about 100 episodes. I'm certain that a lot of decisions and careful consideration had been made about what scenes to cut and change; if I've heard correctly the author had been involved as well.However, the confusion is imminent. Maybe they didn't have time to fit it in, but there was definitely not enough explanation as to what the borrowed power was, which I think had to be important to link the entire story. The borrowed power is from the gods after all, and this is GOD of High School.Overall, I'd recommend someone to watch this, but probably not for the story.

I would say however many shows in the past have never come back with good scores, why is this so special for expectations. It is what it is I guess.The storyline follows initially a martial arts style tournaments that then twists heavily into more supernatural. It isn't bad as such it just isn't very inspired. What makes it not so inspired is the fact of...the keys that are scattered all over and that reminds a bit of a twist on the Dragonball series in as much as it is a power that can change everything plus crazy fights from various different schools of techniques.The art is odd in this. The characters have bright red noses and odd looks, they are very much made of clear lines. The backgrounds are generally beautiful. The gods and such supernatural things use a mix of good and very bad CGI. The battle scenes are very flashy and well made but the odd CGI at times just sort of ruins immersion.The OP is absolutely banging with an alright ED.

You get random people getting close quickly and very deep bonds formed almost out of nowhere. Some stories are explained very well and others sort of just thrown in. You also get the weirdness of decisions for example episode 4 Mi-ra has a random guy propose to her and she goes for it with no hesitation. Either shes dumb or desperate. You also get characters to try to have deep and meaningful backstories that sort of getting ruined by the rushed nature of the show.The show itself is not that bad although it may seem it from this. It is however not as great as I think people want it to look like it is. It's a pretty solid 6/10 for me. the keys that are scattered all over and that reminds a bit of a twist on the Dragonball series in as much as it is a power that can change everything plus crazy fights from various different schools of techniques.The art is odd in this. The characters have bright red noses and odd looks, they are very much made of clear lines. The backgrounds are generally beautiful. The gods and such supernatural things use a mix of good and very bad CGI.

Another web novel adaptation from crunchy roll, following the lackluster Tower of God from earlier in the year, I wondered if this one would be any better. After viewing the first episode I was really intrigued! However God of High school is a lot like fruit stripe gum, starts of great, but drops off real damn fast. By the 3rd and 4th episode I was already questioning what was going on in the story and it only got worse!Story: 3So far the biggest insult God...of High school has, is in the poorly written and almost nonsensical plot. Starting off with Jin Mori on his way to the God of Highschool tournament, I initially though ""ok this is going to be a tournament styled fighting show, im fine with that"" oh how wrong was I. The first episode itself is the only good episode of GoH, it introduces us to the main characters for the first time in a fairly enjoyable and artistic chase scene. This chase scene in fact was the best scene out of the entire show. They then end up at the tournament and have a free for all battle which itself was entertaining as  they had neat looking characters whomst i thought would stick around but one thing GoH loves to do is introduce a load of characters, and even in some cases give us a look into their backstory only to throw them into the dustbin by the next episode. Ok ok back on track, By episode 4 they introduce to us charyeok A weird stand like power ripped off straight from JoJo, Charyeok is barley explained and I had no idea, how this power worked, how people could access it, or what its limitations were. whats worse is that we started the series off from being one of pure martial arts to where everyone is using Charyeok to fight. This power is being pulled straight out of ones ass, and of course all the main characters figure out how to use it easy peasy. They are busting out this magic in front of a televised audience and nobody gives a shit. the first guy who used it in the tournament is punished for doing so but right after that every character uses it and nobody bats an eye. GoH proceeds to become an absolute clusterfuck by episode 8 where multiple story lines have splintered off and it starts becoming a little confusing. By episode 10 at this point the tournament doesn\'t matter anymore and giant Buddhas are falling out of the sky. Why is Buddha falling out of the sky? Idk! Whos this organization who wants to ruin the tournament? beats me! Nothing is explained at all in this story and when they do its glossed over. We went from a martial arts tournament to The destruction of South Korea\'s capital, by characters whomst we know nothing about. It seems like the author writing GoH had an idea that just morphed into a different beast as time went on, or he really had no idea what he was doing. Theres so much wrong with GoH\'s story and I can go on forever why it makes no sense but to sum it up, it felt increasingly directionless as time went on, Nothing is explained in detail. Characters are introduced at breakneck speed and throw out before the episodes done. To many things get brought into the story and go nowhere! It wanted to do so many things at once when it should have stuck to one central idea and cast.Art: 8Perhaps the only redeeming trait behind GoH, is its art. Everything from the characters and theFighting abilities, to the background is well animated, and there is little use of CGI. Many fights were enjoyable to look at, when you turned your brain off. Just take a look at a selection of stills from the show and it would look impressive enough to draw the interest of  a normie lol.Sound: 5gave it a 5, Mediocre, I don\'t remember a single thing regarding the sound from this show besides some of the characters voices (Jins voice is so obnoxious). The OP and ED were alright, but none of the music playing during the episodes actually stuck to my brain. Sound only gets a 5 because I cant remember if it was actually bad enough to score lower. Just forgettable overall.Character: 3Each and every character from GoH is poorly written, flat, and one dimensional. Including the Main characters. Jin Mori is loud, obnoxious, and the definition of a Gary Stu. He\'s wrapped up in so much plot armor, that nothing ever fazes him. He barely progresses as a character during these 13 episodes, as by the end of the show, hes acting the exact same and making the same choices he would have made from episode 1. We don\'t see him struggle much, especially later on when he can solve all his problems by poking himself (acupuncture apparently means your invincible lol). He\'s just a boring Goku clone but with 1% of the character that Goku had. Mira had some issues with Jin as she was a more composed person fighting to save her familys sword style, In contrast with Jins carefree attitude. She often gets pushed into the background though and has no real development at all. The only decent character in this entire train wreck was Dae-Wi, whomst is a quite man but not one to stray from action. For almost 2 episodes the show really shows us what he\'s fighting for and how its impacting him. He could have turned into a good rival for Mori, but The tournament meant fuck all by the end and just like Mira, Dae-wi is pushed into the background with his thumbs up his ass and makes little progression as a character. Everyone else introduced in this show is completely forgettable, and only serves as a device to get the poorly written plot moving along.The villain Taek Jigal is written as bland and generic as a villain could be. Doing what he does because he thinks he\'s better then everyone else. Many of these characters don\'t even serve a purpose in the plot, as at one point we get introduced to some team we think might fight the main trio but they are nowhere to be seen after that. Some characters are introduced during the climax of a scene just to save the day then vanish because like Santa Claus and Superman they did their duty and weren\'t needed anymore. By the end of GoH I did not find myself attached to a single character, I felt no emotion or feeling, nothing at all for them.Oh and every time they showed us the characters in chibi form for a sprinkling of comedy, I wanted to turn it off. Those scenes were so damn obnoxious especially Jin, man I hate Jin.Enjoyment: 3For the obvious reasons stated above, I had such a hard time trying to like this show but i just couldn\'t. It became a slog as the episodes progressed. what really bugged me was the utter lack of world building, and how everything was done because it probably looked cool in the authors head and he didn\'t stop to think if he had gone to far or not. GoH served only one purpose and that was to make characters fight each other with cool crazy powers they pull out of their asses, and some people like that. Yea Bleach and Naruto did the same thing but what set them apart from GoH is that they actually took the time to develop a proper story and explain everything, from how their powers worked to the world they lived in, and most characters in those series got some time in the limelight. The fight Between Rock Lee and Gaara in Naruto was leagues better then anything we had in GoH, and I cared more for Rock Lee who was barely introduced By the time he fought against Gaara. There is little enjoyment to be had in GoH unless you just want to watch guys fight, but at that point you have a buffet of much better shonen options.Overall: 3The God of High school is an over hyped piece of trash that would be enjoyable only for a younger audience who hasn\'t had the chance to view better pieces of work. Or by a brainlet who doesn\'t give a damn about all the things that make a story intriguing and worth your limited time on this Earth. Things such as a coherent plot, well written characters, world building and just overall consistency. It lacks all of these things in what is an incredibly lazy cash grab by Crunchy Roll in putting out what they\'re styling as a ""New Crunchy Roll Original"" and the Anime community would be damned if they plan to put out more generic slop like this into the market. If the new trend of anime is to find poorly written web novels and animate them because they look  cool and marketable, then we\'re in for a rough time. of High school has, is in the poorly written and almost nonsensical plot.

This anime follows pretty much the same clichés of shonen: trio of best friends in which one is a woman. The main character is goofy but super powerful, the girl is the strong powerful straight man girl and the edgy.... Well, Daehwi is actually a good character, forgiven.So the anime is basically a fighting game contest where people around Seoul try to win to get whatever they want to become truth. It is actually interesting seeing the fights, and considering MAPPA animated this, it was...pretty good. Some people consider that the anime had no story, just fighting (for the first 4-5 episodes reviewing the anime), but I actually consider that it had TOO much going on, even finishing, it is TOO MUCH. Like in just one episode we had like 3 side stories? Jin having this, Mira having this, Daewi having this (i don't wanna spoil, if you have seen this anime you should know what i'm talking about). We solved one problem to right after begin a new one. So overwhelming. (I have been informed that the writer wanted to adapt 100 episodes of manhwa in 13 episodes... Yep, that seems about right)By the last episodes, I didn't understand jack shit what was happening and I thought it was only me but I asked a friend if he understood something and he said that no. So yeah. Like, I was willing to give this a 6 but considering everything happened so fast, had to many clichés and I didn't understand the ending, yeah, a 5. Could be worst I guess. Not going to watch the second season.Btw, what's up with the opening, are we back to 2012? So funny xd pretty good.

So funny xd"", ""There is much to love about this anime, yet also lots that doesn't seem right...TLDR: Extremely overhyped, watch it for the good choreography but don't expect a good story or excitement that most shounen animes bring to the table. Characters are boring, unlikeable and inconsistent.Below are all the flaws I see that stand out:-The MC is very unlikeable in my opinion due to his boring motives. He is very one-dimensional like Goku, someone who only fights, eats and sleeps but worse as he isn't fighting to protect the world or anything heroic. He's simply boring and I doubt his back story (which has yet to...be introduced) can fill this empty shell of an MC. He also starts off ridiculously powerful, which may be to some of your tastes, but it will certainly limit how much he can grow, hindering hype and making fights less climatic. Oh yeah, he's also an impulsive idiot. He completely does things on impulse and barges into someone else's fight without anything to gain. Yeah, pretty illogical and dumb of him, two character traits which are annoying as hell esp since he's the lead.-CHARACTER INCONSISTENCIES: After episode 4, I have decided to drop the show completely. I love good fights but I can't ignore the poor writing. It's not a show like Baki where fighting makes up the whole show; GOH is trying to be a combo of bothaction and plot. E.g Han Daewi beating on Mira. This makes no sense as he shouldn't even be motivated to fight anymore as his friend is no longer alive, thus making it pointless for him to fight for the wish. Therefore it is nonsense for him to even show up in the tournament, let alone go full tryhard and merciless against a friend.-The plot feels very forced at times, for example with one of the commissioners giving the MC a very hyped up and rare fruit, without knowing who the MC truly is.-THE MAIN PROBLEM: This anime feels like an unoriginal mix and mash of other shounen. I came into this expecting more realistic hand to hand combat without elements of DBZ energy blasts and JoJo stands abruptly appearing. Its dissapointing as the anime doesn't stick to one style of fighting. E.g the female lead fights a wrestler with a sword. This scene is great and dynamic but ruined when she proceeds to shoot air blasts from her hand after doing some pretty traditional and realistic sword moves.-Art is also questionable. Character design is good, and the fights are super dynamic too, but stylistically speaking the anime is a bit odd. The characters' noses are all pretty large which is a misrepresentation of Asian people, whilst they are also red???? Very odd choice and something that I can't quite ignore or agree with. be introduced) can fill this empty shell of an MC.

Don't watch this shit."", ""Beign honest since the first statement here: The anime is a cliché? It is, but it's still better than the webtonn/manhwa.STORY (6/10): It's good beside what the rate looks like. But the major problem is that the anime doesn't know how to work around all those cliché and obvious narrative that they are into. Let's make a comparision (althought I hate comparisions lol) with BNHA which have one of the most clichés plot and develoopment of all time, but still makes it write and the way that the story is even bigger than the cliché that she's hanging on.

The sound  design of anime was ok and the voice acting was on point. But nothing more to worth tell aboutCHARACTER (4/10): All of them doesn't have a SLIGHTEST good motivation, the most close of this was Daewi, but the way the story puts in the end of his arc was totally bullshit.

But I still want to give my opinion towards this anime. One of the things that carried this anime, in my opinion, are the animation and the ending music. The fight scenes in GOH is just fantastic. You can really see the efforts of the animators who put their blood and sweat over this, and that deserves respect! However, having good animations don\'t make a great anime. The plot of GOH at the start is so vague that it doesn\'t make sense, and the introduction of characters and premise of the...show are nowhere to be understood. It really hurts to watch it, an anime having a great potential yet it let me down. The pacing was also a problem, it\'s fast and confusing. Such as, the mc and his ""friends"" had become friends in just 1 episode, like they\'ve been through hell and shit. Well, it is a shounen kinda type of an anime; power of friendship is to be expected. I saw some of the reviews from the manhua readers that the anime really was a disappointment; they left a lot of plot and had gone too fast. It does feel that the anime is really not that great, but don\'t lose hope. The anime is still at its first season, and I hope if they follow the manhua in the next season, it\'d be great. So, the review ends here, GOH is an anime that has a lot of potentials in the upcoming season, saying it if it will have one, and wasn\'t really that bad. We just need to pray and hope that the next one would be near in the future and surpass the previous season. I give this a generous 7/10 score, it\'s still too early to judge but I have great expectations for this anime. show are nowhere to be understood.

I give this a generous 7/10 score, it\'s still too early to judge but I have great expectations for this anime.', ""guys, guys. if you rate it one or two or three or four- you didn't see a one or two or three or four stars anime. listen' this is a very nice anime with good animation and fun story - a good shounen! maybe you are too old for that, maybe you don't enjoy fighting and s-powers.there is a great background story. as you watch, you want to know more about it, and every time they show you a bit and it is great. this is a good anime, I really recommend it, it is getting much better from ep to another. go watch it,...go have fun!!! go have fun!!!"", ""when i started watching this anime i never thought i would rate anything below 6 (apart from one anime), at first the animation was fine story was fine, everything was fine, but then suddenly, abruptly this anime showed me its comedy, the second i saw this Pathetic excuse for comedy i felt something i never felt before, Cringe.this was the first time i ever felt such a feeling from an anime, the story is fine characters are not really realistic or unique and also their interactions feel like their 3 years old (like the comedy), i might have continued to watch this if the comedy...didn't exist, if i could give the comedy something lower then a 1 i would give it -10.in conclusionif i had to choose between watching another episode of this or actually doing something with my life like sports, i would be anathlete.i also would like to say i really tried to watch more episodes but i couldn't i barely managed to finish episode 2 and when i tried to watch episode 3 i felt  mental pain. didn't exist, if i could give the comedy something lower then a 1 i would give it -10.in conclusionif i had to choose between watching another episode of this or actually doing something with my life like sports, i would be anathlete.i also would like to say i really tried to watch more episodes but i couldn't i barely managed to finish episode 2 and when i tried to watch episode 3 i felt  mental pain."", 'ok, it\'s my 1st review of an anime, so I\'m just gonna jump in and get straight to the points.the anime?it\'s fine; missed a few, if not a lot of parts from the original source material, but it\'s to be expected.the story?if you guys are confused by the plot at all, it\'s basically: monkey king gets reincarnated as a kid, one of the strongest martial artists in the world - aside from six other strong and mystical individuals - tae-jin jin, takes it upon himself to adopt the little kid. the kid\'s name is mo-ri jin, he grows up without tae-jin because...tae-jin leaves to keep evil people hunting him away from mo-ri. mo-ri takes this as a sign that he\'s weak and not strong enough, so he trains until he\'s the strongest kid in his highschool. later, he gets an invitation to join a martial arts tournament for other high schoolers that are strong like him, dubbed the god of highschool tournament. anyone that participates in and wins the god of highschool tournament gets one wish granted, but these high schoolers use powers they borrow from powerful beings they think of as ""gods,"" (i.e one person could worship their martial arts teacher as a god and be able to use their teacher\'s spirit and moves, one person could usethe powers of jesus, one person could use an entire u.s. army battalion, not to mention sacred treasures where any weapon relating to their borrowed power can be used) but the REAL reason behind the god of highschool tournament is to find a way to break the taboo that humans can\'t hurt gods and finally have humans on top of everything. there\'s some broken morals here, some very sad deaths there, but it\'ll all leave you on the edge of your seat for the next chapter.the fights?i\'ma keep it $1.50 with you guys: the fights aren\'t it, chief; they\'re not as impactful as the ones from the webtoon. in the webtoon, you can feel the blows being landed, the injuries being dealt, the pain each character\'s facing when fighting, and the webtoon artist - shout out to the homie yongje park, by the way - makes it all great because he\'s good at drawing out a lot emotions with them. that\'s how good he is. the only good fight, in my opinion, is the one in the last episode.overall?it\'s a solid 5.5-6.0. it isn\'t good, it\'s fine. but, i\'m not gonna say it\'s a generic shounen, it\'s just that the anime didn\'t do the webtoon justice. either wait for season 2 to make the anime better or check out the webtoon. even though the anime didn\'t do the webtoon justice storywise, characterwise, or plotwise, the animation looks pretty clean and smooth. tae-jin leaves to keep evil people hunting him away from mo-ri. mo-ri takes this as a sign that he\'s weak and not strong enough, so he trains until he\'s the strongest kid in his highschool. later, he gets an invitation to join a martial arts tournament for other high schoolers that are strong like him, dubbed the god of highschool tournament. anyone that participates in and wins the god of highschool tournament gets one wish granted, but these high schoolers use powers they borrow from powerful beings they think of as ""gods,"" (i.e one person could worship their martial arts teacher as a god and be able to use their teacher\'s spirit and moves, one person could usethe powers of jesus, one person could use an entire u.s. army battalion, not to mention sacred treasures where any weapon relating to their borrowed power can be used) but the REAL reason behind the god of highschool tournament is to find a way to break the taboo that humans can\'t hurt gods and finally have humans on top of everything. there\'s some broken morals here, some very sad deaths there, but it\'ll all leave you on the edge of your seat for the next chapter.the fights?i\'ma keep it $1.50 with you guys: the fights aren\'t it, chief;

This story is sub par at best, and very chaotic.. That being said I kept being drawn to it. Al tough the story leaves much to be desired I simply can't say the mindless fighting isn't enjoyable.Of course mindless fighting isn't a great way to judge an anime but together with this great art I would say it's worth the watch, since it's only 13 episodes.The intro song is a genre that these days I don't hear too much anymore but if you like it you like it. All that should be said for that, it's...a matter of taste.TL;DR= It's mindless fun a matter of taste.TL;DR= It's mindless fun"", 'I didnt have any expectation of this series and i get a very good surprese since de very begining... The intro is really good, even for me who im not a big fan of electronic music.The story is the kinda stereotypical structural of a very powerful but dumb man character with the only desire to fight, and secondary friends who have a lil bit more deep background. Theres a secret organization making a big tournament to achieve ""dont know what"" (at least till chapter 4 is not much clear).The animation is pretty cool, and have some changes of style and ""first person"" shots who seems...interesting, which i think is their best selling point cuz, the story and characters are pretty averge.buttom line, if you enjoyed animes in the vein of Kengan Ashura (but with waaaaay better) animation (but less story) i said you will find something really enjoyable. interesting, which i think is their best selling point cuz, the story and characters are pretty averge.buttom line, if you enjoyed animes in the vein of Kengan Ashura (but with waaaaay better) animation (but less story) i said you will find something really enjoyable.', ""♚ ZORO Reviews:The God of High School - Season 1 ReviewStory Rating: [5/10]A unique plot but a lot of unanswered questions leading to confusion.Art Rating: [9/10]The animation quality is amazing and the fight sequences were fantastic.

Here are my thoughts on it.Story: 4/10Couldn't get more average than this. The source manhwa work was inspired by shounen Manga, which isn't that strong when it comes to storytelling, just fights. There are a lot of unoriginal elements.Art: 7/10Artstyle was weird. The characters had those red noses, they looked like they caught a cold.I did like the animation, it was amazing. You don't expect it to be this good at these times.Sound: 8/10Dubstep in opening was cool. There isn't much of it in anime openings nowadays. Ending theme hit different after each episode tbh.Character: 3/10There...were all copy of other characters from other series.The protagonist and the rest of the main cast were all generic. Even the characters from other teams in this arc were copies of the main cast.Enjoyment: 9/10I admit it, I enjoyed watching this.

Note that my viewpoint and enjoyment comes from being a webtoon reader.To start, I think this show is gorgeous. Its legitimately one of the prettiest fighting shows I've ever seen and one of the fights honestly goes in my top 10 short fights of all time. The visuals alone make it, in my opinion, impossible to give this show any less than a 7, unless you don't like action.But the problem is, the show is way too rushed. Tower of God was 13 episodes covering 80 chapters. God of High School is 13 episodes covering 110 Chapters....A lot of important character info gets cut, fights get altered to be more succinct.The comic relies heavily on the explanations of how fighters fight and what they fight for to give the side characters depth and give them meaning. The anime cuts most of that. Most of the characters are incredibly bare bones. The overarching plot is very rarely explained and many important character interactions are completely lost. The show takes the fastest route to get to fight from fight, even if that means cutting through other fights.I enjoyed the show a lot as a webtoon reader because I had the info. It was basically just watching my favorite fights get animated. But its nothing more than that.If you enjoyed the fights I beg you to read the webtoon. If you havent watched the show yet, I ask you to read the webtoon first.The anime is not the definitive way to consume this portion of the series, but I still wouldn't say its bad. Its just a lot less than I would've wanted.

I don\'t think the writer intended to make a good story here, I feel like the writer was trying to ""Baki"" it.If you don\'t know what I mean by ""Baki"" it, I mean that the author knows that they can\'t write a great story but they can make great fighting scenes and maybe that\'s the point. It\'s not supposed to be some groundbreaking shonen with awesome action and captivating story, it just...explores a niche that I feel Crunchyroll just promoted too much but who knows?

Thanks for reading until the end.', 'Look, to start this review off, I\'d like to say I\'m a huge fan of the original content. I read the Webtoon to its current chapter and have always remained a lover of this work of art.That being said I will have to say, that unfortunately, that actually may even have added to some of the scoring I gave it.I want people to watch the show, I want people to enjoy this as many did with Tower Of God (another Anime Webtoon that Crunchyroll helped produce.) However when you stray away from the source as much as this did, and compartmentalize the story and side...adventures, you can either get an amazing piece of original content (like Soul Eater) or you can have something completely bomb due to the fact you keep taking out pieces of info, and entertainment that you\'re now ended up with something that can\'t even be compared to Record and MP3.Story: 6/10I\'m split on this one, because there\'s a veritable amount of reasons. If you\'ve read the source, you know the boundless ends of story that can be here. The webtoon even uses lore from all over the world. Different religions, different mythologies, if it\'s something that was cherished or revered, nothing is off limits, and they\'ll use it in the story. In this anime? They gloss over everything. It feels like they didn\'t have time to explain some super huge details, and took a creative turn for the worst. If I didn\'t know the original source I\'d be a bit confused.But it\'s still an original take on a genre of fighting, with plenty purpose and development. You can tell your main characters are going to become developed in the future.Art: 9/10I will not give you any complaints about how this was animated, the fight sequences are almost always amazing, the visuals are captivating, and the way it was done can\'t be sneezed at. You have a very satisfying piece of animation, which each episode delivers, firmly.Sound: 9/10With its gratifying and vast splay of music, there is no doubt Arisa Okehazama has given us a great anime, that really stands out with each passing scene. Words won\'t do it justice, and I\'ll just say they clearly put a vast amount of time, effort, and care into creating the soundtrack into this. The sound effects are also very on point.While some may not agree, the opening song and closing song, really hyped me up for each weeks episode. I\'ll write more on this later on the review. What you should know is every scene has amazing music.Character: 5/10I\'d give this a fair rating at best. You have your main protagonist who ... Likes to fight? Source readers will probably howl and go ""But there\'s so much more!"" and they\'d be right, however that isn\'t portrayed in the anime. They didn\'t touch on his unspeakable love for his Grandfathers martial arts Renewal Taekwondo.You have Miro Yoo, while portrayed almost exactly like the Webtoon, she comes off as one of the most properly animated characters in the show. But where the anime is at now, she\'s still a shallow character with one goal, and not much else going for her. (Later this changes but...)And of course we have to talk about the most grounded character Han Daewi. He\'s accurate, hes well drawn, well voice acted, but like most of the anime\'s falling points, the start of the Webtoon and anime lacked depth for their Star Characters. That being said it does change, and Daewi has one of the most emotional and empowering reasons to fight.Finally... Everyone else, holy crap, one of the things God Of Highschool\'s webtoon did so well was add amazing depth to the supporting cast. Everyone you see fight in the anime has their OWN backstory, their own short sweet story that plays an amazing piece of a bigger puzzle that enhances the enjoyment of the fights, the future arcs, and more. In the anime? You get glossed over on everything.Enjoyment: 7/10What can I say? It was beautiful, I have no regrets watching it, and I\'m sure I\'d enjoy it more if I didn\'t know the original story. (Or... They could just fix it and be loyal)The fighting animation is almost on point for what I\'d like to see in the year 2020 of a growing anime industry, well choreographed fighting, beautiful animations, a serious contender for soundtrack of the year (you can even cut out the opening song/ending song and this would be true).It\'s not your run of the mill, kids battling it out in martial arts, and it\'s not your run of the mill ""everyone has super powers."" The world has structure, and like Tower of God, it\'s a world building story. Season 1 is setting you up for what there is to come, but sadly they have to cut corners, and try to get you hooked on so they can have a reason to continue. So all of the faithful readers have to bite their lip when they see some of their favorite scenes butchered.Overall I\'d give the anime a 6/10, not because it\'s a bad anime... But because the potential it has, and the vast amount of entertainment it could have drawn with some more direction from the original source. (I know I\'ve said that a lot)Would I recommend God of High School? Yes, I would. Do you like cool fights? Do you like some mystical stuff in your fighting? How about epic soundtracks to go with your favorite scenes? And I\'m not talking about your run of the mill ""Play the Opening Song during the fight!"" Each track is unique and fun, and gets you invested in the scene. Do you want something animated well, and properly? Well I have good news, this anime doesn\'t fail on those fronts.It has potential to be so much more, but it needs to rely on its roots a bit more to help hook the viewers and get everyone invested more into the plot, the characters, and the world it\'s attempting to build.My advice? Go read the Webtoon after you\'ve watched this anime. You\'ll be hooked and breeze through every chapter faster than you\'d think, as long as you even remotely liked something about this anime. adventures, you can either get an amazing piece of original content (like Soul Eater) or you can have something completely bomb due to the fact you keep taking out pieces of info, and entertainment that you\'re now ended up with something that can\'t even be compared to Record and MP3.Story: 6/10I\'m split on this one, because there\'s a veritable amount of reasons.

The anime progresses from decent to what the actually frick am I watching. Condensing 112 chapters into 13 chaotic episodes was an absolutely terrible idea. The pacing issues are very clear as it is very difficult to understand anything that's happening in the last few episodes. To give an idea as to how badly rushed this anime was, the plot of the first few episodes, the middle, and the ending could probably be looked at as three completely different anime based on what happened in them. The only reason I'm giving this a 4...and not lower is because there's nothing really to hate in terms of the art and the anime does have small tid bits where it gets me to care about some of the characters.I'd pass on this one, go read the webtoon instead if you have the time. and not lower is because there's nothing really to hate in terms of the art and the anime does have small tid bits where it gets me to care about some of the characters.I'd pass on this one, go read the webtoon instead if you have the time."", ""Shaman King and Baki had a son.The ONLY flaw is that the pace of the story is too fast, other than that, the anime is literally flawless.

Add to that, that plot points come and go like targets on a shooting range - this show is incredibly fast paced, but we'll come back to that at the end of the review. Not that it was bad, mind you... but it was *aggressively* average. Boilerplate. It was competent, but did nothing special.The characters get a 6 - there's...a lot of people here who end up throwing you for something of a loop, either because they were expected to be evil but ended up more towards the good half of 'morally complex', or because they ended up being SO cartoonishly evil that it defied expectations in the exact opposite direction - either way, there's some engaging people here who were written fairly believably. That said, this is no Your Lie in April. It gets a pass, that's all.The sound design gets a 7 - music matches the tone of the moments it's played in, the actual fighting effects are weighty and have that meaty hit sound to them, and the special effects play off my nostalgia for Yu Yu Hakusho a little bit so I might be biased there. Also, the OP is an absolute TUNE and I will hear no arguments to the contrary. This goes beyond base competency and into 'actually pretty good' territory. It won't blow your socks off, but it's better than average for sure.Enjoyment gets an 8 - what can I say other than that I'm typical shounen trash, and I love me some Magic Punch Boys beating the particle effects out of one another until they discover the power of friendship and scream themselves to victory. This category is 100% subjective and your experience may vary - please consult your doctor if you experience any of the following effects: elevated blood pressure, extended cranial piloerection, uncontrollable screaming, and elevated power levels exceeding 9k or more on a standard readout. These are signs of a serious side effect, and you should stop taking Shounen Action and consult your wise old medical practitioner immediately before continuing.Art gets a 9 - but then, it's MAPPA getting help from JC Staff, I'm not sure what you were expecting. This stuff is gorgeous in motion, and the fight choreography takes direct cues from real tae kwon do and jiu jitsu as well as several other fighting styles. I will say, the fight choreography AND artistic direction are significantly better in the first act before the power escalation, where it was basically just all kinds of real-world fighting styles pitted against each other. Not only did we see some awesome choreography, but also studio MAPPA delved into some really gorgeous mixed-media scenes like inkblotting and oil-on-glass, kinda reminiscent of  what Bones did with Mob Psycho 100 - and that's high praise if ever I've given it. Just a shame that that ended up getting binned about halfway through in favor of ki beam spam and Personas - oh well, it was still gorgeous. 9.And of course, 5-9, 6-8, and 7... all average out to a 7, obviously, so there's your overall score. It's good, it's not amazing, I recommend it if you're shounen trash like me and you have some spare time on your hands (and let's be honest - it's 2020. You have spare time).I will say that these scores all become irrelevant in the face of the original manhwa, which apparently was MUUUUUUUCH larger and more detailed than the anime. From what I've seen of comments from Manhwa readers, Crunchyroll apparently ordered MAPPA to cut out *massive* chunks of the original as part of this anime adaptation, which also explains the recklessly breakneck pace of the plot mentioned in the first part of this review. a lot of people here who end up throwing you for something of a loop, either because they were expected to be evil but ended up more towards the good half of 'morally complex', or because they ended up being SO cartoonishly evil that it defied expectations in the exact opposite direction - either way, there's some engaging people here who were written fairly believably.

These are signs of a serious side effect, and you should stop taking Shounen Action and consult your wise old medical practitioner immediately before continuing.Art gets a 9 - but then, it's MAPPA getting help from JC Staff, I'm not sure what you were expecting. This stuff is gorgeous in motion, and the fight choreography takes direct cues from real tae kwon do and jiu jitsu as well as several other fighting styles. I will say, the fight choreography AND artistic direction are significantly better in the first act before the power escalation, where it was basically just all kinds of real-world fighting styles pitted against each other. Not only did we see some awesome choreography, but also studio MAPPA delved into some really gorgeous mixed-media scenes like inkblotting and oil-on-glass, kinda reminiscent of  what Bones did with Mob Psycho 100 - and that's high praise if ever I've given it. Just a shame that that ended up getting binned about halfway through in favor of ki beam spam and Personas - oh well, it was still gorgeous. 9.And of course, 5-9, 6-8, and 7... all average out to a 7, obviously, so there's your overall score. It's good, it's not amazing, I recommend it if you're shounen trash like me and you have some spare time on your hands (and let's be honest - it's 2020. You have spare time).I will say that these scores all become irrelevant in the face of the original manhwa, which apparently was MUUUUUUUCH larger and more detailed than the anime. From what I've seen of comments from Manhwa readers, Crunchyroll apparently ordered MAPPA to cut out *massive* chunks of the original as part of this anime adaptation, which also explains the recklessly breakneck pace of the plot mentioned in the first part of this review."", ""One thing is for certain with this anime is that the fighting animation is great. It also very refreshing to see well animated hand to hand combat.  This show is your classic fighting tournament theme, with a variety of different fighting styles on display, similar to Kengen Ashura.  Unlike Kengen Ashura however, setting the animation to one side, its not very good.Ill start first with the story.  For me, it was really boring.  I didn't feel engaged with any of the character story lines.  This then resulted in me caring very little of the tournament fighting outcomes.  From start...to finish it is really bland.  There are two stories happening at the same time with converging characters.  The tournament side is ok, the other side of this show, outisde of the tournament is completely forgettable.  This is the first show i have watched that is a Crunchyrolll original.  Now I know the Netflix original anime is garbage, Record of Ragnarok and all its associated assets needs setting on fire, I did still however have some high hopes for Crunchyroll's output.  Turns out, though it better than most Netflix Originals, it was still lacking soul and character.  Story wise ill probably give this a 4/10.Music is a little better, but not much.  Its all forgettable with the exception of the intro surprisingly.  Intro music for me is normally something I never like, this however, is a great quality composition, doesn't have about 10 key changes in 1.5 mins like most and has decent dynamics. That's where the excitement on a music front ends, which isn't great that the only memorable musical moment is the intro...I would prob give this a 5/10.Now for the animation.  It is excellent.  The fight sequences are executed superbly.  The hand to hand combat is gorgeous and doesn't dip in quality from beginning to end.  It is such a shame that a show with animation of this quality doesn't really have much substance, all shirt no trousers.  The character designs and variety are great too.  I don't believe the variety of fighting styles on offer are visualised as well as they could have been, Kengen Ashhura is a great example of the fighting style variety executed well.  Nevertheless, the animation is still excellent and i would give it a very high 8/10.  Would have been a 9 if the different fighting styles were explored more.Its ok this show, that's the best i can say.  If you enjoy watching great fights and are not too fussed about an engaging story, and you are happy to invest time in 12 episodes, id give it a go.  I am on the fence of recommendation due to the animation being so great and everything else being the opposite.  All in all, im giving this a 6/10. to finish it is really bland.

But, at a certain point the plot goes crazy and everything turns into a jumble of megalomaniacal scenes without any impact due to the rush of events.I was surprised that in episode 13, all the basic characters from the beginning had immense god-level powers, and that's the anime's premise about taking powers from the gods. Still, it still sounds basic and convenient for a few moments.

The pacing is a bit rushed and I feel like the webtoon probably had a lot more background info that it provided the consumer with. Something that, sadly, cannot be said about the anime.

Not spoiling the manwha, the god of high school isn\'t just a random fighting tournament for a...prize, there is a reason why Mujin Park calls Mori Jin a ""tiger cub"".

First of all, I\'d like to say this anime was a pretty average anime, meaning it was not the best yet the worst thing i\'ve ever watched. I would say it had very good animation ,sound and pretty decent characters but what i disliked was the way it represented the story especially the ending. The ending had me screaming in frustration. why? because i kinda read the manhwa before the last 2 episodes and i was soo damn hyped to what was...taking place in the manhwa, like literally everything was so damn amazing and  then the last two episodes came out and i was so disappointed. I watched the last 2 episodes and I couldn\'t understand why they had butchered the story line, plot line ,call it whatever you like but just why did they do that? I mean anime does tend to change couple of things and im fine with changes but this change was very disappointing. I feel no matter how much I type I won\'t be able to get all the frustration out of my system ,that\'s how disappointed i am. The ending which was messy and rushed completely ruined the anime for me. Honestly, the ending could\'ve been better but whatever.Overall, like all anime it had it\'s ups and downs but if im being honest the anime is not really as ""wow"" as most ppl claim it to be. I don\'t think i\'d recommend this anime to someone but if you love watching characters just fight then i guess this is for them.Also, I have nothing against the ppl who loved this show, just this anime was not what i expected it to be so yea. taking place in the manhwa, like literally everything was so damn amazing and  then the last two episodes came out and i was so disappointed.

In the manhwa that story progresses to be the main story, but 13 episodes is nearly not enough to get to that. If on the off chance this series gets a second season , we will see that story progress. But for now just enjoy the frickin awesomely animated fights and the OST.

The ending seemed to open to a second season which hopefully they will expand more on the story and plot. However, for most of the anime, I was lost with the plot questioning how is this that, and where did this and that come from. I really did enjoy it with the fight scenes and cool battles, but I was left with just that.Story: 5 [CONTAINS SPOILERS]The story started out well understood. I understand the plot and what was going on until...they started to add powers. I don\'t know if there was a background episode to explain how they got these powers and how to develop but it just seemed they just unlocked it randomly. I was also left with why the US sent missiles to South Korea, did they know about their charyeoks and gods and all of that. They gave a background to the Key and it\'s guardian, but none to the ""monkey king""? Like who is Jin Mori\'s alter ego and what is the background. From what I can tell he is just a super-powerful being that can defeat gods with a magical staff. So was he reincarnated? Is that person a god himself? I have no idea, but what I could tell gods are bad. I was just left confused for half the time and I was just distracted by really awesome fighting.Art and Sound: 10The OT and ET are bangers and I constantly listen to them when not watching the anime. I love the music in this anime a lot. The animation is also very well done and it was very very smooth.Character: 6The characters were not shallow but the main character is revolved around saving his grandfather. Yes, that is an incentive and something to fight for but it is just not deep and connective. The supporting characters had more emotional backgrounds than Mori. Daewi\'s best friend is dying and he was fighting for his life. Mira is fighting to keep her dying fighting style alive wished by her father. Mori wants to fight just to get stronger. He has such a shallow personality of being quirky. I also feel like half of the characters were given nothing. Such as the purpose of his grandfather, Mujin, the other contestants, the prince, the Six. They were all present in the anime but given no background as to why. Their arcs were also super shallow other than Daewi\'s and Ilpyo\'s.

The fights weren't my only problem if you really like music you wont like this anime and if story really matters to you then don't waste your time a baby can write better...fight scenes (not hating on the mangaka) I feel like it would be better as a slice of life then a fighting anime.

This review might be different from the rest so bare with me.Before anything else, I have read the webtoon before they even announce that it will receive an anime adaptation. Without a further-a-do...Story: 6/10Why? Is the story that bad for me to give it a 5?No, I\'m talking about the anime. As we all know, MAPPA is the one who holds onto the responsibility of animating this webtoon... and of course, MAPPA has...other things to animate too, one example is Attack On Titan.Not official but, MAPPA is a busy studio and seeing from episodes 1-4 of God of Highschool? It seems rushed compared to the webtoon. As I would like to call it ""a squished sandwich"". I heard webtoons that received an adaptation ends season 1 in only 13 or just less the 15 episodes. That actually made me disappointed, how the fu- is arc 1 going to fit in 13 episodes?The webtoon\'s story is actually well-written, I give it a 10/10, but I saw how much small details are missed in the anime, actually, no, the webtoon is far too different from the anime. Starting from episode 1, I was so disappointed finding myself looking for Mori singing about him being the best fighter ever.But enough about that, let\'s talk about the MAIN story of this anime;We\'re still at episode 1-4 so anime watchers still don\'t know but like said in the synopsis, there is something much deeper in the tournament, why it was created in the first place. The webtoon has a lot of plot twists and turns so I actually have high hopes that MAPPA will detail that as the webtoon. Though again, I think it\'s impossible because webtoon adapted anime only gets 13 episodes in 1 season.Art: 9/10I love it. Its style is so different from the webtoon but It\'s refreshing to see traditional and digital style combined, from the glossy lips to the red-ish tip of their noses and ears... If anyone is still confused about why the tip is red, it\'s because that\'s how Koreans do it.Sound: 7/10Kinda wished for more of like anime intro but the outro is sick! Might be because I\'m also a kpop fan myself and CIX was the one who performed it but it\'s actually a bop. SFXs are really on point too...Character: 8/10The anime character design? Still good because I\'ve read the webtoon but for anime watchers, it\'s actually hard to grasp the background of each and every character because like I said, the webtoon is far too different from the anime. The webtoon\'s very detailed, the anime\'s rushed.I really hope as this anime goes by and the story continues, the anime watchers would have a change of heart, I guess... plus in the webtoon, it\'s actually surprising that these characters are not who we think they are. UwUEnjoyment: 9/10Coming from someone who has read the webtoon before the anime, of fu-ing course I\'m enjoying this. I was so hyped when I found out that the webtoon was getting the anime, the author\'s hard work has paid off. But I would give it a 10 if they expanded the anime a bit more, kinda wished this anime was like those with a lot of episodes so it\'s more detailed... I mean come on, if you were reading something you really enjoy and found out it was getting an adaptation, obviously, you would be happy... but what if the adaptation missed or skipped one scene that was in what you were reading and continued as nothing happened, well, I would be pissed.Overall: 9/10I\'m okay with this, but seriously... I\'m very disappointed with this outcome/distribution of the plotline. To the one who was assigned in fixing the plotline to fit in 13 episodes... I appreciate the effort. other things to animate too, one example is Attack On Titan.Not official but, MAPPA is a busy studio and seeing from episodes 1-4 of God of Highschool?

That actually made me disappointed, how the fu- is arc 1 going to fit in 13 episodes?The webtoon\'s story is actually well-written, I give it a 10/10, but I saw how much small details are missed in the anime, actually, no, the webtoon is far too different from the anime. Starting from episode 1, I was so disappointed finding myself looking for Mori singing about him being the best fighter ever.But enough about that, let\'s talk about the MAIN story of this anime;We\'re still at episode 1-4 so anime watchers still don\'t know but like said in the synopsis, there is something much deeper in the tournament, why it was created in the first place. The webtoon has a lot of plot twists and turns so I actually have high hopes that MAPPA will detail that as the webtoon. Though again, I think it\'s impossible because webtoon adapted anime only gets 13 episodes in 1 season.Art: 9/10I love it. Its style is so different from the webtoon but It\'s refreshing to see traditional and digital style combined, from the glossy lips to the red-ish tip of their noses and ears... If anyone is still confused about why the tip is red, it\'s because that\'s how Koreans do it.Sound: 7/10Kinda wished for more of like anime intro but the outro is sick! Might be because I\'m also a kpop fan myself and CIX was the one who performed it but it\'s actually a bop. SFXs are really on point too...Character: 8/10The anime character design? Still good because I\'ve read the webtoon but for anime watchers, it\'s actually hard to grasp the background of each and every character because like I said, the webtoon is far too different from the anime. The webtoon\'s very detailed, the anime\'s rushed.I really hope as this anime goes by and the story continues, the anime watchers would have a change of heart, I guess... plus in the webtoon, it\'s actually surprising that these characters are not who we think they are. UwUEnjoyment: 9/10Coming from someone who has read the webtoon before the anime, of fu-ing course I\'m enjoying this. I was so hyped when I found out that the webtoon was getting the anime, the author\'s hard work has paid off. But I would give it a 10 if they expanded the anime a bit more, kinda wished this anime was like those with a lot of episodes so it\'s more detailed... I mean come on, if you were reading something you really enjoy and found out it was getting an adaptation, obviously, you would be happy... but what if the adaptation missed or skipped one scene that was in what you were reading and continued as nothing happened, well, I would be pissed.Overall: 9/10I\'m okay with this, but seriously... I\'m very disappointed with this outcome/distribution of the plotline. To the one who was assigned in fixing the plotline to fit in 13 episodes... I appreciate the effort.', ""Not sure why I see so many people hating in the reviews.Only 5 episodes into the Anime so far and I haven't read the webtoon, but from what we currently have, we had a dope pilot episode and way the characters meet, we are introduced to the Fighting Tournament our characters have entered, and we see a few badass fights.On top of this, we are introduced to the very shady administrators of the tournament, who try to poison the MC and also are clearly operating some very sinister agenda (which we are not aware of yet)So far this has got my attention hooked better than...any other action anime since Demon Slayer did last fall, although it hasn't quite at the level of Demon Slayer, which is one of my all time favs.So far it's definitely does the job as an entertaining and gripping story that you want to keep watching.

How do you harness it? Do you only take power from one god? Does your charyeok strength depend on the god that chose to give their power to you or can you train your charyeok to make it stronger? How is Jin Mori a god and why did a god just randomly decide to inhabit a person’s body??Clearly they meant for people to read the manhwa before or after watching the anime, but that’s just lazy writing. I hope they explain some things better in (if we get) season 2.I do have to give credit to the plot twists the anime did have (even if they weren’t very well explained).-characters: 7.5/10While I know GOH is mainly a fighting anime, and usually fighting anime don’t really spend a lot of time developing their characters, I actually really took a liking to the GOH characters. They were your classic “I Will Never Give Up” mainstream anime characters, and more.The Han Daewii - Yoo Mira - Jin Mori dynamic was hilarious, wholesome, and gave me found family vibes, which I am a complete sucker for.Park Ilpyo was an interesting character to watch an overly kind, child-like character who holds immense and unimaginable power (I realized this description fits Jin Mori too..)Q was hilarious, and I loved every moment he was on screen. I also loved the goddess who showed up at the end of episode 13.I thought they might have done more with Jegal’s character, but they ended up turning him into a stereotypical one-sided, power-hungry villain with a trying-to-be-sad backstory.-emotional impact & sounds & effects: 7.5/10The Han Daewi vs Jin Mori fight was a roller coaster of emotion. Han Daewi’s emotions and anguish really come across clearly to the viewer during that episode, and you get a good insight into his character.They tried to do something similar with Jin Mori (with his grandpa) but I don’t think it was as impactful as Daewi’s. For Yoo Mira, they didn’t even try.I really liked the effects they used during the fight scenes, it added a layer of depth to the viewing experience besides just two characters fighting.But this is a fighting anime after all, so there aren’t many emotionally impacting scenes.-fighting scenes: 9.5/10If there was one thing this anime had, it was amazing fighting scenes. The music, the effects, the animation, were all outstanding. I don’t think there was a single fight during a show that left me truly bored.I loved the way that the fight scenes had high stakes attached too, rather than it just being “if we lose this, we’re going to get kicked out of the tournament”. Instead it was “If I lose this, my friend might die” and “if I lose this, I will lose the moon light sword, something I’ve been working on my whole life.”The way charyeok was portrayed during fights was well done as well, even if it wasn’t well explained after the fight scenes. The different styles of martial arts was (I think) well done.I just wish they had made some things a little bit more realistic. If you get stabbed through the stomach, you are going to sit down and probably end up passing out. You’re not going to go on and unleash some complex moves you couldn’t even do before you were injured.

The bad thing is there are some sound that not match with the situation.-Character 5Development character is not bad and not great. 3 Main Characters is good development, but the other Meh, bad really bad.

This has to be the worst action anime I've ever seen. The plot is like made from a teenager that just watched some action anime and got inspired to make everyone super op.It's so fast paced that I don't even know what's going on. During one of the fights there was a backstory about this side character. Like who gives a shit? No one cares. They don't even have a place in the plot later on. There's so much unknown powers that isn't even explained. Sure the animation and music is cool and all but the story telling is...straight up horrible.During the fighting, the main characters were facing against some opponents with those god powers or something. The main characters (who are weak as they are right now) literally punch them 1-3 times and they go down. How does that make sense? All they do is punch and kick. Then there's these cool powers and they just get whooshed in my face. GOH has the most boring fights in history as well.The only things that are good in GOH is the opening, ending and episode 13. Even if there's a season 2 I'm not gonna watch it. straight up horrible.During the fighting, the main characters were facing against some opponents with those god powers or something.

And with only 13 episodes licensed by Crunchyroll, they had to rush few things up. Or else the ending would've been major cliffhanger (similar to that of No Game No Life) and would've brought hatred also....The problem doesn't lie with the anime. The problem was, crunchyroll should've licensed 24 episodes to the anime (double cour or split-cour, as they like) so that things could've been made way more smooth which wouldn't have had brought about this undeserving hatred towards this anime.Personally I liked the anime a lot. I mean, A LOT. True, some things might've been a little bit difficult to understand (because at that time I hadn't read the manhwa yet) but once I read the Manhwa, I could understand everything. The action and animation were so good and the character backstories were also super.Easily received 10/10 from me. The problem doesn't lie with the anime.

I was disappointed that many of the funny and heartfelt moments were cut from the show. The ones that did make it were fine, but felt a little inconsistent. The show also under powers or straight up skips some of the characters, which I totally understand due to the limited time frame, but I still can't help be disappointed. I won't spoil in case anyone wants to read the webtoon, but I was particularly disappointed that they underpowed Mira. I also felt the show failed to capture the motivations, emotions and backstories of the supporting and main cast, and the desperation and determination that drives them to to win the competition.Another major failing of the show due to its fast pace was the adaption of the background and world building the webtoon weaves through the story. Due to this limited world building the show fails to feel grounded and as result the peaks of the show don't quite have as much impact as they do in the webtoon. Somethings are confusing or don't make sense, and others are kind of hinted at but not really explained.**Warning** this is a small spoiler for the webtoon, not really important to the overall story or plot, but shows the shortcomings I highlighted above. Definitely a spoiler for the anime though, so be warned or just skip the next paragraph.When they Taek Jegal (the long blue hair evil guy, incase you don't remember) is petrified before being defeated at the end, the show fails to explain why. I assume everyone who only watched the show assumes its part of Mori's abilities, however it was sort of hinted that it was Jeon Jugok (The green hair grandson of Jeon Jaesan the magican of The Six) from inside Taek's body. The reason Jeon Jugok turns into monster was from his desire to live up to his Grandfathers expectations and the pressure of following in his Grandfather's foot steps (which are quite large I might add). After he loses he begins to lose himself to the desire and want for power eventually becoming a power hungry monster that absorbs everyone around it. However in his final moments he himself consumed by a power hungry monster, petrifies himself along with the monster. His grandfather also sees this in his final moments and proud of him and the man that he is, not who he is expected to be. In the show (I feel) this has nowhere near the same emotional impact it does in the webtoon and this is the case for many other moments such as the fight between Mira and Daewi (don't get me wrong it worked in the anime, I just feel like there was much more of an impact in the webtoon).Anyway, as a summary I think the show was an enjoyable watch with great fight choreography, however it failed to portray the original webtoon to its full extent, particularly its world building and portrayal and depth of characters. Finally, I would strongly recommend reading the Webtoon, even if you've never read manga before, or even if you have and never tried webtoons before (Thank me or hate me later, the way you scroll through the story is strangely addicting). Its sad that the adaption only got the funding and amount of episodes it did, because with a 24 episode first season run and sufficient backing I believe this show could have been truly great.Wow this turned out way longer than I expected, thanks for reading and I hope you have a better understanding of the show and its source material :) episodes they had to cut out many of the jokes and impactful moments that really help ground the story and the characters.

I even recorded the battle scenes and slowed it down to see how they did the character animation. It has great perspective in action. The fight scenes were impeccable. And other studios could learn from them.That being said, that's it. Just like many anime coming out.

Looking for the bad review, I can't run away from the fact this adaptation is far from perfect. Also not to devaluable team job. Here is my first review :First thing first, the story aspect. Shout out to MAPPA Studios for adapting manhwa with webtoon and Crunchyroll also giving me much energy for punching someone face. jk. Fast-paced rumbling. I realized episode 1 did not introduce Jin Mori as an average Korean school student and other characters too. It was like martial art masters, teenagers who don't give a f*** about school life then involved...in a competition called God of Highschool. What a Mediocre shounen anime storytelling that skipped aspects of student life rather than manhwa, I understand but you failed it as the plotholes haunt behind and blurred the context of a scene.Second, Extras and character development. Remember, various martial arts and a few episodes are perfect for ruining the story itself. Like I said before, plotholes became from a skipped scene that blurred the context of a scene also the extras are useless and introduced so fast. It was an effect of the first aspect. Isn't Pathetic enough but fine.Third, Overall it was super smash bros. thingy that showcases different martial arts. I like the opening sound design too, good for MAPPA fight enjoyers and beginners who like fewer conflicts in anime. in a competition called God of Highschool.

Got this recommended by a friend and OMG this is soo bad. They copied a lot of stuff from Naruto and still couldn't make it interesting lol.The characters have literally no development, not even the cliche shonen development. The characters come out of nowhere, the powers and the God-level characters aren't even explained a bit. The whole thing was rushed really badly. The fight scenes were decent, that's all. This is probably the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Don't watch it please and save your time. There are much better anime...out there. out there."", 'This is from someone who did not read the manhwa so completely based of what I watched.This anime is such a missed opportunity. While the fight scenes and art style was very appealing (imo), the storyline leads to its ultimate downfall.The characters are memorable with Jin Mori of course having the obvious main character-esque hairstyle and eyes and overall, the art throughout the anime is honestly well done.SPOLIERS AHEAD -------It seems to be your typical fighting anime where there are rounds of two characters fighting one another to be deemed the best however, it introduces interesting layers with the introduction of the Nox organization and...The Six however, viewers are left wondering how the hell these layers tie in to the main plot line.Many of the details are not explained and left to viewers to guess (unless you read the manhwa (?)). Examples include1. Nox organisation: Who are they? Have they always been a threat?2. Jin Mori & Grandpa: How did he get OP? How is his grandpa tied into his fighting style? Did the Grandpa know of Jin Mori\'s ""potential""?3. The Key: Is he useless now after Jin Mori\'s awakening? How did he get to be the key? Luck?4. GOH: How were they formed? How OP are the commissioners? BLONDIE? Who is he and when is he and Jin Mori going to fight?5. Daewi\'s friend: Most of the flashbacks are vague :(While it attempts to show the different opponents past and stories, most of it are vague and brush over any ability for viewers to understand and empathise with the character. Honestly, the plot moved so quickly and all the resolution of the issues that arise are too ""quick?"" The pacing was definitely an issue and rushed.There is so many questions left unanswered and honestly, you will probably be lost after watching it which I guess, I will try to find these answers in the manhwa considering how hyped this anime was because of the manhwa. I can see why one would be disappointed.However, the art style and animation is pretty solid and while the plot lines does have holes, one cannot deny that the characters are pretty memorable and interesting to consider. I do hope more seasons will be done to answer the above questions as well as expand on Jin Mori, Yoo Mira and Daewi\'s relationship.

As with the tower of god adaptation, they change how events occur and go way too quickly through the story. Only positive is that mappa is amazing and they made it look really nice.SPOILERS:In the original story it is heavily stressed that mori is someone who does not lose often, so losing is a big deal when it comes to mori. But in this adapation, mori beats ilpyo in the tournament, as well as unleashing his god power, neither of which are supposed to happen. Mira is supposed to swap...in and beat an injured ilpyo and mori isnt supposed to use this power until the final fight with jegal. Why they changed this is beyond me.Thats one example but for fucks sake this just really pisses me off. They got me excited for the adapation of tog and goh but then do this crap.

In the next episode they start developing story, it could be interesting, but as i said this isnt a type of anime i care about the story.From the 6th episode onward: HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? Going from a regular fighting tournament, to getting married to becoming a literal GOD in few episodes?Seriously wtf happened, the pacing made me feel I skipped entire season between...episode 6 and 7.So no, do not watch this anime and if you do, make yourself a favor and stop at episode 4 episode 6 and 7.So no, do not watch this anime and if you do, make yourself a favor and stop at episode 4', 'To summarize this adaptation felt kinda meh .

I have read the manhwa so...I know the show has some kind of premise but it is not at all portrayed in the anime . It is just a glorified fight anime with just a few seconds of flashback for the characters as a personality .Art : 7/10The art was pretty good but the character design was not to my taste As they looked a little too cutesy . Every body looked like they were wearing some kind of makeup .The action scenes were quite good ngl.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack was good as it complimented the scenes and the opening was a banger .Character : 4/ 10The characters were bland as hell .

In Seoul, South Korea, the titular fighting tournament is taking place, promising the winner any wish of their choosing. A chance encounter brings together three high school kids, who each join the tournament with their own goals and ambitions. Similar to its predecessor, The God of High School had immense hype surrounding its pre-release that quickly faded once the show aired. But while Tower of God was passable, The God of High School is much worse.As the premise suggests, the season starts out being nothing...but a fighting tournament. A bunch of characters with unique abilities pitted against each other for your entertainment. There are also comedic elements at play to break up the tension. The animation quality accompanying these fights holds up most of the time. Other times the fluidity of movement was disrupted due to the lack of frames. This resulted in some action scenes being hard to follow. Meanwhile, the soundtrack did nothing to highlight the action. It checked off the box of being generic fighting music. The only track that stood out was the opening theme. Overall, the beginning of the show isn’t anything special. It is a satisfactory experience that provides mindless entertainment.The plot leaves a lot to be desired if you were looking for a complex narrative. The God of High School doesn’t maintain its simplicity for long however. As the season progresses, the show evolves into a different beast. The fighting tournament is actually a facade to cover up the amount of randomness trying to pass itself off as a story. From magical powers to religious cults, The God of High School has you covered. The production team clearly had no regard for coherency because it looks like they tried to adapt as much from source material as possible. It doesn’t help that the pacing moves at maximum speed. Because of the rushed pacing, there is a significant lack of details for anything. Characters would gain abilities randomly or fights would abruptly end with a cliffhanger. Even new concepts are introduced without being explained further. We can look at The God of High School’s supposed power system, Charyeok. The power is introduced early in the series with no name or context. From a viewer’s perspective, it looks like these characters are using random powers. It isn’t revealed until near the end of the show what the power’s name is and what it allows you to do. Although they provide an explanation, they still leave out how to obtain such a power, having characters start gaining Charyeok out of the blue. This example represents the nature of how The God of High School never gives itself time to flesh anything out. Your show has a serious problem if your audience can’t grasp what's happening every single episode.The only characters worth mentioning are the main trio considering other characters come and go at the drop of a hat. Park Illypo was the best out of any of the side cast. The main characters themselves are only worth mentioning just because they are the main characters. Jin Mori can be described as a replica of Goku from the Dragon Ball series. He is an overused character archetype: simple-minded with his only purpose in life being to eat and fight. The difference between him and Goku however, is that Goku is likeable. Mori’s childish nature came off more as an annoyance than comical. Yoo Mira and Han Daewi fare somewhat better. Their personalities aren’t annoying like Mori. But the moments they are given to be explored are rushed through before they later become stale. The only aspect about the three of them that’s admirable altogether is the progression of their camaraderie. Mori, Mira, and Daewi also are all capable fighters. Their actual fights are less interesting the more the series progresses. These characters never seem to lose a fight or have any consequences for their actions.

These bland heroes and villains are a direct result of the rushed pacing. They remain stagnant since there’s no time to develop any of them.The God of High School started as another decent take on the tournament arc trope. It provided entertaining fights with a lighthearted tone. Instead of maintaining this formula, it changes into something that feels empty. It’s all a bunch of hot air, all flash and no substance. The fighting and the opening theme are the only aspects that help maintain its integrity for the rest of its runtime. Otherwise, it fails to communicate a compelling story. And as far as Crunchyroll Originals go, they still have a lot of work to do.SCORE 5/10 but a fighting tournament. A bunch of characters with unique abilities pitted against each other for your entertainment. There are also comedic elements at play to break up the tension. The animation quality accompanying these fights holds up most of the time. Other times the fluidity of movement was disrupted due to the lack of frames. This resulted in some action scenes being hard to follow. Meanwhile, the soundtrack did nothing to highlight the action. It checked off the box of being generic fighting music. The only track that stood out was the opening theme. Overall, the beginning of the show isn’t anything special. It is a satisfactory experience that provides mindless entertainment.The plot leaves a lot to be desired if you were looking for a complex narrative. The God of High School doesn’t maintain its simplicity for long however. As the season progresses, the show evolves into a different beast. The fighting tournament is actually a facade to cover up the amount of randomness trying to pass itself off as a story. From magical powers to religious cults, The God of High School has you covered. The production team clearly had no regard for coherency because it looks like they tried to adapt as much from source material as possible. It doesn’t help that the pacing moves at maximum speed. Because of the rushed pacing, there is a significant lack of details for anything. Characters would gain abilities randomly or fights would abruptly end with a cliffhanger. Even new concepts are introduced without being explained further. We can look at The God of High School’s supposed power system, Charyeok. The power is introduced early in the series with no name or context. From a viewer’s perspective, it looks like these characters are using random powers. It isn’t revealed until near the end of the show what the power’s name is and what it allows you to do. Although they provide an explanation, they still leave out how to obtain such a power, having characters start gaining Charyeok out of the blue. This example represents the nature of how The God of High School never gives itself time to flesh anything out. Your show has a serious problem if your audience can’t grasp what's happening every single episode.The only characters worth mentioning are the main trio considering other characters come and go at the drop of a hat. Park Illypo was the best out of any of the side cast. The main characters themselves are only worth mentioning just because they are the main characters. Jin Mori can be described as a replica of Goku from the Dragon Ball series. He is an overused character archetype: simple-minded with his only purpose in life being to eat and fight. The difference between him and Goku however, is that Goku is likeable. Mori’s childish nature came off more as an annoyance than comical. Yoo Mira and Han Daewi fare somewhat better. Their personalities aren’t annoying like Mori. But the moments they are given to be explored are rushed through before they later become stale.

I expected too much honestly and got disappointed.First of all the story is so generic, I mean, this is exactly the same stories I got from the 90's anime. Everything happens so fast. All the characters have already been presented and they've all became friends in the first episode. We immediately get a glimpse of their past that doesn't make any impact at all. The main characters are overpowered especially the main protagonist. He immediately got all...the attention from the first episode and was given special treatment. Of course, he came from a special family line.

Absolute oodles of bitterness).I have never experienced disappointment quite like I did watching this anime unfold. Witnessing the absolute atrocity that is this show occur was valuable only in that it was an objectively fascinating life experience to undergo that I hope I'll never have to face again. Truth be told, I'm quite literally angry about what happened in this show, so I won't be pulling my punches for this review.I'm the first person to emphasize my personal abhorrence of over-explanation in all the forms of entertainment I consume. 9/10 times I'd rather be confused than be forced to...witness some kind of cheesy narrated info-dump of a sequence. God of High School, however, turned out to be the 1/10 time that I desperately craved such a sequence. My god, how hard would it have been to set aside just one scene to explain some of the rules of the world? The ridiculously misplaced cult trying to destroy the tournament? The random and inexplicably overpowered old men who kept dropping in out of nowhere to pull arrays and objects out of the sky in the most bewildering battle scenes I've ever seen? I can't believe how confusing this show's plot was - nothing was sourced or hinted at properly, there really were no attempts to actually explain anything that went on behind the scenes of the GOH tournament. I mean, what, I'm just supposed to accept all this talk about charyeok and gods and superpowers in a show that in every way presented itself as being set in ordinary, present day Seoul? I reject the plot of this show with every fiber of my being. It's a disgrace.A previous reviewer mentioned that this show feels like mindless fighting, which is without a doubt wrong, but I'd actually rather it have been a show about a high school martial arts tournament filled to the brim with mindless fighting than the sh*t it ended up being. This is, in large part, due to the animation, which is simply exquisite. Pre the nonsensical introduction of superpowers, I enjoyed every tournament match to the extreme based on artistic integrity alone. I watched a short interview with the GOH team about their animation process recently and the lengths they went to to create such smooth and deliciously lifelike fight sequences (all hand-drawn, mind you) are clear. In terms solely of animation, GOH is a work of art, made by artists, which makes the sickeningly awful plot so much harder to bear.The characters were another strong point in this show for me. Up to around episode 7, I was thoroughly enjoying all their backstories and watching the main trio - Mori, Daewi, and Mira - grow close with one another. I still think the first episode of GOH is one of the best first episodes of an anime I've ever watched based on the way it introduced each character and brought them together. I deeply enjoyed the side characters too, especially the commissioners. I will say, however - and perhaps this is based on my own personal bias - that Ilpyo fell entirely flat for me. I hated the role he played and he felt extraordinarily condescending and invasive. The main trio was what got me so invested in the show in the first place, but Ilpyo's involvement and the entire purpose of his character destroyed that.The sound was fine. I loved both the OP and ending theme song (stan CIX lol) and felt they really suited this show. Otherwise, there really wasn't anything notable about the sound track or sound design.My enjoyment of this show is a 3 purely because I really did love it for the first few episodes. I had such high hopes and expectations for the story and the characters, but at this point I hate the progression of the plot so much it's hard to look back on even those feelings with any sort of fondness. I just can't believe this script was ever allowed to leave the writing room like this - I don't know how the show compares to the webtoon, but if the webtoon progresses anywhere near as quickly and sloppily as the anime, they should have simply changed it. This lazy, slapdash rough draft should have never seen the light of day - it's just too much information all at once without any explanation of why we're receiving it in the first place.I don't recommend this show in the slightest beyond the first episode.

I thought it was alright, though I get where some of the criticisms are coming from. I\'ll try to focus on the positives first before I get into my gripes.Action and fights scenes are the soul of this type of show, and at the end of the day it\'s nice to let trivial things like stories and character take a back seat and just enjoy the sheer spectacle. If the animation is clean and the action is...over the top you can\'t go wrong. I think the show delivers exactly as advertised on this front. But if all you want are animated fight scenes with no story you could watch flash animations from the mid-2000\'s and get a similar experience.So we have to come to the story. Protagonist is a bland power fantasy trope in baggy pants. Just a Korean interpretation of the monkey king, a character we\'ve seen a thousand times already in wholly Japanese works. He\'s a fighter that starts off stronger than other fighters of similar experience and easily gains power to rival each new stronger opponent he has to face at a rate that is unprecedented. He never gets challenged too much and conflicts that arise seem to resolve themselves very quickly by him just gaining a new ability or believing in himself or the power of friendship or something. I thought the plot was moving along at a refreshingly brisk pace considering how most shounen anime typically drag their feet through training and tournament arcs. That said it also ran the risk of feeling like we were going too fast and moving on from plot points before they felt like they had adequate time to resolve.

How does a show look this great and get this rating?

However, Tower of God didn\'t blow people away especially in the animation department but The God of High School had the advantage with Mappa doing it. So there was definitely some hype to this series but did it live up to it?Story: 3/10The premise of a series centred entirely around A TOURNAMENT ARC sounds like a recipe for success considering this is a battle series. Basically, martial artist from around the world compete in a tournament and the winner gets their wish...granted. It\'s simple but effective. This is the case for the first 4-6 episodes of the series. However, after this, they start to completely abandon this premise and instead focus on evil religious cults, super god Jojo stand powers and one note villains that just completely derail the premise of this series and not for the better unfortunately. It gets even worst when things just happen for no reason and no explanation whatsoever. It baffles me how the author manages to turn a martial artist series into some generic good vs evil garbage. The story is incredibly rushed and unnecessarily covulted for what should have been a simple tournament arc.Art/Animation: 7/10The artstyle is pretty unique but slightly off putting initially. You do gradually warm up to the character designs and the overall style. The animation especially when it comes to hand to hand combat are superb and very stylistic which is expected of studio MAPPA. It loses some points though when it comes to ""Jojo style"" battles which are just not that interesting to look at honestly.Sound/Music: 8/10The opening and ending are incredibly catchy. Additionally, the opening is not a style you see a lot in anime which makes the series feel more unique. The OST is also pretty good and suits whatever is happening in the scene or even making scenes even better. The soundtrack can also make the really dumb scenes that are in the second half at least enjoyable enough because of the soundtrack.Characters: 5/10The main characters Mori,Daewi and Mira start off with clear motives and sympathetic qualites that allow us the audience to root for them. They also all have understandable wishes for when they win the tournament. Their personality is relatively one note but their are some nice character arcs that occur for Daewi and Mira that are enjoyable. However, lets toss all of that straight out the window for the second half cause who gives a donkey butt about them right? Supporting characters will just appear for 1-2 episodes and then they get straight out tossed away. There are multiple villains that appear in just one season instead of just focusing on one of them. All of them are one note, generic and garbage villains with no depth to them whatsoever. Their motive is not explained and you are told ""they want this thing because"" and its absolutely ridiculous.Enjoyment: 6/10I really loved the first 4-6 episodes of this series, it was honestly really enjoyable to watch. On the other hand, the second half is incredibly painful to watch and so rushed that I honestly was so baffled at what was going on. If you can shut your brain and just enjoy it for the cool fights then there is something there to enjoy.Overall: 6/10Disappointing really, Tower of God was better in my opinion. granted.

You do gradually warm up to the character designs and the overall style. The animation especially when it comes to hand to hand combat are superb and very stylistic which is expected of studio MAPPA. It loses some points though when it comes to ""Jojo style"" battles which are just not that interesting to look at honestly.Sound/Music: 8/10The opening and ending are incredibly catchy. Additionally, the opening is not a style you see a lot in anime which makes the series feel more unique. The OST is also pretty good and suits whatever is happening in the scene or even making scenes even better. The soundtrack can also make the really dumb scenes that are in the second half at least enjoyable enough because of the soundtrack.Characters: 5/10The main characters Mori,Daewi and Mira start off with clear motives and sympathetic qualites that allow us the audience to root for them. They also all have understandable wishes for when they win the tournament. Their personality is relatively one note but their are some nice character arcs that occur for Daewi and Mira that are enjoyable. However, lets toss all of that straight out the window for the second half cause who gives a donkey butt about them right? Supporting characters will just appear for 1-2 episodes and then they get straight out tossed away. There are multiple villains that appear in just one season instead of just focusing on one of them. All of them are one note, generic and garbage villains with no depth to them whatsoever. Their motive is not explained and you are told ""they want this thing because"" and its absolutely ridiculous.Enjoyment: 6/10I really loved the first 4-6 episodes of this series, it was honestly really enjoyable to watch. On the other hand, the second half is incredibly painful to watch and so rushed that I honestly was so baffled at what was going on. If you can shut your brain and just enjoy it for the cool fights then there is something there to enjoy.Overall: 6/10Disappointing really, Tower of God was better in my opinion.', ""So this will be my first review, mainly because I could not sit idle with this anime and what others are thinking of it, mainly the praise it gets that i think is somewhat undeserved.I'm gonna start and be real honest, I really find this anime mediocre. It has got lots of hype because of webtoons adaptations and what not, but it didn't live up to it. Of course people can still like the anime, but that depends on what you find important, or more accurately, not important at all.As for reasons I watch anime, it mainly comes down to enjoyment, which I can...find if multiple boxes are checked for an anime. This was not the case for this anime.The animation quality was more than decent and the sounds and music went well with it, it certainly hits the mark on these criteria, but on other points the anime fails. The characters are somewhat fun, but even halfway through this anime, the (main) characters still lack depth, with little to no character development. The plot intrigued me at the start with all its possibilities on where the anime would take me, but it really does not go anywhere special, it is quite predictable without much fantasy.  The story that is building in the anime also lacks.Additionally, for an anime that has 13 episodes that has a lot of source material, I do not get why more than one of the episodes really felt like filler.Is this anime for you? Depends. If you are content with good animation in general, slick fighting scenes and good sounds and music that go along with it, go for it. If you really need more than that in character depth, story and plot, you might want to reconsider. find if multiple boxes are checked for an anime.

Everything happened toooo fast!!! It could've been great if the writer / animation studio would've made more than just those almost nowadays typical 13 quick wanked episodes. To be honest I had at first different, great expectations what the show could offer, different things happened as expected, but less to my amusement.I won't spoil anything nor will I go into detail. My review contains an overall feeling and observation how I've seen it.Story:To be blunt, the story was mediocre, but still not crystal clear since the anime...didn't to shove you the plot into your face directly from the beginning. So it has some development due to his wannabe growing nature which was in the end rushed and left you totally unsatisfied.Art:I have to say that since the animation was good from episode one until the end that I thought that it has to be good and helps not getting bored or annoyed. The character design was interesting due to the reddish spiky noses every character has. It reminded me of anime like Vision of Escaflow and the Akagi series.Characters:You'll get some diverse characters with their own twists and background story so I'd say this is one of the stronger points. But since we're still talking about 13 episodes you won't get as much as you'd want. The main character gets his kinda side kicks which are more or less replaceable and the main antagonist is as unreasonable as a mad man can get. So yeah, I saw potential, but since everything is rushed some characters are beyond the point where you can expect a deep story in case that the anime / story will go into a second season some day.Enjoyment:I'd lie if I wouldn't say that I've enjoyed the first episode and that I've seen some potential in it. It has some good fitting light hearted humor here and there while showing off in which direction the animation and fighting will go. The fighting will get better and is for fight enthusiast, especially Taekkyeon (a traditional style from Korea which fits very well since the anime is based on a Manwa which uses Korean names and takes place in Korea) something nice to see. But there are too many things beside the short but enjoyable fights which kills the potential of the show.After watching it further and further I didn't get too confused, but more irritated about the setting, the plot and many details which tried to fit into this world, but for me it got messier / more random the more the plot involved.I've talked about this in detail with friends which could totally understand my point of view, but some of them thought it was still good enough to get some enjoyment out of it. I don't want to say I didn't enjoy it since I've seen worse, I'm even used to downfalls and that my own hopes for some shows were too high set. But I don't get over this feeling that this anime is missing out big, it tried to be something bigger without giving it time to develop the setting and plot which came out of nowhere. And as we all know: if you rush things nothing great comes out of it!Overall:I'd recommend it for people who like fighting anime, but don't expect a deep story and well written character development. So many things seem to happen totally random. It's hard to describe what irritated me the most without spoiling, but to recap: things happen in this world and are taken for granted what is at some points ridiculous!

A história muitas vezes confunde mistério com aleatoriedade e muitas vezes parece apenas que perdemos o contexto do que está acontece, como se tivéssemos dormido 3 minutos e...perdido alguma explicação importante.Os personagens viram melhores amigos em questão de segundos e arcos inteiros de personagem tem começo, meio e fim e questão de poucos minutos. No começo achei que eles estavam acelerando o começo para chegar logo na parte que eles queria contar da história mas não foi bem isso que aconteceu.Em muitos episódios o anime se contradiz, objetos que são super importantes em um momento no outro são completamente descartados sem reação nenhuma do elenco.E quanto as lutas, assim como o Wolf (youtuber), eu gosto de analisar lutas em dois aspectos: o técnico e o emocional, e God of Highschool falha em ambos pra mim.As lutas não tem importância, o anime nunca se dá ao tempo de mostrar aqueles personagens como seres humanos os quais nós podemos ter empatia, o resultado de varias lutas pouco importam e drama é criado e destruído em questão de segundos, e quando tudo é apressado dessa maneira, nada é construído para que a gente se preocupe.Agora no aspecto técnico, sim, God of Highschool tem uma muito bem executada, mas todas elas são muito caóticas e a maioria dura apenas alguns segundos. Um ponto muito importante quando se faz animação é fazer com o que está acontecendo na tela seja 'entendível' pelo público, e esse anime não tenta fazer isso em nenhuma instância. As lutas são explosões de golpes acontecendo pra lá e pra cá, uma confusão de efeitos, explosões e movimentos chamativos.Eu realmente desrecomendo esse anime, acho que esse tempo pode ser muito melhor usado com outras coisas. Tem muito anime bom por aí pra ser assistido e, pra mim, esse não é um deles. perdido alguma explicação importante.Os personagens viram melhores amigos em questão de segundos e arcos inteiros de personagem tem começo, meio e fim e questão de poucos minutos.

But why on earth if you're speeding through the series you show a backstory of literally 3 irrelevant characters (no exaggeration) but cut the better scenes short? Consistency could be a bit better imoBut overall the pacing is pretty quick, it's almost Tokyo Ghoul : re speed but the animation is better. Art actually represents how they're shown in the manga so applaud there.I'd still recommend reading the manga to get better context on certain...parts, but for how long the actual manga is I still say they did pretty good, main parts are portrayed well, just lacks better understanding as to what's going on parts, but for how long the actual manga is I still say they did pretty good, main parts are portrayed well, just lacks better understanding as to what's going on"", ""Decent fight scenes, but I went searching for the source material to continue reading after the season ends and found that there were a lot more and better (regular and fourth wall breaking) jokes and story in general in the Manhua then in the anime and that I had to restart from the beginning to be able to understand it.story:generic but set in Korea instead of Japan, so that's new (even though the source was Korean so not surprising)Art:colorful and dynamicSound: good OP, IMO...character:happy go lucky MCAloof best friendserious enough female friend to keep the others in linestandard characters, good but nothing we haven't seen beforeenjoyment:lot of tropes but they're implemented well, a good fight scene makes me happyoverall:Good fight scenes but for a story in general it's best to go else where character:happy go lucky MCAloof best friendserious enough female friend to keep the others in linestandard characters, good but nothing we haven't seen beforeenjoyment:lot of tropes but they're implemented well, a good fight scene makes me happyoverall:Good fight scenes but for a story in general it's best to go else where"", 'I don\'t typically write reviews because I\'m bad at it, but its quarantine and I\'m bored so here I am. (Potential Spoilers Ahead)GOH another Webtoon comic based Anime like Tower of God but honestly worse. I haven\'t read the Webtoom Comic so I went into this not knowing what to expect but having higher expectations than normal seeing as a friend of mine told me its ""a potential Anime of the Year."" Needless to say, I highly disagree. Lets get into it.Story 4/10 - The story in itself was relatively unoriginal in that it took the route of your classic martial arts competition. The main...character Jin or whatever his name was, is your classic OP character that climbs the ladder in the story\'s tournament with relative ease. The first couple of episodes do a decent enough job to keep you somewhat hooked but the pacing gets relatively worse through-out the show. The first instance of this that stands out the most to me was the wedding. Maybe its more fleshed out in the Webtoon but in the Anime its so incredibly rushed and poorly written for the sake of Character development that I was seriously considering dropping the show at that point. Some point later, the green hair dude summons a clown with a scythe which made no sense as throughout the show to me it seemed like all these flashy effects were made to emphasize power as some sort of a symbolism similar to that of the Kimetsu No Yaiba but I was mistaken. Apparently these ""Martial Artist\'s"" actually have magical abilities or whatever that they can channel through Gods or Ancient Figures. As the show progresses, you really have no clue who the main antagonist is and that still stands true at the end when the MC is for whatever reason more powerful than the ""Fox God"" that is the only one capable of killing Gods... Im confused just typing that out and trying to think back to what actually fucking happened in that mess of a story. Anyway, it was poorly written and I feel the show may have suffered from only being 13 episodes and if the pacing wasn\'t absolute dog shit I likely would have rated the story higher.Art 8/10 - Personally I think the art style was relatively refreshing. It wasn\'t amazing or breathtaking by any means but it was clean and.....different? The noses were exaggerated a bit but I assume that it was based on the Webtoon\'s style. What I really liked was the fight scenes. Despite the story\'s dogshit pacing I feel the choreography and overall animation during fight scenes are what really kept me from rating this show lower than what I did. The character designs were nothing special but other than that, visually I\'d say they did a good job.Sound 5/10 - The sound track to me was relatively average. I can\'t rate it any higher than that because I feel if I come out of a show and can\'t remember a single tune during specific scenes then that means it didn\'t do well of enough job in the sound department. What I found a bit jarring was in the last episode they played a song during the final fight that honestly had no place being there. It ruined the mood for me personally and wasn\'t as impactful as I\'m sure they thought it would be. If it wasn\'t for the Opening and Ending theme song being pretty damn catchy I likely would have rated the sounds of this show lower.Characters 5/10 - The characters themselves were nothing special and like a broken record the backstories for these characters I feel suffered due to this show\'s dogshit pacing.Enjoyment 6/10 - I\'m not gonna nitpick like other people who critique shows do. I don\'t watch anime like its my job, I simply watch anime for enjoyment so overall I rated my enjoyment of it a 6. Its one of those shows you watch because you really had nothing better to do and have that feeling of having to finish it because you started it and its not so horribly bad that you feel it was a waste of time.Overall 5/10 - I think 5/10 is a fair score. I thought deep about wanting to rate it a 6 but honestly this show at its core is pretty average. If it wasn\'t for the Animators carrying this show and doing such a great job with the Choreography, etc. I wouldn\'t have wasted my time continuing to watch it. Another thing I take into account when I pick scores for Anime that I watch is if it\'s something that I would recommend to a friend. Now would I recommend this show to an avid Anime connoisseur? Probably not. Would I recommend this show to someone new to the realm of Anime and looking for something with fight scenes because they like Naruto or whatever? Sure. Then I can leave it up to them and they can give their own opinion on the show.Anyway, if you took the time to read my horrible review I\'m sorry you had to sit through it. This truly was an act of boredom.TL;DR: Show has shit pacing but is saved slightly by good animation. character Jin or whatever his name was, is your classic OP character that climbs the ladder in the story\'s tournament with relative ease.

This truly was an act of boredom.TL;DR: Show has shit pacing but is saved slightly by good animation.', 'The God of High School takes place in Korea in what looks to be a time close to our current day and age. The show itself starts off in a pretty unique way considering its actual theme.Shortly after the intro we start to get introduced to the real plot of the show. In short it\'s as the title suggests. High School students from all around Korea square off in qualifiers and ultimately a tournament where the winner gets one wish granted.There isn\'t all that much character building so far which is always a down for me personally but given the things at work behind the...tournament itself I can sort of look passed that for now. If this ever continues on the animated side of things I hope there is certainly more development for the main three which are Mori, Mira and Dae especially.I think they have potential to be a solid trio and I would love to see them in one of those World Trigger trio battle scenarios. In my mind if we get to see them in action maybe they would end up being The God of High school version of the original Sannin from Naruto that we never got to really see in action. Mira certainly seems as though she can hold her own from what little we see, Especially after how things happen for herThe show has its own power system called Charyeok. I don\'t want to spoil to much so I\'ll just say the key is in the title. It looks like a very interesting spin on that sort of thing and it really intrigues me to see how it\'s handledThe God of High school is certainly one of those. ""Beat em up"" type of Anime like Baki the Grappler but with significantly less graphic intensity. It did even manage to have one of those moments that made me go ""oh sh*t that was pretty epic"" which is hard to do to me nowadays since I have seen so many Action/Shounen shows now. I found its soundtrack to be pretty amazing as well. A lot of the tracks sound really good if you like the faster paced stuff and they were fit in well in a lot of places.I personally hope to see more of this show down the line.

Ah yes, maybe from the first point that revalidates my position that at the end of the day both Animation and Sound are worth a damn how well they are, if then they are going to kill practically all their ""history and characters"" with a terrible direction of the program, these being the primary factors that will push the viewer to want to get fully into the work and precisely ""The God of High School"" (Gohs soon) is something he does not achieve at any time and makes you want to rethink...why you continue watching this series.Story: 2The premise from minute 1 with the synopsis is very clear in the sense of having a very simple function about organizing a teenage wrestling championship without more and that is not a problem, because at the end of the day we all know what we will find in the anime. Now talking about the execution of it is ... .......... Nefarious in the best of cases, and to place a very clear example the anime encompassed around 130 chapters of his main work, in 13 adapted chapters ... ..... the Meme is counted alone.Clearly recreating 10 chapters of the Manhwa in 20 minutes is crazy and it shows all the time we get forced transitions from one scene to another, the actions of the characters without a specific reason and their motivations, summarized battles, even characters that They are omitted and all of this undoubtedly ended up killing ""Gohs"" so quickly that it was very easy by the 3rd chapter to realize that everything was badly done, and it only kept getting worse until its outcome.Art: 9 / Sound: 8Well without a doubt we reached the strong point of the program, and perhaps the only sections that truly met the expectations. Either, with good fighting, fluid movements and pleasant colors have been the values \u200b\u200bthat kept this ""thing"" standing.As for the sound, it goes the same way, great openings / closings and some Dubstep soundtrack that I feel like a weak point on my part, since it can be enough for me, especially when you include it in a wrestling theme, the harmony of both of them.Characters: 2Main Characters = Empty ShellsThere is really nothing about them, they enter the program and a group of friends is formed overnight in just one episode, it is so silly absurd that there is no way to enter it, and as for the personalities of the same they are stereotypes very clichés within the genre. We have the MC who is a combination of Goku (personality) and Taichi (appearance) that all he wants is to hold on to pineapples with everyone without more. While Han and Mi-Ra presented some interesting introductions at the beginning but since this program is all wrong, there is no time to give their due developments to them and they pass without pain or glory, which does not manage to truly empathize with them at the time. Time of truth. And you can imagine that if these are their main ones, how careless they were with the rest of the secondary castEnjoy: 3I generated a great Hype, the first chapter and I had great expectations of the GOHS during all this wait to see it but the emotion lasted me exactly that, 1 chapter. As the program progresses you realize that nothing fits and all the actions do not make sense, at first I could enjoy the battles without more than that was my only motivation, but after chapter 8 it began to get like a martyrdom, becoming the anime already in a task more than pleasure, since we do not understand anything of what is happening and it never stops explaining such simple things that would have helped to give the viewer another more pleasant experience.------------------------- En Español ---------------------------------------------------Introducción a la reseña general: 4,8 / 10¿Por donde comenzar con esta atrocidad de Anime!?.

A medida que avanza el programa te das cuenta que nada cuadra y todas las acciones no tienen sentido, al comienzo pude disfrutar de las batallas sin mas que era mi única motivación, pero llegados a por el capitulo 8 se comenzó a poner como un martirio, convirtiéndose  el anime ya en una tarea mas que por placer, Ya que no entendemos nada de lo que esta sucediendo y este nunca se freno a explicar cosas tan simples que hubieran ayudado a dar otra experiencia al espectador mas placentera. why you continue watching this series.Story: 2The premise from minute 1 with the synopsis is very clear in the sense of having a very simple function about organizing a teenage wrestling championship without more and that is not a problem, because at the end of the day we all know what we will find in the anime. Now talking about the execution of it is ... .......... Nefarious in the best of cases, and to place a very clear example the anime encompassed around 130 chapters of his main work, in 13 adapted chapters ... ..... the Meme is counted alone.Clearly recreating 10 chapters of the Manhwa in 20 minutes is crazy and it shows all the time we get forced transitions from one scene to another, the actions of the characters without a specific reason and their motivations, summarized battles, even characters that They are omitted and all of this undoubtedly ended up killing ""Gohs"" so quickly that it was very easy by the 3rd chapter to realize that everything was badly done, and it only kept getting worse until its outcome.Art: 9 / Sound: 8Well without a doubt we reached the strong point of the program, and perhaps the only sections that truly met the expectations. Either, with good fighting, fluid movements and pleasant colors have been the values \u200b\u200bthat kept this ""thing"" standing.As for the sound, it goes the same way, great openings / closings and some Dubstep soundtrack that I feel like a weak point on my part, since it can be enough for me, especially when you include it in a wrestling theme, the harmony of both of them.Characters: 2Main Characters = Empty ShellsThere is really nothing about them, they enter the program and a group of friends is formed overnight in just one episode, it is so silly absurd that there is no way to enter it, and as for the personalities of the same they are stereotypes very clichés within the genre. We have the MC who is a combination of Goku (personality) and Taichi (appearance) that all he wants is to hold on to pineapples with everyone without more. While Han and Mi-Ra presented some interesting introductions at the beginning but since this program is all wrong, there is no time to give their due developments to them and they pass without pain or glory, which does not manage to truly empathize with them at the time. Time of truth. And you can imagine that if these are their main ones, how careless they were with the rest of the secondary castEnjoy: 3I generated a great Hype, the first chapter and I had great expectations of the GOHS during all this wait to see it but the emotion lasted me exactly that, 1 chapter. As the program progresses you realize that nothing fits and all the actions do not make sense, at first I could enjoy the battles without more than that was my only motivation, but after chapter 8 it began to get like a martyrdom, becoming the anime already in a task more than pleasure, since we do not understand anything of what is happening and it never stops explaining such simple things that would have helped to give the viewer another more pleasant experience.------------------------- En Español ---------------------------------------------------Introducción a la reseña general: 4,8 / 10¿Por donde comenzar con esta atrocidad de Anime!?.

It has a great blend of soundtrack (which in general seem to be a pretty unique sound/set of songs compared to most ED/OPs that are out right now.)Fight scenes are pretty good, albeit generic. Art style isn\'t my style, but pretty unique with their curled (boxer?) ears and red noses. Characters are flat, but the seiyuus are pretty great at giving each character some life. Pacing probably would feel smoother if you read the original material (note...I haven\'t read it, so trying to enjoy the series while figuring out why the hell everything is unfolding as it is--- is exhausting.

While the original manhwa may not be a narrative masterpiece, it at least has a coherent and decently-paced story. The anime, on the other...hand, is dreadfully-paced and at times logically incoherent. I do not place the blame on MAPPA; I believe that they did as well as they could, given the 13-episode limit placed on the series by Crunchyroll. Nonetheless, trying to fit 113 chapters into 13 episodes is going to result in a lot of issues. Oftentimes plot points will be left with barely-acceptable explanations, if any explanation is provided at all.Art (8/10): As many other reviews will state, the art and animation was great. In my opinion, this was the highlight and saving grace of the anime. However, there were points at which I felt let-down with the way that they animated certain moments, although this disappointment won't apply if you are an anime-only.Sound (7/10): The sound was, in my opinion, good. The opening theme was not my cup of tea, but I enjoyed the ending theme, and the ost was good. Not much more for me to say.Character (4/10): The character development was, for me, poorly done. This is heavily connected to the show's failure in the story department: the fast pace at which the show moves gives the watcher little time to connect with the individual characters.Enjoyment (3/10): For me, this anime was a tragic experience. As a manhwa reader, it disappoints me when I read a review in which the reviewer attacks the author of the source material while assuming that the story in the anime matches the story in the manhwa; this is simply not true. In the beginning, I brushed off the smaller changes to the narrative using the excuse that the cut and rushed story points were acceptable losses in order to make room for later plot points. However, as each episode was released, the problems with pacing continued, and I became increasingly disheartened at the travesty that was unfolding before my eyes.

I don\'t often review shows, but this one was a bit spectacular in that it had something very very good, and something incredibly awful: the fight choreography and animation is, in my humble opinion, top notch. The plot? The characters? I haven\'t seen worse in a long long time. This is an anime where, if you only watch the fight scenes, you might enjoy what you saw, and I think that is something to be appreciated. If you even waste a second on ""why is this character like they are"", then you...will be very very disappointed.Because of the fight scenes, I want to watch more. They are animated very well(even if I find much of what is said during the fight tacky, especially the \'special moves\').

You end up seeing many flashy and exciting techniques, but they leave you feeling empty since their origins are rarely explained. Fight genre anime greats like Bleach and Naruto have well-defined logic and framework of how the fighting functions. The God of High School lacks any sense of logic...and dogpiles you with massive techniques and strange terms.The protagonists themselves are boring and honestly forgettable throughout the onslaught of continual challengers and side characters that you are bombarded with each episode. At some point, you lose track of who is fighting for which side and you end up more confused with each episode.The God of High School compares poorly even to the mess that was the Tower of God and it is hard to recommend someone to watch this, unless you want some mindless fight scenes to stare at. and dogpiles you with massive techniques and strange terms.The protagonists themselves are boring and honestly forgettable throughout the onslaught of continual challengers and side characters that you are bombarded with each episode.

I was really pumped as first after watching ToG and thought it would be somewhat decent and already expected some parts rushed.  However I didn't know the pacing would be this fast.  The webtoon is pretty awesome and got me hooked, however the anime skips out of a lot of character development.  If I never read the webtoon, I would not be feeling anything for many of these characters that are introduced.  The webtoon develops their backstory and sort of...makes them somewhat important.  However in the anime we just get a quick 1 min summary of their story during fights and I could care less about these new characters popping in and out.The character designs and world was fine, however the biggest thing I hate about the animation is the amount of flickering and how it transitions scenes.  Things jump so fast that actually bothered me while watching some fights, I get it its suppose to be faced pace, but to me it looked like it was really choppy.  It's not that big of a problem but I also disliked the amount of censorship, but I understand they didn't want to make it have the R rating from the fight scenes.The sound was ok, there were some weird parts where the voices didn't match character emotions that they were trying to convey.

I don\'t need to read the source material to know that GOH needed more episodes. However, that doesn\'t take away from a very enjoyable presentation (mostly animation, with a very striking color scheme at times) with a very underwhelming structure. Know that I will be judging it solely from this anime season.Characters 3/10:I doubt anyone would suggest GOH by highlighting the characters. I sure wouldn\'t.Bland characters, bland motives and bland developments. They\'re severelyrushed, that even the dramatic moments felt like plastic at face value. Something that ""obviously"" happened only for sympathy,...cramped in very short sequences that served the smallest of interests. GOH didn\'t even make things under this aspect feel interesting. Add with the ""quirky"" aspects of almost all characters, this category feels like the one most jumbled and lackluster at the same time.Story 5/10:First season. It clearly has more to show. Right now, it\'s barely passable. But it doesn\'t have to have a brand at this point anyway. It\'s the fighting, the fervor and the wildness that matters the most as a selling point right now. And it\'s very good. A very healthy reminder that good fun doesn\'t always have to be tinged with complexities. A simple story at face value is sometimes enough to easily explain the heart of this (current season of) anime. I\'m fine with it, and I\'m pumped because it most certainly will only get better from here.Art Style 10/10:I\'ll include animation here. And boy, was it so satisfying. It\'s sooo striking to look at, especially at frames meant to give off the most shounen fanservice that warms the fiery heart. I devoured it all with pleasure.Sound Design 9/10:What more can complement a solid animation than a solid OST! Really loved the hype that the OST brought to me, from the OP to the ED and the rush of each fight scenes. Very pleasing, raw energy pulsing from the atmosphere!I would say the dramatic moments or backstories could use more refiningtouches, but that\'s just a nitpick at this point.Final Notes 6/10:Very fun anime. It\'s actually ridiculous how something so simple is so enjoyable. If you\'re a fan of mindless fighting (well not really, but you get it), then this show will be an absolute blast.

I think people are way to critical about the flaws of the show as it wasn\'t unbearable to watch as they say.Fighting (6/10)-    The beginning of the ""first arc"" had some cool looking fights to cater to an audience who wants to enjoy themselves casually. I think that was the objective they wanted to accomplish in the show.Art style (6/10)-     I think people are also too critical of the art...style or do not think its important. If a show looks horrid, then it\'s harder for people to watch. This shows shows a different style of art compared to shows that aired in the line-up this season, and it complements the fighting sequences.On the other hand, I can see what people are getting at. The main offenders are with the characters, the power progression and the story.Characters (2/10)-    You have to admit how generically bad some of the characters are (especially the villain\'s of the show). There character development was squashed to either one aspect or basically nothing. For example, the main protagonist had no concentrated motivation for joining the tournament in the first place. All he said was he wanted to become stronger. Wow, color me impress for how original that motivation is. Not only that, but when he finally found a motivation, it was forced onto him very blatantly and I don\'t know what to think about it.Power scaling (1/10)-    The last major critic is the power scaling of the show. It turned from a very balanced show with somewhat realistic fighting to a generic power fantasy. It was like a switch got turned on randomly whenever the creator got bored. If they kept it the way it was before with the ""first arc"", then it probably would be higher than what I gave it.Overall, this was a alright fighting show with a lot of major flaws with the story, characters, and power progression. style or do not think its important.

God of High School. At first, I thought it was going to be about high school, but boy was I wrong. There’s literally no involvement of high school, except the main characters are around the age of high schoolers. The story plot was utter garbage, the characters were not well-written, everything was a train wreck. Everyone had red noses, even some long ones at that. The only redeeming quality was the animation. I was so bored with it that. Even skipped 2-3 episodes, but rewatched it later on, just to give my full opinion.Now, at first, I wanted to read...the manhwa first before watching the anime. After the first episode, I finally forced myself to read the manhwa. At first, it was decent. The further I read, the more I found it boring. It was very repetitive and predictive. After 400 chapters of it, I could no longer find any enjoyment so I just stopped it as I was not reading anymore of that rubbish.Story - 2The story... Well, I guess there is only fighting, nothing else? Maybe some characters’ backstory as well. Nothing more interesting beyond that, just very dumb fighting.Art - 3It’s a unique art, but not my taste. The characters look too 3d. Also, what are they, clowns? They all have red noses.. Heh, I doubt I can draw any better than that though. But still, the art is nowhere near great.Sound - 5The sound is decent, atleast. Though, the opening and ending are not really likeable. It’s inferior to most openings and endings I have heard before, most in not that popular animes. The voice acting is decent though.Character - 2The characters are not really well-written. The notable thing is that the main characters receive a lot of plot armor. Like the main characters could just get stabbed in the neck by a sacred sword and they’ll still survive.Enjoyment - 2Overall - 3It’s better to watch other animes than to waste your time on an anime like this, which is a dime in dozen.Do I recommend it? No. Unless you feel like you must watch it. the manhwa first before watching the anime. After the first episode, I finally forced myself to read the manhwa. At first, it was decent.

After 400 chapters of it, I could no longer find any enjoyment so I just stopped it as I was not reading anymore of that rubbish.Story - 2The story... Well, I guess there is only fighting, nothing else? Maybe some characters’ backstory as well. Nothing more interesting beyond that, just very dumb fighting.Art - 3It’s a unique art, but not my taste. The characters look too 3d. Also, what are they, clowns? They all have red noses.. Heh, I doubt I can draw any better than that though. But still, the art is nowhere near great.Sound - 5The sound is decent, atleast. Though, the opening and ending are not really likeable. It’s inferior to most openings and endings I have heard before, most in not that popular animes. The voice acting is decent though.Character - 2The characters are not really well-written. The notable thing is that the main characters receive a lot of plot armor. Like the main characters could just get stabbed in the neck by a sacred sword and they’ll still survive.Enjoyment - 2Overall - 3It’s better to watch other animes than to waste your time on an anime like this, which is a dime in dozen.Do I recommend it? No. Unless you feel like you must watch it.', 'I take what i Just said all these episodes..This anime is shit!There is nothing to watch in this anime anymore. It has finallly gone haywire. If you are still interested, go read the manga instead of wasting time on another crunchyroll original.I dont know what the people behind this thought, but i really tried to be positive about this anime, and it has now utterly failed my expectations with the latest episode.I feel like dropping this anime. The only aspect which keeps the anime running is the art and graphics. Or else, go fuck yerself god of highschool -_-. It aint even worty of...being trash being trash', ""There is gonna be some spoilers ahead you've been warned!The God of Highschool is another product from Webtoon x Crunchyroll collabthat just didn't hit the mark for me, not because it's very bad....it just all over the place it's very hard to rate.but lets see what we have, shall we?I find the show hard to rate because while it has poor story and generic characters, it has one the best fights and animation in recent anime, so where does this put this show?first of all, unlike the previous webtoon adaption of Tower of God, you can tell it's not the japanese setting/story we are...familiar with, so maybe that didn't sit well with some of the anime community, but that's not the issue here.story wise, it's a mess! also Manhwa artists seem to like to put the word ''god' 'in their titles, however that does not make it ''godly'', I mean ''the god of highschool'' what kinda name is that? it's just God and Highschool don't go well with each other, and we barely see any 'highschool'' content in the anime, and most fighters aren't young enough to be highschoolers anyway so it defeats the point of the title.well that aside, the pace of this anime was so fast, that even anime onlys can notice the skipped content, and the story tries so hard to keep you interested by trying to fit all the fruits in one basket with all the ''big evil organization, gods, superpowers, and that crap, but it just fails at that, and becomes a mash up that confuse the viewers, and there is so much going on to fit in 13 episodes.however, the anime is about highlighting flashy battles in which they do a damn good job!the characters are either generic or uninspiring, hell when people started to call the anime a dragon ball rip off, they weren't kidding, I mean come on Mori is the Korean ver of Goku, lol the Manhwa artist wasn't even trying to hide it, (spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  Jin Mori seems to be the incarnation of the Monkey King, SON GOKU! lol he even gave him the staff that changes shape, I mean I was just laughing when watching last episode with that twist!Dae-Wi is very bland but he isn't the worst character in the show, at the very least he isn't one dimensional, Mira felt colorless to me , and when they tried to give her a color, they gave her the wrong color with that wedding episode, so that was a disappointment. Park MuJin was the most interesting character for me tho.the animation is where this show shines, so to keep it short, the animation and battles were fantastic and enjoyable to watch, which is the saving grace of GoHOP/ED songs were not to my taste, I never wanted to skip an anime OP this bad, however the OST especially in episode 10 was very memorable and I enjoyed that fight so much probably my fav episode of GoHwell despite all its flaws I did enjoy GoH, personally I love close quarters combat and this anime delivers, even tho some of the fights felt shallow because there was not a good plot to empower the moments but the animation was just good enough to make you forget about that.verdict: if you enjoy some good fights then check it out if you're in for story and characters and check something elseStory: 3/10Art/Animation: 9/10Sound: 6/10Characters: 4/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 6/10 familiar with, so maybe that didn't sit well with some of the anime community, but that's not the issue here.story wise, it's a mess! also Manhwa artists seem to like to put the word ''god' 'in their titles, however that does not make it ''godly'', I mean ''the god of highschool'' what kinda name is that? it's just God and Highschool don't go well with each other, and we barely see any 'highschool'' content in the anime, and most fighters aren't young enough to be highschoolers anyway so it defeats the point of the title.well that aside, the pace of this anime was so fast, that even anime onlys can notice the skipped content, and the story tries so hard to keep you interested by trying to fit all the fruits in one basket with all the ''big evil organization, gods, superpowers, and that crap, but it just fails at that, and becomes a mash up that confuse the viewers, and there is so much going on to fit in 13 episodes.however, the anime is about highlighting flashy battles in which they do a damn good job!the characters are either generic or uninspiring, hell when people started to call the anime a dragon ball rip off, they weren't kidding, I mean come on Mori is the Korean ver of Goku, lol the Manhwa artist wasn't even trying to hide it, (spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

It is expected that the content introduced from episode 6 will be enough to attract various readers.Also, among the recent animations, I think it is the second best production after AOT. Of course...it's a very personal opinion.There may be personal differences in opinion, but I hope you refrain from making harsh assessments of masterpieces that have not yet taken the first step.

I rewatched it and reappraised it to 2 for the simple fact that the animation was that impeccable. It is the only saving grace of this show. Literally every other aspect you can think of, this show does poorly. Pacing is an ADHD-fueled train wreck, backstories are as in depth as a puddle, characters might as well be played by cardboard cut outs due to such bland and generic archetypes, new plot points that seem like they are of any importance immediately just hit dead ends, the plot only exists to...serve as an excuse for action, 90% of the show is plot-contrived. This was unbelievably boring and if it wasn't for the action this would undoubtedly be the worst show on the site. At least the worst rated show here has some form of comedic value. serve as an excuse for action, 90% of the show is plot-contrived.

I didn\'t expect it to be a masterpiece, or make me question my current values. All I came to this anime wanting was good action scenes, and there are some GREAT action scenes. The animation is fluid and has a good weight to it that I really wanted in an action packed anime.Story: 3If I had to equate the story of ""The God of Highschool"" to anything, I\'d say the story is just as interesting and convoluted as something I made up...as a kid playing with my action figures. Things happen only to move the plot forward and get more fights or to handicap a character so they have to learn to fight a different way only to become stronger than that two episodes later after their handicap is removed.Tonally scenes will make this jarring transition from a serious fight between two characters who are morally opposed to a ""haha that\'s so random and funny"" joke thrown in right afterwards. Not that I\'m opposed to either, but I would rather the series stuck to one or the other, or preferably found somewhere in between and stayed there consistently.The world building is so minimal that it\'s the only interesting part about the story, because I have absolutely no reason for why everything is happening on screen other than that ""it is happening"". These huge groups and events are hinted at being the reasons for why the world is like it is, and how some characters have become the way they are, but they\'re never expanded on. I can only assume this is so they can save it for a season two, but I don\'t have my hopes up for any of the big reveals because all of the reveals during the first season had zero impact. There is no foreshadowing or build up outside of the episode itself and that makes it seems like every episode\'s ""big twist"" has the same narrative weight to all the others.The power system in this anime is very convoluted and barely explained at all. Any character can practically have any power, and it\'s like they expect the viewer to just understand how their powers work even when they keep introducing new ones. Don\'t expect a power system like Stands, or Nen, because it seems like an excuse just to have flashier fights, not to have interesting ones. Characters will come up with new powers for no reason just so that a fight will be different, and it\'s impossible to judge the relative strength of any particular move even when the character yells its name as it\'s being used. I don\'t think there will be any ""United States of Smash"" level of hype from an individual move, and I don\'t think any move or encounter will have that level of narrative weight to it either.Art: 9The animation looks great. Especially during the fights. While the power system might not make narrative sense it makes the fights look awesome. While there won\'t be any ""United States of Smash"" moments all of the fights are on par with that moment animation wise. Everything is super fluid and the dynamic camera lends even more to those scenes.The character design isn\'t anything special. You can tell who is who, and what their personality is just from looking at them. The ""villains"" in particular are very ""evil"" looking.Sound: 6The sound direction is good. During fights every move has a good auditory payoff and the music really helps the fights flow better.Other than the fights it’s nothing special. The OP sounds cool, and the jokes are all accented with comical sounds. The characters\' voices will also change to a more ""baby-like whining"" when they\'re trying to be funny or are being played off as a joke.Characters: 3All the characters are super 1 dimensional and can all be summed up in the one-liners they will yell during or before fights. They don\'t have much motivation past what they say on the surface level, and you can tell there is almost no turmoil under their decisions. They have no reason to change their mind until someone else comes along as says ""what if you didn\'t?""Enjoyment: 7It was fun to watch. It was a good anime to start my week.

But it definitely was my least favorite anime that I watched this season. That being said there were a lot of anime I didn\'t watch this season too.', '(Edited: After days of thinking, I feel like 9/10 is too much for me to give considering the faults I found from this Anime. So, I\'ll move it down to 8/10. Not much, but just want to be as accurate as I can be to the overall feeling I had for GoH while I was watching it, and now that a week has passed since I finished it.)I watched the 1st episode of this last year and, I remember liking it so much that I decided to follow the series. Unfortunately, due to ""THAT"" year\'s global situation, my mind lost all the mood for entertainment,...including Anime, so I failed to that.But now, here I am in 2021, I finally got to continue and finish the series and, I feel bad for not watching this during it\'s OG run cause... It\'s so freakin\' enjoyable!I used the word ""enjoyable"" instead of ""Good/Great"" cause, tbh, I have some nitpicks about some important parts of this Anime; Rushed story? Lame battle conclusions? Bad chibi-animation placements?... not even sure. All I know is that, I just kept watching it cause I\'m just simply entertained in almost every minute of it.BUT, I\'m definitely not confident to call it a ""Good/Great"" ACTION-Anime. I\'ll try my best to explain why.STORY: it\'s the usual Martial-Arts-Tournament-Anime cliché; bunch of HighSchoolers competing in a fighting tournament for different life reasons, Tournament is ran by definitely ordinary businessmen, no secret at all, not obviously keeping a secret purpose for the entire thing.For a change though... they\'re Koreans. It\'s set in Korea cause the material is from a Korean comics (Manhwa).It\'s main unique thing though is the ""Deities"" concept. There\'s this ""Borrowed Power"" thing that makes them...uhm... borrow power from Gods.There\'s also the cult called ""NOX"" that... I think... only wants one God? So their trying to... destroy?... other Gods? And need some ""key"" to do it?To be honest, that\'s the first issue I had with this Anime. I don\'t feel like they established NOX\'s motivation, and the ""Key"" thing enough. I didn\'t even realize the ""Key"" was an actual thing cause, I thought it\'s just the person who is, some sort of, ""The Chosen One"".That\'s all I can really remember from the story. But what I most appreciate about the story is the twists and turns. There\'s been times when I enjoyed a fun action-filled episode so much that I prepare myself for another one. Only to be met with a tone-changing cliffhanger. There\'s also some characters I did not expect to have any purpose but did, and characters you\'d think will play an important part, but goes... Poof!What I don\'t like though is when they make it seem like someone who sacrificed themselves just took a deadly attack but then ends up unscathed moments later. Feels like a cheap trick to get sympathy for the characters.CHARACTERS: Frankly, the protags are just as cliché as its setting; The energetic, idiotic, always hungry, but very strong main protag - Jin Mori, The sexy-nerdy, sword-style heir, gorilla-strong schoolgirl - Yoo Mira, and The strong and silent big boi, former deliquent turned 5-star chef - Han Dae-Wi.To be fair though, they play those roles just about right. And with the help of good VA and Character designs, they make a great protags visually.Same goes for side-characters. There\'s also almost not a single one that stoodout when it comes to uniqueness and motivation, but they all played their cliché parts just right. There are some that hasn\'t really been shown much yet but, unless they do a much better story-telling next season, I won\'t really be expecting too much.ART & SOUND: Now... for someone who rated this Anime quite high, I seem to have been very critical of its flaws (seriously. I also just noticed how much nitpicks I had as I write this review).So, where could have that enjoyment came from?... Battle Animation.Not only does it have great character designs, the fight scenes of this Anime are also top notch. it\'s not one of those still-image kind of scenes. You\'ll see every movement of the characters (I haven\'t Googled much about this Anime yet so, I don\'t know what technology they used for this. But it\'s definitely not one of those forced CGI animation).That, plus add the great sound effects and BGM, and you get yourself one heck of a battle scene. I also love it when the OP theme plays during a battle cause, while it\'s not very Anime-ish style of OP, it does feel very fitting for an intense, fast-paced action that almost feel like a martial-arts dance because, as I mentioned earlier, you can see every movements/forms of the fighters.WITH THAT BEING SAID... my biggest complain about these Anime comes from the animation as well.One of my biggest gripe about it is that, while the fighting animations are so freakin\' awesome... it\'s mostly just for the side-characters that were not so important. The protags, and the other good guys (for now?), usually just do some forms/stances for their ""Special Attacks"" and be covered by a large tornado and/or explosion... and that was before ""Super Powers"" came into play.So basically, their opponents will have an amazingly animated martial arts when fighting the protags but get beaten by a lot of poses, get sent flying to the air without making any contact, and the ring will be filled by tornado/explosion/beaming light then, next thing you know, their opponent is lying on floor, defeated.Imagine Saitama about to punch an enemy but, before it hits, a blinding light covers them. Then it cuts back to the battlefield, the enemy\'s already pulverized, nowhwere to be seen... and Saitama is just shown standing emotionlessly... what\'s that... One Flash Man???I feel like that\'s one of the basics of an Action-Anime. Whether the protags outsmart the enemies, or find a weakness, or just simply get a flashback and power-up to the same level as the opponent and fight their asses off, there should be a valid reason why and/or how the protags are winning. Unfortunately, GoH failed on that basic thing.So yeah, that\'s about it. It\'s weird how I came here and gave this a 8/10 rating, and was hoping to do a very positive review but, ended up pointing out the flaws more than the highlights. But in a way, it does make sense.When I was binge watching ""God of Highschool"" these past 3 days, all this complaints of mine never really bothered me enough to ruin the Anime for me. I just literally played it, watched it, and kept going as much as I can cause, it\'s just that entertaining. Art, VA, OST, Fight Scenes, Cliffhangers, twists... these are the things I appreciate about this Anime.Is it pefect? could\'ve been.Is it bad? The lore-building, a bitIs it good? imo, the fact that I enjoyed it so much... Yes. including Anime, so I failed to that.But now, here I am in 2021, I finally got to continue and finish the series and, I feel bad for not watching this during it\'s OG run cause...

The lore-building, a bitIs it good? imo, the fact that I enjoyed it so much... Yes.', ""At first I wasn't planning on giving out a review on it, just like any other Anime but then I decided to write a review because of how many People are deceived by the Flashy and fluid Animation which btw is the only good part of this show is.GoH is one of the most over-hyped anime I've seen in recent years yet It is way too underwhelming. It was considered as  a type of a show one would think of as one of the next Big titles of Modern times. I wonder If there would be any decent adaptations of Manhwa in future. I'd...say except for the flashy animation and aesthetics, this show is as good as Garbage. Don't watch it unless You only care about the fight sequences and not about characters and plot.Let's start from the beginning to see what exactly happened to it, the initial impression of the Anime was just great: A decent setting of the world, Great Animation, well choreographed action scenes with fluid animation, A tournament where fighters from all over the world came and showcased their skills.Then, We get Introduced to the primary characters and their different motivations for the fighting. A good start indeed.But after starting few episodes the show started going downhill with each passing episode and then it turned into a chaotic mess.As it was progressing I found myself unable to actually feel any kind of attachment to the primary characters or a sense of Character dynamics between them. Well animated fights, that were pushing the boundaries of Animation itself, always seemed rushed and empty. After reading the Manhwa of it, I realized that they adapted a total of 112 chapters into measly 13 episodes, more than 50% of the original content was left out which was necessary for the characters of the story and for the audience to actually feel them and their motivations.The anime staff highly focused on fights and didn't care much about the overall development of the story. You'll find a great Fight in each and every episode 'cause that's how they planned it.As we move further into the story, there's realy nothing much as they had left out a lot of crucial information about the world. Bringing supernatural beings such as Gods, Guardians and other devine beings as well, which was just poor storytelling.As for the anime being generic. Well I guess It's nothing to argue about, both the characters and plot are nothing new which at some point even become a nuisance.Let's take the Protagonist for example He is a total rip-off of Goku from Dragon Ball and the main trio- OH GOD THEY SHOULD JUST DROP THIS SHIT ALREADY.Now for the antagonist for this season Jageal Taek was it? He is hungry for power and nothing else and this personality has completely ruined him. He cares just for himself and No one else. QUITE UNIQUE. ISN'T IT? It’s the type of stereotypical antagonist you can come up in just few moments in any type of SHOW and I bet most of You guys have already witnessed tons of them.but To be honest, A show being generic isn't that problematic for me I only see how the story has been executed If they've done it in a good manner then I can enjoy it and won't make a complaint about how It's generic and other bullshitsConclusion:The anime pushed the boundaries of animation and showed how capable they're in terms of animating a show, It’s stylistic and dynamic with fast paced motion. The artstyle was also pretty good. The BG Music accompanied with the fight scenes make the fights more monumental. Again, If you want to see a visual action flick, GoH will be one hell of a ride.Just Like One Punch Man all showing and no telling. OPM was actually better with all showing since there was no actual story from the beginning, But when You have a story and you just neglect it for some reason that just makes the adaptation worse.Don’t let the flashy and cool animation fool you btw. This show wanted to be something special and indeed in some ways, It managed to do that. But beyond the hype It's nothing more than a mediocre story. say except for the flashy animation and aesthetics, this show is as good as Garbage. Don't watch it unless You only care about the fight sequences and not about characters and plot.Let's start from the beginning to see what exactly happened to it, the initial impression of the Anime was just great: A decent setting of the world, Great Animation, well choreographed action scenes with fluid animation, A tournament where fighters from all over the world came and showcased their skills.Then, We get Introduced to the primary characters and their different motivations for the fighting. A good start indeed.But after starting few episodes the show started going downhill with each passing episode and then it turned into a chaotic mess.As it was progressing I found myself unable to actually feel any kind of attachment to the primary characters or a sense of Character dynamics between them. Well animated fights, that were pushing the boundaries of Animation itself, always seemed rushed and empty. After reading the Manhwa of it, I realized that they adapted a total of 112 chapters into measly 13 episodes, more than 50% of the original content was left out which was necessary for the characters of the story and for the audience to actually feel them and their motivations.The anime staff highly focused on fights and didn't care much about the overall development of the story. You'll find a great Fight in each and every episode 'cause that's how they planned it.As we move further into the story, there's realy nothing much as they had left out a lot of crucial information about the world. Bringing supernatural beings such as Gods, Guardians and other devine beings as well, which was just poor storytelling.As for the anime being generic. Well I guess It's nothing to argue about, both the characters and plot are nothing new which at some point even become a nuisance.Let's take the Protagonist for example He is a total rip-off of Goku from Dragon Ball and the main trio- OH GOD THEY SHOULD JUST DROP THIS SHIT ALREADY.Now for the antagonist for this season Jageal Taek was it? He is hungry for power and nothing else and this personality has completely ruined him. He cares just for himself and No one else. QUITE UNIQUE. ISN'T IT? It’s the type of stereotypical antagonist you can come up in just few moments in any type of SHOW and I bet most of You guys have already witnessed tons of them.but To be honest, A show being generic isn't that problematic for me I only see how the story has been executed If they've done it in a good manner then I can enjoy it and won't make a complaint about how It's generic and other bullshitsConclusion:The anime pushed the boundaries of animation and showed how capable they're in terms of animating a show, It’s stylistic and dynamic with fast paced motion. The artstyle was also pretty good. The BG Music accompanied with the fight scenes make the fights more monumental. Again, If you want to see a visual action flick, GoH will be one hell of a ride.Just Like One Punch Man all showing and no telling. OPM was actually better with all showing since there was no actual story from the beginning, But when You have a story and you just neglect it for some reason that just makes the adaptation worse.Don’t let the flashy and cool animation fool you btw.

Fight scenes are well choreographed but the story and direction completely lack. This speed rushing of anime shows is terrible. It creates so many plot holes and ruins true character development. Just read the manga or skip. Same advice for Tower of God. I'd rate the show a 5 overall, but maybe +1 just for the studio budget and animation fights. What's also sad about this rating is that it's the worst for animes. Mid tier shows ruin the excitement to watch other shows...you always want it to hit...different or talk about how it could have been better. different or talk about how it could have been better."", ""What happens when a show gets too much Hype? look no further than the god of highschool to answer that question, coming of the heels of Tower of God, The god of high school premiered with insane hype around it.as an anime centralized around a fighting tournament, I and quite frankly everyone else got bamboozledthe main flaws with the god of highschool are-lack of plot-lack of character development-rushed pacingIt became clear early on that it had little to no plot aside from the fighting itself, to compensate for this the adaptation rushed, and skipped A LOT of content....Becuase the show is essentially a massive fighting arc, characters come and go, there is little development for the main characters aside from the occasional realization mid fight.The only thing that saves this series from not being shit for me is the art.The art is amazing, fight scenes are great, well detailed and unique, but aside from that this show doesn't have anything to justify the hype it generated.even without the hype, this show isn't great.

They tried to pack way too much into 13 episodes. I swear, the last 4-5 episodes was me just thinking, ""wtf is going on"" every 5 seconds. There was hardly any explanation to the world or where any of these entities were coming from or why they were appearing. They...just kept throwing stuff at the audience, making it super overwhelming.The characters themselves were super boring. MAPPA kind of screwed themselves in the first couple of episodes. They jam packed the first two episodes with amazing action sequences, but after that, they tried to rush some character development which all fell flat. The fourth episode felt super odd and didn\'t fit the show at all and I just rolled my eyes at any character development they attempted after that. It was all just so half-baked and rushed which sucked because all the main characters were super boring and one note.The animation itself had some sparks of ingenuity and liveliness, but overall it pretty much equated to the overuse of shaky cam in live action. At times he camera would do multiple 360\'s over and over which I assume they were doing to try and hide the lack of actually good choreography.  I mean, that\'s not to say there wasn\'t good fight choreography in parts, but overall the fight scenes were just to hard to keep track off to be entertaining. There also weren\'t any good character stakes for me to get really invested in either. The OP was pretty fire though, which is honestly the only real redeeming quality of this show.I wasn\'t expecting much, but man was i let down. The writing wasn\'t even halfway decent, really letting down the show when it had some good animation. I really don\'t recommend watching it, even if you\'ve read the manhwa, (which I haven\'t).

While if you put all the fight scenes together then it isn't that bad but that is the only thing that...it has going for it.

GoH's story is one of my favorites, and I love the characters, but the way that everything was portrayed in the anime adaptation, was extremely disappointing.First off, 13 episodes is not enough time for the anime to be at the point where they are, and still have everyone understand what the hell is happening. By the time you reach episode 10, you are watching parts of the story that happen almost 100 chapters into the Manhwa. Crunchyroll left out so many important parts...that make GoH so good. They made it to where there is almost no context as to what is happening.I would like to say though, the first few episodes of the show were quite promising actually. I watched them and was very pleased with what I was presented with. There were a few minor things they left out but, they weren't things that hindered you from understanding what was going on. As the episodes went on though, they continued to leave more and more things out that were more important, causing people who haven't read to be confused... and people who have read, to be disappointed. I thought as I looked at the episode count for this first season that, maybe they were going to take this slow, and make a lot of seasons with 12-13 episodes each, but nope. What could have been 3-4 seasons worth of content got rushed into 1 confusing jumble.If you are at all interested in the story of GoH... if these crappy excuse for an adaptation caught your eye even in the slightest, then PLEASE... read the Manhwa. There story is really well written, and the characters are amazing. Things are explained in great depth in the Manhwa so you won't be confused.One good thing though, that I do have to say about GoH adaptation is that the art was stellar. It holds true to that of the Manhwa. MAPPA did a really good job with making the flashy fight scenes flow well.All in all... very disappointed in the GoH adaptation. Crunchyroll did the Manhwa no justice. MAPPA did well with the art though. It would be nice if GoH got a reboot, and goes through a company that isn't Crunchyroll, because they just need to take their time developing the story better, rather than trying to catch watchers with crazy fights and big important things that come way later in the story.

The story isn't great, the character development is near non-existent and the main character wins fights with some of the biggest plot armor I have witnessed in anime. I will say that the choreography and animation of the fights are pretty incredible but the flow of the story and the explanation for everything occurring is quite rushed and confusing. The story takes place in 13 episodes which for GOH I do not think served them well at all. GOH starts as your basic martial arts fighting anime then somehow turns into some fights with gods where there is...some evil organization trying to do something I guess. There is no good explanation for any of the events occurred and any type of development in the characters are shot away as the dialogue is so rushed. I do not feel connected to the characters in any way. some evil organization trying to do something I guess.

Ill break this review up into 5 Parts, starting with the story and ending with my enjoyment.Story: With no spoilers i'd say the story is about average and near the 4th episodes its good, The plot is like most shounens where your main character must get stronger to fight the main guy in power and the show is not trying to hide it, it's also introducing a side plot with a...villain organization and this is to be honest pretty basic as well. However at some points in the story the show will be itself and not another basic shounen. That's why I give the story for TGOH a7/10Art: There's not much to say about the art/animation It's pretty good, there hasn't been any bad art or animation yet and I've enjoyed the ways they've drawn the characters. However nothing has been over the top, the animation doesn't feel silky smooth such as Demon Slayers animation or the animation of movies such as Your Name.

I enjoy the show, the side characters have pretty good motivations but I do not enjoy the fact that the only reason our main character is fighting is because he wants to fight stronger fighters. This isn't dragon ball, I don't want it to become another dragon ball. I want this show to be it's own and writing your main character into a corner like this, stunts the shows growth. The main character is too basic and just reminds me of Kirito and Goku which is not a very good combination. Good side characters, poor main character5/10Enjoyment: No matter what I've said up above this is the most important score out of them all, With any anime it doesn't matter if its bad or not or if the characters are basic. It doesn't matter that their motivations might be stupid. What matters is that the reader/viewer is enjoying the show. If it's a bad show but you have buckets of fun watching it, then who cares!

It starts out fairly grounded in reality as a martial arts tournament with competitors from all around the world. Unfortunately, that only applies for the first 3-4 episodes. From then on it quickly descends into what I can only call it as a the anime version of what kids pretend to play as during recess in the first grade. Imagine the power-scaling that happened in Naruto from start to finish but condensed to 13 episodes...and you get this show. I haven't read the Webtoon but from what I have heard, the story isn't actually this rushed in the source material and it shows. It feels like they're trying to cram 3 arcs worth of content into a single short season and it plays out like someone playing a movie on the TV but they're pressing the skip button every 10 minutes before they just fast forward to the end credits. Thankfully, the story in this show matters not, for the real reason to watch it is for the insane fights and fluid animation.Art 9/10The art style has a very Webtoons look about it as is expected, but it works very well in motion. The fight scenes are absolutely gorgeous and they 100% carry the show from beginning to end. Hits are impactful and character designs are unique and pretty to look at. The story being as rushed as it is doesn't show itself as a problem as much as I was expecting it to because I was too focused on the pretty moving pictures. I give it such a high score because of how much to does to redeem what would otherwise be a terrible watching experience.Sound 8/10The sound design works in tandem with the animation to create a really entertaining and enjoyable binge-watching experience, included story speedrun notwithstanding. The sounds hit hard and work to enhance the fight scenes in a way that the Webtoons cannot on a fundamental level.Character 6/10The only reason I gave this category the high score that I did compared to what it deserves is that the designs are so cool which is made very evident by the end of the show. At this point, characters are turning into gods left and right and I love it. The designs for these characters and their powers are so cool that I forgot that the story was bad for a moment. Beyond that however, there is nothing else memorable about any of the characters aside from how they fight.Enjoyment 8/10After what I heard about the pacing of this show I thought I would hate it. A rushed plot with unmemorable characters and generic setting sounds like the perfect recipe for a garbage show but everything else about it carries this show from a 5 to an 8. This show truly does something unique in that it has turned me into a monke while watching it. Any time there was plot development I felt compelled to skip it just to watch two people hit each other really hard and I'm completely okay with that. The show did what it set out to do really well which was to show off people fighting.Overall 8/10There are a lot of people giving this show a very low score calling it generic and rushed...they aren't wrong I just wanted to point that out. If you're looking for a show with a complete story-telling experience then this is not it. If you want to experience the story I suggest reading the Webtoon as it probably does that better than the show ever could. Where this show excels is where the Webtoon begins to falter and that's the animation.

I didn\'t expect to be so disappointed after watching it. Probably one of my least favorite anime ever. This is why a web comic cannot become an anime. They cannot compare. It just left me confused and disappointed.', ""It's not bad nor is it good. Now hear me out. The animation is amazing, so are some of the fight scenes. But, the anime is completely unrelated to its name in my opinion. The pacing is also rushed in the anime. I read the webtoons, and trust me if you want to watch this anime, I recommend reading the webtoon first. It's packed full of action with funny side drawings that would surely keep you entertained. From my personal experiences, the anime was just not for me.I liked the manga because it really made me want to read more. Well, technically it's a webtoon,...but it was one of the first mangas that I actually wanted to finish. The anime on the other hand, although it did have some amazing animation, it was rushed and completely ruined the whole webtoon. but it was one of the first mangas that I actually wanted to finish.

But being somebody who has read the webtoon, trust me, a lot of things are about to unfold that you may or may not be prepared for.Although I did notice that anime cut a few scenes which would\'ve provided context to the actions of some characters, or introduced them.The reason I rated the story a 7 is because (things will get messed up in the future that\'ll be very hard for you to remember).Overall, I feel that this is an anime...you need to binge instead of watching weekly, or you\'ll lose interest pretty quick.The Art: 10/10Now this, this deserves it\'s score because it is as good as it was in the comic. Mappa did a great job on the fluid fight scenes, adding depth to the characters.Music: 8/10The OP and ED are great, as always. The soundtracks chosen for this show did their job well. I like the trend of how there are Korean songs for the ed/op for these webtoon adaptation, paying homage to the fact that these comics were originally Korean.Characters: 7/10Seeing these first few episodes, I think I get why people think Mori\'s character is shallow. Daewi and Mira have backstories, although they haven\'t been fully explored, or expressed yet.Again, This anime cut out a few parts which should have been there to provide context. Mori might seem like a naive guy, but trust me, he\'ll grow out of it pretty soon.Another thing I\'ve noticed is that the show doesn\'t give much attention to the wristbands the participants wear, that keep their health in check and tracks the power they hold. That is a major thing because it shows how Mori\'s levels change when he uses recoilless taekwondo thus revealing the reason behind him being strong.Enjoyment: 8/10I feel like this anime, at this point is giving off the vibes that tournament arcs do. But aren\'t they fun? Along with the fluid fight scenes, I think it\'s doing a good job in it\'s field.Overall: 8/10Park Yong-je (the author/artist of the comic) built a pretty vast world for this one. So if Crunchyroll messes up with the direction this goes in, this anime will result in a massive blunder.As I have mentioned before, I\'ve read the webtoon. So naturally, I know some things about the characters that some people don\'t. I think the story has a pretty solid base, and it doesn\'t progress like a typical anime, courtesy of it being a webtoon.I think people should give it a second chance, and try to see the story for what it is. God of Highschool is a very successful comic, and so far the anime is staying true to the source.I think that this anime shouldn\'t be taken at face value.

But the anime characters don’t have any interesting problems.  The main character of the story, Jin Mori, is very similar to the famous Dragon Ball series’s main character, Son Goku, who just likes to eat and fight strong enemies, to become stronger. Both are oblivious to common sense. The anime does better with Han Dae-wi, who has a good backstory....STORYTELLING: 2-3 Cuts out too much. It was probably to lighten the load of the animators and save time from animating back stories for the characters, but back stories are needed for the anime to tell a better story. The anime’s plot is  just fight scenes.PACE: 4-5, not too slow, not too fast.ACTION: 9,  The animators did a good job on giving it a wow factor. The fight scenes were animated nicely. The details and the animation looks clean, not lazy. Both the animation and the choreography clearly had a lot of work put into them.MUSIC: 7 Energizing and the line “I'll be your contradiction” is very iconic, like it will get stuck in your head.OVERALL: 4-5Skip the anime and read the webtoons.  The animation, fight scenes, and music are good, but the story is not something I would watch, probably my bias from reading the webtoons, which are much more elaborate.

All of the eager to fight stronger fighters, all of the tournament arc settings etc and even the MC is based of the Sun Wu Kong (Goku also based of this character). i like the OSTs, very astonishing, the animation was spectacular, MAPPA never fails ou down on that. The only problem i got with this GOH was it's pacing?! It was too rush and mess up. Come on, like can't you give a proper pacing? i get that it's only merged into 13 episodes due to Crunchyroll wants to focus on...their next project maybe. BUT, if the anime got at least 26 episodes with no cut or changed scenes  etc, perhaps my opinion may differ. They rushed the pacing soo much that i somehow don't even understand what was happening.

The fights were relatively clean in animation. The sound was alright. But the story though, yeah, not very awesome.The biggest problem with this anime is that it is incoherent. You begin with a standard HUMAN fighting tournament, but then they get superpowers which kind of retcons the idea that these guys are masters of martial arts as they built up in the first few episodes.Also, the story direction is dreadful. There is no plot other than fight and win. The fight and win. Then maybe fight...and lose. Oh, wait, no, fight and win. This story just jumps from place to place introducing seemingly entirely new plot points every episode that border on changing the genre.In short, the story does not and will not make sense.Howevere, the saving grace is the art and animation, or, at least, it stops the dumpster fire.I would not recommend watching this anime unless you want to try and see if your on acid or if jumblingly confusing storytelling is your thing. and lose.

But other than that, it was just kind of confusing and boring at times.Literally out of nowhere someone\'s getting married and completely drops this whole fighting stuff. It just doesn\'t make sense. The anime literally doesn\'t want to stay in it\'s tracks.

Side stories that developed other characters, side stories that even developed the main characters, training, among a plethora of other things.2 - Overarching storyline: This ties in with the first point. It really felt like we were just thrown into a fight every episode with a little bit of background story. The...first episode was probably the worst of it, we were just thrown straight into GOH and expected to know what was going on. If you had not read the webtoon series, I don\'t know how you would know the reasoning behind anything. Who even are the bad guys, why are they bad? What is anyone\'s motivation other than ""I wanna fight strong people""? SO MUCH INFORMATION WAS SKIPPED OVER, this season easily could\'ve been 24 episodes. Yet they decided to crunch ALL OF IT into 13 episodes. This isn\'t only the anime\'s fault btw, even the webtoon leaves a lot to be desired.3 - Animation and Sound/music: The animation was great, the transitions were cool, the sounds/music were very good too, loved the OP and the ED.

Crunchyroll, se você não queria arriscar um alto investimento e não ter o retorno esperado tudo bem, afinal, estão arriscando em algo novo, mas pra quê inventou de adaptar 112 capítulos em 13 episódios?

The hype that the anime got was the best part of this show. I enjoyed it more then most people, but not for the right reasons. I tried to like this, but I couldn\'t no matter what.I will warn you this review has spoilers, but there not much point worrying about spoiling garbage.A entire anime based on a tournament arc is actually pretty intriguing, but it\'s so badly executed, that it\'s such a waste, and there is one big reason why. GoH\'s worldbuilding is absolute garbage. The tournament,...the characters, the powers, the fights, and other things are riddled with plot holes and what\'s actually there is boring and honestly so ridiculous it\'s not even funny. The way the tournament works and is broadcasted doesn\'t make sense, there\'s no interaction outside the arena, things happen for no reason, the competitors aren\'t even in high school, the powers in this show lack ANY depth or explanation, blah blah blah. GoH lacks cohesion. It\'s like if I got obsessed with a shounen in 5th grade and tried to make my own. Come on. Anyone can do better than that.The first episode was definitely the best of the entire season. It introduced characters well, and a genuinely interesting bike chase occurred. The build-up toward the tournament was excellent and the fight scenes were great to watch. However, GoH doesn\'t do anything else beyond the first episode. In fact, none of the episodes ever get better. I can\'t count the amount of times I got bored and stopped paying attention. Not like I had anything to miss or anything...The main trio, Mo-Ri Jin, Mi-ra Yu, & Dae-wi Han are supposed to be the best buddies you\'ve ever seen, but they lack any chemistry. The reason they became friends was stupid, and pointless. You can\'t really tell how close they\'re supposed to be until you see the ending of them having fun. They have nothing in common besides ""haha i bash bad guy"" or whatever. Who cares? Why should I worry about such plain protagonists? How is it friendship if they don\'t even bother building one?The characters in general are also very bland and worthless. There is no ambition to their fighting. They just seem to be fighting for the sake of it. To fix this, they shoehorn a backstory during a fight, which is pretty dull and not worth caring about. Still lacks ambition anyway. Mi-ra Yu came to the GoH tournament to find a successor to her sword or something. She loses the sword. Decides she doesn\'t want to get married. And yet she continues the tournament? Dae-wi Han fights for a sick friend, and then he dies. He gets over it a minute later and stick participates. Why??? The only decent backstories became worthless and the characters redundant. Everything else is people\'s lives suck so they need to complete their life by fighting in a ""high-school"" tournament.That\'s what GoH suffers a lot of. A lack of ambition. The main villain group called Nox (I think?) attack a high-school (not really) fighting tournament, but why? Why do they want the ""key""? What kind of villain just randomly attacks some place for some power for NO REASON?! Why do they want to take over the world? What is the reason behind ANYTHING? This is never explained, like it\'s expected for us to know already.The best part of GoH was its fights. It actually made me go ""woah"" at times and that doesn\'t happen very often. There are fights that absolutely look amazing, but there\'s a lot that doesn\'t look all too impressive. The choreography is my biggest issue, because it\'s always so out of place. Honestly the only reason I watched this anime. Just sakuga. None of the characters, tension, or the way they look when fighting. If the plot and characters were meaningful, they could\'ve been more iconic, but nope.Speaking of the looks of the anime, it looks... fine. It doesn\'t look horrible, like you\'d expect from a MAPPA production. The main issue is the character designs. The characters have noses and ears so red you\'d expect a damn flu outbreak to happen ASAP. Still a better villain than Nox. The character\'s actual looks suck, and aside from a few, they look forgettable and sometimes looked way too familiar to a few certain other characters in other anime...The ""character development"" relies heavily on backstories and getting over it. The ""training"" to the characters\' skills is just someone saying ""you can\'t do this"" and then they do it later. Especially Mo-Ri Jin. What\'s even the point of it then? They slap in powers without explaining it, and forget about it later. The power-scaling is the most ridiculous thing I ever seen. Mo-Ri Jin already has enough plot armour. What\'s the point of having these Goku-level powers I wonder. And speaking of plot armour, why is there no struggle with these central characters? They get beat up, unlock new power, and win.Another strong reason this crap is crap is because of the ridiculous pacing. They adapted 118 webtoon chapters into 13 episodes. These chapters aren\'t 4 pages for god\'s sake. Everything goes so fast you don\'t even know what\'s going on. It\'s almost as if the anime is an ad for the webtoon. Pretty terrible trailer but whatever. By the time of the last episode, I just gave up. Good sakuga can\'t save this. Why did Crunchyroll only fund for 13 episodes anyway? Did they even bother reading the webtoons?Don\'t forget about the crazy advertising for webtoon and Crunchyroll. Oh wait you CAN\'T forget. It\'s everywhere, for no goddamn reason. What\'s this got to do with the anime. It\'s dumb and sleazy. Why would they even advertise their own production companies for one of their most crappiest anime ever?The OP theme is basically shredding your eardrums with dubstep. It\'s not good whether you like dubstep or not. The OST is so unremarkable and doesn\'t add anything. No music would actually fit such an anime with a lack of depth.GoH was such a disappointment. It had strong potential thrown away for some weird plot. Like I said, I want to like this. Seeing the behind the scenes, and hearing what the webtoon author had to say and seeing the mo-cap production made me more keen on this. But GoH can\'t redeem itself as more than just a simply, bad cash-grab. These webtoon adaptations have been badly done and the GoH community was angry at this too, so maybe the webtoon is better, but this anime doesn\'t justify it.

I'm personally not against having an OP main character as long as they switch up the generic sob story background and so I didn't quite know whether I liked the main character or not. The art was pretty good and fight scenes were done well, but that was basically the whole show, fighting in the arena. It feels like they tried to cramp too much story into 13 episodes, as it started off more realistic and kinda went off the rails with...the newfound usage of Charyeok later on in the series. The other thing was that although the fight scenes were done well, they were over super quicky. Like, a character would get knocked down after about two minutes, suddenly have a power boost and then win in twenty seconds. It wasn't awful and I'll probably watch the second season if there is one, as I think the story has the potential to develop if they don't try to cram so much in each episode. the newfound usage of Charyeok later on in the series.

And that's what I got."", 'The God of High School is a South Korean manhwa released as a webtoon and illustrated by Yongje Park. While receiving a mobile game adaptation and an ONA short attached to said mobile game, it eventually got a proper television adaptation animated by MAPPA that aired from July to September 2020.The plot is about as straight-forward as you can expect it to be with that kind of title. The God of High School is a South Korean national martial arts tournament in which high school students from all around the country participate. The rules and limitations of the tournament are pretty daft and ridiculous, but...let’s be honest. You’re not watching this to get an accurate representation of real-life school-level martial arts tournaments. The rule of cool is absolutely working overtime here, what with one of the rules being that participants are allowed to use any weapons they want, except firearms. Yes, you will have people with swords and metal bats fighting people who are unarmed. No, it doesn’t make any sense, nor should you expect it to.Doubtless, however, there’s more than mere martial arts involved. Early on, I found myself wondering if what I’m seeing is just over-the-top visual metaphor – such as in Kuroko no Basket - or genuinely supernatural – such as in Galactik Football. Don’t repeat my mistake. Waste no amount of time with such pointless musings. They’re literally superpowered. Yes, all that supernatural-looking shit is honest-to-God supernatural. So, if you’ve come here expecting an anime about martial arts à la Hajime no Ippo, then you can turn around and leave right now. This is zoomer Dragon Ball Z.It should also come as no surprise that there is a darker, more nefarious purpose behind the God of High School tournament. I won’t spoil it, but it’s about as absurd and contrived as you think it is. What can I say? It’s just another high school battle show. Of course the premise is imbecilic. It’s par for the course.In consonance with MAPPA’s style, GOH is bright, colorful, youthful, hip, and really aggressively animated. While there is no question that the colorful and fluid aesthetic of the show is to be greatly credited for its popularity, the reason I call the animation aggressive rather than a more unambiguously positive adjective, such as amazing, is because in contrast to Ufotable, who endeavor to make every frame of animation as polished as humanly possible, MAPPA seems to favor just having explosive movement at all times on screen. That’s not to say that it isn’t impressive animation, because it is, but it has to be said that the structural integrity of the objects and characters on screen sometimes gets distorted in off-putting ways that just break immersion. I’m not talking Naruto vs. Pain levels of overexaggerated fluidity, but certainly more Looney Tunes than I would have personally liked.Far and away the aspects of the show’s aesthetic I disliked the most are the way ears were drawn and the way noses were colored. All of the characters’ ears are drawn to look very big and ostentatious. They all evoked the image of Dumbo for me, and not in a fun way. Particularly the top of the ear lobes is invariably drawn to hook down in a bizarre way. I can’t even describe it properly. Just look at a couple of scenes of characters talking and you’ll understand exactly what I mean. You won’t be able to unsee it. As for the noses, they’re always highlighted with a bright pink color, much redder than the rest of the skin. It makes it look like all characters constantly have a cold. Simply put, it just looks silly. In contrast to the ear thing, this is not unheard of in anime. It’s actually fairly commonly used in shoujo shows. I remember there being quite a bit of that in Clannad, but seeing it in an action show laden with blood and violence was… strange. Made it difficult to take some villains seriously when they look like Rudolph. I hoped it would either go away or grow on me in time. It did neither. It bothered me the whole time through.Additionally, a secondary consequence of overanimating every single moment, even the most mundane ones, is that when the studio finds themselves faced with a legitimately high-stakes scene where things are expected to kick into high gear, they have little room for upward moment, because in a sense, high gear is the standard. Hyouka is a prime example of precisely this kind of problem. As such, they have to resort to lateral movements into various dramatic arthouse animation styles, which, to be sure, can be used to great effect in the absolute climax of ultimate battles – the final fistfight between Simon and the Anti-Spiral from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann comes to mind – but there is a reason that sort of thing works in that context. The arthouse animation in and of itself is not what makes the scene exciting. Arthouse styles can, in fact, be pretty hit or miss. The first phase, so to speak, of the Ekko vs. Jinx fight from Arcane is a great illustration of that very fact. The LSD color trip made me tune out after 5 seconds flat. Standard, proper action animation is, at face value, vastly more impactful and exhilarating to watch. Why, then, would you ever resort to non-conventional animation for select action scenes? Because in very select few cases, you will want to make a point that goes beyond just the bare-bones content of the action. Naturally, any good fight will have an emotional narrative running simultaneously with the physical action narrative, but in those moments, you want to intentionally divert the audience’s focus to the emotional dimension instead. It’s a sleight of hand that can be used to great effect when employed sparingly.In GOH, however, you have an overdramatic scene like that as early as episode 5. It’s not an irredeemable scene, and the fight is still plenty exciting, but personally, it took me out of it and prejudiced my investment. It felt too early and too cheap. It felt unearned. We don’t even know these characters well enough to be invested on that level after having spent so little time with them. It felt not like an organic development of the story, but rather the studio seeing similar scenes in other media and simply wanting a scene like that in their own show just for the sake of it.While we’re on the subject of rushing unearned events, the escalation in this show is just ridiculous. In the span of the meager 13 episodes GOH boasts, you will go from standard fistfights in the first episode, to literal gods in the last episode doing battle so intensely that it affects the weather and various natural phenomena around the world – much like Saitama’s final punch against Boros. In contrast to much of the commentariat, I’ve long been a proponent of the idea that no amount of escalation is too much escalation, but I do believe there is such a thing as too much escalation in too short an amount of time. Point and case, every time a new fighter, a new villain, or a new power-up gets introduced in GOH, though the show makes a big spectacle of it in the moment, said element immediately gets powercrept and buried in irrelevance within the next 5 minutes to make room for the shiny new thing. What was that Syndrome line again? “When everyone’s super, no one will be.” The excitement one feels at the spectacle presented is significantly nerfed by the knowledge that whatever one is currently witnessing will become trivial and useless 60 seconds later. And since the show has so little time in general, not only does it not have time to let its power-ups breathe properly, but it also does not have time to properly develop its antagonists. One of the coolest power-up scenes in the entire show takes place in the context of a fight with a literal Whomegalul antagonist. The reason Goku going SSJ for the first time felt as epic as it did was not just because the spiky blonde hair looked cool, but also because of the villain he was up against. Frieza was well established as an insurmountable threat. Imagine how underwhelming it would have felt is he had gone SSJ for the first time in his fight against, say, Android 19, you know, the irrelevant fat fuck android from the beginning of the Cell saga. Don’t remember him? Yeah, exactly, that’s my point.Still, the rate of escalation aside, I don’t actually have a problem with the amount of escalation in and of itself. My theory is that any amount of escalation is fine. You want to go from basic bitch fistfights to universal space battles? Fine, go for it, but when you reach the absolute ceiling of cosmic power levels, that’s when your story needs to end. TTGL is incontrovertible proof that this theory works. The problem I am about to outline did not dawn on me until about episode 8, when it became obvious to me that the show would not have time to deal with all of the big dick villains it had set up. As it turns out, these 13 episodes are not an exhaustive adaptation of the GOH story. This is only season 1. As such, sequels are to be expected. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because the sequel has apparently been confirmed. As long as we actually get a continuation, I don’t mind the fact that a single season doesn’t cover the breath of the story. I’m fine with waiting for sequels. That’s not the problem. The problem is that we’ve already reached the level of (literally) godlike cataclysmic world-ending power levels. Where are we supposed to go from here? I’m not suggesting that I know for a fact there is no place to go. Maybe season 2 will prove me wrong. I am, nonetheless, definitely suggesting that it’s unlikely that there is a place to go. Further escalation will be a difficult sell and the probability that it will fall flat is overwhelming, much like all of the escalation in DBZ after Final Form Frieza, all of the escalation in Bleach after Second Resurrection Ulquiorra, or all of the escalation in Yuu Yuu Hakusho after 100% Toguro.The nature of how the superpowers fit into the larger world actually brings forth some interesting questions, as well. A supernatural show set in a medieval setting is one thing, but when you set it in a modern, contemporary setting, things inevitably become murky. Since we get to apocalyptic power levels, it begs the question of how the existence of these superpowers affects the balance of the world’s political power. It would appear that nations other than Korea have no knowledge of this Charyeok, which is what the supernatural abilities are called in GOH. Not only that, but Charyeok can and is in fact used to annihilate entire armies, cities, aircraft carriers, and islands. As such, does that technically make South Korea the world’s greatest martial power? If so, that’s hilarious.As far as the characters are concerned, there’s not much depth to be found, but they’re fun. Jin Mo-Ri is our protagonist. He has all of the fun-loving and happy-go-lucky personality of Naruto, without all of the complexity of Naruto. You might not think Naruto is a particularly complex character, and you would be right, which kind of says all there needs to be said about how one-dimensional Mo-Ri is. To be sure, the author attempts to give him depth by ham-fisting some manner of tragic backstory in there, but it was so telegraphed that as soon as there was any kind of flashback scene, I instantly tuned out. His design is also almost identical to that of Tai from Digimon. I am hard-pressed to believe this to be a simple coincidence. At the very least, in contrast to Naruto, Mo-Ri is crazy strong, so he can fight his own battles and all, but his obvious skill contrasts very starkly with his lackadaisical temperament. It’s a tough pill to swallow.Yu Mi-Ra is the main heroine of the series. She is the 25th master of something called the Moon Light Sword Style. Much like Kuina from One Piece, a good deal of her character arc has to deal with the challenges of inheriting a martial art and a dojo as a woman. Your mileage with that will vary, but personally, what I found really unattractive about her was the design. Giant frog eyes, round featureless glasses, basic school uniform, short bordeaux hair that stands up to the sides? Eh, I’m not about it. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, just look up a picture of her. Put plainly, I didn’t enjoy looking at her. Her design is fine for a side-character, but not the main heroine. For what it’s worth, it would appear that her design changes significantly in later chapters of the story, so I will hold off judgement on that, but insofar as the bit of the story actually adapted by the anime, nah, she’s just unappealing.The simultaneously least interesting, but also most likable main character is GOH’s deuteragonist, Han Dae-Wi. He looks like a normal dude in black pants, white shirt, and short messy black hair. His shtick is karate. There’s really not much more to be said about him. He has his own vague backstory, but literally who cares. He’s cool. We like him.All in all, I know I’ve spent most of this essay shitting on the show, but don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to leave you with the impression that GOH is a bad anime. It’s good! It’s certainly a high effort production. In the words of one MAL reviewer, “go into your kitchen, put on some dubstep, and start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and imagine the most generic fighting anime possible. Well done. You have created an experience almost as horrible as The God of High School.” While I wouldn’t go that far, it’s indisputable that it has a number of significant flaws that keep it from becoming a cultural icon, which it certainly had the ingredients to be, rather than the transient experience it actually turned out to be.One thing you can unequivocally not fault the show for is having a slow pace. You will never be bored. There’s always something happening and the story will move along at a breakneck pace. If anything, as I outlined above, everything is too rushed. It felt very much reminiscent of watching Kill la Kill, but without any of the depth of Kill la Kill – such as it was.Speaking of Kill la Kill, there’s some fanservice in this show, but it’s nothing to write home about, so if you’ve seen clips of some bubblegum-chewing wrestler chick going around, and you’re thinking that if you watch the show, you’ll get to see more of her, don’t get too excited. I will leave it up to you to decide whether you’re disappointed or relieved by this.So, yes, as long as you don’t expect a new favorite to center your entire fandom impulse around, and are instead satisfiable by a transient action experience with really cool animation, then I wholeheartedly recommend you watch The God of High School.P.S.: The most hilarious tidbit about GOH is the fact that it also has its own overpowered old dude, much like Whitebeard, Yamamoto Genryuusai, and the 3rd Hokage, but the reason this overpowered old dude is famous is hysterical. He is known as such a legend because of how heroically he held the line on his own against northern aggression. He fought and defeated the invaders’ most elite troops by himself. That all sounds cool and dandy until you realize that these “northern invaders” are actually North Korea. Canonically considering North Korea to be this fearsome and ominous threat is laughable to me, and the notion of your most famous war hero’s greatest achievement being that he defeated Rocketboy’s “elite” soldiers is sending my sides into orbit. It just goes to show that local cultural context matters. I almost expect Rocketboy himself to appear in a later chapter as some kind of unstoppable god of war. let’s be honest. You’re not watching this to get an accurate representation of real-life school-level martial arts tournaments. The rule of cool is absolutely working overtime here, what with one of the rules being that participants are allowed to use any weapons they want, except firearms. Yes, you will have people with swords and metal bats fighting people who are unarmed. No, it doesn’t make any sense, nor should you expect it to.Doubtless, however, there’s more than mere martial arts involved. Early on, I found myself wondering if what I’m seeing is just over-the-top visual metaphor – such as in Kuroko no Basket - or genuinely supernatural – such as in Galactik Football. Don’t repeat my mistake. Waste no amount of time with such pointless musings. They’re literally superpowered. Yes, all that supernatural-looking shit is honest-to-God supernatural. So, if you’ve come here expecting an anime about martial arts à la Hajime no Ippo, then you can turn around and leave right now. This is zoomer Dragon Ball Z.It should also come as no surprise that there is a darker, more nefarious purpose behind the God of High School tournament. I won’t spoil it, but it’s about as absurd and contrived as you think it is. What can I say? It’s just another high school battle show. Of course the premise is imbecilic. It’s par for the course.In consonance with MAPPA’s style, GOH is bright, colorful, youthful, hip, and really aggressively animated. While there is no question that the colorful and fluid aesthetic of the show is to be greatly credited for its popularity, the reason I call the animation aggressive rather than a more unambiguously positive adjective, such as amazing, is because in contrast to Ufotable, who endeavor to make every frame of animation as polished as humanly possible, MAPPA seems to favor just having explosive movement at all times on screen. That’s not to say that it isn’t impressive animation, because it is, but it has to be said that the structural integrity of the objects and characters on screen sometimes gets distorted in off-putting ways that just break immersion. I’m not talking Naruto vs. Pain levels of overexaggerated fluidity, but certainly more Looney Tunes than I would have personally liked.Far and away the aspects of the show’s aesthetic I disliked the most are the way ears were drawn and the way noses were colored. All of the characters’ ears are drawn to look very big and ostentatious. They all evoked the image of Dumbo for me, and not in a fun way. Particularly the top of the ear lobes is invariably drawn to hook down in a bizarre way. I can’t even describe it properly. Just look at a couple of scenes of characters talking and you’ll understand exactly what I mean. You won’t be able to unsee it. As for the noses, they’re always highlighted with a bright pink color, much redder than the rest of the skin. It makes it look like all characters constantly have a cold. Simply put, it just looks silly. In contrast to the ear thing, this is not unheard of in anime. It’s actually fairly commonly used in shoujo shows. I remember there being quite a bit of that in Clannad, but seeing it in an action show laden with blood and violence was… strange. Made it difficult to take some villains seriously when they look like Rudolph. I hoped it would either go away or grow on me in time. It did neither. It bothered me the whole time through.Additionally, a secondary consequence of overanimating every single moment, even the most mundane ones, is that when the studio finds themselves faced with a legitimately high-stakes scene where things are expected to kick into high gear, they have little room for upward moment, because in a sense, high gear is the standard. Hyouka is a prime example of precisely this kind of problem. As such, they have to resort to lateral movements into various dramatic arthouse animation styles, which, to be sure, can be used to great effect in the absolute climax of ultimate battles – the final fistfight between Simon and the Anti-Spiral from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann comes to mind – but there is a reason that sort of thing works in that context. The arthouse animation in and of itself is not what makes the scene exciting. Arthouse styles can, in fact, be pretty hit or miss. The first phase, so to speak, of the Ekko vs. Jinx fight from Arcane is a great illustration of that very fact. The LSD color trip made me tune out after 5 seconds flat. Standard, proper action animation is, at face value, vastly more impactful and exhilarating to watch. Why, then, would you ever resort to non-conventional animation for select action scenes? Because in very select few cases, you will want to make a point that goes beyond just the bare-bones content of the action. Naturally, any good fight will have an emotional narrative running simultaneously with the physical action narrative, but in those moments, you want to intentionally divert the audience’s focus to the emotional dimension instead. It’s a sleight of hand that can be used to great effect when employed sparingly.In GOH, however, you have an overdramatic scene like that as early as episode 5. It’s not an irredeemable scene, and the fight is still plenty exciting, but personally, it took me out of it and prejudiced my investment. It felt too early and too cheap. It felt unearned. We don’t even know these characters well enough to be invested on that level after having spent so little time with them. It felt not like an organic development of the story, but rather the studio seeing similar scenes in other media and simply wanting a scene like that in their own show just for the sake of it.While we’re on the subject of rushing unearned events, the escalation in this show is just ridiculous. In the span of the meager 13 episodes GOH boasts, you will go from standard fistfights in the first episode, to literal gods in the last episode doing battle so intensely that it affects the weather and various natural phenomena around the world – much like Saitama’s final punch against Boros. In contrast to much of the commentariat, I’ve long been a proponent of the idea that no amount of escalation is too much escalation, but I do believe there is such a thing as too much escalation in too short an amount of time. Point and case, every time a new fighter, a new villain, or a new power-up gets introduced in GOH, though the show makes a big spectacle of it in the moment, said element immediately gets powercrept and buried in irrelevance within the next 5 minutes to make room for the shiny new thing. What was that Syndrome line again? “When everyone’s super, no one will be.” The excitement one feels at the spectacle presented is significantly nerfed by the knowledge that whatever one is currently witnessing will become trivial and useless 60 seconds later. And since the show has so little time in general, not only does it not have time to let its power-ups breathe properly, but it also does not have time to properly develop its antagonists. One of the coolest power-up scenes in the entire show takes place in the context of a fight with a literal Whomegalul antagonist. The reason Goku going SSJ for the first time felt as epic as it did was not just because the spiky blonde hair looked cool, but also because of the villain he was up against. Frieza was well established as an insurmountable threat. Imagine how underwhelming it would have felt is he had gone SSJ for the first time in his fight against, say, Android 19, you know, the irrelevant fat fuck android from the beginning of the Cell saga. Don’t remember him? Yeah, exactly, that’s my point.Still, the rate of escalation aside, I don’t actually have a problem with the amount of escalation in and of itself. My theory is that any amount of escalation is fine. You want to go from basic bitch fistfights to universal space battles? Fine, go for it, but when you reach the absolute ceiling of cosmic power levels, that’s when your story needs to end. TTGL is incontrovertible proof that this theory works. The problem I am about to outline did not dawn on me until about episode 8, when it became obvious to me that the show would not have time to deal with all of the big dick villains it had set up. As it turns out, these 13 episodes are not an exhaustive adaptation of the GOH story. This is only season 1. As such, sequels are to be expected. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because the sequel has apparently been confirmed. As long as we actually get a continuation, I don’t mind the fact that a single season doesn’t cover the breath of the story. I’m fine with waiting for sequels. That’s not the problem. The problem is that we’ve already reached the level of (literally) godlike cataclysmic world-ending power levels. Where are we supposed to go from here? I’m not suggesting that I know for a fact there is no place to go. Maybe season 2 will prove me wrong. I am, nonetheless, definitely suggesting that it’s unlikely that there is a place to go. Further escalation will be a difficult sell and the probability that it will fall flat is overwhelming, much like all of the escalation in DBZ after Final Form Frieza, all of the escalation in Bleach after Second Resurrection Ulquiorra, or all of the escalation in Yuu Yuu Hakusho after 100% Toguro.The nature of how the superpowers fit into the larger world actually brings forth some interesting questions, as well. A supernatural show set in a medieval setting is one thing, but when you set it in a modern, contemporary setting, things inevitably become murky. Since we get to apocalyptic power levels, it begs the question of how the existence of these superpowers affects the balance of the world’s political power. It would appear that nations other than Korea have no knowledge of this Charyeok, which is what the supernatural abilities are called in GOH. Not only that, but Charyeok can and is in fact used to annihilate entire armies, cities, aircraft carriers, and islands. As such, does that technically make South Korea the world’s greatest martial power? If so, that’s hilarious.As far as the characters are concerned, there’s not much depth to be found, but they’re fun. Jin Mo-Ri is our protagonist. He has all of the fun-loving and happy-go-lucky personality of Naruto, without all of the complexity of Naruto. You might not think Naruto is a particularly complex character, and you would be right, which kind of says all there needs to be said about how one-dimensional Mo-Ri is. To be sure, the author attempts to give him depth by ham-fisting some manner of tragic backstory in there, but it was so telegraphed that as soon as there was any kind of flashback scene, I instantly tuned out. His design is also almost identical to that of Tai from Digimon. I am hard-pressed to believe this to be a simple coincidence. At the very least, in contrast to Naruto, Mo-Ri is crazy strong, so he can fight his own battles and all, but his obvious skill contrasts very starkly with his lackadaisical temperament. It’s a tough pill to swallow.Yu Mi-Ra is the main heroine of the series. She is the 25th master of something called the Moon Light Sword Style. Much like Kuina from One Piece, a good deal of her character arc has to deal with the challenges of inheriting a martial art and a dojo as a woman. Your mileage with that will vary, but personally, what I found really unattractive about her was the design. Giant frog eyes, round featureless glasses, basic school uniform, short bordeaux hair that stands up to the sides? Eh, I’m not about it. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, just look up a picture of her. Put plainly, I didn’t enjoy looking at her. Her design is fine for a side-character, but not the main heroine. For what it’s worth, it would appear that her design changes significantly in later chapters of the story, so I will hold off judgement on that, but insofar as the bit of the story actually adapted by the anime, nah, she’s just unappealing.The simultaneously least interesting, but also most likable main character is GOH’s deuteragonist, Han Dae-Wi. He looks like a normal dude in black pants, white shirt, and short messy black hair. His shtick is karate. There’s really not much more to be said about him. He has his own vague backstory, but literally who cares. He’s cool. We like him.All in all, I know I’ve spent most of this essay shitting on the show, but don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to leave you with the impression that GOH is a bad anime. It’s good! It’s certainly a high effort production. In the words of one MAL reviewer, “go into your kitchen, put on some dubstep, and start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and imagine the most generic fighting anime possible. Well done. You have created an experience almost as horrible as The God of High School.” While I wouldn’t go that far, it’s indisputable that it has a number of significant flaws that keep it from becoming a cultural icon, which it certainly had the ingredients to be, rather than the transient experience it actually turned out to be.One thing you can unequivocally not fault the show for is having a slow pace. You will never be bored. There’s always something happening and the story will move along at a breakneck pace. If anything, as I outlined above, everything is too rushed. It felt very much reminiscent of watching Kill la Kill, but without any of the depth of Kill la Kill – such as it was.Speaking of Kill la Kill, there’s some fanservice in this show, but it’s nothing to write home about, so if you’ve seen clips of some bubblegum-chewing wrestler chick going around, and you’re thinking that if you watch the show, you’ll get to see more of her, don’t get too excited.

Seeing such low scores for music and art (going as low as 1 and 2) makes people look simply childish in the way they approach reviewing this show.So let me give everyone that consider watching this a glimps on what to expect.I will shortly dissect each major part (art, sound, story, characters/overall pacing).Art (8.5/10):Seeing the poster for this anime made me hopeful for some flat colour type of approach with a lot...of linework giving it depth, somewhat simlar to a dorohedoro style. We don\'t get that which is fine, overall, the quality we receive is great (to be expected from MAPPA), animation for the most part looks smooth and enticing. Fight scenes as a whole usually hook you in. However the one\'s that are supposed to be more ""epic"" at least for me are the ones that seem the most bland and boring. Perhaps it\'s due to preference in seeing smooth rather realistic fights rather than ones that remind me of old shonens where ""powers"" are the main thing. Despite that, this category overall is most likely the strongest point for this anime.Sound (7.5/10):I will be brief here. I rarely notice issues with voice acting, I watched the japanese voiceover as I do with most anime (unless specifically the anime comes from korea or china and I notice it in time).  It\'s great, nothing to frown on. The music is rather catchy, nowhere near a masterpiece but it does stand out and you will notice some nicer pieces playing throughout the show. And I mean that in a good way, they add to the vibe which is exactly the kind of ""noticeable"" that you should have if you want the soundtrack to standout usually. Albeit it is not the ultimate be all, end all (I might aregue it does sound bit basic as much as music goes in general, rather soulless but it does the job well), it deserves a higher note just for not being the default shonen soundtrack.Story (4/10):Probably the weakest element of the show. The story is chaotic and rather bland, since it\'s a shonen anime I honestly don\'t care too much as long as it doesn\'t actually try to scare me off or bore me. In short. The narrative revolves around a high school tournament in which the strongest high school fighter is allowed to make any wish they want. Underlaying theme however is that the fighters were chosen since one of theme may hold a powerful artifact that the organisers need. We follow a group of high schoolers fighting through the tournament and slowly uncovering the plot behind this tourney.Rest would be spoilers however there are some issues, we never find out the exact reasons and motivations apart from some bland (for good, for bad, ""artifact stronk"") kind of excuses. I never really fully grasped the mechanics behind abilities that were shown in the show and thus it made it less entertaining to look at. In summary, story is rather boring, world depiction is barely existent.Characters and Pacing (6/10):Apart from a couple of characters, most seem to go through a sped up classic weak to strong route for this genre. They have their personalities sure, they are nothing special though and with the amount of episodes that we had it was hard to actually get attached to some or to understand their personality, motivations and so forth.Pacing was decent albeit some aspects should\'ve been drawn out bit more to add bit more detailed explanations behind some of the shows story and character aspects.One strong point is the humour, I did get a chuckle every now and then which made it a smoother watch despite overall story flaws.In summary, it\'s not a bad show, it has it\'s strong points, as long as you want to watch another shounen with a decent style and vibe, it will be enjoyable enough.
