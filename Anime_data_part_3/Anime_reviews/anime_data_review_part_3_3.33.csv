Kannagi: Moshimo Kannagi ga Attara...,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5978/Kannagi__Moshimo_Kannagi_ga_Attara,"['The ""Kannagi DVD Special"" is basically the 14th episode to the Kannagi series, despite it only being one episode in length, it still captures the charm and humor of the series.Story: 7/10Taking into account that a majority of viewers will be watching this after finishing the actual TV version, I will touch base on one thing first: ""it doesn’t pick up directly where the series left off"", at least not in the way you would think. Most fans will remember that the actual anime ended on somewhat of a cliffhanger, with a few plot points never being answered (for the sake of spoilers, I won’t...mention them). However, I will say that this particular episode pretty much goes back to its ""slice of life"" roots, you could easily place this any time after ""Nagi, Zange, Tsugumi and Jin"" all became acquaintances, and it wouldn’t make much difference at all. Now that’s not to say just because this episode doesn’t follow the last events from the series that it’s bad...because it’s not. In fact for only being around 23 minutes long, there is quite a bit going on. The episode starts out with the gang making a film of sorts (if you have ever seen ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya epsiode 0"", then this will look pretty familiar, they even have Tsugumi pay tribute to the ""Mikuru beam"".) After that the gang spends some time indoors, then take on an adventure style mission while trying to return a borrowed DVD disk. I was honestly never bored once with this episode, what with so much going on during it. Now of course not all viewers will like this fact, some might even find its constantly changing direction in storyline to be a bit inconsistent and annoying. Still, all the humor and character interactions remain staple here, my favorite scene is where Jin and the others are playing an old Nintendo Famicom system from the 80’s.Art: 8/10Not really much I can say about the art style, other than it remains exactly the same as before. Character design is pretty distinct, with colorful environments and landscapes. Even if it is pretty appealing to the eyes, it\'s not really anything technically superb either, backgrounds range from detailed, to average. But overall, it is still pretty darn good.Characters: 8/10What made me love the Kannagi series in the first place, was with it’s cast of characters. I wouldn’t go as far to say that they were very deep, but they interacted with each other quite well, and were funny to watch. All of them keep their distinct personalities, from Daitetsu’s quiet demeanor, to Zange’s flirty ways. They mange to keep their persona’s down to earth, yet never feel like a cliche’. And speaking of characters, yes there is some ""fan service"" in this, which is all done in the usually Kannagi manner, but of course never over the top. Some may even find it a bit tame from the norm.Sound: 8/10I was really glad to see that they kept the same opening and closing scenes from the TV series, which made it feel like no time had past since we last left the gang. All the voice cast members have once again returned to fill their roles. Though I still find the background music to be pretty lackluster and boring.Overall: 8/10Well there isn’t really much more I can say regarding this. If you loved the TV series, then you will most likely love this. Some may still find it disappointing that this episode doesn’t shed any light on the events from the end of the series. Never the less I still found it to be just as good as the episodes from the actual anime, and I think many will feel the same way after viewing it. mention them).

Junk Head,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39833/Junk_Head,"['Junk Head is an extraordinary achievement of stop-motion animation. Its influences range from art cinema to B-grade horror films and post-apocalyptic video games, but there\'s nothing quite like it out there. Created almost entirely by one man, Takahide Hori, Junk Head is a journey through a nightmarish underground landscape of ruins, caverns, and decaying industrial infrastructure inhabited by grotesque sentient humanoids and even more twisted and repulsive predators who lurk in the dark.The story is fairly simple, involving the extremely perilous adventures of a future ""human"" who volunteers for a dangerous mission into the unknown, His travels deep underneath the Earth\'s surface reveal a...phantasmagoric, meticulously detailed underworld with its own social structure, belief system, and far more deadly threats than anyone could desire. Life is cheap in this underground labyrinth and the film doesn\'t shy away from the many interesting ways in which living creatures can meet their end. Adding to this sense of utter alienation from anything resembling our own reality, the characters all speak in various invented languages made of harsh, guttural sounds. You are relentlessly assaulted with the fact that this world, even though it\'s still called Earth, might as well be as alien as any planet from science fiction.Thankfully, Junk Head offers much more than a hellscape of misery and terror. Takahide Hori has a wonderfully playful sense of humor, sometimes dark, often quite silly, and frequently rather subtle. He also clearly cares about the many oddly shaped misfits who star in the film. They\'re all given personalities, motivations, and often some real dignity. They\'re just trying to do their best in an environment that\'s pretty much out to kill them at every turn. The film is never sentimental, but it invests the struggles and actions of the characters with genuine weight and significance. This movie is not just mere spectacle for its own sake.While Junk Heap is by no means the kind of film most people on this site would expect, I hope it gains a new audience of fans from the MAL community. The film is audacious in the scope of its execution and offers the kind of pleasures that popular entertainment rarely does. Hopefully Junk Heap will encourage some anime fans to delve into other forms of animation storytelling more deeply (I would especially recommend Jan Svankmajer). And if nothing else, maybe you\'ll have some intriguingly unique dreams in days to come. phantasmagoric, meticulously detailed underworld with its own social structure, belief system, and far more deadly threats than anyone could desire.

Houkago Shounen Hanako-kun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56425/Houkago_Shounen_Hanako-kun,"[""What can I say other than... it was just okay? It's fine if you've got nothing better to do and want to see a few little extra omake-like bits for the original hanako, but honestly most of the humor was lost on me. Very quick and short little bits that mainly revolve around the little mokke, sometimes a little of something else. All it really did was make me miss the first season and wish for more story again.Either way. Art is on point. Seeing the characters you miss is great. But you're not missing anything important or all that fun anyways. At least the...halloween bit made it just a little worthwhile! halloween bit made it just a little worthwhile!"", ""Hanako and everyone returned for four episodes of short stories culminating in a Halloween-themed episode and it was nice to see everyone again. Each episode had a good mix of silliness and horror. The animation was also the right mix of cute with a touch of creepy. It made me miss the main anime especially since prior knowledge of characters and world is necessarily to really enjoy these shorts.If you're looking for something that mixes drama and comedy together like in the regular storyline, you'll be disappointed. Everything's a bit lighter and sillier in this anime. If you've never watched or Read Hanako-kun before,...you'll want to start there before watching this. That said, if you like the source material and you're looking for something short and entertaining to pass some time this is an anime you might enjoy. you'll want to start there before watching this.

On the other hand, I'm confused about the timing, since nothing of Hanako came in animated form for years and now this appeared just before the release of the second season / remake (?). Although I'm not complaining about that. The adaptation of ASH is actually really well done for such a mini-series. ASH consists of funny little short stories from Toilet Bound Hanako-Kun. Each episode of the anime consists of 2 chapters and therefore 2 stories. They don't give any further in-depth impression of the world or...the characters, but are rather intended as short laughs. Some of them can even be really funny. I think every TBHK fan can look forward to more animated content. Everyone else doesn't need to watch it. the characters, but are rather intended as short laughs. Some of them can even be really funny.

It features some things found in almost no other anime. The world design in particular is very unique. The houses, props, vehicles, and general setting are very unique to this anime, and you don't see anything like that in most other anime. The closest similarities I can think of would be Outlaw Star or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. It definitely stands out in terms of prop and world design.Story wise, Iria is a unique and classic sci-fi anime. It takes place in a universe where there are many established planets that people...live on that each have their own existing culture and customs. Iria is a bounty hunter apprentice, that is searching for answers surrounding the disappearance of her elder brother and mentor. Along the way a creature that is very violent and involved in the disappearance her brother, ends up in the same place as her travels, and she must deal with it, as well as unravel the conspiracy that may be behind the creature in the first place.One of the things I really like about this story, is it tells the story of a girl who has a submissive, yet sporty personality, and is still strong enough to stand on her own. Iria is a very unique character, and a combination of girly and motherly, as well as quite sporty and capable.It's definitely a very unique anime and very enjoyable. This was one of the first anime I ever really enjoyed, and at only 6 eps long, it's definitely worth a watch! I kind of think of it like a long movie broken into 6 chapters.

It tells the story of a young bounty hunter Iria\'s hunting of Zeiram, the most dangerous life form in the galaxy.The weird opening theme, which sounds like some Sharon Apple song from ""Macross Plus"", feels out of place and put me off the anime initially. And not being the fastest anime off the block despite its short length, it took ""Iria"" a couple of episodes to catch my interest, but to its credit it gains more and more momentum as it goes on.The action, though slightly sluggish at...times, is overall solid enough to provide a good foundation for the enjoyment of ""Iria: Zeiram the Animation"", with the appropriately climatic climax being especially good. It\'s backed up by a pretty good story (albeit one that doesn\'t explain everything) and some really likeable characters. The roles of the mischievous kids are played out perfectly, as is that rogue Fujikuro, providing comedy entertainment that often had me grinning widely. The animation may not look that great by today\'s standards, but there are some fantastic character designs. The heroine Iria herself has quite a unique look, while Zeiram reminds me of Yoshimitsu from the Tekken video games.On the downside, I think the anime suffers from small inconsistencies in its characterisation and plot. To name a couple of examples, part of the personality of Iria is hard to pin down since she seem to be inconsistently portrayed from one episode to the next, and I could have sworn the Zeiram\'s weak point that is revealed towards the end had already been peppered with bullets with little or not no effect in an earlier episode.Even though this OVA does look and sound a bit old, it\'s still succeeds in providing an entertaining 3 hours.

Iria: Zeiram the Animation is a 6 episode mini-series that actually be likened to a 3-hour action flick. Iria shines becuase of the world and chracters that are created. The characters themselves are well-done are show a good amount of depth and personality for a mini-series. Escpecially the titular character, Iria. Iria is a tough-as-nails bounty hunter who is just starting out, but her character is still that of a young woman. Strong but feminine. Iria is a great role-model for young women, and a...good example of a strong woman. The character designs for this show are excellent. Done by the famous Masakazu Katsura (Video Girl Ai), each character is detailed and has a unique look. The visuals of the world itself are equally as amazing. The world has an oriental look but mixed with futuristic technology. The designs for the weapons are inventive too. Some of the weapons these bounty hunters use make me want to be one! I'd reccommend Iria for the visuals alone. But the story itself is worth a watch. A classic tale of revenge and justice. The English dubbing is really good for this one, and the DVD quality gets my thumbs up as well. Rent disc 3 if you want cast interviews and some insight into this world. I reccommend checking Iria out. It's a cut above most of the garbage anime that's flooding the US nowadays. good example of a strong woman. The character designs for this show are excellent.

However, I'm inflating my review after looking at some of the other reviews. Mainly because there is an unfortunate portion of modern anime viewers that see old school animation, and that's all she wrote folks, that's all it takes to make it average... Except Iria Zeiram is a badass anime, with beautiful hand crafted art, and a strong female lead that isn't drenched with fan service, characters like this are why I fell in love with anime...all those years ago.Anywho, I'll (try to) keep the rest of my review fairly short. The art for me is the standout, along with some really refreshing character design/writing. The art is classic late 80s to 90s hand drawn goodness, if you're in a nostalgic scifi mood look no further, especially if you've seen the usual recommendations. Character design is awesome, modern anime is a little uh, sexist? I hesitate to use the word, but really it's refreshing to see an anime without fan service, while still being mature make no mistake. Weird how you can make a strong sexy female character without their boobs flopping about, go figure.Having listed the strengths, the weaknesses are undoubtedly the story and sound. Story is really nothing to salivate over. Depending on your exposure level to anime/manga/books/cinema, then a fair rating would fall somewhere between an 8 to 6. If you're experienced, it's a 6, otherwise it could range up to an 8 if you aren't familiar (bored) with common anime tropes. Sound is to me the weakest part, it's by no means bad but there's nary a banger to me found here IMO, but lovers of 80s sound design might really dig this.Overall this one really took me by surprise, the MAL reviews made me hesitate. Reviews be damned though, this is a keeper anime, and when you've been around the anime block as long as me that's rare. Granted some of this might have to do with my disillusionment for modern anime, it's getting old seeing awesome stories/characters ruined by horndogs beating the fan service cash cow like there's no tomorrow. all those years ago.Anywho, I'll (try to) keep the rest of my review fairly short.

If you've been following my reviews for a while you may recall Ashi as the ones behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Superman Legend. The OVA is actually set up as a prequel to a live action film from '91 called Zeiram. To be completely honest, I haven't seen the film in question and I'm not going to know how well it follows it. Basically, I'll be judging the OVA entirely as its own thing, is what I'm saying.Story:We open with our heroine using her Shine Aqua Illusion to bring...in a baddie. Or she just beats him up. Unfortunately for her, a different bounty hunter shows up to steal the bounty away. We cut to later where she's conversing with her older brother about the situation while he prepares to go on his own mission with his friend, Bob. Events unfold, she follows and they end up on a space station looking to rescue the crew and recover the cargo. They find no cargo and a whole lot of bodies. When they do locate some survivors, they indicate that the cargo itself may be to blame. Iria and her brother quickly have their first encounter with the monstrous Zeiram.The biggest narrative issue is that the OVA doesn't explain some things very well. Most notably, there's an episode that ends with Iria on the run from the authorities for reasons and the very next episode opens with her back in good standing. I don't know how it happened but I'm just going to assume her shrine priestess girlfriend pulled some strings. Another issue is just that things are pretty predictable and it makes things less interesting. Not uninteresting, mind. The Ova is still kind of interesting.On the positive side, I do like the way the OVA manages to bring Zeiram and Iria's confrontation into play in a variety of situations. The climactic confrontation works well. And the story telling is pretty good, as a whole.Characters:Iria is a pretty compelling character. Her dynamics with other characters also work well. Particularly with Gren and Bob. That being said, most of the characters aren't particularly interesting aside from their dynamics with Iria. It's kind of like Spice and Wolf where the main female lead just carries the cast because everyone else is dull. There are two child characters who are kind of obnoxious little sods. Zeiram is also very much one of those not remotely complex and menacing because of supernatural abilities villains.Art:By today's standards, the art and animation are a bit dated. That being said, it holds up pretty well. The action sequences are strong. The character designs are nice. The sci-fi trappings look good. About the worst I can say for the art is a nitpick, the hair bead things don't look like they should stay in place. They don't look so much braided into the hair as they do haphazardly attached to it.Sound:Most of the performances in this are competent. Not good, but decent enough. The exception is Hisakawa Aya (also the voice of Mizuno Ami). She's really good in this. Yoshikawa Yoichiro did a good job with the music composition.Ho-yay:There really isn't any.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Iria: Zeiram the animation is a decent little OVA. Not good, but okay. If you're a big fan of adventurous sci-fi, it'll probably keep your attention. You may even like it more than I did. For myself, however, the rating is going to stand at a 6/10.

They don't look so much braided into the hair as they do haphazardly attached to it.Sound:Most of the performances in this are competent. Not good, but decent enough. The exception is Hisakawa Aya (also the voice of Mizuno Ami). She's really good in this. Yoshikawa Yoichiro did a good job with the music composition.Ho-yay:There really isn't any.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Iria: Zeiram the animation is a decent little OVA. Not good, but okay. If you're a big fan of adventurous sci-fi, it'll probably keep your attention. You may even like it more than I did. For myself, however, the rating is going to stand at a 6/10. Next week's review is Mob Psycho 100."", ""This has to be one of my fav to this day. ITs got a great story line about a young female bounter hunter trying to make it in a man's world and follow in her brothers footsteps til the unthinkable happens and she's all alone. Now she has to Zeiram the alien who she thinks killed her brother. "", ""Certainly interesting, and didn't even go too far wrong, but still kind of missed the mark.Now, I did enjoy Iria: Zeiram. I wasn't uninvested, and I haven't forgotten the events so far. In fact, if anything is to be taken from this review; be it that it's no doubt worth a try. But that said, it didn't quite click with me.Being seriously strong with characters and their world, and with a pretty decent standard of narrative, Iria: Zeiram, while not exceptional, stands as a fair show. If given another chance to go around, it could easily exceed itself.----The story is admittedly simple, not boasting any...revolutionary concepts, but is easily followed and flows without issue. Being half-cour length works pretty well, as it keeps each episode unique and doesn't spawn any unnecessary characters. All I can really point to as a plot issue is suddenly abandoning a line of inquiry the eponymous Iria is taking halfway throigh the show, with the information gotten in the previous episide being seemingly forgotten.The characters are excellent, as is the way they are handled. Everyone gets a sizeable lump of screentime, and their starkly different personalities clash really well. The group that accompanies Iria in the second half has particularly good chemistry with each other, being perhaps the biggest strength of the OVAs. Zeiram himself isn't really a character, being an illegible monster. I can't complain too much being as this is wholly intentional, but there are more interesting villain paradigms.----Iria: Zeiram has at-par animation, nothing stands out in either direction. The artstyle is quite nice, it gets every character looking good. But music, though, is rather poor. While the ED gets no complaints from me, the OP is surprisingly just awful. The song is grating to hear and feels like the singer hadn't seen the lyrics before the night. Try as I might to bear it, it ended up amongst the few I just had to skip past.Now, where these OVAs really shine is with aesthetics. The vehicles, technology, clothing and architecture is all extremely unique, featuring antiquated and modern elements in equal parts. While this style isn't my cup of tea personally, I do appreciate the creativity behind it and I would by no means be opposed to seeing more of the world. As for character design, I really like Iria's, with everyone else also being pretty solid until Zeiram. His design sort of falls apart at his head and face, which doesn't really sit right. A few small tweaks could easily make it much more appealing and menacing, but again, this is probably just personal taste.----Iria: Zeiram, then, stumbles in that while most elements are good, they don't mesh quite as well as would be needed. As for improvements, I'd change the OP first and foremost, and add scene or two in the centre to handwave the forgotten plot point I mentioned.All in all, much of what I disliked can be chalked down to personal dissatisfaction for one reason or another, so I wouldn't want to complain too much. It's a curious little set of OVAs that didn't do much spectacular, but also never collapsed in on itself. revolutionary concepts, but is easily followed and flows without issue.

An action story about a rookie bounty hunter named Iria, comes into a battle conflict against an unstoppable killing lifeform called a Zeiram.With a plot straight to the point, live and get rid of the Zeiram, this anime knows what it is. Spanning as a 6 episode OVA series, each episode is different, yet a continuation on each other. Time continues between each episode until Iria must have another life and death battle between her and the Zeiram.Even though the anime...is on the short side, luckily, all the characters involved are fairly interesting and the viewer slowly sees Iria become more mature with each episode. There is plenty of action ranging from the transportation machines to the numerous gadgets used to fight. Needless to say, the action is the strong point, and while not being smooth all of the time, the fighting sequences and explosions are done well enough.However, the anime does have its flaws. The ending, for example, is pretty controversial, and why some weapons work in places while others do not are just a couple to pay attention to. Although, if given more time (episodes), maybe things could have been explained better. Instead most is left up to the viewer’s imagination.As Iria Zeiram the Animation could come off as a bit old and average, the action is worth the ride. Iria is lovable and so is the supporting cast around her. is on the short side, luckily, all the characters involved are fairly interesting and the viewer slowly sees Iria become more mature with each episode.

I give it a 9 and would have given it a 10 if it werent for the bad english dub over. ', ""English:Review: Iria: Zeiram The AnimationI already knew about the existence of the Iría eggs, as well as that the Iría eggs act as prequels for 2 live action movies that had been released before (more specifically in the years 1991-1992 the films and the eggs in 94) .Despite that detail, I will only focus on talking...about the eggs of Iría and leaving my opinion on the matter about the work in question.Well, something that I must highlight about the work is its technical apparatus, both the animation, direction, setting and music in general is exceptional, this whole section is fantastic.The music is catchy, pleasant and beautiful to listen to, it makes the viewer feel involved in the work and want to continue seeing more of it. Each piece of music that is available is quite suitable in specific moments, it has music for action, as well as relaxing and ambient music for moments of calm / serenity, as well as melancholic music for when you want to evoke the feeling of tragedy or lost, as well as many others that are quite good.The animation and direction are not far behind either, the animation is budget-friendly, so you will not see quality downturns for any moment and the action or chase scenes are quite polished and worked.Likewise, the designs of the characters are quite distinctive and recognizable, since each character has its own characteristic style that makes it different from other characters (Of the main ones obviously), although it is not revolutionary or unique, but even so this section fulfills its function quite well.The other section that I would like to emphasize would be in the story, because the story is quite basic, since it is about a novice bounty hunter, called Iría who is after a strange creature that asks a high reward for her, called Zeiram, which is wanted by the number of people that this creature has killed and one of those people was Glenn (Iría's older brother).Who sacrificed herself to save her sister's life, helping her escape, causing Iría to make the decision to hunt down and defeat the Zeiram on her own, although the latter could not face the Zeiram, but is still willing to defeat him, even if you have to lose your life in the process.As I said before, this is an adventure story with sci-fi elements so you will see civilization and high-tech weapons, something that the work does well is to show you how imaginative and creative it is with the construction of its world, especially with its weapons and advanced technology that is presented and how the work manages to provide exposure on the use of said weapons, which is achieved thanks to the actions and situations that the work puts our protagonist and how she takes advantage of these in the circumstances, providing the information that the viewer needs to know, how the operation, use, times when it is useful, etc.It should also be clarified that the work also has a government system, which gives it quite a lot of credibility with our world, as well as preventive measures in case of a threat, in addition to having scientists and other entities to make it even more plausible for the viewer.Well, already talked about the technical and the history, you will think that the characters section is as good as the 2 sections above, right? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the work wastes several characters in your work, although not all of them, I will talk about them in a more concrete way.Iria the protagonist can become quite interesting as a character, she begins as a rookie bounty hunter, to gain more experience thanks to her confrontations with the Zeiram and other hunters, likewise her attitude undergoes a significant change as well, since it goes from being of a girl who is only insecure about her ability and only having sex with her brother Glenn. To later be more confident in her skills as a bounty hunter and in improving her relationships with the other characters in the works (mainly with Kei and Bob). Also obtaining her license as an official hunter thanks to her training with her brother, in addition to having a team willing to help her in combat and I proved more confidence / security, in addition to the love / affection that her brother gave her and wish her the best (And for those characteristics it is my favorite waffle: -u).Another would be Kei, who begins as an orphan who only went after he would go to steal equipment and food to survive, but that caused him to get into dangerous situations and be a hindrance to Iría on several occasions. But little by little he manages to progress and in a surprising way he manages to establish a brotherhood relationship with Iría, helping her and supporting each other, in addition to forming a great duo together (In addition to another surprise that Kei kept almost at the end: v) without doubt the best of any work in general.While for the rest of the characters they do not shine so bright, the rest are only plot devices to trigger future events that the work needs to develop.Glenn (Iría's older brother) is one of the cases of characters that I just mentioned, such as the fact that he is quite forgettable if it weren't for Iría keeps emphasizing how much he misses him and because of the guilt she feels for his lost.Bob is another character who falls into the same problem, which only served as support for Iría and his brother at the beginning of the work to disappear at the beginning, and then return to the middle of the work, but now on a computer without explaining what happened to his body, with the only justification that his body is badly damaged, but that he was still off-screen and omitting what happened to his body after transplanting his mind to the computer.Although it is not such a serious damage, since at least it manages to be of help to Iría, giving him advice as a bounty hunter with some experience and giving him some advice that would help him.But out of desire it does not fulfill another function, in addition to being a role that any other character can do without problems, in addition to the decision that they get rid of their body to transfer their mind to a computer was quite taken out of the hair. And that such action deprives him of showing human characteristics and can show human characteristics, which is a shame.Fujikoro is another who also falls into this syndrome of other wasted characters, since it only limits itself to making life more complicated for Iría and putting her in more dangerous situations and what little she contributes to the plot, as in the development of his character.Komimasa suffers from the same problem as Glenn, that you will only remember him as Kei's friend and his sacrifice to save Iría and Kei, apart from being a friend of Kei and being an orphan and that, like the latter, his death only serves to trigger future actions of the characters of Iría and Kei and that the plot progresses.Doctor Touka would be the worst case of a wasted character, his role in the play was to investigate the Zeiram, because they do not contribute anything, also being ignored throughout the work after its presentation, although it could contribute a lot to the plot, such as knowing where the Zeiram comes from, improving the military combat equipment, Improving the security system of the planet and the cities, etc.Government committees are also another basket case, as they ignore the ideas / suggestions of Dr. Touka and send troops to the idiot to die in battle in vain.Also another weak point of the work is the slow rhythm, which does not suit this series of eggs, this slow rhythm does not allow the work to develop its plot naturally and without problems.Causing that they do not have a more active role in the play and have their time to shine on the screen. But instead all of them were either forgotten or did not have a satisfactory conclusion as characters (with the exception of Iría and Kei), as well as several things that were not clear in the work, such as the origin of the Zeiram that is never explained to us from where it comes from and why they are powerful in the first place, to mention examples.This could have been resolved if it had been a television series, at least that way the reason for the slow pace would be justifiable, but that is already a hypothetical case, which does not go for this review and I think my points were already clear with this work .In short, we can conclude that the work is a sci-fi with interesting elements, an excellent soundtrack, an amazing technical section, in addition to a solid development and conclusion for the 2 main ones, but it also carries the problem of wasting with characters with potential, a slow pace, wasted elements, unnecessarily lengthened conflicts and a lot more kind of problems that I have just mentioned, but still it is a work that I recommend seeing either for anyone interested in seeing it, as well as sci-fi lovers in general To finish, I just hope that your Live Action movies do not have the problems I have just mentioned or that at least they do not have it to a great extent, but that only time will tell.6/10.Espanish:Reseña: Iria: Zeiram The AnimationYa conocía de la existencia de las ovas de Iría, así como también que las ovas de Iría actúan como precuelas para 2 pelis live action que se habian estrenado antes (más concretamente en los años 1991-1992 las películas y las ovas en el 94).Pese a ese detalle solo me centrare en hablar de las ovas de Iría y dejar plasmando mi opinión al respecto sobre la obra en cuestión.Pues algo que debo de resaltar de la obra es su aparto técnico, tanto la animación, dirección, setting y música en general es excepcional, todo este apartado es fantástico.La música es pe gajosa, agradable y hermosa de escuchar, hace que el espectador se sienta envuelto en la obra y quiera seguir viendo más de ella. Cada pieza musical con la que dispone es bastante adecuada en momentos puntuales, cuenta con música para la acción, así como música relajante y ambiental para los momentos de calma/serenidad, así como también de música melancólica para cuando quiere evocar el sentimiento de tragedia o perdida, así como muchos otros que son bastante buenos.La animación y dirección tampoco se quedan atrás, la animación es de presupuesto de ovas, por lo que no veras por ningún momento bajones de calidad y las escenas de acción o persecución están bastante pulidas y trabajadas.Así mismo los diseños de los personajes son bastantes distintivos y reconocibles, ya que cada personaje tiene su propio estilo característico que lo hace diferenciarse de otros personajes (De los principales obviamente), pese a que no es nada revolucionario o único, pero aun así este apartado cumple bastante bien su función.El otro apartado que me gustaría recalcar seria en la historia, pues la historia en bastante básica, ya que trata de una caza recompensa novata, llamada Iría que esta tras una extraña criatura que piden una alta recompensa por ella, llamada Zeiram, el cual es buscada por la cantidad de personas que esta criatura a asesinada y una de esas personas fue Glenn (el hermano mayor de Iría).El cual se sacrificó para salvar la vida su hermana, ayudándola a escapar, provocando que Iría tome la decisión de cazar y derrotar al Zeiram ella sola, pese a que este ultima no pudo hacerle frente al Zeiram, pero aún está dispuesta a derrotarlo, incluso si tiene que perder la vida en el proceso.Como dije anteriormente, esta es una historia de aventura con elementos sci-fi por lo que veras civilización y armamentos de alta tecnología, algo que hace bien la obra es en mostrarte lo imaginativo y creativo que es con la construcción de su mundo, especialmente con su armamento y tecnología avanzada que se presenta y de cómo la obra logra brindar exposición sobre el uso de dichos armamentos, el cual es logrado gracias a las acciones y situaciones que pone la obra a nuestra protagonista y de cómo esta le saca provecho a estos en las circunstancias, brindándole la información que el espectador necesita saber, cómo el funcionamiento, uso, momentos en que es de utilidad, etc.También cabe aclarar que la obra posee además un sistema de gobierno, lo cual le da bastante verosimilitud con nuestro mundo, así como también tienen medidas preventivas en caso de una amenaza, además de contar con científicos y otros entes para hacerlo aún más plausible para el espectador.Pues ya hablado de lo técnico y la historia, pensaran que el apartado de personajes es tan bueno como los 2 apartados mencionados anteriormente, ¿verdad? Pues lamento desilusionarlos, pero la obra desaprovecha varios personajes de su obra, aunque no todos, hablare de ellos de formar más concreta.Iría la protagonista puede llegar a ser bastante interesante como personaje, empieza como una caza recompensa novatas, para adquirir más experiencia gracias a sus enfrentamientos con el Zeiram y otros cazadores, así mismo su actitud sufre un cambio significativo también, ya que pasa de ser de una chica que solo tiene inseguridad de su habilidad y solo tener relaciones con su hermano Glenn. Para más adelante ser más segura de sus habilidades como caza recompensa y en mejorar en sus relación con los otros personajes de la obras (principalmente con Kei Y Bob). Obteniendo además su licencia como cazadora oficial gracias a su entrenamiento con su hermano, además de tener un equipo dispuesto a ayudarle en combate y le probé más confianza/seguridad, además del amo/cariño que su mismo hermano le daba y desearle lo mejor a ella (Y por esas características es mi waffle preferida :-u).Otro seria Kei, el cual empieza como un huérfano que solo iba tras Iría para robarle equipo y alimento para sobrevivir, pero eso provoco que este se metiera en situaciones de peligro y ser un estorbo para Iría en varias ocasiones. Pero de a poco logra progresar y de forma sorpresiva logra entablar una relación de hermandad con Iría, ayudándola y apoyándose del uno al otro, además de forma un gran dúo juntos (Además de otra sorpresa que se guardó Kei casi al final: v) sin duda de lo mejor de toda obra en general.Mientras que por el resto de personajes no brillan tanto, el resto son solo plot device para desencadenar futuros eventos que la obra necesita para desarrollarse.Glenn (el hermano mayor de Iría) es uno de los casos de personajes que acabo de mencionar, como el hecho de que es bastante olvidable si no fuera porque Iría no deja de recalcar lo mucho que lo extraña y por la culpa que esta siente por su perdida.Bob es otro personaje que cae en el mismo problema, el cual solo sirvió de apoyo para Iría y su hermano al inicio de la obra para desaparecer en el inicio, para luego volver a la mitad de la obra, pero ahora en una computadora sin explicar que paso con su cuerpo, con la única justificación de que su cuerpo está gravemente dañado, pero que aun así fue fuera de pantalla y de omitir lo que paso con su cuerpo después del trasplantar su mente a la computadora.Aunque no es un daño tan grave, ya que al menos logra ser de ayuda para Iría, dándole consejos como caza recompensas con algo de experiencia y dándole alguno que otro consejo que le serviría de ayuda.Pero fuera deseo no cumple otra función, además de ser un rol que cualquier otro personaje puede hacer sin problemas, además de la decisión de que se deshicieran de su cuerpo para pasar su mente a una computadora fue bastante sacada de los pelos. Y que dicha acción hace que le privan de mostrar características humanas y pueda mostrar rasgos humanos, lo cual es una pena.Fujikoro es otro que también cae en ese mis síndrome de otros personajes desaprovechado, ya que solo se limita a hacerle la vida más complicada a Iría y de meterla en más situaciones de peligros y de lo poco que contribuye en la trama, como en el desarrollo de su personaje.Komimasa sufre el mismo problema que Glenn, que solo lo recordaras como el amigo de Kei y de su sacrificó para salvar a Iría y Kei, fuera de ser amigo de Kei y ser huérfano y que igual a este último su muerte sirve solo para desencadenar futuras acciones de los personajes de Iría y Kei y que la trama progrese.El Doctor Touka sería el peor caso de personaje desperdiciado, su función en la obra era investigar sobre el Zeiram, porque no contribuyen en nada, además ser ignorado en toda la obra después de su presentación, pese a que podría contribuir mucho a la trama, como saber de dónde proveniente el Zeiram, mejorar el equipo de combate militar, Mejorar el sistema de seguridad del planeta y de las ciudades, etc.Comité del gobierno también son otro caso perdido, ya que ignoran las ideas/sugerencias del doctor Touka y de mandar tropas a lo imbécil para morir en batalla en vano.También otro punto débil de la obra es el ritmo lento, el cual no le sienta bien a esta serie de ovas, este ritmo lento no le permite a la obra poder desarrollar su trama de forma natural y sin problemas.Provocando que no tengan un rol más activo en la obra y tengan su tiempo para brillar en pantalla. Pero en su lugar todos o fueron olvidados o no tuvieran una conclusión satisfactorias como personajes (con excepción de Iría y Kei), así como también varias cosas que no quedaron claras en la obra, como el origen del Zeiram que jamás se nos explica de donde viene y del porque están poderoso en primer lugar, por mencionar ejemplos.Esto se pudo haber resuelto si hubiera sido una serie de televisión, al menos así sería justificable el porqué del ritmo lento, pero eso ya es un caso hipotético, cosa que no va para esta reseña y creo que ya mis puntos quedaron claros con esta obra.En fin, podemos concluir que la obra es un sci-fi con elementos interesantes, una excelente banda sonora, apartado técnico alucinante, además de un sólido desarrollo y conclusión para los 2 principales, pero también acarrea el problema de desaprovechar personajes con potencial, un ritmo lento, elementos desaprovechados, conflictos alargados innecesariamente y montón más de problemas que ya acabo de mencionar, pero aun así es una obra que recomiendo ver ya sea para todo aquel interesado en verla, así como los amantes del género sci-fi en general , ya para terminar solo espero que sus pelis Live Action no posean los problemas que acabo de mencionar o que al menos no lo posean en gran medida, pero eso solo el tiempo lo dirá.6/10. about the eggs of Iría and leaving my opinion on the matter about the work in question.Well, something that I must highlight about the work is its technical apparatus, both the animation, direction, setting and music in general is exceptional, this whole section is fantastic.The music is catchy, pleasant and beautiful to listen to, it makes the viewer feel involved in the work and want to continue seeing more of it.

Cada pieza musical con la que dispone es bastante adecuada en momentos puntuales, cuenta con música para la acción, así como música relajante y ambiental para los momentos de calma/serenidad, así como también de música melancólica para cuando quiere evocar el sentimiento de tragedia o perdida, así como muchos otros que son bastante buenos.La animación y dirección tampoco se quedan atrás, la animación es de presupuesto de ovas, por lo que no veras por ningún momento bajones de calidad y las escenas de acción o persecución están bastante pulidas y trabajadas.Así mismo los diseños de los personajes son bastantes distintivos y reconocibles, ya que cada personaje tiene su propio estilo característico que lo hace diferenciarse de otros personajes (De los principales obviamente), pese a que no es nada revolucionario o único, pero aun así este apartado cumple bastante bien su función.El otro apartado que me gustaría recalcar seria en la historia, pues la historia en bastante básica, ya que trata de una caza recompensa novata, llamada Iría que esta tras una extraña criatura que piden una alta recompensa por ella, llamada Zeiram, el cual es buscada por la cantidad de personas que esta criatura a asesinada y una de esas personas fue Glenn (el hermano mayor de Iría).El cual se sacrificó para salvar la vida su hermana, ayudándola a escapar, provocando que Iría tome la decisión de cazar y derrotar al Zeiram ella sola, pese a que este ultima no pudo hacerle frente al Zeiram, pero aún está dispuesta a derrotarlo, incluso si tiene que perder la vida en el proceso.Como dije anteriormente, esta es una historia de aventura con elementos sci-fi por lo que veras civilización y armamentos de alta tecnología, algo que hace bien la obra es en mostrarte lo imaginativo y creativo que es con la construcción de su mundo, especialmente con su armamento y tecnología avanzada que se presenta y de cómo la obra logra brindar exposición sobre el uso de dichos armamentos, el cual es logrado gracias a las acciones y situaciones que pone la obra a nuestra protagonista y de cómo esta le saca provecho a estos en las circunstancias, brindándole la información que el espectador necesita saber, cómo el funcionamiento, uso, momentos en que es de utilidad, etc.También cabe aclarar que la obra posee además un sistema de gobierno, lo cual le da bastante verosimilitud con nuestro mundo, así como también tienen medidas preventivas en caso de una amenaza, además de contar con científicos y otros entes para hacerlo aún más plausible para el espectador.Pues ya hablado de lo técnico y la historia, pensaran que el apartado de personajes es tan bueno como los 2 apartados mencionados anteriormente, ¿verdad? Pues lamento desilusionarlos, pero la obra desaprovecha varios personajes de su obra, aunque no todos, hablare de ellos de formar más concreta.Iría la protagonista puede llegar a ser bastante interesante como personaje, empieza como una caza recompensa novatas, para adquirir más experiencia gracias a sus enfrentamientos con el Zeiram y otros cazadores, así mismo su actitud sufre un cambio significativo también, ya que pasa de ser de una chica que solo tiene inseguridad de su habilidad y solo tener relaciones con su hermano Glenn. Para más adelante ser más segura de sus habilidades como caza recompensa y en mejorar en sus relación con los otros personajes de la obras (principalmente con Kei Y Bob). Obteniendo además su licencia como cazadora oficial gracias a su entrenamiento con su hermano, además de tener un equipo dispuesto a ayudarle en combate y le probé más confianza/seguridad, además del amo/cariño que su mismo hermano le daba y desearle lo mejor a ella (Y por esas características es mi waffle preferida :-u).Otro seria Kei, el cual empieza como un huérfano que solo iba tras Iría para robarle equipo y alimento para sobrevivir, pero eso provoco que este se metiera en situaciones de peligro y ser un estorbo para Iría en varias ocasiones. Pero de a poco logra progresar y de forma sorpresiva logra entablar una relación de hermandad con Iría, ayudándola y apoyándose del uno al otro, además de forma un gran dúo juntos (Además de otra sorpresa que se guardó Kei casi al final: v) sin duda de lo mejor de toda obra en general.Mientras que por el resto de personajes no brillan tanto, el resto son solo plot device para desencadenar futuros eventos que la obra necesita para desarrollarse.Glenn (el hermano mayor de Iría) es uno de los casos de personajes que acabo de mencionar, como el hecho de que es bastante olvidable si no fuera porque Iría no deja de recalcar lo mucho que lo extraña y por la culpa que esta siente por su perdida.Bob es otro personaje que cae en el mismo problema, el cual solo sirvió de apoyo para Iría y su hermano al inicio de la obra para desaparecer en el inicio, para luego volver a la mitad de la obra, pero ahora en una computadora sin explicar que paso con su cuerpo, con la única justificación de que su cuerpo está gravemente dañado, pero que aun así fue fuera de pantalla y de omitir lo que paso con su cuerpo después del trasplantar su mente a la computadora.Aunque no es un daño tan grave, ya que al menos logra ser de ayuda para Iría, dándole consejos como caza recompensas con algo de experiencia y dándole alguno que otro consejo que le serviría de ayuda.Pero fuera deseo no cumple otra función, además de ser un rol que cualquier otro personaje puede hacer sin problemas, además de la decisión de que se deshicieran de su cuerpo para pasar su mente a una computadora fue bastante sacada de los pelos. Y que dicha acción hace que le privan de mostrar características humanas y pueda mostrar rasgos humanos, lo cual es una pena.Fujikoro es otro que también cae en ese mis síndrome de otros personajes desaprovechado, ya que solo se limita a hacerle la vida más complicada a Iría y de meterla en más situaciones de peligros y de lo poco que contribuye en la trama, como en el desarrollo de su personaje.Komimasa sufre el mismo problema que Glenn, que solo lo recordaras como el amigo de Kei y de su sacrificó para salvar a Iría y Kei, fuera de ser amigo de Kei y ser huérfano y que igual a este último su muerte sirve solo para desencadenar futuras acciones de los personajes de Iría y Kei y que la trama progrese.El Doctor Touka sería el peor caso de personaje desperdiciado, su función en la obra era investigar sobre el Zeiram, porque no contribuyen en nada, además ser ignorado en toda la obra después de su presentación, pese a que podría contribuir mucho a la trama, como saber de dónde proveniente el Zeiram, mejorar el equipo de combate militar, Mejorar el sistema de seguridad del planeta y de las ciudades, etc.Comité del gobierno también son otro caso perdido, ya que ignoran las ideas/sugerencias del doctor Touka y de mandar tropas a lo imbécil para morir en batalla en vano.También otro punto débil de la obra es el ritmo lento, el cual no le sienta bien a esta serie de ovas, este ritmo lento no le permite a la obra poder desarrollar su trama de forma natural y sin problemas.Provocando que no tengan un rol más activo en la obra y tengan su tiempo para brillar en pantalla. Pero en su lugar todos o fueron olvidados o no tuvieran una conclusión satisfactorias como personajes (con excepción de Iría y Kei), así como también varias cosas que no quedaron claras en la obra, como el origen del Zeiram que jamás se nos explica de donde viene y del porque están poderoso en primer lugar, por mencionar ejemplos.Esto se pudo haber resuelto si hubiera sido una serie de televisión, al menos así sería justificable el porqué del ritmo lento, pero eso ya es un caso hipotético, cosa que no va para esta reseña y creo que ya mis puntos quedaron claros con esta obra.En fin, podemos concluir que la obra es un sci-fi con elementos interesantes, una excelente banda sonora, apartado técnico alucinante, además de un sólido desarrollo y conclusión para los 2 principales, pero también acarrea el problema de desaprovechar personajes con potencial, un ritmo lento, elementos desaprovechados, conflictos alargados innecesariamente y montón más de problemas que ya acabo de mencionar, pero aun así es una obra que recomiendo ver ya sea para todo aquel interesado en verla, así como los amantes del género sci-fi en general , ya para terminar solo espero que sus pelis Live Action no posean los problemas que acabo de mencionar o que al menos no lo posean en gran medida, pero eso solo el tiempo lo dirá.6/10."", 'Iria: Zeiram the Animation is decent sci-fi. You get bounty hunters, an Asian (Thai) space tech motif, an evil invincible alien, annoying kids, good action, and decent plotting.Story 6/10The story is pretty good overall. Per the title, it focuses on Iria and her trials as a budding bounty hunter. It starts off with a small mission to have us get to know her and the universe. Bounty hunters are called on for special missions outside the scope of the authorities, have rules and regulations and honor code, and are in competition with one another occasionally. Then we get into the meat of the story...with the Zeiram creature, corporate conspiracy, and wacky kids.The story is told mostly straightforward with minor flashbacks to fill in the brother-sister relationship. The main story with Iria vs. the creature and corporate intrigue is pretty good. There are some minor twists along the way but nothing unexpected or surprising. The series is 6 episodes long and, with an exception of the escapades with the kids, is filled out at a good pace.It felt like the writers didn’t know how to wrap up the creature. We are told of its goals but not of the consequences of it succeeding. I think the story could have been script-doctored to make the end have better stakes instead of being an alien shootout.The entire arc with the kids did add some humanity and self-reflection to Iria’s character but I didn’t like the way it was handled. The kids were annoying to the point I was rooting for them to get blown up at times. They would alternate between being skillful robbers to crybabies and too much of the runtime was spent with them. Minus one point.Finally, there was the story with the doctor who studied the creature. It did not pay off in a meaningful way. If they had executed this plot point better, it could have been a plus point or even neutral. But I’ll have to subtract one point here.I like bounty hunters, space monsters, and corporate intrigue. 8/10. Minus two points for the kids and the hanging scientist thread. 6/10.Art 6/10The art for the series was innovative but executed in an average way. The quality was 90s budget anime level. The animation looked mostly decent but was rough in some spots – the characters looked different from some angles and the movements were awkward.The setting had the aesthetics of tropical space-Thailand. It looked cool especially for someone who has familiarity with southeast Asia.  The tech was creative too – lots of things that spin, organic tech, and wild west style gunplay. There was an emphasis on mushroom shapes (the alien, the buildings, and actual mushrooms as flora) and that was interesting to look at. Plus point for creativity.Iria’s character design was okay for a space bounty hunter. She had her skin-tight jumpsuit, armor plates, and then the cloak. She looked the part and had action sequences that were well-directed.The creature’s design was creative and menacing. The mushroom head and the tiny demon face were a nice and strange touch. In the beginning, he had a couple of different forms and some technological abilities. I was looking forward to seeing how he’d evolve new abilities and challenge our hero. However, it was only for the first episode and the rest of the time was spent in his default form.I couldn’t stand the kids. Their hair was aggressively annoying. And the second kid had the constant facial expression of being electrocuted. I know it’s anime and they needed memorable character designs but I hated almost every second they were on screen. Minus point.The action was pretty good. The bounty hunter’s arsenal was interesting and the running, jumping, shooting, and kicking were well directed. There were a few instances where the main characters had plot armor and couldn’t get hurt (everyone was getting shot and slashed and the MCs were getting punched and thrown) but it’s anime so I’ll roll with it. Plus one point for the action.Average plus two and minus one. 6/10 for the art.Sound 5/10The sound was average.The Japanese voices were okay. Iria sounded good and was expressive. The men’s voices were average. And the kids were annoying. The less they spoke the better.The sound effects were basic and didn’t standout. Gunshots, machines, and high-tech whirring. The sounds of the creature humming/chanting were unsettling and that was nice.The music had a groovy feel to it with funky guitars. The opening theme was not memorable or special. The end ballad was okay. Both songs had tropical-sounding instruments so they fit the aesthetic. The battle theme was twangy and fitted the action.Characters 5/10The main characters were pretty good.Iria was the apprentice bounty hunter looking to make her mark. She was brave, brash, and feisty. Her relationship with her brother was shown well and central to the story. She was tough when she needed to be and showed humanity at the right times. Iria was a heroine that was easy to root for.Zeiram was decent evil alien villain. His mushroom demon face, strange mumbling sounds, morph capability, and ability to interface with tech (though not played up well-enough) made him a menacing and formidable foe. If the writers had a little more for him to do at the end, his character and the story would have been better. He was decent, though.The supporting characters were pretty cookie-cutter. Bounty hunter friends, sniveling corporate crooks, and of course the kids. The kids were annoying from the first minute they showed up.Main characters 6/10. Minus one for the kids. 5/10 total.Enjoyment 7/10Even though some parts dragged, I had a good time watching Iria. I’d say the main character, the action, and the future-tropical aesthetic were good enough to keep me through all six episodes. The setting was interesting enough that I thought that there would be a sequel or two.If I had script-doctored the series, I would have kept evolving the Zeiram and made his motives more well-defined, reduced the annoyance level of the kids, and made something more interesting happen with the scientist. With those points executed well, it would have been 9/10.Still though, it’s solid sci-fi. Overall 6/10. with the Zeiram creature, corporate conspiracy, and wacky kids.The story is told mostly straightforward with minor flashbacks to fill in the brother-sister relationship.

It focuses on rookie bounty hunter Iria who works with her brother Gren who is a more experienced professional bounty hunter. Together, they hunt down and capture criminals for money. After Gren was killed, Iria finds herself working on her own taking on various different bounty hunting jobs. She can be very naïve and reckless and her actions cause a lot of harm. Iria skills as a bounty hunter improves as the story progresses.Episodes are told through an overarching narrative where it connects to a much bigger plot in the...later episodes. The plot is also very inconsistent in its storytelling as well as Iria can be on the governments bad side on one episode but in the next they would team up together like nothing much has happened. The government controls the bounty hunters and seems to be manipulating them for some nefarious purpose. The plot was generally faithful to some aspects of the film. It’s a prequel so you do not need to watch the film to understand the plot as it does its own thing for the most part.Iria is the typical rookie type protagonist and is a tomboy and her notable thing about her appearance is the beads she wears and that is normally reserved for males in the world of Iria Zeiram. The beads represent her level of skill in bounty hunting and because of her wearing beads she is the eccentric. There is plenty of comedy and entertaining moments in the show.The musical score was generally good and I also found the voice acting good but the dialogue was cheesy. The characters and plot concept wise were not the most original and they are not really complex either. The sci fi atmosphere does feel trippy and bizarre and the art design for characters, world and sci fi related scenery such as the aliens and bio weapons are generally good. The animation is sort of fuzzy looking and has not aged well.  There was no CGI in the anime and it was entirely hand drawn animation.The action is decent but nothing really special with the space fights being pretty good. It can be high stakes at certain parts of the episodes from fighting unknown aliens and mysterious bio weapons. The story can be predictable at times and you already know what the end result. The storytelling is secondary to the action.The pacing of the story is generally fast with no filler or padding. There are plot discrepancies between the movie and the anime. Many things are left unexplained or glossed over but this is probably because of the short length of the anime version. It is not fully clear how Iria’s brother survived or where there any explanations for his absence.It’s a decent watch if you can overlook the cheesy dialogue and inconsistent story telling. later episodes.

On the face of it it seems as though this is just another 90s sci-fi action OVA, and in many ways it is, but upon closer inspection it manages to set itself apart in a variety of interesting and bizarre ways. For example, this anime is actually a prequel to the live action film Zeiram from 1991. When considering this weird production trajectory, backed up by an utterly unique art style and fun campy premise, it's clear that this anime is more than just a throwaway OVA. Beginning with the story, it's fairly simple, and heavily...reminiscent of the Alien franchise. Two so-called 'hunters' and an apprentice are sent up to a ship in crisis to evacuate the crew and retrieve the cargo, only to find a horrible, seemingly invincible humanoid monster with grotesque biological abilities has escaped, which then begins to wreak havoc across the system. It runs into some problems later with character motivations, but it's not that big of a deal here. Despite being a touch predictable and perhaps heavy-handed with its Alien influences, it manages to execute its formula well and remain a cool early 90s romp throughout. It really feels like something meant for popping in the VHS player, then cracking open a few beers and ordering a couple pizzas with your friends. Like, it's not necessarily good, but it is a fun time, especially under the right circumstances. Moving on to the art, it is this anime's strongest aspect. The general art direction is incredibly strong, with a real vision for a unique and fantastic world distinct all its own. It has this engaging blend of the futuristic and the traditional, combined with a style which draws heavily from Indic cultures, like India, Sri Lanka, and more broadly Southeast Asia. The backgrounds are also consistently impressive, and seem to be where most of the budget went. Overall, it reminds me more of an 80s anime than a 90s anime, due in part to some of the stylistic choices they make throughout. Unfortunately, while the characters themselves have good designs and are well-animated in combat scenes, they feel somewhat cheap in comparison to the rest of the show, and suffer from what I term the 'dreaded mask', where the character's facial expressions seem stiff and unemotional at moments where they absolutely should not be. Other than that though, the art is what really sets this anime apart. The sound is good, meeting all standards of quality for the time, and supported by an energetic and almost trippy synth track that sounds straight out of the 80s. The characters fit their setting rather well, even if they're not very deep. Among the cast, my favorites are Fujikuro and Komimasa, because in comparison to everybody else, they feel somehow the most believable. Fujikuro has this rough exterior which evolves over the course of the show to the point he really grows as a person, and as a result has actual layers to his character, whereas Komimasa acts in a fashion which befits a street urchin with a sense of honor, and his moments of dialogue almost feel like they come from a different anime altogether- he is a more believable depiction of what he is than his friend Kei, for example. Overall, Iria: Zeiram the Animation is a fun 90s action romp with which you can just turn your brain off and enjoy- so long as you can ignore its flaws. reminiscent of the Alien franchise.

I decided to switch things up and go back and watch older anime so that I could find any hidden gems. While browsing through the app RetroCrush, the first anime that caught my eye was an Original Video Animation (OVA) called Iria: Zeriam The Animation (1994) which was made to be a prequel for the live-action movie Zeriam (1991). The show is a short watch as it’s only six episodes but, is it worth your time to watch during this quarantine?The narrative...is a simple premise of a bounty hunter chasing a supposedly “indestructible” monster. It’s nice that the show had a simple premise because of the limited run time which made sure that every episode had impact and purpose. The world-building was it’s the strongest point and made the show interesting; they dropped hints of how the world operates through dialogue and visual clues that weren’t emphasized. Also, the first few episodes of the show did a good job of pacing and not trying to overload the viewer with a bunch of exposition.Unfortunately,  during the last half of the series the limited run time worked against it because it felt like the show wanted to reveal more of itself to the viewers but it had to quickly wrap up for the finale. So you can probably predict that there may have been some things that viewers would’ve liked to see or questions that they might’ve had that will never get answered because there were too few episodes.Visually, the show was gorgeous and really stands up to the test of time. The colors in the show were vibrant and helped bring the world to life. The character designs were very original and felt very unique to this show. The suits had Batman-like compartments that characters could pull little gadgets, while that is a little ex Machina, it still was an interesting thing to see. Also, the gadgets looked great with having a less traditional look to them but were used in the manner they were designed to do so it didn’t take away from the show in any way.Additionally, the backdrops in the show were really great. The show teases you with the wonders of what else could be out there to see in this universe.The version of Iria that I watched was dubbed and with this show being made in a time where anime was very niche, it’s to be expected that the voice acting quality would not be to par to today’s standards. With that knowledge, the voice acting was still subpar. Almost, everyone in the show sounded like emotionless robots. That really took away from the show making you wish the characters would hurry up and shut up. The music in certain parts also failed because they tried to really hone in on the Sci-Fi elements by making experimental music that would really fit into the genre. The end result was that music was so different that it failed to draw on emotions in order to enhance a scene.Iria herself wasn’t the most interesting character you will find in anime but that still makes for an enjoyable watch. She is your stereotypical good guy that believes in treating all humans as humans. The rest of the supporting cast wasn’t really that memorable, to be honest, but that is another fault of having a limited run time where you can’t flesh out every character. Now, the character of Zeiram wasn’t anything unique just like it’s protagonist counterpart. Zeiram is presented as an indestructible killing machine...that likes to kill. That’s it and that’s honestly all the show needed from it.Overall, the show was an enjoyable experience and it left wanting more. I felt the universe of Iria was really original and had a lot to offer if it was given a chance to be a full 12+ episode season. As it stands, I wouldn’t rewatch but I would recommend it to those that haven’t seen it. There aren’t that many episodes and during these crazy Covid-19 times we have nothing but time, so I implore everyone to give it a watch.Story: 7/10Art: 9/10Sound: 5/10Character: 6/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 6/10 is a simple premise of a bounty hunter chasing a supposedly “indestructible” monster.

The final movie covers the last third of the MS Zeta Gundam series.The digital remastering was not done totally. There would be new scenes added in with wonderful new animation. Just as you're happy and marvelling at the animation they cut to the scenes lifted 100% from the series, which while they might have been remastered look very dated. The switch between the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; scenes is very jarring and affected my enjoyment of these movies.That being said,...some new scenes added in were very good and helped with character development. They also cut out a lot of fluff which made the movie much more enjoyable than the series, which tended to move along at a snail's pace.Overall the final movie is leaps and bounds more enjoyable than the series as the pacing, animation (spotty) and character development are much better.

When it came to this part...though I felt everything that was important was present. There were certain scene I did not remember it was indeed been a while so I\'m not sure it they were added or I just don\'t remember them. Example the conclusion fight between Yazan and Kamille I don\'t remember it playing out this way but if it didn\'t play out this way I do feel this version is actually better than how ever it played out in the anime adaptation. There were also moves that the Zeta Gundam was using that I also do not remember it using like ""Beam Confuse"" as it is called in this movie, I felt little additions like that made the experience fresh and new to me. Also the pacing I felt was great.Now as for the one thing that obviously still plagues these movies is the combination of new and old scenes and if you\'ve stuck around to watch all three of them like i said in my review in the second one you should have gotten used to it by now. I felt it was 50-50 when it came to new and old scenes. Also the new scenes was outstanding for the time it came out. The triple treat fight between Scirocco, Haman and Char that scene was by far the best scene visually that impressed me, so I\'ll commend them for it.Overall like said before and once again I only recommend this to someone who is familiar to the Zeta Series new comers I recommend the anime as I still feel as an overall package is still the definitive version but this one out of the three is indeed the best of them. though I felt everything that was important was present.

Nisekoi: OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32553/Nisekoi__OVA,"['Nisekoi: OVA is an extra 26 minute episode that was released with a recent issue of the Nisekoi manga. Its plot is divided into two parts. Part 1, also known as, ""Honeymoon"", centers around the male main character, Raku, and the first four female characters of his harem: Chitoge, Kosaki, Marika, and Seishirou. In ""Honeymoon"", Raku and each of the four characters share a dream together in which the two of them become married.Part 2 of the OVA is ""Magical Pâtissière Kosaki-chan!"" It essentially builds off from the first half of Episode 8 from the second season of Nisekoi (""Magical Pâtissière Kosaki!""). Here, Chitoge,...Marika, and Kosaki use their magical powers once again to battle the evil leader Shuu.If you\'re wondering if the scriptwriting improved, you will be sorely disappointed. It uses the same old antics, but even then, the humor is far drier than its parent story. On top of that, the plot jumps all over the place (and since when did Nisekoi ever have a straight plotline? Good question.). As for the characters themselves, they don\'t change much from the second season, which is to be expected since this is just a single OVA.The art is done well and does not differ much from the second season. The shading is very consistent and the animation is fluid. If you pay close attention, you will also notice that Magical Pâtissière Kosaki-chan! pays tribute to some of Shaft\'s other shows, including Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica and Bakemonogatari. Aside from that, I do want to warn some of you that there is some minor fanservice. If you\'re not interested in stuff like that, I wouldn\'t recommend watching, but if you\'re okay with it, go right ahead.The sound in general is decent, but it is certainly far, far from spectacular. Let\'s just say that it suffices for the context of this episode.Overall, this OVA was pretty poorly done and lackluster. It had its moments, but it ultimately fell flat on its face due to the fact that it was so dry. If you decide to not watch this OVA, don\'t worry - you\'re not missing out.(In case you\'re wondering, by the way, I gave this OVA overall a 3 because MAL says 3 is ""poor.""

Which is what exactly this was.)', 'Also regarded as OVA 4, this was released way back on January of 2016, after the end of Nisekoi 2nd season. I didn`t hear about this OVA when it first came out, and never got to watch it. I just recently stumbled upon it, read the name, and thought to myself \'Yeah, I got some free time, lets watch it.\' Nisekoi is an anime which I liked, just barely, and whose manga and its ending which I utterly despised. But the OVAs of popular romance animes tend to be at the very least entertaining. And the name and plot summary seem like it could be...fun. Honeymoon and magic girls, sure why not. How bad can they mess it up? Pretty bad it seems.This OVA is pure Nisekoi, with all its flaws and problems that I have with it. Its story is repetitive, shallow, and lacks any meaning, reason, or pay-off. I was turned off and bored out of my mind.STORY AND WRITING:The anime is divided into two separate stories. One is a dream honeymoon sequence, while the second is an adventure of magical girl story. And both SUCK in terms of Script and Writing.The honeymoon part is essentially a type of dream sequences in which Raku dreams of spending his marriage anniversary with Onodera, Tachibana, Tsugumi and Chitoge, one at a time. These dreams sequences are too short, lasting from 2 to 3 minutes each, and give you no joy or satisfaction at all. They all contain noting more than some greeting, a lit bit of praising, the overused ""Dinner, bath, or me” phrase, TOGECHI (yeah, that happened) and a lot of blushing, chinch, and bad comedy. This makes the entire half of the OVA feel empty and uninteresting, short and pointless. This was a great opportunity to show some meaningful romance and payoff, and yet the episode completely butchered it and fell flat on its face.The magical adventure part picks up from the first half of episode 8 of the 2nd season (Which took me years to force out of my mid, THANKS A LOT OVA!). In this part, the magical girls (Onodera, Tachibana and Chitoge) go on a mission to stop Dr. Maiko from doing, something. Led by the great sage Rurin and the Magical princess (*sign* I really feel like I`m shortening my lifespan by writing this). It`s what will happen if Nisekoi and several magical girls shows from the 90s had a baby. Yeah, only awful things can happen from that. This half is also lacking in any content. Its empty and has noting more than transformations, erotic scene, and yep you guessed it, bad comedy.The script is dumb and the writing is poor. The stories are uninteresting or fun, but they are so lacking in any real thought or content. The characters are the same, and without even a hint of change. Nearly half of the OVA contain only the intro and outros, with the actual story feeling like an afterthought. The OVA will constantly jump from one scene another, without properly wrapping them up properly. Believe me when I say that I was looking forward to some variety and change in this show`s repetitive and boring story. And this type of story points gave it the opportunity to do so. Yet it still somehow was able to deliver the same type of story that I am sick and tired of. And it even went above and beyond the call of duty. Because the script and writing for this OVA are some of the worst this show has given (I was going to say the worse, but then I remembered that the Tachibana rescue arc happened in the manga).ANIMATION AND MUSIC:One thing which Nisekoi could lean on, is its animation and music. It`s animation and music are much better compared to many other romance animes. And when it uses them together, it creates many eyes warming and pleasant to watch scenes, which the anime is filled with.The animations, character animations in particular, are fluent and colorful. This makes watching the shows regular banter and fake-outs bearable and sometimes entertaining. Season 2 improved those aspects, and it`s carried on to the OVA. The dream with Onodera and Tsugumi, had some good animation pieces. The magical girl section also had some, particularly their transformation one, which takes half of their part`s runtime. But the problem is that there is barely any of that here. Half of the OVA`s runtime is taken up by the 2 intro and 2 outros of the show. There is not enough run time and barely any worthwhile animation piece.The situation is even worse in the music side of things. Nisekoi has quite a few charming OST pieces, that the OVA refuse to use. The intro and outro of the second season is in here, and it`s as average as I remember. The intro and outro for the magical girl part, somehow, I liked. And combined with the animation, it was pleasant to watch. I`ll raise it a point for that (now it’s all the way up to 4).CONCLUTION AND VERDICT:This OVA is extremely bland, boring and at times horrifying to look at. Just like the actual anime, this OVA is determined to frustrate you and waste your time, with no pay-off and satisfaction. It`s plot constantly jumps back and forth, it tries so hard to be comedic and fails miserably, the writing is extremely dumb. Even the animation and music are underutilized. What was suppose to be a chance to give fun and entertaining episode, turned out instead to be an extreme misfire and a very big DUD.I wasn`t expecting much from this OVA, not even enjoyment. I just wanted to turn my mind off, spend my time, watch something dumb and fun, and don`t think much about anything. And yet here I am, writing this DAMN review because of how much shocked and frustrated I am. I didn`t even remember much about Nisekoi. And looking back at it, I always thought that I was I little TOO hard on Nisekoi. But now I know that it was because I was successful in removing it out of mind. And if this is how I remember the anime, no wonder I was hard on it. If you are like me and don`t like Nisekoi`s writing, then avoid this OVA at all cost.Thank for reading the review.

(better than one piece in the first episodes tbh).- Althought the plot was rushed it is not boring, you can imagine how far it can go and there's so much potencial.- I love the power system, in the last episodes you get to learn that there's more to just having red yellow or blue kitetsu, watching the trio grow their powers and learning to...control them while having to fight the 8 and destroy the kishin does sound intertaining.- It had a little of romance in the middle which is always enjoyable.Overall for a anime that no one talks about it's good and I give a 7.5/10 with clean animations and better pacing (+episodes) it can reach high popularity. I cannot praise this enough the anime has huge potencial. control them while having to fight the 8 and destroy the kishin does sound intertaining.- It had a little of romance in the middle which is always enjoyable.Overall for a anime that no one talks about it's good and I give a 7.5/10 with clean animations and better pacing (+episodes) it can reach high popularity.

I think breaking apart Musashi from Tsugumi and Kojirou wasn’t the smartest move as their group chemistry holds the show together. A lot of this second half is Musashi getting dunked on over and over again and it gets fatiguing to watch fast.I’m not a huge fan of newly introduced characters. They’re all very stand off-ish and by the time they have character arcs it’s a bit too late to start liking them. The only exception is Michiru who...has a good character arc and is a sweetheart.But the animation is still the biggest flaw of the show. I think it would be a much more entertaining anime in the hands of a better studio that can choreograph big, bombastic sakuga fight scenes and big oni boss battle because some of the sword powers and techniques are very cool and they really need some extra animation flare. It would also help in swallowing some of the more tedious parts of the story.I really want to like “Orient” more. There’s some good, interesting ideas going on, but as a production it feels so half arsed. Maybe I’ll just read the manga.5/10 Mediocre (Parts 1+2 Overall Score) has a good character arc and is a sweetheart.But the animation is still the biggest flaw of the show.

The first 5 episodes or so of this anime are absolute trash. I don\'t know WHAT Shinobu Otaka was thinking, but they\'re a god awful mess and I think the primary reason why the ranking for this show is so low.But if you stick with it, everything from episode 6 to 12 is actually pretty good, and everything past episode 12 is PHENOMENAL. If you like Magi, this has a really similar vibe. It\'s well executed, and Shinobu Otaka shines with her worldbuilding, mixing of fight scenes with emotional story beats, and making you feel like the characters are...really human. The animation is well done and the pacing is actually done really nicely so you can feel the growth of everyone in the story. I cried so much at the last couple episodes tooIgnore anyone who says the MC is trash, because those people just want your run of the mill anime protagonist who ""rages"" and powers up fast so they can ""kill everyone"". This MC is not that, this show is not a power fantasy. This is an actual story and it\'s genuinely very well done (after those first few episodes). really human.

NOPE, not one bit at all.With Part 2's arrival covering the 4th arc of the manga from Volumes 6 through to 13 (God, that almost looks like the anime is rushing, but the adverse is true becuse the manga chapter panels are getting shorter) showing the Awajishima Gekitou-hen a.k.a The Battle of Awaji Island arc, featuring the Kanemaki Band trio Musashi, Kojiro and Tsugumi descending onto Awaji Island to learn more about Kojiro's past. Pretty standard and typical...Shonen fare.So, first things first. It's nice to see Musashi have a change of heart thanks to this character called Michiru Saruwatari, whom the trio first encountered right at the end of the 1st half of the series being attacked and captured by an Oni, only to be rescued by them. Despite being a damsel in distress, Michiru, for some reason, doesn't communicate because she's too shy, and letting both Kojiro and Tsugumi fight over her to get her to talk frustrates the hell outta Musashi out, and she finally opens her mouth because he remembers her name. But at the time, and despite the growing intimacy between the two, they were both travelling in opposite directions, so that's where their initial separation lies. It's not until the Awaji Island Recapture Operation arc that this girl would come back again after the trio banded with other Bushi bands to form the Uesugi Alliance in order to take down the famed 8-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi, one of the 5 strongest Onis in the series and the feared green Kishin who has occupied Awaji Island.But to Michiru, she has one more problem up her sleeve: her own father Yataro. Like Shiro Inukai, Nanao Inusaka (both of which were seen at the end of the 1st half) and Seiroku Inukawa, Yataro Inuda is also a member of the Obsidian Eight, whose purpose as you know is to extract the Obsidian Goddess out of Musashi. And this father expects a lot from his only capable daughter, seeing that she like any Bushi, wield a Kitetsu Blade, and named her after being his 3000th creation. But knowing that Yataro would do anything to capture Musashi, the burden lands on Michiru to inform Musashi and the others about the impending doom on Awaji Island, and the stage is set for the immense conflict bound to happen over the course of the 2nd half.In all essence, you should expect from the somewhat subpar showing of the 1st half to be carried over here, that's a mainstay. The only thing that's improved here is Shinobu Ohtaka's story elements that come now with high stakes given that the Obsidian Goddess is pretty much in peril in spite of Musashi who still has no clear idea how to fully utilize its power, that is until now. And despite the Kanemaki trio not making a lot of screentime in the latter half, some people do are given the spotlight instead, like Tatsuomi Uesugi: the unrivalled leader of the Uesugi Band/Alliance and one of the 5 Grand Generals of Hinomoto, and Akihiro Shimazu of the Shimazu Band. They stand out for their own reasons, are given ample screentime to work their issues out and experience character growth. This is the same for Musashi as he is being shifted to the forefront, he's still the same bragging boy, but changed for others and most certainly Michiru for their budding relationship. The OST sounds more or less just about the same (Da-iCE is just Da-iCE), though like with Wataru Hatano's 1st half's ED, Gakuto Kajiwara's 2nd half ED is on par as well for being as enjoyable.At the end of the day, it's no doubt an improvement.

I definitely recommend it however I know that there will be quite a few people who might not like it the same way I do.I like this arc as it really shows you what it takes for one of the 4 great kishin to be taken out not only that but it also introduces you to the power system and the cool things that can be done in this anime, I also...like that musashi isn\'t treated as some overpowered prodigy or even relative in power to that of the high ranks of the verse as it shows you just how far he has to grow in order to become the strongest and that its kind of a breath of fresh air since its been a while since there was a shonen anime. I also like the villains and side characters of the story as they arent just weak and have no standing unlike some anime that build up the main characters too much to the point where the side characters are just useless in 90% of situations, where as in this show it doesnt matter how weak the person is individually if they are able to link their power with you, the combined attack can be formidable. The villains now they pretty much just want the ultimate power that being the obsidian goddess but the way they go about doing it is interesting as they could be allies but they do not depend on each other rather they push each other down and call them weak if they see them as such i cant wait until we see the entire group of the black dogs and all of them using their powersI wanted to add what has been seen as ""bad"" for the anime. Personally i have seen quite a few people talk about the main character being weak and that is why the series is bad or how instead of the series focusing mostly on the main character they show the side characters more, even I would say the animation could do with some polishing up but i would still watch the anime once I like the story enough so for me it isnt a problem but for some I have seen people just not watch an anime because it simply wasnt visually appealing. like that musashi isn\'t treated as some overpowered prodigy or even relative in power to that of the high ranks of the verse as it shows you just how far he has to grow in order to become the strongest and that its kind of a breath of fresh air since its been a while since there was a shonen anime.

Has a decent art style and animation, and decent Osts. The villains are interesting and also strong with a lot of good abilities but in the end, they are overpowered easily by the heroes and his comrades.

So, surely it is better than the prequel. Well, it is both yes and no. Not only the story develops even more but it is also a lot more action packed compared to the last season. You can see the effort put into this anime but the problem is there is more action compared to the last season, which also means it requires better animation to properly display everything that is going through that moment. Unfortunately, most of the time...it is just a cinemagraph with visual effects and that alone is a massive turn off. Furthermore, there is not much of a problem to reuse the same shots over and over again but at least there has to be something worth watching after that. After that, the overall flow of the anime is honestly sad to look at actually. Casually inserting a flashback or something similar during an action scene without a proper transition not only makes it hard to sympathize with the characters but it also makes certain characters looks worse than their initial impression.In a nutshell, Orient has a solid foundation since the idea of the story itself is not bad but the execution of it is unfortunately terrible because there is nothing much to like about it. You are welcome to watch it if you want but it is wasted potential in my opinion it is just a cinemagraph with visual effects and that alone is a massive turn off.

Too bad,it kinda dissapointing me since i was expecting this gonna be good after watching the first season of the anime.Quite a disappointing story but I can't say why. From the review of the first season, I always say that the power system in this anime is one of the weaknesses of the story because of its unclear elements.

In terms of audio quality, maybe this is just a matter of taste because I feel that I don't really like the opening song that is being performed, but fortunately they have an ending song that is pleasant to hear.

Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de,"['Moderator Edit: This review may contain spoilers.---Ever go into a burger restaurant, only to realize that it sells some of the most kickass tacos? That\'s what watching Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de feels like.Came in expecting superpower battles, came out having experienced one of the best anime dealing with friendship. Right off the bat, this anime tells a story of a group of normal high schoolers (and one primary schooler) gaining superpowers. For some inexplicable reason, they are now held with the burden of functioning as normal students with these destructive weapons at their disposal. Not surprisingly, this presents quite a problem for them;...and I think that\'s the purpose these superpowers serve. They were implemented as a device to see how the main male character, Andou, would resist his chuunibyou desires to use his cool-yet-dangerous powers. They were implemented to see how Sayumi, the most level-headed member of the group, would manage this newfound burden as the leader (and so on and so forth). At the end of the day, we didn\'t get many battles; rather, we received a story of a series of struggles that these high schoolers faced while possessing these powers.There were many hints of romance throughout the series, but again, they were used as devices to highlight the friendship between the main characters. Tomoyo had to come to terms with her own self, accepting her chuunibyou and not being afraid to be who she was. In order to achieve that, she also had to come to terms with her feelings for Andou, as he was the one who truly allowed her to express herself. In a Sakurasou-like fashion, there was a side-story in which Tomoyo strove to be a light novel publisher. Initially hesitant, with the support of Andou, she boldly put her name out there (and got pretty damn far!). It\'s amazing how much an anime (that\'s technically a romance-comedy) can teach me about hard work and dedication. At the end of the day, it\'s not about how far you get; it\'s about how far you extended your efforts. Because of that, Tomoyo didn\'t have anything to regret, and Andou acknowledged her regardless.Another ""romance"" of Inou-Battle came in the form of Hatoko\'s relationship with Andou. Admittedly, while watching her interactions with Andou, I could greatly relate to a lot of the frustrations she had. Unable to relate to Andou (due to not having the same interests--see: chuunibyou), she was hopelessly trying to grab his attention, and yet, unable to do so. So frustrating a effort finally culminated in one of the most emotional seiyuu performances I have ever seen in an anime. So much emotion was put into every word; I truly understood the magnitude of Hatoko\'s frustration. I would dare say this scene alone makes Inou-Battle worth the watch (for those curious, it is in episode 7). At the end of the series, Hatoko didn\'t fully understand the person whom she affectionately calls ""Ju-Kun""; despite that, she certainly had matured as a character and became infinitely better at understanding those different from herself.With the final episode, I think most who had been following Inou-Battle weekly would agree that there was a huge surprise; there was an actual battle with strategy! Indeed, a lot of confusion was cleared up with the explanations in the final battle, and it showed that there was a maturation process all the characters had to go through (especially Andou) in order to learn how to manage their powers. At the end of Inou-Battle, I think there are two main takeaways: with power comes the need for great responsibility, and friendships only strengthen when friends take the time to talk things out. Rather than harboring a silence anger, voicing frustrations is often the best thing that could happen for a friendship. It was a definite pleasure to watch such characters as Hatoko learn how to better relate to others, Tomoyo learn how to be honest with herself, and Andou learn how to balance chuunibyou with maturity.With Inou-Battle, don\'t look forward to supernatural battles. Instead, look forward to deep themes of hard work, responsibility, self-honesty, and friendship. Inou-Battle will deliver. and I think that\'s the purpose these superpowers serve.

This is a slice of life and a harem/romantic comedy.  This is a show about a club of friends and them developing powers is more of a background setting thing.  Apparently a lot of people missed this completely when they decided to watch it.  Taking that into account, I found the show to be quite enjoyable and cute.  Some pretty funny bits but not too much that made me laugh out loud....Regarding the harem aspect, there\'s next to no fan-service so it manages to avoid many of the same harem tropes seen in countless other shows (for example, the ""Oh no you tripped and grabbed my boobs/walked in on me while bathing"" = scream + slap routine).  The slice of life aspect is mostly just their club activities or episodes mostly centered around a few of the girls at a time.  Things move pretty slow.Moving on, the MC isn\'t a spineless self insert or a pervert either, you can actually understand why these girls are all falling for him.  When he decides to drop the chunni bit and act serious, he is insanely good at saying the right things and just happens to keep raising their affection levels.  It\'s entirely possible that he could talk himself into a harem ending without realizing it and getting hogtied by the girls.For the girls, I found them each to have their own personality and problems and were pretty decently done.  Childhood friend gets a special mention just because she has the usual jealousy issue that gets old, but it\'s flavored by more reasons than just him getting along with another girl.All that said, this show is by no means perfect.  There\'s really no plot, just something shoehorned into the setting (that probably fit better in the source material) that gets needlessly distracting.  Also the show really is all about the girls falling for the MC.  Best just to view it as a romcom.  Not surprisingly  there isn\'t much of an ending either.  Not a cliffhanger, but not any resolutions to the main plot.  Personally I wasn\'t bothered by it since the plot didn\'t really feel like it fit in this show anyways.

The answer is Inou Battle Wa Nichijoukei No Naka De. Literally meaning ‘When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace’, this show based on the light novel of the same name adapted by Trigger pulls off this strangely yet addictive gimmick to grip your eyes to the screen. And how does it do that? It’s those supernatural battles and the characters that gets involved in them as part of a common place ritual.The series’ title speak for itself as...the very first episode quickly demonstrates the female characters in this show are ladies you don’t want to mess with. In essence, they have supernatural powers ranging from time manipulation, elemental abilities, healing/repairing objects, or even creating object themselves. Simply put, these girls are part of this group known as the Senko High School's Literature Club but there’s one oddball in the mix: Jurai Ando. Unlike the others, he is an ordinary kid who pretends that he has powers. If you ever remember watching ‘Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!’ before, then you’ll get the general idea. Just replace the words of ‘Dark Flame Master’ with Dark Flame Dark; a seemingly useless flame that is spawned from his imaginations. Despite the wacky way the show handles itself, there’s also surprisingly a strong degree of fun that viewers can get out of this series.It all starts with our characters. While Ando isn’t anything extraordinary, he does have an innate ability to influence people whether he knows it or not. His interactions with the members of the Literature Club often provides a genuine amount of comedy. In fact, every episode generates some sort of new gimmick that involves most of the characters. No one is left behind in the dark as Ando is able to create ways for him to get involved despite being different from them. This even applies to supporting characters such as the student council president Mirei Kudo when she misunderstands a situation that ends up being much complicated than it should be. But surprisingly enough, the show doesn’t kill off this sub-plot but actually provide some genuine moments of honesty. In retrospect, the show is self-aware of itself and is able to balance between the comedy and dramatic moments; a feat that is quite something for a show such as this.When it comes to the girls, this show qualifies for cliché to the max. We have the tsundere Tomoyo, the polite airhead Hatoko, the book nerd Sayumi, and the playful Chifuyu. All of their personalities contrast from one another but are somehow all able to co-exist as a group together. And unlike most series with similarities, Inou Battle appeals more to lighthearted comedy by employing the characters’ gimmicks. Examples are evidence with clever jokes involving Ando and any of these girls or as a whole. Although he ends up being a butt monkey on occasions, the girls are appreciate for his presence and are interested in him as a person. At times, the show gets a bit crazy for its own good but that really never drowns what it’s trying to accomplish: to create genuine comedy for appealing entertainment. Thanks to our characters, we get most of that.Individually, the main characters also get their backgrounds fleshed out and spotlights throughout the series. Various episodes explores their personalities and brings out challenges like common place. The thrill of the show doesn’t rely on what might come next from guessing. Instead, it lies at where the viewers may feel being part of such a story with its expositions. It’s also noticeable that Ando once again plays key roles as part being of each episode. Rather than standing in the sidelines or becoming a victim, he plays the role of a guardian angel to help the helpless. It’s also ironic since he is the one without the powers and is able to help the girls who are blessed with these supernatural gifts, no?Despite crafting a bucket load of fun and laughter, the show can be hard to get used to after a while for some. Characters are still one-dimensional and doesn’t escape its harem-esque tropes. It should be obvious but all the main girls seems to have an implied crush on Ando. These also are mixed with various reactions ranging from jealousy, to loneliness, to even aggression (See Hatoko’s ragefest episode). However, the show is lighthearted so it doesn’t steer its wheel too far onto the drama road. The back stab is that it can hardly be taken seriously in this manner. Sure, there are moments where we feel compelled to realize these emotions but most of it is still covered by the immense amount of comedy. At later stages of the show, even the comedy seems to be a bit diehard and loses its momentum. The superpowers gimmicks also dies down considerably to a point where the show almost seems like a slice of life. Ando himself doesn’t improve much either as he still tries to go die-hard with his chuunibyou behavior. Despite standing out more than a dull average boy, he is also oblivious to the girls’ feelings which leads to generic moments of misunderstandings and saturated nonsense. Speaking of which, the romance aspect of this show should be treated as a bad joke. While it shouldn’t be taken account as a shoujo fest of love angles, the series still makes the romance look like a silly slab of bland cliché collection.You’ve heard about them before and seen what they can do. Studio Trigger takes a crack at this light novel adaptation as one of their first non-original series. The end result is satisfactory when it comes to artwork although nothing astonishingly remarkable. Let’s face it, the backgrounds looks goofy and hardly noticeable with its generic school setting. However, the character designs offer a fun degree of diversity. Tossing Ando aside (since he is the most dull looking character), the girls are illustrated well in suit of their personalities and roles. During ‘action’ and ‘fighting scenes’, the series tries its best to make it look real with various degrees of success. Fan service is also limited although there are a few occasions of suggestive camera angles; usually aimed at cosplay gimmicks in particular one episode and swimsuit shenanigans.Background music doesn’t play a huge role in the show but the character voices do when it comes to their roles. While Ando is a dull-looking boy, he brings in an immense amount of energy with his personality. Similarly, the girls create an atmosphere of recreational fun with their casual way of speech mannerisms. They say what’s on their mind and often does it without repetitiveness. I give praise to the ensemble cast of our characters (including Ando) for their ability to draw in viewers at what they try to achieve. On the other hand, the OP and ED songs aren’t very appealing. While it is cute and has a decent amount of colorful attractiveness, there’s nothing special about it with its generic themes.To say the least, this show isn’t for everyone. If you’re used to some of Trigger’s previous work, then you will find Inou Battle to be somewhat different. I don’t mean it different at its premise but rather the gimmicks the show holds when it comes to connecting its characters. Still, the characters makes up a bulk of what you can enjoy from this show. Now, fuse that with comedy and with every day common stories and you’ll get entertainment at its most definite form. Just be aware though that the show isn’t trying to drive a story with an ultimatum. Instead, it celebrates supernatural culture in way that doesn’t involve high level battles to save the world. the very first episode quickly demonstrates the female characters in this show are ladies you don’t want to mess with.

Do not be fooled by its title. While the series is named ""Supernatural battles within daily life"", the ""Nichijou"" part is far more prevalent than the ""Inou battle"" part, and what little plot or action concerning their powers there is gets confined to the very last episodes (and left with no closure) and its presence and relevance is marginal at best.The ""nichijou"" part is not too succesful either, as the transitions from comedy to drama sections are often abrupt and do not...fit the general tone of the series well. The fact that everyone is in love with the MC is eyebrow raising as well because they hardly show why the female cast develops feelings, and therefore all the romance and drama arising from it is not as effective as it should be. While the series would have benefited from a stronger comedy section, it\'s still generic enough to be enjoyable if you don\'t mind the style in the first place but it is no more than filler between better series. fit the general tone of the series well.

I\'m here to tell you right now, that is indeed NOT the case. It quickly sets into motion what can only be described as the best damn harem you will ever see. The first episode gives a sort of self insertion vibe, but by the next episode you will have realized that the main character, Andou, is too unique for any of that. It feels almost as if he has two different personalities. That, children, is what we call INDIRECT...CHARACTERIZATION. This is a process that not many authors in the manga writing world seem to understand. Right off the bat we are SHOWN that he is an overactive chuuni (A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to ""Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome"". People with chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.) in a club filled with some of the most unique harem characters seen to date.STORY: Andou, Jurai is a boy who believes his right arm harbours a supernatural dark flame. This of course being nonsensical couldn\'t possibly be a reality, especially since he is a chuuni, right? This could technically be right, except for the fact that one day, while in the literature club room he and his club mates spontaneously gain \'superpowers\'. From this, the story heads down a path of broken hearts and strengthened friendships. Anything said passed this is spoiler territory since the anime pretty much starts from the word go.ART: It\'s not amazingly good, but it\'s up to standards for modern times. The boob physics are somewhat broken, though. The animation really adds to a lot of the moments. There will be times where how fast (or slow) something is happening will really add to the comedy. I forgot to mention, this show can be really funny when it wants to be, just not often. All of the members of this guy\'s harem are drawn really uniquely, not often matching their personalities.SOUND: Holy shit, the voice actor for Andou is absolutely amazing. The voice cracks when he screamed sounded not at all forced and added to a lot of the humour. Every character is voice acted perfectly, I just specifically noticed that his stood out. The ED and OP as well as the OST don\'t stand out a ton, but set the mood whenever need be.CHARACTER: Pretty much every character has two sides to them. Andou is dimwitted, but not to the point of absurdity. He acted in ways most guys would act when a female does not explain why she is feeling the way she is feeling. On the other hand, he can be calm and serious enough to know what to do in most situations. Chifuyu is your loli for this harem, however, she is manipulative and straightforward. If something is on her mind, she will blatantly say it out loud. Tomoyo is a true tsundere, no, not in that annoying fashion that has become commonplace in anime. She gets understandably upset, but does not abuse the character even if it seems inevitable. Take notes, light novel writers. Hatoko is the childhood friend and I have never felt so bad for one in a harem as I have with this one. She is not dumb, per se, just confused. She does not understand what a chuuni is and therefore comes off as ditsy when those situations arise. Another thing I have to give props to is that she IS the childhood friend, you get backstory on it as well as you get to see the chemistry between them. Sayumi is the senpai, she surpasses in everything that she does. She is calm and collected. Nothing passed that really. Oh yeah, she\'s got a body like a hot tamale. All these characters have reasons to actually love the MC. You get to see them develop their feelings and it all feels so natural. I had to take breaks between each episode to gather myself and comprehend what just happened. The side characters are fleshed out quite well, but are not able to be mentioned due to showing up at a later time in the series.EENJOYMENT: I think I may have enjoyed this more than Hagani, and that\'s the only other harem I sort of liked.

And that ends this 12 episode cliche harem anime, so Happy Holidays to everyone, time to make my review.StoryThe anime\'s title is Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de or in English, it either means:When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace, Inou Battle Within Everyday Life or Inou-Battle in the Usually Daze, which isn\'t what the anime is, cu\'z the so called Supernatural Battle only happens...with Kiryu Hellkaiser Luci-Frist\'s posse, and not with Andou\'s harem, in fact this series should be titled \'When Supernatural Beings Becomes Common Place, cu\'z that\'s what really has anime\'s plot is, and in most episode it always involve the main guy Andou and his harem. so, I\'m giving this part a 5.ArtWell, there isn\'t much fanservice involve, thought the character\'s school uniform looks good on the females it doesn\'t look good on the guys, frankly , it would have been better off if the guys would don a Gakuran instead of a red top and white trouser for the guys that makes them look sissy. Also, I don\'t get as to why Hatoko has to wear  a cardigan during summer. Cu\'z of it, I\'m gonna go for a 3 for the crime of fashion that illustrator,  Kōsuke Kurose did with the boys uniform and making Hatoko wear a cardigan during summer.SoundDespite of Sayumi sounding like a milf, I\'m still gonna give this part a 7 for the opening and ending theme.CharacterOk, so Andou is a good MC according to a lot of MAL users, but to me he is just the usual harem guy, then again I gotta give the guy credit for what he did in the last episode, what I don\'t get was that he becomes a chunni in the later part of his teens, let\'s not for get that in one episode he is seen being a normal middle schooler helping Tomoyo who is the chunnibyou back then, so why the sudden reversal?Hatoko Kushikawa, was a typical wife material for Andou, what I like about her.......was her being wife material, what I don\'t like about her was her being too nice to the point of being an air head.Tomoyo Kanzaki, what I like about her was that I like herb to be Andou\'s love interest and I\'m glad that she actually like him.Sayumi Takanashi, well I guess somebody has to be the older girl, who is smart and a typical  Yamato Nadeshiko which is her.Chifuyu Himeki, what can I say she serves as this lolicon material for the MC.Mirei Kudou, I can never understand why original creator Kota, Nozomi limit her to be a support character, whereas she has potential to be one of the main characters.If you look at all of them they\'re just the usual characters that would be found in any anime with a harem genre, so it\'s a 5 all the way for this part and not even the addition of Kiryu Hell Kaiser Luci-frist\'s Fallen black posses can make me change my rating for this anime.EnjoymentDespite of all the cliches, it was still funny enough to be watched, especially with the added mystery of Kiryu\'s group, so it\'s a 7 for this part.OverallI giving it a 3 cu\'z of the following:- Inconsistencies about the MC being a chunni where at one point he was seen as a normal teen and all of the sudden he becomes this obnoxious chunni in his later life.- The misrepresentation of the anime\'s title, where it should have been applied to Kiryu\'s group.-Putting all the main climax at the last episode instead, of equally distributing it within every episode.-And not including Andou\'s harem in the so called ""Fairy Wars"" where imo would have provided such intensity to the anime. with Kiryu Hellkaiser Luci-Frist\'s posse, and not with Andou\'s harem, in fact this series should be titled \'When Supernatural Beings Becomes Common Place, cu\'z that\'s what really has anime\'s plot is, and in most episode it always involve the main guy Andou and his harem. so, I\'m giving this part a 5.ArtWell, there isn\'t much fanservice involve, thought the character\'s school uniform looks good on the females it doesn\'t look good on the guys, frankly , it would have been better off if the guys would don a Gakuran instead of a red top and white trouser for the guys that makes them look sissy.

And cool is all they need to be.""Have you ever wondered how much more exciting life would be if you had a supernatural power? If you could be more than the average human being capable of all kinds of cool magical abilities, just how much more fun would your everyday life be? Fortunately, the human mind has a great imagination, and as a result many young men and women like to pretend to be their favorite superheroes in real life as a sort of make-believe persona, a condition known as chuunibyou. Inou-Battle (just going to refer to it...as such as the full name is way too damn long) follows the lives of a quartet of high-schoolers and one elementary schooler who together make up a club of just these kinds of people. However there\'s one thing that differs between this group and the ordinary chuuni characters. Their powers are actually real.As someone who absolutely loved the (original) Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai TV-series, the aspect of finally finding yet another slice of life comedy starring chuuni characters was a very thrilling idea for me. Admittedly it\'s not quite on that level comparatively, but Inou-Battle is still most certainly a very characteristic and entertaining series. Initially, the anime is very straightforward. It follows the various club members\' daily lives with crazy comedy antics which take full advantage of the chuuni setting of the characters (especially the protagonist), and delivers a very simplistic but extremely humorous and enjoyable experience.However it must be stated that while this simple premise works wonderfully, the anime does not really maintain that concept all the way throughout. Unlike what the synopsis and setting of this series may indicate, Inou-Battle actually does attempt to have a serious story, starting a couple episodes down the line. It tries to give all the characters back stories in order to help us understand them and their circumstances, and then attempts to build upon that in present time in a typical drama-like fashion. The problem is this however; while I\'m all for having more depth and character development in an anime, the fact of the matter is that there is a time and a place for everything... and honestly I don\'t think this was the right one. The story tries to bite off more than it can chew, and about halfway though, the anime turns into more and more of a stereotypical romantic harem drama fest. Now personally I don\'t actually dislike harems by any means, but in this case I can\'t help but feel it was awfully misplaced. The show goes from something simplistic, incredibly silly and non-serious to an attempt at being an emotional romantic rollercoaster every so often, but really it just ends up feeling awfully needless in my opinion. In addition to this it simultaneously tries to have some sort of grander, overarching story by introducing a bunch of rival side characters seemingly out of nowhere but it barely ever touches upon that part of the story again for real. Where did they come from? What is their purpose? I don\'t know. We never get to find out. Then it keeps going back and forth between chuuni mode on and chuuni mode off, and the overall sense of coordination starts feeling somewhat lost. Given how rare chuuni anime are to come by, I would have much preferred if it had just stuck to its roots and kept the same sort of atmosphere as the first few episodes did from start to finish. Slightly wasted potential.On to the character cast then:The protagonist of the show is the die-hard chuunibyou victim Andou Jurai who has the  power of ""Dark and Dark"" which allows him to... spawn a black, lukewarm fire in his palm... which does absolutely nothing at all. He likes to pretend it does however.Secondly, we have the redhead tsundere Kanzaki Tomoyo and her ""Closed Clock"" ability which enables her to slow down or temporarily freeze the flow of time at will.Thirdly, we have Kushikawa Hatoko, the polite, somewhat air-headed childhood friend who has the frightening power of ""Over Element"", which as the name somewhat implies allows her to have free reign over the five elements of earth, water, wind, fire and light.Coming in as number four, there\'s Takanashi Sayumi, the refined club president who wields the power of ""Root of Origins"" which enables her to return things to their original state, an ability that can heal people, repair items and similar.Last but not least, there\'s the goddess-tier loli elementary schooler Himeki Chifuyu who hangs around the high-school club solely due to being related to the club\'s adviser. Her ability is arguably the most powerful of all: ""World Create"", which as the name implies enables her to create items and surroundings out of thin air as well as portals and dimensions, and it also makes her capable of manipulating materials down to a sub-atomic level.As cool as all of that sounds however, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, these abilities are not really properly explored to their full potential. It\'s only really in the beginning that you get to see their actual capabilities, but there\'s not enough time to cover them all to their full extent. Of course the chuuni aspects and the accompanying supernatural abilities still exist throughout the rest of the anime as well and are definitely used, but not as frequently or as deeply as I would have liked, as its screen time tend to get replaced with more ordinary anime-esque love drama. Not that the drama side of Inou-Battle was actually terrible (it was fairly mediocre though), but it\'s really not what the anime should have been about at heart.The animation and sound I don\'t really have much to say about, they\'re both very average throughout. Although it\'s animated by Studio Trigger, you shouldn\'t go into this expecting it to look like anything as wacky as Kill la Kill did for example; Inou-Battle looks very much like your typical moe romcom in its art style, good enough to be pleasing to the eyes but nothing spectacular. The OP and ED are both decent, but again nothing amazing. Special shoutout to Hayami Saori though for having one of the greatest single rants I\'ve ever heard a voice actress pull off in an anime history. You\'ll know exactly what I\'m talking about when you get there.In the end, I think this anime could honestly have been one of the best moe comedies of the year, just like Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai was back in 2012. However Inou-Battle missteps somewhat along the way and for some reason tries to get away from the very thing that makes it unique just in order to make it more generic instead... which really is a shame because the show could have been something truly special if it hadn\'t. That being said, I still enjoyed the show from start to finish, just not as much nor for the same reasons in the second half as the first one. I know some people are surely going to be a lot more bothered by the sudden change in direction the series had midway than I did however, so take all this with a grain of salt. On the other hand, even with that taken into account it doesn\'t change the fact that the first few episodes were just as good as I could have hoped for them to be, and I would definitely recommend you to watch that much at least. After that, it\'s up to you to see if you like the direction the story heads in or not.Oh, and if you were wondering just how on earth everyone managed to make their chuuni abilities real in the first place... you\'ll just have to keep wondering. We may never find out. Just accept it for what it is, lean back, and try to find some enjoyment in what this little anime has to offer.

There are certainly much worse ways to spend an evening.', 'I guess it\'s my lazy nature, but I\'ve always liked ""pirates who don\'t do anything""-type shows where a cast of characters is given superpowers or what have you, and instead of saving the world, fighting crime, or at least government corruption, they just...hang out, as do the literature club members of a certain Japanese high school whose name (the school\'s) I don\'t remember.Meanwhile (SPOILER ALERT) in the background, other superpowered teens are indeed engaged in a Fate-series type magical battle whereby the winner will be able to wish for anything they desire...all for the amusement of a race of sadistic fairies who gave them these...powers simply out of boredom and curiosity. And despite the efforts of some of these battling students and the fairies to reach our protagonist, Jurai Ando, and his fellow club members and drag them into the battle royale, Ando and company still remain oblivious to it all in the end. I also like the idea of characters just escaping great danger and possible death and being completely unaware in the end.So having read about those preferences of mine, you\'re probably wondering why I haven\'t rated this higher.Because, unfortunately, from about episode 2 onward it becomes rather obvious that Inou Battle\'s primary genre is ""harem"". And if, like me, you don\'t have much use for this genre, at this point you may get a sinking feeling when you realize Ando is the only guy in the club, and the remaining females all conform to the main stereotypes of this incredibly by-the-numbers genre; the redhead tsundere (who is cast as the likely winner from about episode 3 onward) Tomoyo, the domestic-minded Yamato Nadeshiko (or ""ideal Japanese woman"") childhood friend Hatoko, the precocious loli Chifuyu (she\'s an elementary schooler, and OF COURSE she develops a crush on Ando, as well as her same-age friend Kuki. Don\'t ever change, Japan...), and the busty fujoshi/one-sama whose name escapes me now.To be fair, the characters are all still likeable. For a harem protagonist, typically one of the most hated character archetypes in anime, Ando is actually pretty cool. He revels in his chuunibyou, or youthful flights of fancy in which he spends most of his energy deciding on spell names and delivering his lines with a pronounced hammy flair, and meanwhile he doesn\'t care what the ""Muggles"" think of his behavior. Yes, all the girls he comes across still flock to him like pigeons to bread crumbs, but whereas, say, SAO\'s Kirito (the Gary Stu by which future Stus will be judged) was a flat blank slate onto which frustrated otaku could project themselves, Ando is his own person.Meanwhile Tomoyo, though still an easily riled tsundere, somewhat has her own justifications for being one, as well as some motivations in her life that (gasp!) don\'t involve Ando. And to the best of my memory, she never said to him anything like ""I-it\'s not like I l-like you or anything..."" And Hatoko, though still playing another archetype, eventually manages to break out of her shy bystander shell and try to reach out to her would-be lover. Along the way, though, she manages to command the spotlight in a five-minute (!) speech seriously questioning Ando\'s ""chuuni"" philosophy which also somewhat rattled some of us fans and our at-times similar worldviews.Unfortunately, while that speech led us to wonder if Ando might be led to start questioning his delusional lifestyle (like Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai before), by the next episode things are largely back to normal between Ando and Hatoko. Which brings me to my next point; another one of this show\'s flaws was that it had a habit of bringing up some interesting threads but then forgetting about them in favor of another harem (because Lord knows Japan just doesn\'t produce enough of those shows). It seemed like it was on the brink of becoming something special, but in the end it was just another harem, albeit with some slightly more dynamic characters. And no hot spring scene with Ando falling on the men\'s/women\'s side barrier. Though there were two, count \'em, two beach episodes and a clothes-changing scene.

This is just my opinion, if you don\'t like my review feel free to give your OWN REVIEW!2. If you are expecting a lot of superpower actions from this anime, then your hopes will be crushed like mine.3. The name has ""everydaylife"", you shouldn\'t expect action from the anime. Let me correct, actually the name is ""When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace"" I thought it might be because of superpowers where everyone fights to prove themselves. Hence, the battle becomes commonplace!Story- ~Let me ask you a question! Like other reviewers asked. What will you do if you get superpowers? Surely, You...will step out of your average life, put on a badass costume and starts helping random citizen, not like carry out your daily routine events and act like you never got any powers to begin with. Well, basically that\'s what this anime is showing us from last 12 episodes! Let me tell you the summary of all 12 episodes.-Episode 1 (This is where everyone gets power, I had really high expectations from that point)-Episode 2 (A new girl is introduced she can steal other\'s power, though she falls for Andou because of some misunderstanding and that girl has like one time appearance)-Episode 3 (this is where every girl realizes how good Andou actually is pretty nice development){now from this point on this anime takes the random route. Every girl in the club gets a fair chance to be female lead in the upcoming episodes}-Episode 4 (Chifuyu\'s turn the loli of this series)-Episode 5 ( Tomoyo\'s turn the tsundere of this series)-Episode 6 (Sayumi\'s turn the kuudere of this series)-Episode 7 (Hatoko\'s turn the perfect waifu of this series, but she gets kidnapped in the end finally a turning point of the anime)-Episode 8 ( My hopes were up again, but one of the girl that has route of origin ability recalls her at the near end of the episode and she is back like nothing happened)- Episode 9 (Back from where we started, Now this time every female has given equal amount of time and now they realize they actually love andou, even though they kicked Mirei in the 2nd episode because she falls for andou, fair enough)-Episode 10 (is your typical ecchi pool scene)-Episode 11 (is your typical beach and firework festival scenes, Did I mention? This show is about supernatural powers?)-Episode 12 (Finally, at the last episode it takes serious turn for real this time but, How can it possibly explain everything in just 1 episode of 24 minutes? So many plot holes and questions and Can you guess what andou\'s really powers his in its 2nd stage? Its amaterasu black flame from naruto just give it purple color. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT IT IS AMATERASU, the only thing that show made me watched till the end and it turns out huge disappointment. I will just delete my memories of this show and forget it even exists)Characters- I already said everything about characters, there no character\'s development or even power development. One is your typical loli, there is Tsundere, kuudere, perfect waifu. Most of all our Useless andou who is this power called ""DARK AND DARK"" which is actually a purple flame (don\'t know why it called dark then, I guess its just a gesture)Art- Needless to say anything its ""TRIGGER"", though really disappointed from Kill la Kill to this. I guess they are make money for the upcoming epic anime!Sound- meeh nothing rememberable, that gives a rewatch value. There\'s not even a single fight scene yet that gives some tensed background music. All there is medicore tunes playing randomlyEnjoyment- I re-edited my review and explained it in detail why I hate this anime. Again, this is just my review.

Loved the OP sequence, and how Andou would switch over to chuuni mode (reminded me of Lelouch and not nearly as painful/embarassing to watch like in Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai) but what really stood out and gave me the chills was Hatoko's rant in episode 7. Damn son that was some fine voice acting.The character development hit the ground running. That is to say, that you would go into episode 1 with their identities already fleshed out and we, as the viewers, would have to play catch up. Personally I like that style of portraying the characters every now and then. And once you're familiar with each character you'll be sure to love them. Especially Chifuyu. Crap I might be turning into a lolicon because of her. I really really want to write more about the characters but that would make this too long. But safe to say the main character is more badass than you would initially think and much of the fun comes from watching their interactions.I don't think I need to say more about how much I enjoyed this show. I mean, here I am writing this so I could share the fun I had with it.I've been on a bit of a marathon spree this year and have probably watched most of the titles in the top 200 or so and it got a bit boring to be honest. What I usually do when this happens is pick something from the middle of the crop to shake things up a bit and Inobato delivered. I practically finished it in one sitting and enjoyed from start to finish. Problem is it left me wanting more and unfortunately the LNs aren't translated yet. And if I had one major complaint to voice out, its that they didn't give enough screen time for Kudou!Cheers! up. Lo and behold: TTGL and Kill La Kill! *facepalm.

Waking up, putting on clothes, heading to work/university, grabbing something to eat, hanging out with friends, going on the Internet, and heading to bed sounds like a pretty normal day.And for many, this is exactly the type of life they lead, one of common, simple happenings without much excitement or action to change up the formula. There may exist dreams of something interesting occurring, but that\'s it. Wishes which exist only in fairy tales.The question is, then, what would one do if...such a dream came to fruition? *Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de* would have you believe that, honestly, nothing much would change, giving us a different little adventure with a not-so-little heart.**STORY**Inou-Battle follows Andou and the rest of the Literature Club: Chifuyu, Tomoyo, Hatoko, and Sayumi. Following a rather fantastical phenomenon, the group find that they have amazing new powers that affect matter, time, and space.As the anime progresses, it goes about the story-telling in a rather interesting way. Instead of focusing on what *should* be the more interesting aspect -- the supernatural abilities they have gained -- it instead chooses to make the cast\'s simple, everyday lives the center of attention. It\'s rather unconventional; choosing to ignore the inherently ""cool"" portion of the show when it is purposely incorporated is a strange move that, even more strangely, works.It creates a misplaced feeling of expectation that is never quite met. And by doing so, what is occurring on-screen is that much more engaging. The story can and could weave a grander tale, but it opts not to, making the story rather slice-of-life and character driven. This technique isn\'t even used just once. There exist multiple points at which Inou-Battle decides to forego the common route in favor of the more obscure one: Andou and Mirei\'s relationship and the later-introduced sub-plot come to mind. It\'s a fascinating move that contributes to the ""everyday"" feeling that the show is trying to accomplish.At its core, Inou-Battle is a romance story and, more specifically, a harem. In this regard, it performs at least well enough. Each girl is usually given her respective story and attempt to win over Andou. Either due to his personality or that girl\'s newfound understanding, the harem remains mostly intact the whole way through. Yet, there is the ""obvious"" choice among them. But once again, the show defers to its tried-and-true tactic, avoiding coming to a resolution that would bring satisfaction to one group. That is to say, it ignores the expectation and gives us the more contextually unrealistic situation.All of this serves to give us the overall theme of the anime. It is explained directly to us quite unnecessarily (or perhaps it is just one more example to the growing list): how life really doesn\'t need to have a wrench thrown into it. There are plenty of opportunities waiting out there; it just requires a bit of initiative, knowledge, and luck to find them. And when they are found, enjoy them. Relish in what they bring today, so that tomorrow even more opportunities can be discovered.**ANIMATION**Inou-Battle follows a blended style both in terms of art and animation, giving it an overall positive feel.The art style at times feels rather generic, but Trigger injects some of their own signature style for a breather. Over-the-top segments or more ""rough-and-tumble"" frames give it a weird mixture of both well-done set-pieces and ""badly"" designed caricatures.The character designs have their own flair, with distinct hair designs, differing outfits, and a certain simpleness to their eyes and faces. They are each appealing in their own ways, making them a welcome addition to anime.The animation receives the same treatment from Trigger as the art style did. It is above average in nature, with plenty of moments to showcase quick or crisp character movements and the use of their otherworldly skills.**CHARACTERS**The cast of Inou-Battle are fairly stereotypical, but actually contain a surprising amount of depth. Instead of elaborating on the characters, the anime chooses to make each of the girl\'s relationship with Andou the focal point. Everyone has their chance and background looked at, providing the audience with more to the cast than is first given credit.Actually an elementary school student, Chifuyu is a little girl who enjoys participating in the extra curricular activities of the high school\'s Literature Club. Adorable, small, and constantly clinging to her stuffed animal (""Lissun""), she is very smart for her age but still unable to cope with the emotions she feels. Dubbed ""World Create,"" she can manifest anything into existence, be it other dimensions or transitional portals. It\'s pretty evident how much she\'ll never win Andou\'s heart, but their relationship is one of mutual protection. That is, neither wants to see the other get hurt, physically or mentally. But when it comes to matters of love, there is always a chance.Sayumi is the eldest in the group, having a great physique, good grades, and holding a strange intolerance for being deemed cute. Her outwardly cool and calm demeanor hides a rather fragile young woman looking to have her feelings returned to her. Her code-name is ""Root of Origin,"" due to her being able to return anything to a previous state. While she tries to get Andou\'s attention, she never seems have it go her way. And that\'s fine, because sometimes relationships don\'t need to go beyond anything more than friendship.As the childhood friend, Hatoko already has a hard hurdle to overcome. Somewhat slow, she usually tends to go with the flow. Her inability to really say what she wants prevents her from obtaining the kind of connection she wishes to have with Andou. She is ""Over-Element,"" having the capability to manipulate the various elements of the world itself. While she may wish to be the one Andou calls girlfriend, he instead places her in a different light. Love has many different shapes and sizes, and Hatoko proves this through and through.Of all the girls, Tomoyo seems to be the destined victor. Easily flustered and with a particular prettiness and charm, she most easily connects with Andou due to her closet-chuunibyou ways (""chuunibyou"" is a term referring to ""8th-grade middle school syndrome,"" where imagination is often replaced with reality). Known as ""Closed Clock,"" she is able to manipulate the very fabric of time itself. It\'s not easy being in love, and even harder knowing that one is. She may think otherwise, but there is no denying the feelings she has for ""Dark and Dark.""In an interesting move, the anime actually includes a very clever piece of characterization. The superpowers that each person receives seem completely random in nature, but that is far from the case. In fact, they each obtained their powers based on what they were missing or needing in regards to their relationship with Andou.Chifuyu is the lost cause, literally needing anything and everything to come out on top; for Sayumi, she is essentially ""friend-zoned,"" warranting her the need to *reset* her relationship with Andou from the ground-up; like a towering tsunami, an exploding volcano, or a ravaging tornado, Hatoko needs to make her passion, her *emotions*, more tumultuous because of her always-reserved nature; and despite being the leader, Tomoyo requires all the time in the world to understand what her heart-of-hearts is telling her.Even Andou\'s ability holds a deeper meaning: his power does nothing because he requires nothing in regards to himself. He understands where he comes from, who he is, and what he wants to be.**SOUND**I really like the beginning part of the OP, and the repeat of it during the middle of the piece. The song is pretty ""pop-y,"" with a nice set of vocals and catchy background beat. The ending ""ahhh-ahh"" also provides a nice finish to the track overall.The ED is quick and fun, with a good mix of guitar and drums. The final portion, with the stuttering of the music and vocals, sends it off with a cute little finish.The soundtrack contains suitable pieces for the scenes involved, with piano tracks for the more sad or dramatic parts or more mysterious ambient tones for tenser situations. Nothing is extremely notable, but the music plays its part.As for voice-acting, everyone involved performs above average. Saori Hayami as Hatoko goes above and beyond, with a stellar moment during the anime that definitely leaves an impression on those who watch it.**ENJOYMENT**Being the romance man that I am, this was a joy to follow. All of the girls involved are cute or beautiful in their own way, so watching them struggle to get Andou to love them, with dates to the pool or their embarrassment from him complimenting their outfits was enough to make me smile. I really wanted Tomoyo to step her game up, but that was more me being frustrated that she wasn\'t able to come to terms with how she really felt. But watching her blush and overly-defend herself every chance she could get made it at least worthwhile in the long-run.As many people may know, I\'m a fan of chuunibyou antics. Listening to Andou\'s ridiculously long-winded speeches or seeing Tomoyo and the other girls take part in a fun imaginative get-together was always good for a laugh. And the show contains many other comedy bits as well, usually revolving around Andou and his quirky personality. But the girls do have their comedic moments, again mostly due in part to their relationship with Andou.Lastly, when the cast are going about using their powers, it\'s pretty awesome to see. Chifuyu being able to walk through walls, Tomoyo being given the right to stop time, and Andou\'s ""spectacular"" flames made these portions of the show great to see, due to the varying ways in which their abilities were used or overlapped.Going through this anime at first, I wasn\'t wholly impressed. But behind Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de\'s chuunibyou, supernatural moves, and hilarity lies a smart story filled with a cast of interesting characters. Everyday life may seem boring, but as this one proves, there\'s a lot more to it than meets the eye.**SUMMARY**Story: Good, dodges expectations to tackle its themes wellAnimation: Good, nice detail with Trigger\'s signature styleCharacters: Great, everyone involved is given clever characterizationSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice VA workEnjoyment: Good, chuunibyou, comedy, and romance are known to workFinal Score: 8/10 such a dream came to fruition? *Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de* would have you believe that, honestly, nothing much would change, giving us a different little adventure with a not-so-little heart.**STORY**Inou-Battle follows Andou and the rest of the Literature Club: Chifuyu, Tomoyo, Hatoko, and Sayumi.

Andou July, is super kind guy that had chuniibyou (google it) problem, nothing much I can say about this character since there's nothing to talk about him.Heroine - Tomoyo is one of the heroince in Inou Battle, he falls for the protagonist because they share the same problem, there's not much to tell about this character.Heroine- Sayumi and Chifuyu, A big boobed and a loli, both of them had the same circumstance, they fall in love with the protagonist because the protagonist care deeply about themKudou -

Sure, it isn’t bad, but it’s not exactly original either. Let’s break things down:The premise is pretty poorly set up. On the surface it looks simple – you basically have five club members (plus Mirei, I guess, lol, so six people total?) who gain some pretty awesome superpowers. But are these powers used half the time? Nope. Thus, their powers seem more like a gimmick...– in other words, the powers are just there just for the sake of making the show interesting – and serve no real significant purpose for most of the show. (And how do they even get their powers…?)Another big downside to this show is how new characters and other plot elements were introduced. A good example of this is Episode 8. I’m going to try to refrain from spoiling anything, but if you pay attention to this episode, it spews (yes, emphasis on spew) a boatload of new characters and supernatural elements without fully explaining what is going on. Many questions still remained unanswered by the end of the show.What about the plot? Well InoBato is your basic generic harem, so don’t really expect anything deep or meaningful. Most of the romance, as with other harems, is pretty forced. Chifuyu’s romance came straight out of left field; meanwhile, Sayumi was being forced along by a side character we don’t even care about. Hatoko and Tomoyo aren’t as bad but even they sometimes come off as a little off (if you were like me, you’d say something like “That’s a really lame thing to argue about”). Also, the romance doesn’t even kick in until the last few episodes… talk about forcing the plot along…(And then you have Mirei who’s gone for a good chunk of time after her little tidbit in the first two episodes, which is really too bad, I feel like she could have contributed so much more to the show.)One good thing, however: there were a couple of episodes where the show clarified Jurai’s relationship with each of the girls (i.e. how does he know them, what significance he is to them, etc.) that made up a little bit for the lack of character development throughout the show.Tl;drStory: 2Art: 4Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 5Overall: 3Pros:- Mediocre plot execution (as a whole), but it was still relatively easy to follow along- Relationships clearly established among Jurai and the others- Decent sound + voice acting, especially in eps. 11 & 12Cons:- Characters are not fully flushed out in terms of development- Personalities are drawn from very stereotypical anime archetypes- Use of gimmicks = poor premise- New plot elements poorly embedded into the show- Forced romance, it doesn’t even factor into the show until the last few episodes- Transitioning is sporadic (e.g. episode 11, 12)P.S. Jurai stop being a Mr. Nice Guy and leading people on lol – in other words, the powers are just there just for the sake of making the show interesting – and serve no real significant purpose for most of the show.

The ability to be able to fly freely or be able to lift something 10x your weight has been a fascination for many kids, and even some adults.  But what happens when you ACTUALLY get superpowers, hmm?  How would you react?Story (6.99/10):  The story of Inou-Battle follows the story of the literature club, five individuals that one day, get exposed by a flash of light, each of them ending up with a special power, each one different from the last.  Now,...with these special powers, the literature club must now cope with their newfound abilities in their ordinary lives.Describing Inou\'s storyline in and of itself is a bit of an interesting thing to witness because compared to a normal superpower show, this one doesn\'t really utilize the character\'s perspective superpowers all that much.  In fact, there are even some episodes that don\'t even mention or show the superpowers at all.  This comes with a mix between pros and cons with the series, a mix that is both of equal parties.Pros:The series does follow a slice of life style of storytelling.  It follows the lives of these five individuals and just generally how they live life.  One thing that Inou does well in, is character exploration.  All four of the girls featured do get a bit of backstory for each perspective girl (some more than others) and give each of them a little bit more depth to all of them as a whole.  It\'s not a terrible amount, but it is some.In addition, the show puts some realism to the idea of the characters\' superpowers.  While the show for the most part is comedic with the Chuunibyou lead, Andou being our main focus for comedic acts and memorable moments, Inou does delve into the idea of what it would be like to have superpowers in real life, not only focusing on the cool stuff you could do like mastering the elements like the Avatar, creating whatever you want out of thin air, or control time (to an extent), but about what kind of dark and inverse effects it could have on other people.  On occasion, the show does make note of what kind of sinister effects have powers can have, which does add a nice twist to what would otherwise be a generic story.Cons:While the story does have some nice elements to it, there are some very glaring and obvious flaws to the story.  One of the biggest ones happens at the 75% way mark of the series.  In this point in time, the story takes a drastic turn, creating an explanation for how the powers came to be and how people in this world obtain them.  Personally, I feel as if this explanation is unnecessary.  The reason why is due to the fact that the way the show tried to explain the way people got their powers was horrendously incomplete.  You don\'t really get the whole story as to why these powers exist and the whole explanation is rather incomplete and really beats down on the show\'s quality because of how little explanation you get when this show gives you this backstory.In addition, transitions from one scene to another is some select scenes can be somewhat awkward to watch.  They\'re not overly glaring, but they do exist.Overall though, the show as a whole has a decent story for it.  There are some good points to it, but there are some very obvious points about it that hinder the show as a whole.  As for a story ending, there really isn\'t any sort of satisfying resolution aside from ""established harem.""  It doesn\'t really have a completely satisfying end, and I\'m a little sad for that.Overview:+  Good take on the superpower genre+  Decent character development-   Unnecessary and under explained backstory-  Unsatisfying endCharacters (7.00/10):  The characters for this show vary quite a bit, becoming a mixed bag that doesn\'t really quite work out.First is Andou Jurei, our main protagonist.  Andou is a bit of an interesting character because he\'s essentially a male Takanashi Rikka, infected with Chuunibyou.  Being very ecstatic about being a Chuuni and referencing his dark powers on a near constant basis, Andou is very quick to make reference about his ""dark power"" just like a normal Chuuni.  Andou is an interesting character because he doesn\'t really have all too much going on for him.  We get some semblance for his backstory and he does have some interesting traits about him, but apart from that, he\'s really just a generic harem protagonist as he doesn\'t see the girls around him crushing on him and he\'s just mostly really nice.And then we have the four harem girls of the series.  Hatoko, Tomoyo, Chifuyu, and Sayumi.  All four of these girls, like Andou, have a special power that they were granted without word or warning.  In the series, all four of them get their own time with Andou, giving each of them a bit of character depth to them, making them more than just generic harem girls.  However, they dn\'t really change all that much in terms personality or as characters.  The depth that each of them receive is more or less a backstory to their character and how they are towards Andou.  They\'re all decent characters, but in the end of the day, they really are just harem girls.In addition, there\'s one girl that does also drag down the series as well, and that is the character Kudou Mirei.  What really bothered me in this series is the fact that this specific character isn\'t really used all that much.  She\'s a character that was featured heavily in the first few episodes, as well as the last couple.  Aside from that, she\'s basically non-existent.  The reason why I felt that this character was handled unfairly is because she technically is a harem girl and functions similarly to the other girls in the series, having both a special power and a crush on Andou.  She\'s even featured in both the opening and ending songs, leading one to believe that she is an official harem girl.  I felt sad seeing that we didn\'t really see so much of her because seeing more of her could\'ve made a little more impact to the story because she posed as a character that was an outsider in a similar situation.Aside from these characters, the side characters come in a wide variety of characters, that you barely see.  To be quite honest here, the amount of side characters that you see here compared to the amount of time you actually see them is a lot to none.  They don\'t really serve any purpose aside from building onto the dysfunctional and incomplete backstory for the idea of how people get superpowers, which in and of itself isn\'t thoroughly explained.Overview:+/-  Somewhat decent main cast-   Lost potential with unused character-   Unneeded supporting castArt and Sound (7.79/10 and 7.00/10 ):  The show was produced by Studio Trigger, the same Studio that made the ever popular Kill la kill.  The show definitely is made in a nice looking and quality art-style, mostly using a somewhat moe artsyle in order to exhibit the characters, using a lighter gradient color scheme.  The animation is definitely done rather nicely.  There aren\'t any jarring moments in the series, and nothing in the series is particularly done wrong.The music of the series is a group of decent tracks.  There aren\'t things I would particularly say are fantastic about it aside from its upbeat nature and cheery tones.  There\'re nice tracks to listen too, but they\'re not particularly memorable.Overview:+  Nice looking art+  Decent soundtrackPersonal Enjoyment (8.00/10): Regardless of all of the flaws, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de was a rather enjoyable show to watch.  There was still a lot of nice parts about it that I enjoyed.  There were nice tension moments between the characters that you don\'t ordinarily see in a lot of anime.Did I like this anime?There were a lot of nice parts about the anime that made it a lot better than I expected.  There were a lot of moments in the anime that featured some really good character tension which was a huge plus in the series.  In addition, they put a little bit of realism of the pros and cons of having superpowers, which gave a lot more depth to the idea and had characters cope with their newfound abilities, thus giving them more depth.What didn\'t I like about the anime?The anime still at the bottom line, played out as a generic harem, which is something I personally would like to not see considering that harems that don\'t follow the generic harem formula tend to be more better quality than the ones that do.  In addition, the explanation for why the powers exist (Aka the great fairy war) makes basically no sense because it wasn\'t explored beyond maybe one episode and you don\'t really understand fully as to why things are the way they are.  The audience follows the lives of the five main characters, it doesn\'t follow the makings of whatever the hell is going on behind the scenes, which is a major flaw for the series because it introduces an idea to the audience, while holding back because we as the audience, know jack about what is going on by the end of it.Would I recommend this show?There are some flaws to the series, some very, very major ones.  But overall, the series isn\'t too belittled by its mistakes.  It still manages to be a very enjoyable show, and while the characters aren\'t too insanely well developed, they still do have a decent amount of depth to them that make them interesting to a degree.  If you want to watch a show that takes a different take on the idea of superpower genre, as well as a decently above average harem show, then this is worth the watch.Overall Score: 7.30/10 with these special powers, the literature club must now cope with their newfound abilities in their ordinary lives.Describing Inou\'s storyline in and of itself is a bit of an interesting thing to witness because compared to a normal superpower show, this one doesn\'t really utilize the character\'s perspective superpowers all that much.

If you want to watch a show that takes a different take on the idea of superpower genre, as well as a decently above average harem show, then this is worth the watch.Overall Score: 7.30/10', ""“Kanzaki Tomoyo, can you swear with certainty to God that superpowers don’t exist in our world?” So asks Andou Jurai of his friend Tomoyo, after she chastises him for pretending that superpowers actually exist. As Andou continues ranting about probabilities, another character sighs that there’s nothing worse than a defiant chuuni. Moments later, everyone watches in shock as a bright light appears in the room, and black flames erupt from Andou’s right hand.This opening scene sets the table for the rest of Inou-Battle, a supernatural harem comedy adapted from Kota Nozumi’s light novel series. The mysterious light leaves each of the five main...characters with a different superpower. The four girls, who also fill common harem archetypes, get the sort of powers schoolkids at recess always dream of having. The tsundere can slow or stop time, the team mom can heal and restore things, the childhood friend can manipulate the elements, and the loli can create matter out of nothing.Then there’s Andou, whose power looks flashy and cool but is completely useless. His “Dark and Dark” flames (as he names them) aren’t even hot enough to burn anything, but he loves them anyway just because it means his dream of having superpowers has come true. Andou is the heart and soul of the series, a character whose goofy enthusiasm and defiant chuuni attitude carry Inou-Battle through many of its best and funniest moments. Refreshingly, he is also a rare male harem lead who pays attention to the thoughts and feelings of his female friends and isn’t a pervert.  He’s also a good listener and surprisingly insightful sometimes.The dual nature of Andou, his flashy but useless power and the goofiness that masks his best qualities, really sums up the whole series. Most of the time, Inou-Battle is smart and fun. Despite the setup, one of the running jokes is that the cast rarely need to use their powers for anything besides goofing off, because there’s nothing for them to fight. So for most of the series the “battle” part is pushed off to the side, while superpower-enhanced slice-of-life and harem comedy hijinks take center stage. The comedy can be very clever, and many common genre tropes, from loli fetishes to mistaken love confessions, are lampshaded and parodied to the hilt. Novice anime fans may not get all the jokes, but veterans will smile and laugh knowingly.One of the things that makes Inou-Battle slightly frustrating, though, is that there are times when it teases greatness, going beyond the bounds of the harem comedy (or mocking it), to give us scenes that actually have something important to say. Unfortunately none of those scenes are followed up or explored further in any meaningful way, and each time things soon go back to the status quo. It seems like the writers, like their main character, are afraid of saying too much; they keep getting spooked and retreating back to safe ground again, like Andou retreating back to the chuuni persona that he’s most comfortable using to express his feelings.As for the “battle” part itself, there actually is a larger world out there where other people have powers and really are fighting battles; unfortunately these scenes mostly come late in the series and get crammed in at odd moments, disrupting the flow of the narrative. So what could have been an interesting parallel background story if it had been better integrated from the start of the series ends up being little more than an unwelcome distraction instead.Visually, Inou-Battle is decent. Although this is a Trigger series, their signature visual style is downplayed quite a bit in favor of a more standard-looking comedy show. It's not unpleasant to watch by any means, but compared to the best animation that came out this season, it's pretty ordinary. The OST is fairly anonymous, but the opening and ending songs are both catchy enough that I've found myself humming them occasionally. The voice cast, on the other hand, is very good; my favorites were Nobuhiko Okamoto as Andou, Haruka Yamazaki as Tomoyo, and especially Saori Hayami as Hatoko; the latter has one signature scene in particular that will be remembered for a long time.Inou-Battle is at its best when it’s being a harem comedy for anime fans who don’t take harem comedies too seriously. It helps that all five of the main characters are quite likeable and intelligent, and they actually know how to talk to each other when a conflict arises, like real people. I’m not normally a fan of harem shows, but I enjoyed this series. It could have been much better, especially if it hadn’t messed up the secondary plotline, but overall it’s still good, and at least worth streaming if you think it might appeal to you. If Inou-Battle ever gets a second season, I will gladly watch more of these kids and their everyday lives. characters with a different superpower.

Think of the endless fun you\'ll be having when you can spew out black flames out of your hands or freeze time. While Inou-Battle certainly gave us ideas to how we could potentially use powers, I\'m almost certain half of earths population would die in a matter of days thinking all of us could become Goku. With that said, the show was not what I expected it to be. I listed it off as a  shounen with fights around every corner, but what do I get instead? I get a surprisingly laid back almost...slice of life, if you disregard the powers, show with some interesting points.Story(7/10): When the English translation of Inou-Battle was ""When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace,"" I immediately became readied for a lot of fighting scenes. The show delivered about two to three which lasted about five minutes... After watching more episodes I dropped the idea of constant fighting and completely did a reset on my mindset of the show. The story is laid back and isn\'t really focusing about them having superpowers. It\'s more like I said, a slice of life where their everyday things as teenagers affect them like friendship and romance. The story doesn\'t  pick up the pace about them having powers until near the end where the purpose of their powers are revealed. I\'m going to give the story a bit of leniency because it has the potential to grow. The first season is almost like the introduction, where not much is happening, but a great deal is being made to explain what\'s going to happen.Characters(6/10): The characters were an interesting bunch, even though at the start of the first episode you automatically knew all of them would fall for the Main Character. That\'s also where the show shows off the little drama it possesses. When a number of  female leads fall for the main character, it usually doesn\'t start off well. There\'s going to be some that deny it, and some would explicitly state that they love him. While that could potentially lead to jealousy and broken friendships, they handle it out maturely. Now on to the Main Character, Andou. He\'s typically not what you\'d expect from a high school student that still has chuunibyou. He\'s cunning, tactical, and mature when it counts. He calmly assessed their situation when they first got their powers, and ultimately kept everyone from losing their heads. While in a chuuni standpoint, he\'d want to use his powers as much as possible, but he doesn\'t let fiction and reality affect him. He knows that there are boundaries which they should never tread on and that\'s the biggest surprise for me in this show. Characters like Tomoyo, Hatoko, Chifuyu, and Sayumi are just there to be in Andou\'s harem. They aren\'t given a really important role to the story other than they have powers. You could call them useful because they\'re the reason why Andou is level headed about their situation and they\'re the reason how Andou is as a character, but that\'s about it. Other characters such as their potential enemies in the future aren\'t really given much screen time, so saying something about them while blind isn\'t really much help.Art/Sound(8/10): The art is really charming, it wouldn\'t work if the anime was going to be a fight fest between characters. It works as it is because how laid back the show really is. The colors are vibrant and cheer, which makes sense due to the shows true nature. Truthfully, I don\'t remember the sound much at all. It either blended in too well with the voice acting, or nothing really made an impression. However, even when I didn\'t notice it, the show wasn\'t handicapped by it. The overall steady pace the show was going didn\'t really need an amazing OST to leave an impression.Enjoyment(7/10): While at first I had a different mindset when coming in to watch Inou-Battle, I ultimately learned I had to be flexible with the show and use the term ""Don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover."" I mostly enjoyed how Andou solves everything and acts as a balance for the rest of the main cast. It also could be funny at times seeing as how Andou can still use his chunni ways to solve problems, but they\'re well thought out for something that is suppose to be fictional.Overall(7/10): The title could mislead a lot of people who want to try this show. They could be coming in with a totally different mindset and end up getting disappointed. My advice is to be flexible with the show. Unless you\'re really craving something that requires heavy fighting with lots of battles, then don\'t even touch this. If not, then I suggest you give this show a chance. It\'s a good way to bend a slice of life to where it\'s not so serious, but it still gives off that feeling when handling everyday life. slice of life, if you disregard the powers, show with some interesting points.Story(7/10): When the English translation of Inou-Battle was ""When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace,"" I immediately became readied for a lot of fighting scenes.

It\'s a good way to bend a slice of life to where it\'s not so serious, but it still gives off that feeling when handling everyday life.', 'Studio Trigger, the group who brought us Kill La Kill and Inferno Cop return with a more lighthearted comedy, Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, or When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace. (A mouthful, so I\'m going to call it Inou Battle or WSBBC for short for the remainder of this review.)This show, while maybe billed as harem, is a fun little Slice of Life (SOL) comedy effort, which is an adaptation of the light novel series by the same name. This adaptation is a first for Trigger, who has previously produced originals, however, this show retains their signature feel for incredible comedic timing and...adds their personal touch to the source material without bending the story.If you were expecting Kill La Kill 2 given the name ""Supernatural Battles"" and the Trigger logo slapped on this little prize, you\'re barking up the wrong tree. That said, let their reputation not be a hindrance to the enjoyability of this show, it is a quality product.Story: 7A group of high school kids, along with their elementary school friend discover one day that they have superpowers..but little do they know that they are a smaller part of a much larger scene. The powers don\'t take the center stage so much as the lives of the characters, and their relationships. This story focuses on their lives: as friends, club members, having crushes, love pentangles, and comedic antics. Inou Battle is SOL through and through, and it hits the mark just fine on that count.*There are a couple of unresolved plot points by the end, but I attribute that to being left open to a new season/OVAArt: 8The show is well animated, and character design is good and fairly consistent. I found the show to be very crisp looking, and it\'s fairly vibrant, color wise. The humorous asides (characters butting in onscreen, giant angry heads, embarrassment shown in the form of a humorous death gag) are very Trigger, and accentuate the comedy.Sound: 7Nothing special here. BGM is a playful tune, or some light piano. Voice acting is competent, and sells the characters well. *a highlight is an impressive rant one of the characters goes on late in the series*Characters: 8Enter the Literature Club, Andou, Tomoyo, Hatoko, Sayumi, and honorary member, 4th grader Chifuyu.Andou, who is hopelessly afflicted by Chuunibyou, (term for middle school syndrome, pretending one has a mystical power, with a personality to go with it) is our MC, and is a goofy, but caring person, and typically serves up a lot of comic relief with his Chuuni antics. Andou sometimes has moments of lucidity, where he gives insightful and introspective advice to his friends, and shows that he actually is a real person underneath his Chuuni persona. This being a romance/comedy, he\'s also the object of the affections of his female Literature Club members.Tomoyo, our first girl, is of the tsundere persuasion. She has her insecurities, and among them is a hilarious flashback scene from her middle school past, a highlight for her of the show. She\'s a typically serious character who\'s a bit prone to overreacting and being self conscious.Hatoko, lady number two is our lovably well meaning airhead. She doesn\'t always get the joke, and part of the fun for us are the misconceptions and awkward situations that arise therefrom.Sayumi, who is the Literature Club President and resident Judo blackbelt is our tough, take-no-crap protagonist. Andou\'s chuuni antics typically invoke a ""cut it out or I\'ll knock you out"" death glare from Sayumi, and on several critical occasions, her scary serious side comes out to save the day. Suffice to say, the silent, strong type.Lastly, we come to little Chifuyu. Chifuyu arguably has the most ridiculously overpowered ability of the group, and is absolutely the most unassuming. A 4th grader, she gets involved with the other kids because her aunt, a teacher of the other\'s, is too lazy to take her home, so she stays to play at the school. Chifuyu is keenly aware of Andou\'s Chuunibyou, and takes every opportunity to mercilessly chastise him about it.Enjoyment: 9This show brought back some nostalgic feelings about middle school/early high school romance, which really made the humor resonate with me. I laughed at a lot of the romance awkwardness, as it reminded me so much of my own life in days past.Overall: 8The title of the show is a great tongue in cheek reference to the story within. There are Supernatural Battles Within the Everyday (or Usual Daze), but the focus is less on on the battles and powers, and more on the everyday, SOL element. It\'s a bit of a jab at the magical girl trope, while still fulfilling what it set out to be. It\'s not pretentious, and it doesn\'t pretend to be what it isn\'t. adds their personal touch to the source material without bending the story.If you were expecting Kill La Kill 2 given the name ""Supernatural Battles"" and the Trigger logo slapped on this little prize, you\'re barking up the wrong tree.

The thing is, when combining multiple genres that usually don\'t go so well together, you either get something amazing like Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (SoL+RomCom) or JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure (Adventure+Horror+Comedy), either you get the pile on wank that is InoBato.Story : 3/10As I said before, combining genres is a hard thing to do. Due to the complete failure of InoBato, the story has an enormous amount of plot holes, undeveloped characters, shitty RomCom transmissions, and Plot Armour, a lot of Plot Armour.[Potential spoilers]Due to the failure of the combination, at...episode 8 you get thrown a bunch of new terms and characters, clearly showing that the show was rushed as hell. The show never explains what ""F"" is, or how the ""Fairy Wars"" started, or about the rule that when you die with a super power you just become a normal human and lose memory. See? That\'s the problem with combining. You have a 12 episode show that needs to develop characters, have Harem, RomCom and SoL at the same time.The ""well done"" parts aren\'t even good too. The RomCom is cringy, even though the show clearly spent 8/12 episodes on it.  [Potential spoilers] You just have characters fall in love, and you have no idea why. The only ok relationship was Tomoyo, as she was developped through out the entire show.Art : 8/10I like the art style quite a bit. It\'s not the best looking anime, but it\'s not bad either.Sound : 8/10Well, voice acting was on point, thanks to the amazing voice actors. The opening is catchy.Character : 3/10Alright let\'s see. I did make a checklist for this. Tsundere? check. Deredere? check. Loli? check. Kuudere? check. Stone Wall? check. ""Hey if our show is bad might as well appeal using other ways"" is most probably what the directors thought.As I mentioned before, characters lack of development. The entire ""antagonist"" group, even though they are not really antagonists, but hey, I have no idea who the good guys are, were never explained. The characters are fine up until episode 6-7, but then the mark nosedives to 3/10.Enjoyment : 1/10The only reason I watched this show, is because I had nothing better to do on the plane. I was very close to dropping it. In all honesty, it\'s not good.Overall : 3/10The show had a good start, but thanks to all the reasons I wrote about above, it turned into shit pretty quickly. I would not recommend it.P.S : I have noticed something. This might be a bit farfetched, but I think the show/the light novel took quite a bit of inspiration from JoJo\'s and Touhou. The power names, the things the powers do, all seem to familiar. Fairy Wars is not a name you can hear often, and I have no idea why that name was chosen. Also some characters resemble some Touhou characters too. Sayumi  looks exactly like Utsuho Reiuji, and some other character share resemblances.

Though it never come as a main theme, at least several well-known series has a side character who is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou has rather vague theme, where involving it may betray with the character itself. But there is a good series that can overcame that obstacle, named Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai. After its success, we get another Chuunibyou main theme series this Fall 2014, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (InoBato).Inobato tells the story of four high school students plus an elementary school children gathered at a club and then one day, they get...supernatural powers. But, what good is this power if there is no problem that needs to be solved with it? This series tells about the daily activities of that ‘special’ children. Oh, did I tell that one of that children is Chuunibyou? It’s interesting to follow how the Chuunibyou’s reaction get their dream come true.The existence of the premise of ordinary people with superpowers is the strength of this series. This premise is also used well during the first episode and strengthen the premise of the story. In addition, the background story of each character is also interesting and do not deviate from the initial premise. I liked how the story has quite good pace to be followed, not fast nor too slow. However, the presence of war in this series somewhat weakens the story. This is due to the absence of further explanation of the background of the war itself. I can understand this because the series is adapted from the light novel. But, in the absence of this explanation makes me hope for a second season of this series to explain further about this.The addition of the genre from romance to the harem slightly weaken the already strong premise. I can accept the existence of romance in this series, but harem theme in this series does not make me sympathy. Maybe it's because of my resentment towards harem theme itself, but it feels the harem doesn’t make any good to the story. In addition, it also weakens some character trait that is from the beginning has been generic. Fortunately, this harem theme does not appear in every episode.Inobato has a line of generic characters. It is good enough to further strengthen the premise of the ordinary people. Although classified as generic, the character trait of this series is quite strong. The interaction between the characters is quite interesting, also bring their own entertainment. Unfortunately, there is no character development in this series except for the background story of one of the characters if my memory serves me right.One thing that you could not forget, a babble in an episode of one of the characters in this series, Kushikawa Hatoko. I appreciate it because it is very powerful babble that strong enough to be able to raise the status of the character of the side characters become the main character.Regarding art, I love the character design in this series. Though it might not be unique, it’s lovely to see the girls’ design. It’s a pity that Andou Jurai’s (the MC) design is plain, unlike the girls’. Another note is Studio Trigger made a good job about the animation. Though the design and story aren’t Trigger-like, Trigger studio bring their own style to the animation, like skipping frame battle animation and old style animation. I love how they bring the comedic scene and how every battle scene goes with their animation style.The OP and ED songs itself is quite good, though not the best. I’ve never skipped even once their OP and ED because of the atmosphere it brings is suitable to the series. The background sound has no impact for me, I don’t think you will miss it if there are no background sound there.As you watch this series, you might find yourself wondering how this series could come from a studio like Trigger. Though it’s not like they do a bad job, it isn’t their best form. But, in a different approach, I find that Inobato is a quite nice series. It has a great story, a decent characters, and quite good art though the lack of good background sound not made it best. But still, I would recommend this series to you who love slice of life with some romance.Thanks for reading my review! supernatural powers.

While there are several different types of this ""disorder,"" the most common among anime characters is the Evil Eye chuunibyou, where one believes that they have special powers or special connections to the supernatural world. While this type of character has been around for a while, their popularity has exploded over the last few years, especially with the premiere of Kyoto Animation\'s Love, Chuunibyou, & Other Delusions, and the possibilities for this character archetype are multiplying rapidly. For example, what would happen if the...chuunibyou in question, as well as some of his friends, ended up getting actual superpowers?Taking place in the standard Japanese high school setting, our story focuses on Jurai Andou and his friends in the Literature Club. On a seemingly ordinary day, Andou and the others are suddenly granted strange and fantastic superpowers. Normally this would be an automatic setup for some kind of superhero story line about saving the world, but Andou and his friends don\'t seem to be interested in that at all, as they\'d much rather use their powers in secret to have fun amongst themselves. From there, the story unfolds with the everyday lives of these students as they interact with each other and learn more about their powers.The fact that they don\'t end up taking your standard superhero route ends up being a huge strength of the series. It almost reminds me of a more lighthearted version of the movie Chronicle. Not every kid is gonna want to immediately go out and be a superhero. Some of them might just want to mess around a bit, and that\'s what a good portion of the series is about. Unfortunately, the slower parts of the series were the ones where they introduced an overarching story line. There are a ton of other characters with superpowers in the background, and there\'s some kind of war going on, and it all gets really generic and convoluted. It\'s really weird how this series made five kids sitting in a club room more interesting than a looming war of supernatural powers.That being said, the moments where it is just the main characters messing around are really enjoyable to watch. It\'s a big ball of fluffy, lighthearted fun with tons of laughs to be had. The humor of this series is spot on for the majority of its run time, with a lot of chuunibyou-related jokes thrown in everywhere. There are also quite a few serious moments in the show as well, and their lead-ins never feel forced or unnatural because they blend so well with the comedy, though sometimes the series is purposely jarring in tone for added effect. This brings us to episode 7, which might be one of my favorite episodes from any anime I\'ve watched this season because it just completely shreds all of the fantastical elements surrounding the chuunibyou archetype and slams it headfirst into a wall of realism, showing us what it\'s like for people on the outside to try and interact with this character on an emotional level.However, this isn\'t just a comedy series, as there is a very prominent ""romance"" label attached to this anime that soon evolves into a full-on ""harem"" label. While the harem elements are very light and nontraditional until the last few episodes, I would still call it a traditional harem despite the fact that there\'s actually very little fan service in this series. I should note as well that it\'s very rare for something other than a visual novel adaptation to have truly effective dramatic elements as part of its harem, and Supernatural Battles pulls off these moments surprisingly well. Unfortunately, much like other traditional harems, there is no conclusive ending yet, so I can\'t really give it any true praise until Andou actually makes a choice, so hopefully some additional seasons are on the horizon.The characters initially seem very generic and standard at first. Andou is the full-on chuuni, Tomoyo is the tsundere, Hatoko is the childhood friend, Sayumi is the club president, and Chifuyu is the loli. However, as the story progresses, each of these characters has their own individual quirks and secrets that make them stand out from their usual stereotypes and turn them into much more interesting characters, with Tomoyo and Hatoko getting a rather excessive amount of focus. Unfortunately, we end up not getting as much information about how they feel about their own powers as I would have liked, so we don\'t really get to see how this might have changed them in some way.The animation was produced by Studio Trigger of Kill la Kill fame, which is really odd considering that Trigger is known for purposefully breaking the mold of typical anime. The character designs are fairly generic, but still manage to be very appealing, while backdrops don\'t seem to do anything other than just exist. As for movement animation, Trigger\'s style of being purposefully low-budget can be seen practically everywhere, and I\'m still not sure if this is a good thing or not. Purposefully making animation look sloppy still makes it sloppy, but they end up doing it in ways that actually works well with some of the comedic timing. As for the action and superpower scenes, they\'re relatively solid, but certainly nothing impressive.There is no dub for this series yet, and I imagine it will probably stay that way, as the series is currently unlicensed. I feel that this one works better without a dub anyway, especially considering how much chuunibyou language is used throughout it.The soundtrack was composed by Elements Garden, and I\'m not gonna lie: this is probably one of the most annoying soundtracks I\'ve heard in a while. It\'s not so much the fact that everything is super generic, which it is, but some of the musical cues felt very jarring and out of place. There was one particularly intense track that was unbelievably over-dramatic and kept getting worse and worse in its execution as the series went on. The opening theme ""OVERLAPPERS"" was performed by the four lead voice actresses of the series, while the ending theme ""You Gotta Love Me!"" was performed by Kato*Fuku, and both tracks provide incredible catchy J-pop tunes that are certainly worth a few listens.Overall, while it did have quite a few elements that made it stands out from its genre peers, When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace still suffers from a few misplaced ideas and the lack of a proper soundtrack. chuunibyou in question, as well as some of his friends, ended up getting actual superpowers?Taking place in the standard Japanese high school setting, our story focuses on Jurai Andou and his friends in the Literature Club.

Well, they\'d probably just keep being normal people.  In fact, the ""supernatural"" aspect of this show play little to no actual role.  Remove the powers and it\'s still a highschool romcom.  But it\'s a really good highschool romcom with a likeable main character, even if he is romantically oblivious like every other harem lead.I\'m not going to bother giving a summary of the plot, because there barely is one, but I can say that I did not expect to enjoy the show...as much as a I did.  I\'m a firm believer that when the credits roll and the show finishes and I still want more, the show deserves a good score in my book.  This show ended with me begging for more because it does exactly what every good SOL romcom should do: focus on the characters.The characters do, ultimately fall into tired cliches, eg. Loli, tsundere, childhood friend, maturity-chan.  But they\'re all great, multi-dimensional characters and I enjoyed every one of them.  In the end, they\'re all best girl, and in a show like this that\'s the best possible outcome.  The MC isn\'t an idiot, he\'s actually got some redeeming qualities that would realistically make women fall for him unlike so many harem leads.  And if you\'re not careful you\'ll be going gay for him so watch out.Overall, the show gets  a 9.  Sure, the plot was weak, but it\'s a subversive show.  It\'s meant to showcase a different side of the classic superpowered action show, and it\'s supposed to subvert your expectations of what your normal high school students would do if suddenly granted powers.  The art was good, I love Trigger\'s animation style, and the sound was phenomenal.  In the end, the characters are lovable and left me with an empty feeling when the show finished.  That\'s a 9/10 in my book.  If you\'re looking for something to watch, I\'d 100% suggest this show, even if you normally don\'t like slice of life romcoms set in a high school.  It\'s a mixed bag with a little something for everyone! as much as a I did.

It\'s a mixed bag with a little something for everyone!', 'Man, was I wrong judging this anime by its first episode. Studio Trigger knows its ways to make this anime enjoyable for me to watch.InoBato, shorten name for this long title, revolves around the lives of a literature club. One day, Andou, the only male student in the club and ‘suffers’ from chuunibyou, suddenly gained a superpower on his own. Few months later, the rest of the club got their own superpowers, yet they didn’t know how they really obtained them. However, you won’t be seeing they finding out more about their powers, and that can disappoint you a lot. This story shows their ‘everyday...life’ as a student with superpower.Okay, maybe this isn’t a slice of life where there’s no actual story. While there’s no main objective to drive the story forward, each episode (or two) tells its own story. Some episodes focus mainly on Andou and one of the characters. The rest pieces up what’s left to pick up. I was really impressed over what has been showing after the first episode, but the overall story isn’t an masterpiece or an eye-opener. The comedy in it is alright. There are some funny moments in the story, mainly from characters’ interaction. Andou’s chuunibyou may have been the highlight. There’s also romance in the story. The development isn’t very much, and it isn’t like two-way. In fact, all of the members in the club love Andou. Time and time again, no way will we see one of them girls winning the Andou bowl. In the end, it went to simple harem. And as usual, romance can lead to a bit of drama in the story. It’s good that it doesn’t grab hold over the story, so a little surprise is lovely.One problem about the story is having a new set of characters introduced with an entirely different subplot for no apparent reason in the middle of the story. It messes up and it can be forgettable. In the end, nothing much to see about them since there’s very little development. I see little relation between the two groups, the Literature club and the other, but they fall over this superpower thing.The girls in the Literature club are generic. There’s the tsundere red-haired Tomoyo, polite air-headed Hatoko, calm president Sayumi and cute elementary-school student Chifuyu. Each of them have their own defined powers that help out in certain ways in the story, at least no one is being left out. It’s a good thing that there are not so static as they show different kinds of emotions. However, they are not too dynamic since they did nothing much in different out of their character. I love to watch Andou’s way of thinking. He may have chuunibyou, but he didn’t overuse it and whenever he talks to each of the girls alone, he is calm and understanding. He has a way of words to make the girls feel happy. He’s a cool person to interact to. Of course, he has a useless superpower and we can laugh off over that.Each of the girls have some character development thanks to Andou himself. I don’t have anything to say about it in-depth. Also, remember this ‘new set of characters’ I mentioned. Unfortunately, due to them introduced in the later part of the story, it’s hard to see much development in them because of little screen-time. I feel they are just wasted.The art of InoBato is nothing different out of other similar anime. The sceneries are nice-looking and the atmosphere around them are lively, depending on the scenes portraying. The character designs are adorable and sweet, although it is still as similar to some anime. Some of the characters wear battle costumes which look cool as well. Facial expressions are well done, telling the audience how the characters feel. I like the visual effects of battles taking place between characters using their superpowers, although those aren’t really that important and not having the impact in the story.The opening song, sang by the voice actresses of the four girls, is calm and somewhat catchy. I like it maybe because of the instrumental. It may not feel like what is supposed to portray the anime, and it may be too ‘dramatic’ but hearing this many times is pleasing. The ending has a different take over the opening song. Sang by Emiri Katou and Fukuhara Kaori who also voice-acted as supporting characters, it is more energetic and catchy to listen. No complaints about both songs, but it does not stand out much over the rest of the anime this season.Background music isn’t very noticeable, so it’s hard to recall something memorable with its usage over the scenes used. The voice acting is great, but I have my utmost respects to Hayami Saori, who voiced Hatoko. If you haven’t known already, there’s one episode which impressed a lot of the audience with one long tearful rant. Brilliant acting indeed.Overall, InoBato is one interesting anime to watch, despite its generic setting. I enjoyed as much as how I enjoyed watching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, although it had a better story and flow. One of the charms of the anime is not having excess fan-service. It may not be for everyone since the story doesn’t impress them. When I watched the first episode, I was expecting something better.

It may not be for everyone since the story doesn’t impress them. When I watched the first episode, I was expecting something better. And looking at the title, you wonder ‘are there even battles happening’. Sad to say, battles are never a focus in the series.', 'When it comes to the definition and execution of something being ""generic"" or ""cliché"", there are certain qualities in a show that people automatically expect. For example, perhaps the characters aren\'t that deep, or the setting and story are overused. When it comes to ""Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de"" (sadly translated to English as ""When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace""), the label of ""generic with a little bit of flair at times"" can be sufficiently given.Our story sets up with an average harem, in a general setting (high school -- surprise!). The members of the schools Literature Club are meeting, and before we know...it, are bestowed with superpowers (which leads to the first episode having quite a bit of action). Now, based on the title, first episode, and even some of the scenes the show\'s OP, you might think this is a supernatural-battle action show. Wrong. We follow around these characters and witness their (usually funny) interactions with each other now that they suddenly have magical powers (that are rather generic in themselves). The show starts off with a light tone, and as it progresses tries to take itself more seriously by introducing darker ideas and characters, often ending later episodes with darker cliff-hangers. However, the episode following never fails to return to its roots of lightheartedness, with only a minor nod to the seriousness that had transpired just moments before. In the end, this awkward, unbalanced toss back and forth between slice-of-life and darker action gives the show either a feeling of not knowing where it wants to go, or an inability to take risks and venture out of the ""comfort zone"" that it has already established. The ending (no spoilers) leaves tons of unanswered questions, and stops the show abruptly. You don\'t get a feeling of satisfaction or conclusion, and that leaves a bad taste -- at least in my mouth.Characterization is vital for slice-of-life shows -- you need to feel connected with the characters in order to really understand their motivations behind how they act and why. Though they are molded around cliché archetypes, the main cast brings through enough emotion and authenticity to understand what they\'re going through. While the characters themselves aren\'t particularly deep, we do see some development to keep us engaged between them all, especially on the part of Hatoko. Jurai is your typical male harem protagonist, who suffers from ""chunni"" syndrome. While this quality in him makes the first few episodes amusing, it quickly feels overused (because that\'s all were really given to go off of for him) until he somewhat forms a connection with Tomoyo regarding it in later episodes of the series. Speaking of, Tomoyo is -- surprise -- the generic tsundere, but her ability to be easily embarrassed (instead of just abusing everyone around her) somewhat makes up for it. Hatoko, at least in my opinion, is the only character that really gets fully developed with an interesting personality. Her inner-conflict regarding her feelings for Jurai (which aren\'t as fully explained or developed) really drive her forward, showing us beyond the quiet and cheerful demeanor she\'s almost always portrayed to have. While I feel like her actions at the end of the series aren\'t totally in character, it felt as though she were the most... human. In regards to Sayumi, there really isn\'t that much to say, because, well... she doesn\'t say much. At all. Chifuyu is your loli that is cute. Really, that\'s it. That\'s her role. So, in short: The generally get the job done, but albeit Hatoko, there\'s nothing more to them.The animation department pays nice attention to detail at times. While the work itself isn\'t stunning or phenomenal by any means, it puts-out at above-average quality. Some of the character designs were nice. Sound-wise, the OP and ED are both catchy and alright. The OST, aside for one or two tracks, is forgettable. The voice acting does its job, but I wouldn\'t say it really deepens or changes these already lack-luster characters.Due to the lack of a focused story and trope-following characters, I can\'t say I particularly enjoyed watching ""Inou Battle."" There wasn\'t anything really good about it that made it stand out, and felt somewhat misshapen and thrown-together in terms of Episodic Value. Had there been more character development (since that\'s what really drives slice-of-life shows), it could have at least been a little more bearable and fun to watch.""Inou Battle"" is built on generic characters and an unbalanced story.

But i made the fatal mistake of reading reviews before i went into it, which i rarely do and almost always i end up disappointed not only by the anime itself but by the reviewers themselves and if we were talking amateur reviewers that would be fine(i\'m used to easily impressed people by now) but to think that pro reviewers were singing praises like this...was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ..You can read any review in here and not give a single fuck but big sites play by other rules altogether and from what i\'ve seen so far the rules seem to be to favor certain genres and the rest of them get shit from top to bottom. I always hated that in the music magazines, when for example Iron Maiden released an album, no matter how bad it was, the reviewers would lick their asses until they were squeaky clean cause of course they would..Cause they\'re fucking Maiden and the name only strikes fear into hearts of men..This seems to be out of place but to link it back to this anime when a big studio such as Trigger releases any anime apart from a small percentage of ""fans"" the rest are having actual orgasms leaving a trail of fluids like snails do on the floor.For better or worse my allegiance is to the medium itself not the studios that make them, even the best of them are bound to fuck up in any shape or form. Like this studio made Darling in the Franxx and Kill la Kill among others..Certainly not the best animes by any standards but nevertheless animes that are still talked about even to this day. As for this one i\'m not really sure it\'s gonna be remembered even after 10 mins after you are done watching it. Hell i finished it this morning and by noon i had to resort to my notes to write this review.WSBBC has a school club setting(cause all anime do these days) and most of it takes place there. The male lead, whose name i can\'t be bothered to remember, apparently has some case of 8th grade syndrome and thinks he has super powers and where have i seen that before?.....And seen before is the rest of the cast which consists of 4 girls, whose names can be found in the internet somewhere, and they are submitted to his antics on a daily basis until some shit goes down and one day they all gain powers beyond their wildest dreams....Apart from the harem king who only produces a black flame that can\'t even heat some tea..So basically everyone gets the good stuff and he got shit, which some people find very funny indeed...Certainly the writer did find it funny AF and his standards of funny can only impress those with IQ with ""-"" in front of it...And for 2/3 of this anime we just witness the daily lives of these kids as they go on to fight crime with their newfound powers.....Or do they?And this is the start of my problems with this one..Cause their powers are rarely mentioned or shown in the span of the first 8 eps. A case can be made that it doesn\'t follow in the tracks of most shows of this genre and true that as it may be for me personally the time they spent showing absolutely nothing could be used in a more productive way..But no here what you get is 8 eps full of establshing the male lead\'s harem and what do you know....Of course among the high schoolers there is also an elementary kid who for some reason hangs out with them and also develops the hots for our main lead..And this being a harem the male lead doesn\'t seem to get that every girl around him gets all hot in their underpants about him..Fortunately most of the bad traits of harem animes are not a pert of this one so kudos?But in these eps they get some development right Dion? Nope not even close..They all do get some flashbacks of their time with our MC as there are the necessary ""girls arc eps"" but that\'s as far as their development goes. They don\'t move even an inch of their established role as harem girls..No semblance of character advancement whatsoever, they just wait their turn for something to happen and fall in loive with the MC..So like any other harem then. As for the MC he is 80% harem lead and 20% likable..That 20% of him being somewhat serious, funny and most of all not a hairy pussy like most male leads really took me by surprise but mind you that\'s not saying much since it\'s like finding a 0.2 gram gold nugget in a lake of shit.Another problem with this anime is that by episode 8 it takes a drastic turn altogether. It\'s like they were on a mushroom trip and when it ended they picked up from where they thought they left off. Basically they tried to explain this late into the anime how these powers came to be, something about a fairy war and also we got introduced to some other group with superpowers who are part of this war.....Who these people are or what role do they play is a mystery..Are they friends of the main cast or foes? Don\'t know and i don\'t think whoever wrote this crap cared enough for me to know either, cause most of the time they seem to act in a friendly manner and then they became the antagonists and then back again?!If this explanation of mine seemed half assed trust me it\'s not my fault for not being eloquent enough to word it properly but the anime\'s fault for doing a speedy half assed job of explaining things..This is why i said that all these eps spent showing us harem shit could be better utilised to actually paint the strory in a much better way. From that point on there is a back and forth between the usual formula and serious plot points up to the last 2 eps where for some reason we change gears AGAIN and if the finale gave us some form of closure i would be totally fine with that but with no closure and no 2nd season in sight the ending was disappointing to say the least..Imagine going out with the girl of your dreams, going to a hotel only to find out that she pees standing up.....Nough said.WSBBC falls into this category i have mentioned tons of times before where an anime wants to be many things at once but fails in all of them spectacularly. It wants to be a romcom SOL,it wants to be school club anime, it wants to be harem, it wants to be serious and comedic at the same time, it wants to have superpowers and secret wars and factions etc. I can\'t blame solely the studio for that though as an anime can be as good as its\' source material and when the material at hand is a mess of mixed genres they did what they could...I mean when even the writer doesn\'t know where he wants his creation to go...In its\' defense it wasn\'t all bad. Sure it had its\' good moments and i had some fun watching it and the animation was good enough to be watchable but ultimately it failed to take advantage of every good aspect to focus on inane things for most of the show and as such i can\'t reccomend this to anyone..If you do want to watch it go ahead and make your own assumptions but don\'t say i didn\'t warn ya. was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ..You can read any review in here and not give a single fuck but big sites play by other rules altogether and from what i\'ve seen so far the rules seem to be to favor certain genres and the rest of them get shit from top to bottom.

From that point on there is a back and forth between the usual formula and serious plot points up to the last 2 eps where for some reason we change gears AGAIN and if the finale gave us some form of closure i would be totally fine with that but with no closure and no 2nd season in sight the ending was disappointing to say the least..Imagine going out with the girl of your dreams, going to a hotel only to find out that she pees standing up.....Nough said.WSBBC falls into this category i have mentioned tons of times before where an anime wants to be many things at once but fails in all of them spectacularly. It wants to be a romcom SOL,it wants to be school club anime, it wants to be harem, it wants to be serious and comedic at the same time, it wants to have superpowers and secret wars and factions etc. I can\'t blame solely the studio for that though as an anime can be as good as its\' source material and when the material at hand is a mess of mixed genres they did what they could...I mean when even the writer doesn\'t know where he wants his creation to go...In its\' defense it wasn\'t all bad. Sure it had its\' good moments and i had some fun watching it and the animation was good enough to be watchable but ultimately it failed to take advantage of every good aspect to focus on inane things for most of the show and as such i can\'t reccomend this to anyone..If you do want to watch it go ahead and make your own assumptions but don\'t say i didn\'t warn ya.', ""This is a Harem everybody should be clear on that. The fact they have supernatural powers just gives them another reason where they can just play around with. Well at least for most of this series.

Even though it may seem like it  the characters having supernatural powers does add new light.Also the damm powers where did they get it form??How did they get it??The show does shed some light a very small cheap pocket flash light of a light. and that is the most interesting part of the whole series that mild action that this show gave raised up my rating from a 5/6 to a solid 7Character:Andou jurai is a chunni and the girls put up with his condition seeing their chemistry is great. The MC is definitely has a key personality of the anime where as in other animes it is concentrated heavily on the females. The females have a good contrast with each other which makes you want to root for every each one of them.Overall the anime was a very fun anime as I do like to watch harems but not the same scenarios over and over which this tried to be original and sor of worked.As a Harem it was okay at best as a supernatural show with them working together it has potential to be a brilliant series. which he calls Dark and Dark.Story:The story is a not just a harem which we've all seen before.

It is a mix of comedy, romance, slice of life, supernatural, harem, ecchi and action. So try not to be deceived by its cute anime art style. What I've enjoyed about this anime is the progressing story that takes its time to develop...and doesn't rush into the good parts like some anime.

The first half of the series tells slice-of-life stories with a superpowered twist. However, after the first few...episodes, the series shifts focus from superpowered antics in daily life to almost straight up slice-of-life romantic comedy, and even though it somewhat squanders its fascinating concept, the development given to the characters is rather excellent. While I wish that it have balanced both elements, the heavier focus on the characters made me genuinely care about each one.*Characterization: 8.0/10-* Inou-Battle uses the harem aspect of multiple girls vying for the affection of one guy better than most other harems because it gives specific attention to each individual girl and her story, while providing ample reason for why the girls are interested in the main male protagonist, in this case, Jurai Andō.Andō himself is chuunibyou, roughly translating to ""Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome."" Chuunibyou generally refers to someone who has delusions that they have magical powers or are someone of great importance, although there are many different varieties of chuunibyou. Andō pretends to have special powers trapped within his hand, and eventually, he does receive a power, albeit a seemingly useless one. However, his previously useless knowledge of what are the morally right and wrong ways to use certain powers that come from reading manga, light novels, ect, is what makes him incredibly useful to the club.As for the girls, each one is surprisingly fleshed out with moments of unexpected emotion. Of course it is nowhere as powerful as top notch drama anime, but for a comedy harem, it will surprise you.*Overall: 7.9/10-* Providing you have the correct expectations going in, Inou-Battle is fun, pleasant, and often sweet anime that uses the harem concept to further develop the characters. Sure, it might not be the over-the-top madness fest that Kill la Kill was, but it is a well executed comedy drama that desperately needs another season. episodes, the series shifts focus from superpowered antics in daily life to almost straight up slice-of-life romantic comedy, and even though it somewhat squanders its fascinating concept, the development given to the characters is rather excellent.

One of the main reasons I get angry towards this anime is from the title alone. The English title for this anime is “When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace”. When I and 90% of people who watched this anime saw the title, we were expecting an action-packed anime full of battles that show off supernatural powers. Instead, I got an extremely forced and cliche harem anime that uses the powers as a gimmick rather than a necessary plot point. I’m willing to bet that this anime...would be exactly the same with or without supernatural powers, which is incredibly disappointing.******WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD******WHAT I LIKED:This anime starts on a high note with episode 1. Episode 1 does a decent job of introducing the characters and their respective powers. We also get to see some supernatural battles, which unfortunately is one of the only times we ever get to see a supernatural battle in an anime called “When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace”.The sound design for the most part was good. It may not have been memorable, but it was pretty good for setting the tone. The art also was fairly good. It was fairly bland looking but it wasn’t physically painful to look atWHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:The romance. For an anime that focused a lot on the romance and harem aspect, it does not do a good job at it. The romance doesn’t feel natural (you could even say it felt supernatural) and as a result, I couldn’t connect with the characters as well as it wanted me to. Here’s what I think about the main 5 characters:Hatoko: Her character is essentially the dumb girl that wants to get closer to Jurai, but feels like she can’t. In episode 7, she yells at him for not being able to understand him. This scene lasted for 2.5 minutes. It’s pretty sad that her whole character revolves around her not being too bright. I literally can’t think of any other character trait for her other than dumb. The rant scene in episode 7 was supposed to make me feel sympathetic towards her, but it honestly made her more unlikeable.Chifuyu: She’s a loli.Tomoyo: She’s the least likeable character out of the entire anime. The way she talks to Jurai and interacts with him almost always conflicts with how she feels towards him. She’s a tsundere, but not a likeable one. An unlikeable tsundere is never a good thing, especially in an anime like this. The way she expects Jurai to understand her feelings despite not having the foresight to express her feelings makes her infuriating.Sayumi: She’s the most forgettable character out of the four despite being the most likeable which is ironic. I don’t really have much to say about her.Jurai: This is yet another harem anime where the main character is oblivious to the other characters’ feelings towards him. I guess it makes sense in context to the anime, but that didn’t take away how annoying it came across. Speaking of annoying, this anime really likes to give Jurai a hard time. When superpowers are brought up, the characters have to consistently remind us that his power is useless and they constantly make fun of him because of it. I get that this was supposed to come across as funny, but in reality it came across as annoying. (Although to be fair, I don’t like when any show unfairly treats one of the main characters for comedy).The second half of the anime introduces a boatload of new characters without any warning. Seriously, they just throw 10+ new characters at you and expect you to care about what’s going on. It was like I was watching an entirely new anime. This could’ve been done a lot better if we got more information on the reasoning behind the supernatural powers. I was insanely bored while watching these new characters talk because I had little clue on what was being said. It felt very rushed and forced. To sum it up, it was confusing, unnecessary, and annoying.All in all, this anime was disappointing and infuriating. I never want to watch this again. I had some fairly high expectations going into it, but then I got this, After the first half of the anime, it got pretty boring honestly. Even the final battle wasn’t very entertaining to me after I had to sit through the other episodes. I do not recommend this anime to anyone unless they want to make themselves angry for some reason.In summary:Story: 2/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Characters: 1/10Enjoyment: 4/10Overall: 3/10 would be exactly the same with or without supernatural powers, which is incredibly disappointing.******WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD******WHAT I LIKED:This anime starts on a high note with episode 1.

Speaking, of which the story is simple on its surface but it is actually pretty deep. This is more about about the characters interacting...and trying to live just a normal life rather doing some epic stuff and saving the world. Speaking of those characters, they are hillarious.

The word battle, it means in the everyday school life of the characters. The story is light, simple, and funny. The author able to portray the harem I think because without Andou Jurai the four heroines are nothing. And Jurai is the one who carries the group. The downside of the anime is it does not portray any action battles even the character's own powers. Although, they have those powers it only uses in everyday life. That's where the problem lies since possessing a power without villains is useless.The art is good and cute,...especially Chifuyu Himeki but the design of Andou Jurai in the story is common. I've seen the face of the guy anywhere. The sound of opening and ending even the seiyuu is good. The way the character of Andou would exclaim his right hand is funny, even mentioning the names of the powers, it's like your in the middle of class then shouting nonsense.

Because the presentation of this anime is supernatural good.Okay there are some kids who get super powers which are actually overpowered. And there is this goofy chuunibyou who has the lamest flame there is (it isn’t even hot). Yet he is obsessed over it, because it is his power. The geography of the battles are satisfying to watch as they are built up logically and the way power are used are just neat. The only downside is, there are just 3 battles and that’s it. But the anime...strong suit isn’t the battles at all.Andou is not your typical chuunibyou. He acts all that way and he as all the traits of a chuuni, but what made me fall in love with him is his deeper side. Inside of him lies a man at heart. He has the capabilities to watch further than dreams alone. His masculine side of him is what shines brighter than his flame. The way he thinks about others is simply refreshing to see (even for such an old anime). While this anime also involves a bit of romance Andou doesn’t have the typical tropes of that embarrassed mc who can’t handle his emotions/a girl. He is a well balanced character who steals the showHatako is your lovely airhead. While she has a personality of a green person, calm, collected, easygoing and kind, she has such a good presentation. While I like the airhead in general, we got to see a piece on her mind. That gave such a different dimension to her and the anime. We get to see a resolve, which is followed up and pushed through.Tomoyo is your red tsundere. Just like a tomato, sweet and sour. She has like other series side character dreams she wants to follow, but she also has personality. While she is a tsundere, it is perfectly balanced with common sense and well built conversations. We got to see her support others or struggle through something else.Chifuyu is your cute sweet loli. She is not only there as fanservice factor, but she actually gets some character development. Together with her friend Kuki a.k.a coockie we get to see a more serious loli rather than a generic one.Sayumi feels for me as the most flat character. While it is clear that she is more of a bookworm with some quirks, her personality doesn’t fit as well in this anime as the others. I got the say she got hair fangs and that is more than enough.Mirei is best girl, she deserved better.This anime is set up as character driven story with its own mini arcs to progress a character and their information. The way it is set up is genius. There are actually two sides. There is, without the knowledge of Andou and his friends, a fairy war going on (yes the outer space species) which grant people the powers. This arc coexisting besides the girls their arcs is rather interesting and gives the extra edge of world building. The follow up on the actions and the pre-event scenes fit in nice and seamlessly in the main story.While there is a harem tag, the focus on love is secondary as character development is done first. I like it better this way, because the typical tropes of a harem anime are left out and we got the only the best part left with some supernatural as extra.The conversations when Andou is serious are what is best of this anime.With a misleading synopsis, tags and titles this anime surprised me in a good and pleasant way.

If you like rather good character building and some well placed humor, this is your anime.', '*Possible Spoilers...?*It takes a while to get used to the fact that the superpowers are actually a minor focus (for the main cast at least) of the show, but if ""Love, Chunnibyou and Other Things"" is among the best when it comes to addressing the Chunny issues in a world where powers don\'t exist, then this one is the same but in a world where powers DO exist.In short, if you came for the superpowers, I expect you to either drop or stay for the characters instead...I suspect that things MIGHT get a little more serious past this season\'s stopping point, but to be honest,...I hope they won\'t: this show won me over precisely because it didn\'t go down like your generic fantasy animes of the season, which I suspect this story might borderline if it gets too serious.

Well in my case, I do want to have it, heck I’m still doing some chuunibyo-thing although not in extreme ways but, it still fun doing things like that once in a while.You might expect some crazy powerful superpower or intense battle with super villain in this anime, but in Inou Battle, it turns out to be different...than other supernatural anime series. You can say this anime is not about defeat some villain or watching boss fight, instead showing us a daily life group of students who has superpowers and try to act like normal person. Despite having the story tells us different perspective about having superpower; the character development also playing a big role as the story progress through in each episode.Unlike Gatchaman who has a power and responsibility to protect people, Andou and his friends need to hide their power since the powers itself are destructive means more burden than responsibility since they need to get through daily life within and out school. What I like about Inou Battle is not something like seeing some amazing superpower, but to be understand the name or aliases given by Andou since he is chuunibyo and having great sense of naming each of superpowers are one of his forte.Although our main protagonist does not resemble some other strong characters that we usually see in other generic MC, his other strong points really do show some worthy aspect which saves his friends when they meet some adversaries. Also, the interactions between each character are also one of my favorites in this series. It has some sort of SNAFU-vibe, and some of the scene does portray in real life relationship which you can say, it gives impact that might give you some thinking like episode 7.In my opinion, Studio Trigger did a decent job for quality of animation. It’s not too extravagant but they keep it in low profile although I do expecting some high quality animation since the theme was supernatural. The OST didn’t have much impact in this series although I kind a like the OP and ED.Verdict:Inou Battle is a good anime that has some good genre that you might want to watch. I didn’t expecting it become this good since it not in my main list in Fall 2014, but I’m glad that I have finished it. Also the other strong points are the VA of the series itself. They do have really a great job in portraying in each characters especially Hayami Saori, I can assure you, that’s not your everyday VA doing an amazing job immersing the character itself since you need a lot of experience to become like that.

Honestly, it's not often a show comes along that captivates an audience so thoroughly that one can't help but rewind and re-watch the same scene over and over again.This is rather surprising as I typically don't enjoy anime that contain little to no story line and a massive lack of character development. That being said, the way the cast interacts with one another, the animation, and adult humour left me wanting for much much more.I won't spoil this for anyone who has yet to...watch it, but will encourage you to sit through all twelve episodes; I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Watching this is like going into a burger place expecting some okayish burgers, and finding out they make some really good tacos. Most of the plot of the show would be exactly the same if there were no superpowers. The main character's power does not allow him to fight at all. It's a rom-com with some funny, but not super original characters. If anything, the show's big selling point is probably that it's a rom-com with much less annoying versions of our favorite archetypes that don't feel like the characters were simply strewn together. There's an actual connection...between them, and it's a great show about friendships.Characters 9/10 - MC: Yuuta Togashi is the better chunnibyou MC. He's a more dynamic and interesting character. Tsundere: She's a fairly layered character with an interesting connection to the MC, and isn't violent towards him. Kuudere: She's a more boring, less cute, and less psychopathic version of Satori Tamaba. Oujodere: Very cool. Classic oujodere. A more boring but less whiny version of Utaha Kasumigaoka. Main loli: Cute, but lacking in a lot of personality. Side loli: Bubbly but doesn't get enough screen time.Overall, the characters aren't super original or interesting themselves. They all have 2-4 main personality traits that drive them as characters and the author is consistent with them. Where the characters shine is not as standalone but in their relationships.Story: 6/10 - The story isn't terribly interesting, and isn't delved into a lot.

The character arcs/relationships arcs are the most interesting part of the story, as opposed to a somewhat classic plot-driven story. It teeters on the edge between being a slice of life, and a thriller.Overall: 8/10 - A lot of it has been done before, and the title is misleading, but where the show shines carries it really hard: The relationships between the characters. If there was more focus on the dynamics between the main cast that don't involve the MC directly, I'd have rated it higher, but it primarily focuses on MC-to-character interactions or group interactions. The other great thing about the show is that the writers don't do weird baits to drag out the story, where they tease a confession or some other major plot event, and then have some really convenient interruption that prevents it, and the whole scene turns out to be filler. between them, and it's a great show about friendships.Characters 9/10 - MC: Yuuta Togashi is the better chunnibyou MC.

I was almost able to do so but the level of condescending attitudes between all the main female characters towards the one male character made me drop it. If they weren't so darn condescending towards him I may have been able to watch it, but when an anime makes me yell a sentence with an obscenity in it at my computer screen towards multiple main characters it's time to quit. If you dislike severely condescending characters don't even think about watching this, if you love them, this...is the one for you. is the one for you."", '(first review pls dont hurt me)When I think of Inou-Battle, one specific number pops into my head. 7. Exactly 7. Nothing more, nothing less. The MOST 7 anime I have ever watched. Is that good, is that bad, and what does that even mean. Keep on reading to find that out, I guess.Story: 7The overall story in Inou Battle was pleasant, but nothing groundbreaking. To sum all of it up, it is a supernatural slice of life type anime, somewhat similar to Charlotte. The story is fairly lighthearted, but if you are looking for a show with loads of substance, Inou Battle would probably...leave you craving more. However, the show can get fairly deep and personal, and when it does happen it doesnt feel out of place. Like I said, the story is pleasant as a whole. There is a point where I thought it would follow the tracks of Charlotte and derail itself within the last few episodes, but it didnt affect the story as much as I thought it would have.Art & Sound: 7I consider these two factors to be very similar in an anime like this. The art and sound are just good. Really, honestly, just pretty solid as a whole. Vivid colors, decent soundtrack, all of that jazz. It was made in 2014, so you can expect it. It\'s not like these factors are particularly notable and exponentially boost the show, but they are fine.Characters: 7The characters, like many other things in this show, are good. I originally thought the male MC was going to be awful, but he actually ended up as very tolerable and likable (sort of). The side characters really shone through as well, as none of the four main ""love"" interests felt shallow or disposable, they each had their own somewhat unique effect on the show. They werent too deep, but they were substantial enough.Enjoyment: 7Now I guess you can see why I call this a true 7 anime. I genuinely thought everything was good about Inou-Battle. There wasnt anything that particularly annoyed me (despite the MC for the first couple of episodes), and I really want to say that everything fell into place very well. However, even through there really wasnt anything ""wrong"" with the show, there also wasnt a particular factor that stood out as superb, or anywhere near it. I would compare Inou-Battle to a burger from Five Guys. Is it a damn good burger? Absolutely. If I wanted another burger, would I go to Five Guys? Yeah, sure! But was it the best burger I have ever had? No, not even close. All together, Inou-Battle was just a good wholesome experience through and through, and I definitely enjoyed it. leave you craving more.

If I could explain this anime very shortly, I would say, ""f(x)=cos(x)"" on a graph. It starts off pretty well, but then it dips to the point of torture, but then it rises up pretty high, only to fall on its ass once again. Firstly, the synopsis isn\'t really what it is. It\'s about 75% of what it really is. The other 25% is about a fucking fairy war that is happening at the moment and nobody knows about it, only to be introduced in ep 8 and then forgotten about until it comes back in ep...12. Huh? Then it focused on a love/harem story with the main character, and remember,one of the girls is a MIDDLE SCHOOLER... Either focus on the love aspect of this anime, or the war. Please not both. So I don\'t believe this should be a 12 ep anime; it should be a 24 ep anime. There is so much more to cover and I think they\'re just milking it for season 2. Nonetheless, this is just my opinion, and if you think you would enjoy something like this, go ahead and watch it.- Spacecraft555 UwU 12. Huh?

The anime is really episodic in the half end, the main story is actually only competition of the girls winning jurai love. Really ? I expect something more comedic or entertaining about club activity. But they prioritise romance drama over thing i expect above.And they bring something called 'war' or some shit that actually not the story....Visual 6The art is ok, but so much fail drawing and animation on the half end of the anime that really noticeableVoice sfx bgm ost 6The VA is good enough, but not consistent at some point, especially about Jurai. The SFX is only on some comedic and chuunibyo things. I didnt notice about any bgm in this. OP and ED is nothing special. Its gonna be good if they improce about the sfx and bgm.Character 4This a romance drama anime in the end. So all the development is only make the viewers choose who is the best heroine.But seriously, thats nothing important about them beside the background story and their past. They really show us who and what actually he/she are. And they make Jurai is one sided, self insert and perfect person for all the girls like really ? Girls really want Jurai's deekEnjoyment and directing 4Yeah, this is actually a love drama about who get Jurai love. Theres nothing interesting about supernatural power or some shit. Nothing really special about the chuunibyo things. They just put all development about the girls and this anime is changed to a hatem building anime. Good job.This is a harem romance drama anime.

Then there are the opposing forces that are trying to get their powers and some who are trying to protect them. Just how do they get these powers well that’s still a mystery, but it begins during a Literature Club meeting, the four club members—along with their faculty adviser's niece—suddenly find themselves with supernatural powers. Now capable of fabricating black flames, resident chuunibyou Jurai Andou is the most ecstatic about their new abilities; unfortunately, his own is only for show....Moreover, he is completely outclassed by those around him: fellow club member Tomoyo Kanzaki manipulates time, Jurai's childhood friend Hatoko Kushikawa wields control over the five elements, club president Sayumi Takanashi can repair both inanimate objects and living things, and their adviser's niece Chifuyu Himeki is able to create objects out of thin air. Even thought they have these totally wicked abilities they don’t do much with them, they pretty much act like regular high school students and just hang out.~Art~ 7The animation in this was beautiful don’t get me wrong but, there were moments when the animation did not match up with what the character was saying. Other than that and it being a typical high school building background for most of it, the animation was not too bad.~Sound~ 7.8Opening song: 8I think that the opening song was cute and catchy and I really liked the beat of itEnding song: 7Its upbeat and its sort of catchy but I'm not as fond of it as I am the opening song mainly because of the lyrics.Voice acting: 8Everyone fit well with their characters and I enjoyed how they all sounded together as a group. Sometimes you find that you like voice actor and how they sound individually but in this case they all sounded very good together~Character~ 8I like the characters and found them to be an entertaining bunch. Although they didn’t really change much, other than the gaining of superpowers, they pretty much stayed the same. Mind you that is just my view. I'm sure you could say that Tomoyo changes because she becomes a bit more open about her dreams and they all change, spoiler warning, they all fall for the main male character Jurai, even little chifuyu.~Enjoyment~ 9Even though it’s a typical anime that involves super powers I found it to be an interesting anime. It had a lot of good laughs in it and moments where even I was like oh my gosh Jurai just stop talking. It had me laughing so hard that I had to pause the anime so that I didn’t miss anything.~Overall~ 8.2I would recommend this to anyone who likes dramatics and weird superpowers, or even if you just want to laugh at a drama queen boy.

This is my first one, and it might show. But Inou-Battle is a show whose flaws need to be pointed out direly.This anime is a Comedy Slice of Life Harem. Don\'t confuse it with an action one based on the ""Supernatual"" tag.When I first heard about the show, I was intruiged. A group of high-schoolers suddenly getting superpowers! Neat, right? Yeah, it would be neat, if anyone actually used their powers.If I recall correctly there were two, maybe three memorable instances throughout the entire anime where the main characters used their powers.Which would be...fine -- if anything else that happened actually was interesting.The anime presents itself with a sense of urgency and grandeur at the start, but doesn\'t actually deliver any of it.Instead it focuses itself on exploring the connectiosn between the main characters, with random ""literature club"" activities sprinkles throughout.This works well at first, but simply ends up with every single female character, unsurprisingly, falling in love with the main character.In a later episode, something resembling a plot appears. Additional characters, a kind of explanation, something that actually has to do with the titular Inou battles!!... However, even this ""plot"" doesn\'t last long. The romance takes over again, and is only once more interrupted by anything resembling a supernatural battle.And then it ends, with the main characters having accomplished nothing (except Andou accidentally assembling a harem) and more questions being asked than have been answered.For a while I was hoping for a second season to clear some of these questions up, and possibly give more room to the plot behind the show. But as it seems now, the continuation will only remain as a visual novel.That is why I am personally annoyed with this anime. It felt like a show that ""settled"" for being a Slice of Life Romance. There are elements here that have potential, but they are not used, in favour of making something much more cookie-cutter.Thank you for reading. fine -- if anything else that happened actually was interesting.The anime presents itself with a sense of urgency and grandeur at the start, but doesn\'t actually deliver any of it.Instead it focuses itself on exploring the connectiosn between the main characters, with random ""literature club"" activities sprinkles throughout.This works well at first, but simply ends up with every single female character, unsurprisingly, falling in love with the main character.In a later episode, something resembling a plot appears.

I won't say that this is the best rom-com out there, but it is quite unique in its own way. Despite what the name of the show suggests, this is not an action heavy show. It's more apt to describe it as a slice of life romantic comedy with sprinkles of action here and there. There is an overarching story behind the rom-com of it all that gradually unravels as the episodes go by, and that...is quite fun and interesting as well. There is some fanservice, but it doesn't detract from the story at all. I'm sure some people would feel like dropping the show in the early episodes due to various reasons, but I do assure you that it gets better as the show progresses.Art style and Character Design : The art style is vibrant and dynamic. Character designs are slightly generic, but some characters are rather unique looking in their attire. There are several extended gag scenes where the use of good color combinations, shading and clever use of art styles, give off an entirely different feel to the show.Animation : The studio didn't cheap out on the budget in this as the animation is overall very fluid and pretty to look at.Voice Acting : Voice acting is just brilliant. The general voice acting is overall great, but the chūnibyō parts are especially hilarious. Minor spoiler that is more like a point of appreciation rather than a spoiler - Look out for the episode where the VA just kills it with a monologue. My jaw dropped while hearing it, it was that good.Direction : The direction and pacing of the show is just right. It's not too fast and not too slow. There are episodes where they approach non-linear storytelling and it might seem confusing at first, but everything falls into place when more information gets revealed over time.Story : I'd say the rom-com story is pretty good with some unique elements to it, but the overarching story that lies at the back end is interesting and what makes it even more unique.Overall, this was a good show to watch.

I can see many people think positively of it, but if you want a genuine review of this anime from a longtime anime watcher, rather than a fresh one, then please stay and read. Keep in mind this review is not solely based around my pessimistic experiences, but it will sound a bit overly negative at times. Be warned, minor spoilers are ahead.Firstly, the concept. The anime kind of throws you into it rather abruptly, as if you hadn\'t done any prior research, you\'d assume it\'s just another generic school council harem...anime; of which, many exist in this genre. And, just like the many others before it, the goal is the same: all the girls constantly tease the main guy. Here is where I will note my few positives with this anime. But, this time, they have superpowers! More on that later.Firstly, the main character, Jurai Andou. He is the reason why I watched this in the first place. I saw a funny clip on YouTube that came off as a shock to me at how rich the humor was. Firstly, it reeled itself into what I believed was going to be another generic case of all the girls hating him (taking place in the second episode) and I was scared, but his reactions were unusually optimistic and his retorts were genuinely rich (his retort to the ""Why don\'t you ask yourself?"" line, which I expected to be the most negative part of the scene, was the funniest part). Seeing this, I had high expectations that this anime wouldn\'t fail to entertain me and would be wholly unique. And, most of the time, it truly did make me laugh a lot due to how funny he reacts to everything around him.And speaking of reactions, this is one of the few anime you are going to watch that actually has a rich amount of fluidity involved in its presentation. In some comedy scenes, the characters whip around like it\'s one of those old cartoons and their reaction scenes are quite humorous. Jurai, of course, steals the show with this, but some of the other characters such as Hatoko and Tomoyo also had some hilarious reactions to things. Truly, you look forward to the comedy in this anime more than anything.Unfortunately, for the moments that are funny, we have to come across the moments that are...well, heartless, so to say. Beginning my negative opinions here, my first problem with the anime was, once again, a trope I hate in most school council anime I watch: the main guy is treated very poorly. It\'s a trope mainly because nearly all anime taking place in a school council setting is typically a harem. Thanks to Jurai\'s unique schizophrenic, yet joyful nature, you could never genuinely feel depressed during the infamous ""girl power"" scenes that simply aim to make him feel depressed, however.But, later on in the anime, when it suddenly tries to throw a story at you (which it fails to really deliver on), some of the things get out of hand. Okay, I\'m sure you\'re curious by now about my ending sentiment on my opening lines. Superpowers?! Yes, they have superpowers!Seemingly out of nowhere, that\'s the ""abrupt"" plot they throw at you. It\'s actually...pretty cool, to say the least. It would have been more cool if it wasn\'t for the fact that their powers are purely situational for the most part and they never even had one of those fun episodes where they all use them to their advantage or things like that, if not multiple episodes where this was done during the comedy scenes. As such, their purpose is simply overshadowed by more generic school council anime humor in its place, with the girls using them every now and then.(MODERATE SPOILER START)Oh, and one thing I would like to call bull on, for those that have seen this, is the infamous pool episode the anime had. As you know, Sayumi has the power to restore things to their original state, and Tomoyo would be the one that you\'d think would be the fastest in the anime due to her power to freeze time. However, in that one scene where Sayumi was trying to avoid water, she suddenly possessed superhuman speed. I know damn well her power doesn\'t grant her any other attributes, so you\'d think the super speed would mean she had the power to stop time, as Tomoyo could give off the impression that she could move at supersonic speeds due to her ability to slow time for herself to move around and change things.(MODERATE SPOILER END)The main guy himself has, of course, the most useless power in the anime, just cause of the whole ""girl power"" thing (literally) I\'m sure. He has a development with it later on, but it\'s (basically) exclusively for the ending of the anime, so I won\'t say what that is. But, let\'s just say his power is essentially worthless throughout the whole anime otherwise and it\'s nothing to look forward to, other than his humorously long chant that he does before he uses it.Honestly, well I know it\'s primarily a comedy anime and I normally love those, the story, usual ""girl power"" trope being rather oppressive this time around and many other things can\'t warrant a high rating. Though, I did enjoy its soundtrack a little, it\'s nothing memorable. It\'s probably the only thing I gave a decently high rating on here, though.(REVIEW ENDS HERE, BONUS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MODERATE SPOILERS)Also, one last thing, the oppressive nature actually took it up a notch at one point. They legitimately had one scene where Jurai joked about using his awakened power and everyone else being HORRIBLY oppressive to him during it all, despite how much he joked about it. Now, considering the nature of his character, the fact that he knew how harmful his awakened power was to him and a few other things, he obviously wasn\'t serious in the slightest. And yet, he had to face some rather harsh words, which struck a real nerve to me. Sayumi\'s extremely cold lines after her ""shut up"" to him took a turn for the worst and that alone shaved off two whole points in my overall rating because of it.And, believe me, this was not an overreaction on my part. Once you watch the scene yourself, and by this point in the anime you\'ll be familiar with Jurai\'s character, you also feel bad for the way they gnaw at him. I honestly wanted to punch Sayumi in the damn face, and I normally don\'t feel that strongly about this kind of thing since I know it\'s commonplace in most harem anime. It just annoyed me a lot for some reason. But, that\'s just me. For those that ignored the spoilers and read my other things concerning Sayumi, I hope you don\'t feel similarly to me, if not stronger. I still liked the comedy myself, but it was rather painful that one, single scene could change my opinion. It\'s rather bipolar, though, cause as I said earlier, one comedy scene gave me an overly optimistic view on the anime, well this one gave me a despondent pessimistic view on it as a whole. Pretty sad, wouldn\'t you agree?Give this one a go if you want a good comedy, but try not to take it too seriously. anime; of which, many exist in this genre. And, just like the many others before it, the goal is the same: all the girls constantly tease the main guy. Here is where I will note my few positives with this anime.

It follows the going ons of the literature club which is composed of five members. In the first episode, they suddenly acquire super powers of varying kinds. Despite its title, there are no major battles for the majority of the series.  The most they use their powers for is to deal with mundane activities in some dramatic way. It regularly makes fun the tropes that come with this type of show through this fashion. It also has a harem plotline with our male mc at the centerArt: 8The art...is generic for these types of shows.Sound: 8There is not much music aside from the opening and ending. However, both of them are quite entertaining and catchy.

While it has the typical harem tropes and meta humor that we\'ve come to expect (so if you\'re tired of that there\'s no need to watch this), the show gave me one of the most enjoyable surprises that I do not expect from anime: a protagonist with a Roddenberrian ethic.I am referring to Gene Roddenberry, the visionary behind Stark Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation. A recurring theme in his universe is that the average human being is much more philosophically self-aware and more prone to critical thinking than we\'re used to. The future Roddenberry imagines is full...of people who are frequently exposed to new and seemingly unfathomable phenomena, yet have the courage and wisdom to think rationally on the consequences these things have as well as their own actions in response to them. People like Spock, Kirk, Picard, and Data come to mind as easy examples of those who resemble this philosophical futurism.This anime\'s protagonist, Andou, does not do the usual ""let\'s become superheroes!"" or the devious ""let\'s use these for our gain"" like most anime characters do in this situation. His chief concern is always with how the abilities of his friends will affect others as well as themselves. While most younger viewers may find it immoral to not use one\'s superpowers for good (with most americans having grown up on Spiderman), this show does a good job conveying the idea that there is no way to fully understand what kind of consequences will come from using those powers. Without spoiling the great dialogue that explores this Prime-Directive inspired philosophy, I can at least say that Andou makes good arguments convincing his friends that each use of their powers must be carefully considered from all angles even in the direst of life-and-death emergencies.And for the folks who just don\'t care about philosophy, just watch the show already because it\'s entertaining and decently animated.

It\'s fun.', 'If you had told me 3 months ago that I’d actually enjoy a soon-to-be-airing high-school-supernatural-slice-of life-harem light novel adaptation of all things, I’d have told you you’re an idiot. Well against all odds, and much to my surprise, this show has proved to me that good things can come out of that ever-so-overused setting.This is the Fall 2014 anime adaptation of the light novel bearing the same name, and is brought to us by studio Trigger, the more recently founded studio which brought us such anime saving masterpieces as Inferno Cop and Kill la Kill. Our cast of characters is fairly standard, to start it...off we have:Jurai Andou, the ever oblivious chuunibyo MC. He follows the general trope of being a somewhat but not exceptionally likeable guy, who seems to always know exactly what to say and when to say it. He seems silly and ignorant on the outside, yet has a deeper more wise side as well. It’s nothing particularly new, but he’s still an enjoyable character and he had some pretty good moments throughout the show. Jurai, unlike most copy-paste harem protagonists, actually manages to have a little bit of a personality. Now of course with the only male main character out of the way, we can move on to the only thing you guys really care about, the laaadiiiesss.We’ve got our resident Tsundere, Tomoyo Kanzaki, who bears a somewhat hidden chunnibyo side as well, which more of is revealed as the show progresses. This aspect of her character makes for some really hilarious moments throughout, and unlike the Tsunderes that infuriate me, she’s not abusive, and simply is easily embarrassed. Watching her actions and character as it was expanded upon throughout was really enjoyable, along with her gradual self-acceptance, which made for a very nice overarching development.There’s our Dandere, the quiet Sayumi Takanashi. To put it simply, there’s not a whole lot I can say about her, as she doesn’t say a whole lot. None of the characters in the cast bear too much depth, but Takanashi especially I found to be rather dull, and out of all the characters, the show tends to objectify her in particular, making her seem even more purposeless.Now we can’t leave out the loli, Chifuyu Himeki, who luckily doesn’t suffer from Sayumi’s latter issue. Simply put, she’s cute. Chifuyu is there to be the cute little girl, stating the obvious and fulfilling her moe role, and that’s what she does. She did get an arc, like all the main characters did to some extent, and it was actually pretty solid, showing her nice relationship with her best friend, though it’s attempts at a sense of drama felt more silly than serious.In this case, I saved the best for last. The clear and obvious best girl Hatoko Kushikawa, and if you disagree with me, you’re wrong. I’ll admit I always tend to prefer the childhood friend character archetypes, as they generally have what I find to be the best chemistry with the characters and also are the most developed. While that’s not always the case, it often is, and Hatoko isn’t an exception. Her character arc was my favorite, and was by far the most engaging and broad in tone. They used some great buildup for her arc’s climax, and while she wasn’t my initial favorite, during her arc I quickly changed my mind.Now these characters are far from special as far as the genre goes, but what makes Inou Battle particularly interesting in this case is the story.We get a fairly generic seeming setup, where our main cast has inexplicably gained powers, from a useless aesthetic fire to the ability to freeze time. I initially was pretty disappointed with this aspect, as it has very little effect on the storytelling at the start, and seemed like it would be yet another pointlessly supernatural harem. As the show progresses, however, the depth of their situation starts to become fully realized. We see there’s a bit more to this world than just their club, and that these powers, and the people using them, are affecting the world on a much more global scale.They introduce some legitimately interesting aspects to the plot, and this mixed it up enough to keep the experience engaging. I respect it for taking at least the first few steps in the right direction, but it really doesn’t go all the way with it, and there were a fair share of issues in it’s deliverance. For example, this is a method that was used to build suspense several times: the episode ends with a cliffhanger, and the start of the next is strangely dark and tonally jarring, but then after throwing plenty of exposition-filled dialogue at us, it very quickly returns to the status quo. It doesn’t entirely ignore the previous events, but the drastic change back to a happy-go-lucky feel, and the seemingly minor effect of these events causes the story to feel, for lack of a better word, “trolly”. And keep in mind it does this more than once. This does keep you on your toes, and stops it from getting repetitive, but also is annoying, as it builds itself up just to let itself fall back down once more.There also is the ending, of which I won’t spoil, but I will discuss. It’s pretty disappointing. To be frank, it doesn’t feel like an ending. It felt like merely another episode in the show, like it abruptly stopped at the halfway point. None of the many, many, unexplained plot points were resolved, explained, or talked about in any real depth either. It wasn’t a poor episode persay, It just wasn’t an ending. Luckily, I wasn’t particularly watching this for the “mystery” of it, so it wasn’t exactly enraging, just dissatisfying. Of course, you can discredit this argument if after the time of this review a second season is released, but for now it stands as a pretty major flaw, and if there is a second season, I still would say that they could have better handled the introduction and pacing of revealing the deeper aspects of the story, as there were a fair amount of things introduced or brought up that felt added just to unnecessarily complicate the story.Now for the animation, which as it was done by Studio Trigger is really the only reason anyone picked this show up anyway. Personally, I think it’s… alright. It’s really nothing particularly special, it’s not out of this world with flow or beauty, and the general aesthetic while not bad, does feel kind of generic, with nothing about it really standing out to me. I did like some of the character designs, and I really enjoyed how they animated the character movements and the flow of their clothing. There were a couple times where you could see the more ‘cartoony’ side come out, where it began to bear a larger similarity to classic western styles of animation, but these were not common enough for me to properly appreciate it. It’s pleasant and a little above average, with some nice facial expressions and movement, but nowhere near exceptional.I have to leave a quick paragraph for the sound, though to be honest there’s not a lot to say. The opening and ending are pleasant in their own right, but nothing struck me as brilliant about them, the voice acting, as far as I could tell was solid but nothing fantastic, and the general OST was entirely forgettable, leaving neither a positive nor negative impression.In conclusion, Inou Battle is above average as far as harems go, with some enjoyable characters, pleasant humor, and a story that at least tries to be different. It could have been much more, but for what it is, it’s not bad. If you’re looking for an amusing, lighthearted show to watch, and don’t mind some unexplained and unnecessary plot points, I’d recommend giving this one a shot. I give When Supernatural Battles Become Commonplace a 6.5/10.(Originally Written January 9th, 2015)https://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/ off we have:Jurai Andou, the ever oblivious chuunibyo MC.

I did like some of the character designs, and I really enjoyed how they animated the character movements and the flow of their clothing. There were a couple times where you could see the more ‘cartoony’ side come out, where it began to bear a larger similarity to classic western styles of animation, but these were not common enough for me to properly appreciate it. It’s pleasant and a little above average, with some nice facial expressions and movement, but nowhere near exceptional.I have to leave a quick paragraph for the sound, though to be honest there’s not a lot to say. The opening and ending are pleasant in their own right, but nothing struck me as brilliant about them, the voice acting, as far as I could tell was solid but nothing fantastic, and the general OST was entirely forgettable, leaving neither a positive nor negative impression.In conclusion, Inou Battle is above average as far as harems go, with some enjoyable characters, pleasant humor, and a story that at least tries to be different. It could have been much more, but for what it is, it’s not bad. If you’re looking for an amusing, lighthearted show to watch, and don’t mind some unexplained and unnecessary plot points, I’d recommend giving this one a shot. I give When Supernatural Battles Become Commonplace a 6.5/10.(Originally Written January 9th, 2015)https://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/', ""Inou Battle is an anime that caught me by surprise. The first episode makes you think you're in for some kind of superhero action series with a mixture of comedy, drama and romance. What you get is... Mostly just fanservice.When I say fanservice I don't mean lewd scenes. There aren't really any lewd scenes in this anime. When I say fanservice I mean romantic fanservice. This is a harem anime and so throughout the episodes, Ando takes turns going on dates with all of the different girls in his harem. All of it feels cheap, rushed and pointless, like you're just taking a tour of...the harem while they tick all the romance boxes.The plot is all but ignored for the majority of the show. What starts out as an interesting premise (the superpowers) ends up immediately sidelined after a couple of gags early on. You would THINK that a girl capable of stopping and slowing time would have some interesting interactions, especially since it's a romantic anime. But nope, she barely uses her power at all. Pretty much all of the plot progression is rushed out at the final few episodes, and none of it is especially interesting. The plot is basically an afterthought, the romance and drama is all the writers seemed to care about.The characters weren't super badly written but they also weren't incredibly memorable. Andou is at least not super awkward with women like your average main character. He's also not a complete doormat and speaks his mind, which is a nice change of pace. There's not a lot to write about the female cast, they tick all of the cliché trope boxes and that's about it.I didn't find myself laughing all that much, there were maybe one or two memorable scenes where the comedy got a smirk or chuckle out of me. They definitely avoided plot progression and comedy and went all in on the romance.Art and sound were fine, nothing exceptional anyhow.Ultimately, Inou Battle wasn't really that memorable to me. There's a lot of wasted potential, they could have done so much with the superpowers but instead chose to just make this another bland romance. If you're fine with watching a generic harem romance with in-your-face romantic fanservice and a small side dose of supernatural stuff, you might enjoy this anime. the harem while they tick all the romance boxes.The plot is all but ignored for the majority of the show.

This anime has the absolute worst MC from all the animes I\'ve seen. There isn\'t anything special about him at all! Sure, you might say that he has a goofy personality but that lasts for only while before you start getting ticked off. It gets really irritating, moreover, I\'ve never laughed once.(-1)2. This is basically a slice of life anime - no other genres included. Not even comedy itself, it feels like they just included superpowers for the sake of this being called a supernatural anime. They barely use their powers in the...first place and when they do it\'s for something minor like transporting somewhere.(-1)3. The characters are really overpowered, no -infact really is an understatement. One can stop time, one can create anything, one can control all the elements and one is basically invincible as she has the ability to restore anything to its original state including severed arms. And, where might our MC be amongst this chaos? Standing tall on the other side of the ring is the stupid, incredibly weak MC. The biggest joke is that after his power evolves, it becomes even more useless. It\'s a double edged sword.(-1)4. Each episode feels like a therapy session. This characters as this problem, let\'s devote a whole episode to it, maybe even two! It\'s really, really boring. It happens to be the skip-type anime where you literally skip episodes or skip parts without missing a single bit of the plot.(-1)5. For some reason, it feels like the author came with a cliche plot about something like a tournament or a war where people with supernatural powers fight; but, instead thought it would be boring so made it a slice of life theme and hints in at this previous plot as to create a suspenseful atmosphere.  This just makes it worse because there are random episodes with random characters doing something completely random while trying to look cool. I have absolutely no idea what\'s going on, it basically feels like I\'m being kept in the dark but I think I\'ve nailed most of the plot down through simple guessing.(-1)6. In the midst of these therapy like session episodes, there\'s seems to be little development about the MC at all. There\'s no change or growth whatsoever.(-1)7. Very few fight scenes and they all happen to be really boring.(-1)Honestly, this anime is a no-go. Maybe viewers who gave this a high rating thought it was refreshing with the slice of life genre in the mix, but to me, it seems like a cliche plot glittered wrapped in a neat little bow and dusted with glitter to make it look new and different. But, in the end, it\'s still that same cliched ""boring"" plot.3/10 but I\'ll give it 6/10 - I\'m being generous here since I know a lot of hard work goes into making an anime or coming up with a plot in the first place first place and when they do it\'s for something minor like transporting somewhere.(-1)3.

Let's see.Ah, Inou-battle wa Nichijou no Naka de. I can't even start to express what I truly feel about this series. I feel grateful that I discover this but also disappointed at the same time. What could be great in my opinion was destroyed in front of my eyes. Not saying this is a bad show but I'll let you be the judge.So, the show starts with a bunch of students getting a superpower all of the sudden and they use it to battle each other for fun for over six months (This is just the first 5...minutes into the first episode). With that in mind, you'll get the idea that there will be a lot of action to come. Let me tell you this, there will be nothing for you (The only magic fight you could see after the wonderful show of power in the first episode is in the last episode even though I hardly called that a fight). But, even though it's disappointing in terms of action, they make it up with a brand new theme, friendship. The story will revolve around the character and how they deal with each other and also add some romance spice along the way (even though there's hardly a romance development).With that, the series relies on the character progression and their life even though it promotes action from the start. It's like ordering a burger but you got a sandwich instead. It could be disappointing to some but some just shrug it off and take it as it is, no complaint.I actually enjoy this, though. But I recommend you this if you're expecting a slice-of-life anime with action in between not the other way around.P.S : The VA for Hatoko Kushikawa is the best thing this show could come up with.

I don think it did well, mashing different types of genres like supernatural, slice of life, drama, comedy, and romance into one anime. If anything it should have just focused on one and stuck with it. This anime like many animes had to have something unique to it which is very generic because many animes that has something unique in it focuses something entirely different. The story for this anime is all over the place as I said above and the pacing is a bit too fast, but I was used to it. One episode...is all drama, and the next episode they bring a whole new plot about some war with a number of factions into the series only to brush off with a beach episode. I don't mind having drama with the supernatural but the anime was just glossing over the supernatural aspects of the anime which just made the show become a harem drama type anime. I did enjoy the drama and comedy of this anime to a degree but the lack of organization of plot just made this show kind of generic for me. The characters all have generic personalities but all were still likable. In episode 6, Hatoko, became my favorite character and was the introduction to the drama of the anime. That scene of Hatoko arguing with the main character that I watched on YouTube was the main reason I watched this anime. Even though it felt like a mess, I still enjoyed this anime because of the drama and comedy it had and the last episode was very interesting and fun to watch. is all drama, and the next episode they bring a whole new plot about some war with a number of factions into the series only to brush off with a beach episode.

The characters were pretty endearing and the story kept up the interest, at least for me. The ""mechanics"" (sound design, art, animation) were all fine, and I enjoyed it.right up until it ended... I really wanted to see where the story was going but I suppose I\'ll have to read the LN, which I recently started doing after all these years since watching this show.Of course, I would still have to condemn it with the usual anime/manga failings of weird/gross mild pedophilia but, whatcha gonna do.Might be time...to give this a rewatch and edit this review. to give this a rewatch and edit this review.', ""Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Nake de is a decent show, that seems to have an identity crisis.Episode 1 as the shows title suggests, introduces super-powers to a group of high-school kids, where one might ask, what would a bunch of teenagers do with such power? Would they delight, despair, use them for fun and practical jokes or perhaps the power would go to their head?Well forget all that, we're in episodes 2-5 now, where it's bog-standard slice-of-life school comedy. The whole super-power thing is pushed aside, and personal problems and club-room activities take center-stage. They mention their powers from time to time, one of...the girls states that its a burden, but we never see why she thinks this way. They don't do anything with their powers and nothing even remotely suggests why they would see them as a burden. As rarely as they're used, they can use them with ease, with no resource-cost or risk. They have no struggles to deal with, no accidents, no adversaries to face. Its also almost certainly not how any regular person would react to being gifted incredible power, but all doubt is resolved in the matter of a single scene anyway so it doesn't matter.Anyway, forget all that, we're on episode 6 now, lets introduce a bunch of characters we've never seen before and won't see again. Oh and also there's a committee of fairies that have humans fight each other for amusement in an ongoing fairy war...For some reason....But forget all that! it's episode 7 now, and from here on it's a harem show - studying in the club room, going to the pool and spending the day at the beach.

No mention of powers, the fairy stuff, or the other characters until the final episode - episode 12. But only for the first 10 minutes.It's not that any of this stuff is terrible, or abrasive. It doesn't annoy, bore or insult intelligence the way worse anime might. But it doesn't gel together very well either. Plot threads are introduced and dropped very quickly, and overall seem to lack direction, focus and narrative flow.The better parts of the show are actually the more mundane, romantic drama parts, which makes me think this would have been a better anime had they cut out the other stuff altogether.

This is an absolute must watch if you are into the genre and I can\'t even begin to understand why I have seen no hype for this anime and how I...barely managed to stumble across it. As I said it is a must watch for anyone that is into the slice of life romcom genre especially if you enjoy some light fantasy as well, ignore any cliché tropes or unoriginality that appear to be present as I assure you this anime is anything but stale.This anime is practically everything Charlotte wishes it could have been.Now for my one disclaimer which I pray to god doesnt ruin it for you as it was still very highly enjoyable. This whole anime is one big advertisement. This anime is a ""free"" sample designed to promote the suirce material which I imagine is a light novel. (which I will definitely be checking out since the sample was so good) unfortunately this means that the anime is not complete. The vast majority of plotlines and subplots that simply are not fully explored and completed because that is not the purpose of the anime. Personally this didnt take away any enjoyment from me as much as it leaves me craving more, however I will say that I recognize that being incomplete makes it a lot easier to be so good , as anime tend to make more mistakes the longer and more complex the plot and, by consequence, the resolution become. Keeping this in mind this anime is not a masterpiece from a creation standpoint and cannot be even judged alongside other great anime that I would consider 9\'s and 10\'s because it was given a signifigant handicap in not being complete (bowling handicap or advantage not a disadvantage). Anyways still watch it and then just find the source material afterwards and without further ado onto the review.As previously mentioned I give this anime a 9/10 as it has overall very very few flaws and does a lot of things spectacularly.Story: 10It\'s hard to judge since a.) it is incomplete and b.) it is technically but not really a slice of life, however I was amazed how well the story was woven together in just 12 episodes. There are many significant connections and revelations to the main storyline that you don\'t see coming and are quite well crafted. Despite being only 12 episodes you get the sense of a much bigger world/central conflict that would have the potential to be a much longer anime say full metal alchemist length without getting old or worn out. (This is why I don\'t consider this entirely a true slice of life) overall very well done I just wish we actually got those other 52 episodes with the same qualityArt. 7TBH the art overall was nothing special. Character designs where mostly intriguing and fresh (even the main character isnt too bland) but background and auxillary art where hardly noticable most of the time. Also i\'m not necessarily the most skilled critic at this but sometimes the animation was noticibally simple with only the mouths being animated for numerous numerous scenes. However I do believe the animation and art quality did increase a bit during the many fantasy scenes. Overall you are not watching this show for the art but it doesnt hinder your experience whatsoever.Sound: 8The sound was slightly above average maybe even an 8.5 The opening and ending where not somethign absolutely amazing that I never skipped but they were still well above average for me and I enjoyable listened to them while watching the well made opening and ending sequences quite a few times. The ambient/standard background music is entirely forgettable however towards the end during a few important emotional scenes they have a rework of the opening theme that does well. However the most impressive aspect of the sound category was the voice acting. No character had an annoying voice to me not even the ""loli"" and there are some hauntingly amazing scenes where the voice actresses/actors really outdid themselves and really made the scene as memorable as it is(those who have seen it already will know which scene in particular I am talking about).Character: 8This could maybe be and 8.5 as well. The character category has some mixed reviews. I really only have issues with one character that i will adress in a bit. First off one thing that both amazed and dissapointed me was how they used most every character, in fact there were only really two people that can actually be considered characters with names rather than extras that dont see extensive or significant use in the story(sorta). On the flip side they seemed to stuggle to use a lot of these characters at the same time with some characters being heavily focused on only to be completely forgotten moments later or vice versa, and some characters completely failing to interact with eachother other. However I imagine that a lot of this stems from the 12 episode deadline and incomplete nature of the anime. Another thing I would like to adress with characters is tropes. This anime does in fact apply a lot of standard anime character tropes, however most of the characters manage to use this only to a comedic end and grow beyond the archetype not letting it define them. But this is where my single biggest issue with the anime came in. The tsundere doesn\'t really grow beyond the tsundere trope. It doesn\'t necessarily ruin her as a character or negatively affect the show as people including me have been shown to still like tsunderes despite there being so many of them,  ut it just seems to take away some originality. Actually really the only way the tsundere is developed is as a double tsundere afraid of her true feelings towrds the male lead as well as her feelings about her hobby. Other than what I mentioned characters were all above average.Genre related themes: 9Being a romcom light fantasy/slice of life the main focuses are of course romance comedy and light fantasy/ slice of life.The romance is quite above average and it is not your typical harem anime. People actually get hurtand there are real strains on chara ters relatiosnhips, the girls actually make a legitimate attempt to express their feelings to the lead character, and he in return is not completely oblivious to their or his own feelings. Unfortunatly seeing as the show is unfinished there was never a true romantic conclusion but hey that means whatever ship you choose wont be completely sunk until you get to the light novel.The comedy gets progressively better as you go along and get more in touch with the characters. It varies a bit in style and while it isnt revolutionary and I never had a seen where I was dying laughing it gave me quite a few chuckles and I always had a smile on my face during the lighter scenes. It balances out serious with humorous very well most everywhere (although actually for me one of the scenes that I for some reason personally found to be one of if not the funniest scene was smack dab in the middle of one of the most serious scenes.) Additionally the anime is frequently very self aware to the viewers comedic delight.Finally one last bit of confused praise that I have for this anime is how it balances out being both a slice of life and fantasy anime at the same time. The anime starts out as and is still at its core a slice of life anime, however while they are never technically the main main focus of any given episode the fantasy aspect permeate the anime, creating as previously mentioned a deeper world/central comflict, giving insight of what to expect in the completed light novel. I will say that I do believe that the slice of life was mainly a tool used in this ""promotional anime"" to allow the viewer to quickly become enraptured by the characters and I suspect that the source material is slightly more fantasy focused, however I have never read any light novel let alone this one so I couldnt tell you.So yes overall very good anime 9/10 because of what it does well and my overall enjoyment despite some minor flaws.I highly recommend that you watch especially if you are a fan of the genre.*******here is the slight spoiler********So idk if this really counts as a spoiler since the information is in the description and is technically revealed episode 1, but the superpowers in this show are real within the anime (so long as the very end is oh yeah every single one of these hundreds of people all mass hallicinated the exact same thing. This wasn\'t entirely clear at first and considering the chuunibyou theme it was honestly sorta hard to tell and I wasn\'t entirely sure until we meet Reatier or whatever her name was in the sub. Overall I do think however that this uncertainty was sorta nice and the final confirmation that it was real felt pretty good. barely managed to stumble across it.

Keeping this in mind this anime is not a masterpiece from a creation standpoint and cannot be even judged alongside other great anime that I would consider 9\'s and 10\'s because it was given a signifigant handicap in not being complete (bowling handicap or advantage not a disadvantage). Anyways still watch it and then just find the source material afterwards and without further ado onto the review.As previously mentioned I give this anime a 9/10 as it has overall very very few flaws and does a lot of things spectacularly.Story: 10It\'s hard to judge since a.) it is incomplete and b.) it is technically but not really a slice of life, however I was amazed how well the story was woven together in just 12 episodes. There are many significant connections and revelations to the main storyline that you don\'t see coming and are quite well crafted. Despite being only 12 episodes you get the sense of a much bigger world/central conflict that would have the potential to be a much longer anime say full metal alchemist length without getting old or worn out. (This is why I don\'t consider this entirely a true slice of life) overall very well done I just wish we actually got those other 52 episodes with the same qualityArt. 7TBH the art overall was nothing special. Character designs where mostly intriguing and fresh (even the main character isnt too bland) but background and auxillary art where hardly noticable most of the time. Also i\'m not necessarily the most skilled critic at this but sometimes the animation was noticibally simple with only the mouths being animated for numerous numerous scenes. However I do believe the animation and art quality did increase a bit during the many fantasy scenes. Overall you are not watching this show for the art but it doesnt hinder your experience whatsoever.Sound: 8The sound was slightly above average maybe even an 8.5 The opening and ending where not somethign absolutely amazing that I never skipped but they were still well above average for me and I enjoyable listened to them while watching the well made opening and ending sequences quite a few times. The ambient/standard background music is entirely forgettable however towards the end during a few important emotional scenes they have a rework of the opening theme that does well. However the most impressive aspect of the sound category was the voice acting. No character had an annoying voice to me not even the ""loli"" and there are some hauntingly amazing scenes where the voice actresses/actors really outdid themselves and really made the scene as memorable as it is(those who have seen it already will know which scene in particular I am talking about).Character: 8This could maybe be and 8.5 as well. The character category has some mixed reviews. I really only have issues with one character that i will adress in a bit. First off one thing that both amazed and dissapointed me was how they used most every character, in fact there were only really two people that can actually be considered characters with names rather than extras that dont see extensive or significant use in the story(sorta). On the flip side they seemed to stuggle to use a lot of these characters at the same time with some characters being heavily focused on only to be completely forgotten moments later or vice versa, and some characters completely failing to interact with eachother other. However I imagine that a lot of this stems from the 12 episode deadline and incomplete nature of the anime. Another thing I would like to adress with characters is tropes. This anime does in fact apply a lot of standard anime character tropes, however most of the characters manage to use this only to a comedic end and grow beyond the archetype not letting it define them. But this is where my single biggest issue with the anime came in. The tsundere doesn\'t really grow beyond the tsundere trope. It doesn\'t necessarily ruin her as a character or negatively affect the show as people including me have been shown to still like tsunderes despite there being so many of them,  ut it just seems to take away some originality. Actually really the only way the tsundere is developed is as a double tsundere afraid of her true feelings towrds the male lead as well as her feelings about her hobby. Other than what I mentioned characters were all above average.Genre related themes: 9Being a romcom light fantasy/slice of life the main focuses are of course romance comedy and light fantasy/ slice of life.The romance is quite above average and it is not your typical harem anime. People actually get hurtand there are real strains on chara ters relatiosnhips, the girls actually make a legitimate attempt to express their feelings to the lead character, and he in return is not completely oblivious to their or his own feelings. Unfortunatly seeing as the show is unfinished there was never a true romantic conclusion but hey that means whatever ship you choose wont be completely sunk until you get to the light novel.The comedy gets progressively better as you go along and get more in touch with the characters. It varies a bit in style and while it isnt revolutionary and I never had a seen where I was dying laughing it gave me quite a few chuckles and I always had a smile on my face during the lighter scenes. It balances out serious with humorous very well most everywhere (although actually for me one of the scenes that I for some reason personally found to be one of if not the funniest scene was smack dab in the middle of one of the most serious scenes.) Additionally the anime is frequently very self aware to the viewers comedic delight.Finally one last bit of confused praise that I have for this anime is how it balances out being both a slice of life and fantasy anime at the same time. The anime starts out as and is still at its core a slice of life anime, however while they are never technically the main main focus of any given episode the fantasy aspect permeate the anime, creating as previously mentioned a deeper world/central comflict, giving insight of what to expect in the completed light novel. I will say that I do believe that the slice of life was mainly a tool used in this ""promotional anime"" to allow the viewer to quickly become enraptured by the characters and I suspect that the source material is slightly more fantasy focused, however I have never read any light novel let alone this one so I couldnt tell you.So yes overall very good anime 9/10 because of what it does well and my overall enjoyment despite some minor flaws.I highly recommend that you watch especially if you are a fan of the genre.*******here is the slight spoiler********So idk if this really counts as a spoiler since the information is in the description and is technically revealed episode 1, but the superpowers in this show are real within the anime (so long as the very end is oh yeah every single one of these hundreds of people all mass hallicinated the exact same thing. This wasn\'t entirely clear at first and considering the chuunibyou theme it was honestly sorta hard to tell and I wasn\'t entirely sure until we meet Reatier or whatever her name was in the sub. Overall I do think however that this uncertainty was sorta nice and the final confirmation that it was real felt pretty good.', ""Starts out as a surprisingly funny comedy, shifts to an interesting character-focused drama, and ends as an unfocused harem-romance war story.This show really loses me on episodes 8 to 12, which is unfortunate because it peaks right before that.

Admitting to personal bias here, I've never been able to stomach harem romance stories. And this anime doesn't end up being the exception.

I hope so,...may be producer changes their mind and get us new season for this anime. may be producer changes their mind and get us new season for this anime."", 'A poor man\'s Chu2byou. That\'s basically what this anime boils down to.WARNING: This review may be LONG, LONG-WINDED, and contain some MINOR SPOILERS (not like that should matter though)Studio Trigger were riding a high in the years 2013-2014 fresh off saving anime with Kill la Kill and charming everyone with Little Witch Academia. So why did they make something like this? As far as MAL is concerned this is the only LN adaptation they have done yet and they haven\'t dabbled with it since they made this in 2014. Did they blindly follow the craze of LN adaptations which just started to explode into...the scene at the time? Judging from the quality of this anime as well as what this anime says I have a sneaking suspicion that might be the case.If you go into this anime expecting a fast-paced battle-action anime where our rag-tag group of main characters use superpowers to battle for survival against circumstances put against them, you\'d be disappointed. If you expected this anime to be a more grounded realistic take on the typical ""characters with superpowers do quirky antics"" shtick where they hunker down on the explanations and see how possessing powers affects their livelihood and brings around new trials to their everyday struggles as outcast, you\'d also be disappointed. So what if I look at the bright colours and the comedy-harem tag, and all the recommendations from Chu2 that may have brought you here? You\'d also be disappointed. Why? This anime doesn\'t know what it wants to be, what it can do, and what it should do.It\'s very apparent that this anime tries to do a spin on the battle powers genre with a bunch of characters suddenly given powers. Like the tittle implies, they go around their daily lives as normal people who just happen to have powers. This is not a particularly unique setting but it is something that can be explored on multiple levels. This anime elects to take a more grounded Slice of Life route that contains comedy and wacky hi-jinks. This, combined with its frequent jabs and nods to actual power-fantasy stories that we see everywhere, could have actually made a pretty good comedy parody in addition to being a good SoL. This anime however, fails to do so for various reasons. Not least of which is the fact that its really hard to care about the characters.Any SoL anime is built on its characters. The characters of Inou Battle just aren\'t compelling to watch or follow. They\'re all basically one-note stereotypes. There\'s the Chu2-esque MC who I\'ll expand on latter. There\'s the kind and caring childhood friend, the stern yet troubled Club President (Oh did I mention they were in a highschool club? The most goddamn overused and abused setting? Nope? Okay.), the red-haired tsundere who does tsundere things, and the token loli. I know perfectly well that the story does this purposely to build up expectations before proceeding to subvert them, but this anime...sort of doesn\'t. Never do the characters in any way act outside of what is expected of them. This anime follows an episodic style which sees the MC interact with a chosen girl-of-the-week in your typical harem encounters to build love points/meter/gauge etc which doesn\'t do anything but get out female MCs to like our male MCs. Never once have I thought that these characters could have lives outside of this show\'s incredibly closed and looped-around world where they don\'t revolve around our male MC. It doesn\'t help that the anime never gives them any meaningful development that sticks nor do they show the consequences of said development which really burns in such a character-reliant show.Chifuyu gets the first standalone episode and she is the victim of some of the worst character building of the series. It\'s heavily implied by the anime that she usually spends long bouts of time alone even though she\'s a child because her parents don\'t hang around for some unexplained reason. Okay, cool. You got something you can build your character on and have her resolve slowly throughout the anime. No? What? Who\'s this Cookie girl? Nothing about her is explored, not the motivations for her hanging around the Literature Club with the other MCs, not her aunt who\'s a teacher and somewhat of an important character who is hardly ever in the show and you probably forgot about her, not anything. Her main purpose after her episode is to be a cute mascot and that\'s about it. Though I will admit the MC shouting out loud that he was a lolicon for a gag did bring some shades of Araragi (Oh how I wish he was even a fraction of the character Araragi is).Tomoyo and Hatoko are two sides of the same coin and if you\'ve seen any harem anime or know literally anything about VN romance harems you know their interactions with each other and the male MC. Tomoyo never breaks out of the tsundere character mold and her being a LN writer brought bad memories of other pseudo-meta bullshit that other light novels throw in their wok for shallow self-gratification. It never reaches that point but that was at least something you could have built her character on but her development never felt natural. It all boils down to another ""Oh the male MC is doing what literally any reasonable human being would do, I think I want to bang him"". Outside of that, she also has wasted potential in that she was a chu2 herself and her brother is somehow a major character in this show. The anime does nothing to advance these bases in any meaningful way outside of making our MC look good. Hatoko is probably the most basic character of the cast yet she has one of the most infamous scenes in anime and arguably a reason why this show got some attention. She is very much your typical childhood friend but she carries the burden of being the main torpedo to sink the power-fantasy vessel that is the fleet ship of the very shows this series subverts. Her emotional  call-out in her designated episode was very impressive to say the least - helped immensely by Hayami Saori\'s powerful voice. SHe clearly expresses how she is not only angry at the MC but also at herself for not understanding him. It makes it all the more infuriating that the anime doesn\'t do any meaningful followup on this instead giving us a stupid might-as-well be filler episode in the follow up.  And then she returns to being the childhood friend character with the only difference being she likes the male MC more and, instead of discussing more of the inherent flaws of the male MC, actually puts him on a higher pedestal than the one he was knocked off in the pipe-bomb outburst. His inherent flaws are instead re-stringed to somehow be positive, helpful traits of the MC. God I hate what the anime did with that.Sayumi is...basic...I have no idea what to think about her...Her character itself isn\'t too bad. It\'s kind of a typical club president trope. But she\'s a good example of how awfully the anime handles its character building. Most of what we learn from her in her episode comes from her sister - a character purely there to provide us raw exposition and nothing else. Like, really? The MC just so happens to leave his notebook at her house so she has a good excuse to call the MC to dump exposition. That episode (6) makes the flaws of this series apparent. Whenever this series needs to get a move on with the story they just blindly introduce new characters you would forget about (the teacher, Saymi\'s sister, Kuki, etc.) or rashly throw events at our group just because they have powers.The male MC is...really annoying. It\'s not that I dislike him or his character archetype but I hate the style in which he was handled. There is no more wasted potential among the other characters than this guy. Why is he chu2? Why is he in the literature club? Why are his powers useless? Why do you somehow manage to subtely give us clues on his character (like him having good marks) but then never give us any explanation as to how he is like that nor have the anime do anything which shows it being important in some way? He\'s the prime example of the wasteful loops this anime jumps through because the anime pulls his character in so many different directions. He\'s smart but the anime never lets this be shown outside of contrived bullshit like the last episode, he\'s a genuinely kind person but this is never shown in a way that doesn\'t have the female MCs drooling over him, he\'s a chu2 except when he isn\'t and actually is a normal person. This character is the prime reason this whole series feels contrived and shallow. Any sort of attempt to wade in deeper waters stops dead because of this anime\'s inability to be consistent and focused. I know perfectly well that this is a harem show and that the female MCs are going to end up liking the male MC (even the loli so this right here, FBI) but the characters should have been able to carry the viewer longer than they could. The male MC comes off as an inconsistent, annoying character I was never able to get behind because the anime is busy artificially jacking up his image. This makes him an incredibly generic chick-magnet who is of course oblivious to the feelings of the girls around him (which the anime of course also never resolves). He could have come off as the grounded MC who uses his chu2 knowledge and natural compassion to guide and influence the other female MCs as well as himself but the tone of this anime falls flat whenever they give any character their predictable development. I\'m not happy with this. I would love to see his type of character be utalised in a better series. That\'s how much wasted potential lies here.Speaking of potential, there was a lot of it in giving meaning to the powers, as much as the anime makes a point in downplaying them (which is why I don\'t include their powers in my character breakdown). Why do the characters have the powers they do? Do they have any meaning to their situations and personality? The anime annoying somehow alludes to this in episode 3 with the female MCs walking home and discussing how our male MC influenced the way they limit the use of their powers. I say annoying because as much as I can infer the subtleties of what the main characters were saying, it was a blatant ""tell don\'t show"" exposition moment whose purpose was to only get the female cast to talk highly of our male MC.Storywise, in addition to the harem antiques and interactions the characters we know go through, there is in fact another ""overarching plot"" within the SoL plot of this show where it is an actual battle-power show with other ""Main characters with powers"" that have nothing to do with, and mostly remain separate from our actual main characters. Unfortunately. I say that because this is used to juxtapose our MCs way of living normally with superpowers against a normal high-adrenaline, high-stakes battle story with plenty of conspiracies floating around. In theory it should have worked but in practice this sub-plot stuck to the main SoL storyline like a tumor. It ruined most of the pacing of the mid-to-late episodes (as if the pacing wasn\'t bad enough already), brought us plenty of new characters we, AS THE WRITERS INTENDED, are NEVER expected to care about but they\'re given way more screen-time than they should get, and serves no other purpose that make a lame attempt to make some sort of climactic ending. Oh yeah, the ending had that one girl. Kudou, was it? I forgot to add her in the character section but don\'t worry the anime forgot about her too until they realised they needed an ending.If it feels like I\'m unfair in my rampant criticisms of this show its only because I could actually see this anime doing some good. There are some moments that are actually pretty great in the anime which makes it all the more infuriating when you realise that those moments are what the whole anime could have been. There\'s a few great ""show don\'t tell"" moments like the male MC\'s room having trophies on the cabinet- likely because he was an achiever - but these are few and far between the trashy ""tell don\'t show"" scenes the anime could have asily replaced or gotten rid of. Some of the banter between the characters are pretty great and feel natural for highschoolers but they\'re lost in a sea of poorly-written exposition and typical lines you\'ve heard in every harem/romance show. A few other positive moments elevate this anime above a ""4"" (which I consider to be your generic, unemotional ""bad""). A few tweaks here and there with a bit more focus on the circumstances of the characters and the implications of their actions outside of strengthening the harem tag could have made this a pretty decent show.This anime has pretty inconsistent animation. The first few episodes scream low-budget and sometimes the mouthflaps don\'t even sync with the dialogue. The anime then proceeds to have good animation quality in the middle before devolving towards the end. Being studio Trigger there is plenty of exaggerated moves to punctuate comedy and it\'s pretty great. It\'s just that the scenes they are in aren\'t. The direction is something that miffed me. It\'s mostly harmless with plenty of shot-reverse shots but there\'s parts where they noticeably cut way too much which breaks up the pacing and tone of the scene. Especially egregious was Hatoko\'s call-out scene where they tried way too many different shots and cuts and even included an obnoxious text-on-screen effect (with associated loud sound effect) like it was JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure or a comic books or something. Thank goodness Hayami Saori can carry a scene by herself. The music is...meh...so generic and sometimes over-played. Nothing notable stood out to elevate a scene. The voice acting was pretty good for the most part. The voice actors played their parts naturally. Just wished they had a better script to work with.Overall I didn\'t get anything from Inou Battle. At least, nothing that I couldn\'t get more of and in better quality in other anime. The themes and tone of the show are apparent but the characters don\'t have the chance to pull them through to the viewer. The pacing is shot for the most part and the anime falls into way too many pitfalls of writing which leads to bouts of boring exposition and plenty of characters thrown to the wayside even though they\'re given more screentime than they should have been given. Honestly, just watch Chu2 if you want similar interactions and themes to this show. I would also recommend Sakurasou no Pet nad Kanojo for a farm far superiour romance and Imouto sae ireba ii for an actual grounded SoL that successfully subverts the genre it tries to parody while still maintaining compelling characters.Thanks for reading! the scene at the time?

There are some moments that are actually pretty great in the anime which makes it all the more infuriating when you realise that those moments are what the whole anime could have been. There\'s a few great ""show don\'t tell"" moments like the male MC\'s room having trophies on the cabinet- likely because he was an achiever - but these are few and far between the trashy ""tell don\'t show"" scenes the anime could have asily replaced or gotten rid of. Some of the banter between the characters are pretty great and feel natural for highschoolers but they\'re lost in a sea of poorly-written exposition and typical lines you\'ve heard in every harem/romance show. A few other positive moments elevate this anime above a ""4"" (which I consider to be your generic, unemotional ""bad""). A few tweaks here and there with a bit more focus on the circumstances of the characters and the implications of their actions outside of strengthening the harem tag could have made this a pretty decent show.This anime has pretty inconsistent animation. The first few episodes scream low-budget and sometimes the mouthflaps don\'t even sync with the dialogue. The anime then proceeds to have good animation quality in the middle before devolving towards the end. Being studio Trigger there is plenty of exaggerated moves to punctuate comedy and it\'s pretty great. It\'s just that the scenes they are in aren\'t. The direction is something that miffed me. It\'s mostly harmless with plenty of shot-reverse shots but there\'s parts where they noticeably cut way too much which breaks up the pacing and tone of the scene. Especially egregious was Hatoko\'s call-out scene where they tried way too many different shots and cuts and even included an obnoxious text-on-screen effect (with associated loud sound effect) like it was JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure or a comic books or something. Thank goodness Hayami Saori can carry a scene by herself. The music is...meh...so generic and sometimes over-played. Nothing notable stood out to elevate a scene. The voice acting was pretty good for the most part. The voice actors played their parts naturally. Just wished they had a better script to work with.Overall I didn\'t get anything from Inou Battle. At least, nothing that I couldn\'t get more of and in better quality in other anime. The themes and tone of the show are apparent but the characters don\'t have the chance to pull them through to the viewer. The pacing is shot for the most part and the anime falls into way too many pitfalls of writing which leads to bouts of boring exposition and plenty of characters thrown to the wayside even though they\'re given more screentime than they should have been given. Honestly, just watch Chu2 if you want similar interactions and themes to this show. I would also recommend Sakurasou no Pet nad Kanojo for a farm far superiour romance and Imouto sae ireba ii for an actual grounded SoL that successfully subverts the genre it tries to parody while still maintaining compelling characters.Thanks for reading!', 'people seem or probably misunderstand the anime story and why is it just a ""normal High-school harem genre anime"" or so that\'s what they call it, and I feel like I understand what does the anime title means now, and why is everything seems so normal..

The character development could have been a lot better with lesser time consumption. The progress of the show was...slow. The direction was not good either.

This may be due at least in part to it being an adaptation, but I can\'t comment on that having not read the source material.In any case, it starts out really strong. The premise is really fun and initially well done. Even though there are superpowers, they\'re there as a comedic device to create interesting situations. For awhile, there was no indication that it would stray from keeping to its premise of a regular high school club suddenly gaining superpowers, experimenting, and having a laugh with them. The characters all seemed really interesting...at first, and it looked like a few more superpower-wielding characters were set to be introduced.Unfortunately, things went downhill steadily, starting after the introduction of the first new superpower user... because, well, despite being introduced, she then promptly disappears and is hardly touched again. After this, Inou-Battle experiences an identity crisis. What started out as a light-hearted comedy suddenly takes a dark turn out of nowhere with the introduction of the ""fairy war"" concept and a large cast of undeveloped characters who somehow get additional screen time despite this. But just as suddenly as it turns dark, it jumps back to comedy. Then romance. Then you start to notice it\'s feeling like a harem because all of the conveniently female club members start falling for the male lead. Meanwhile, you realize that you haven\'t seen or heard anything about the club\'s superpowers in several episodes, with the only superpower-related scenes being about the completely unrelated fairy war with the cast of extras who are ultimately never connected to the main cast. And, in the end, the romance aspect never goes anywhere either.The farther into the show you get, the more distorted it becomes. As I mentioned at the beginning, I suspect this is likely because of poor adaptation. It seems to me that the producers wanted to focus on the light-hearted comedy aspect, using the superpowers and characters\' personalities/interactions. However, they ended up shackled by having to include the original aspects of the source material, which presumably include the darker parts of the story. However, without enough time to develop everything in detail, the serious side just ends up as a disaster that ruins a perfectly good comedy.As much as I loved the first few episodes, I can\'t in good conscience recommend watching this anime because I think that, like me, you\'ll end up disappointed. The strong start makes the terrible mess that it becomes so much harder to endure.However, if you like chuunibyou and superpower comedy with a touch of seriousness, I recommend Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai.

Penguin's Memory: Shiawase Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16434/Penguins_Memory__Shiawase_Monogatari,"['[SPOILER FREE/SHORT REVIEW]This is a hidden gem. The fact that only 340 people have got this on their list is quite disappointing. I am currently taking part in the recommendation clubs August/September challenge. I have to watch a show from each year from 1985-2004 in the next two months. I found this browsing the archived seasonal charts and thought, ""Hmm, this might just be stupid enough to be enjoyable!"".Let me say, I was wrong. This is not stupid at all! This was such an eyeopener for me! This film looks silly. Bearing in mind my thoughts going into it, the first shot was a...bunch of penguins lined up in bush firing M16\'s at other penguins and I laughed so hard I had to pause to take a breather. However, once this action tones down a bit, we are introduces to our main characters. Three best friend penguins, one of which was just wounded. They have a good talk and at this point it all sinks in. This film is serious.This film focuses less on the combat and much more on character development and what war does to an individual. An individual who has lost things very close to them. An individual who wants to live a quiet life as a librarian, where he can be surrounded by the poetry that motivates him to keep pushing forward through tough times.This was released in 1985, and I would say that the artwork is average even for its time, though with the exception of the first and third scene, there isn\'t a lot of heavy animation anyway. It is a very dialogue and character driven story. The music and sound was also pretty average, though I couldn\'t point to anything I disliked.A 7/10 is a good score, something I give to anime that I don\'t want to forget about. It isn\'t given to a ""meh"" piece of throwaway entertainment. Its something that I enjoyed immensely. bunch of penguins lined up in bush firing M16\'s at other penguins and I laughed so hard I had to pause to take a breather.

It is a very good presentation in tone and mood. Perfectly conveys the emotional states of the characters. Music is high quality and memorable and very melancholy. I cried like a baby through most of the movie. The external conflicts weren't that great or were resolved easily. The internal conflicts were the main draw dealing with war,death, ptsd, survivors guilt, finding peace, and whether to choose love over your dreams. A very good movie to watch when you're in a sad place mentally as it can provide catharsis and optimism. Especially with the people being...cute penguins, there is a juxtaposition between an almost idealized small town America and the heavy themes. While the movie doesn't delve too much into the hard topics, it leaves the viewer to interpret the main character's struggles with them. Not bad considering it's apparently an ad for Suntori Beer. cute penguins, there is a juxtaposition between an almost idealized small town America and the heavy themes.

Not bad considering it's apparently an ad for Suntori Beer."", 'Hmmm this was certainly an interesting watch. But the most interesting thing is actually how uninteresting it is. This movie is just a regular movie from the 80’s that happens to use animated penguins instead of actors. No penguin puns or references whatsoever, no flashy animation sequences that would be lost in live action. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t bad it was just absolutely nothing special. The only original thing it has going for it is the novelty that it is penguins. I will go in depth in the body but my final judgement and reccomendation lies in the conclusory paragraph if you wish...to skip.Story: 6/10I feel like I have seen this story at least 3 times before. It is nothing original. One could easily predict almost every single plot developement well before it happens. There are no twists, no new angles on the old clichés. Additionally since it is targeted at a slightly younger audience the violence, love, and tension are sort of dialed down and minimized, making for a rather flat roller coaster ride. This movie is just plain vanilla. This might be partially due to the movies age but then you can’t say it has aged well. Additionally, at least tome, the ending was sort of chintzy as it apppeared pretty melodramatic tho this might be due to a difference in the legal system and societal attitude towards convicts and propriety in the  japanese 80’s and modern day America.Art: 8/10I personally don’t have much experience with art and animation criticism, and I have taken into account this movies age, so there isnt much to pan it on. It looks nice enough to even pretty good at times. I do have a few complaints tho and that is with the character design. The penguins rarely wear clothes and are for the most part drawn indistinguishably from eachother aside from a few minor details such as an accessory or slight change in head shape. This never becomes an actual issue as far as differentiating characters but the relative lack of diversity, especially among the main characters, makes it sort of boring i liked the unique design of some of the side characters and I wish there was more of that throughout. Another slight issue with the art direction is that the penguins small eyes, beaks, and plump faces did not lend themselves to being very expressive. This often left the voice acting and music to carry the emotionality of the scene once again resulting in a plain/boring product. So overall the art was good but not flawless imo. I can say that it was fun to look at the male penguins and in your head switch between a big eyed perspective and a big forehead perspective.Sound: 9/10The music was probably the all around best and most unique part of the show. The insert songs were spectacular. They were catchy and well suited suited to the scenes/ overall plot. The background music was fitting though not super memorable or inspiring but it blended well with the mood of the scenes. The voice acting was probably the weakest part of the sound production it was just so plain and sounded like voice acting rather than sounding like it was the penguins themselves speaking, this might just be a product of the timesbut I can’t help but feel a little disenchanted. So overall average asides from the insert song which might be the one thing that redeems this show from a sentence of deserving to fade in the sands of time.Characters: 6/10For most characters the most interesting thing about them is that they are penguins and this is an issue. It once again is probably due to age but most of the characters are boring to one dimensional. They were completely predictable and none were particularly compelling. The doctor was maybe the most interesting character and he had very little screen time. Another anachronism is just how weak/dependent the female characters are. I’m no feminist and I can definitely see merits in the argument but it still slightly put me off how one of the themes is that the female lead should give up her dreams to be a happy housewife instead. Especially since this theme countered the idea of the male lead making a full recovery from his PTSD and living a rich life rather than quitely pittering out. I guess these themes/character developments add a touch of realism to the story but it once again makes it sort of boring. My dinal issue/nonissue with the characters is why are they penguins. It ads nothing meaningful to the piece. In fact i think several arguments could be made that it detracts from the piece as far as relatability as well as the ability to read their emotions and emphasize. In reference to another work I recently finished, it was like a reverse oyasumi punpun. Representing the characters as penguins served to dull them and their emotional output, while punpun’s varying highly juxtaposed physical representation is one of the most lauded literary techniques in manga for how well it let you look inside punpun. So in short I don’t understand the choice of making them penguins. At the same time the fact that they are penguins and the novelty value this commands is pretty much the only reason anyone, including myself  watches this movie in the first place so I guess in one way or another it was an overall good choice.Overallthe movie wasn’t bad. Heck I won’t even forget the fact that I watched it just because the fact that its penguins. But I can’t say I particularly enjoyed it. It is pretty dull. In fact I watched it over the course of 8 or so hours because I kept on getting bored and having better things to do. I almost enjoy watching completely shitty movies because it then at least gives me the satisfaction of being disgusted at them. This movie is just plain and bland. In the end, I can only recommend you watch it for the novelty value/memes or in order to discover the insert songs. Other than that the movie is destined to fade away as the years go by or maintain its small novelty value because it simply doesn’t bring anything of substance to the table to keep it relevant. Thank you if you read this far. I also appreciate any feedback you have, whether your opinion differed on the movie or you have ideas on how I can improve my reviewal method. Thank you to skip.Story: 6/10I feel like I have seen this story at least 3 times before. It is nothing original. One could easily predict almost every single plot developement well before it happens. There are no twists, no new angles on the old clichés. Additionally since it is targeted at a slightly younger audience the violence, love, and tension are sort of dialed down and minimized, making for a rather flat roller coaster ride. This movie is just plain vanilla. This might be partially due to the movies age but then you can’t say it has aged well. Additionally, at least tome, the ending was sort of chintzy as it apppeared pretty melodramatic tho this might be due to a difference in the legal system and societal attitude towards convicts and propriety in the  japanese 80’s and modern day America.Art: 8/10I personally don’t have much experience with art and animation criticism, and I have taken into account this movies age, so there isnt much to pan it on. It looks nice enough to even pretty good at times. I do have a few complaints tho and that is with the character design. The penguins rarely wear clothes and are for the most part drawn indistinguishably from eachother aside from a few minor details such as an accessory or slight change in head shape. This never becomes an actual issue as far as differentiating characters but the relative lack of diversity, especially among the main characters, makes it sort of boring i liked the unique design of some of the side characters and I wish there was more of that throughout. Another slight issue with the art direction is that the penguins small eyes, beaks, and plump faces did not lend themselves to being very expressive. This often left the voice acting and music to carry the emotionality of the scene once again resulting in a plain/boring product. So overall the art was good but not flawless imo. I can say that it was fun to look at the male penguins and in your head switch between a big eyed perspective and a big forehead perspective.Sound: 9/10The music was probably the all around best and most unique part of the show. The insert songs were spectacular. They were catchy and well suited suited to the scenes/ overall plot. The background music was fitting though not super memorable or inspiring but it blended well with the mood of the scenes. The voice acting was probably the weakest part of the sound production it was just so plain and sounded like voice acting rather than sounding like it was the penguins themselves speaking, this might just be a product of the timesbut I can’t help but feel a little disenchanted. So overall average asides from the insert song which might be the one thing that redeems this show from a sentence of deserving to fade in the sands of time.Characters: 6/10For most characters the most interesting thing about them is that they are penguins and this is an issue. It once again is probably due to age but most of the characters are boring to one dimensional. They were completely predictable and none were particularly compelling. The doctor was maybe the most interesting character and he had very little screen time. Another anachronism is just how weak/dependent the female characters are. I’m no feminist and I can definitely see merits in the argument but it still slightly put me off how one of the themes is that the female lead should give up her dreams to be a happy housewife instead. Especially since this theme countered the idea of the male lead making a full recovery from his PTSD and living a rich life rather than quitely pittering out. I guess these themes/character developments add a touch of realism to the story but it once again makes it sort of boring. My dinal issue/nonissue with the characters is why are they penguins. It ads nothing meaningful to the piece. In fact i think several arguments could be made that it detracts from the piece as far as relatability as well as the ability to read their emotions and emphasize. In reference to another work I recently finished, it was like a reverse oyasumi punpun. Representing the characters as penguins served to dull them and their emotional output, while punpun’s varying highly juxtaposed physical representation is one of the most lauded literary techniques in manga for how well it let you look inside punpun. So in short I don’t understand the choice of making them penguins. At the same time the fact that they are penguins and the novelty value this commands is pretty much the only reason anyone, including myself  watches this movie in the first place so I guess in one way or another it was an overall good choice.Overallthe movie wasn’t bad. Heck I won’t even forget the fact that I watched it just because the fact that its penguins. But I can’t say I particularly enjoyed it. It is pretty dull. In fact I watched it over the course of 8 or so hours because I kept on getting bored and having better things to do. I almost enjoy watching completely shitty movies because it then at least gives me the satisfaction of being disgusted at them. This movie is just plain and bland. In the end, I can only recommend you watch it for the novelty value/memes or in order to discover the insert songs. Other than that the movie is destined to fade away as the years go by or maintain its small novelty value because it simply doesn’t bring anything of substance to the table to keep it relevant.

Thank you', 'Originally from Anilist:Shiawase Monogatari is a strange little film that has nearly been lost in the annals of history. You aren\'t likely to find it and are even less likely to find someone who has watched it. As an example of this, I only made the decision to watch and review this film because hardly anyone else has, and I cannot even recall how I heard of this movie.The plot follows as such: Mike is a (presumably) Little Penguin who is an American Vietnam War (referred in the anime as the Delta War) veteran who (like the rest of world) speaks Japanese. The story revolves...around Mike dealing with his PTSD and finding out if he can lead a normal life after the horrors he\'s been subject to......yes, it is an utterly odd as it sounds. A movie filled with Club Penguin-esque penguin deals with a shell-shocked veteran and it\'s played 100% for drama. Odder still is that Mike was the mascot for a brand of beer, something that you would not realize watching the movie. The strangeness of the movie is the only reason it\'s still remembered. The fact that cartoon penguins can have thousand yard stares or shoot automatic weapons isn\'t the most bizarre part of this movie.The most bizarre part is that it works.Or, at the very least, it did for me. Bear in mind that y profile is also of a screaming Kamille Bidan coupled with a cryptic image of Lain, thinking that it\'s cool or mysterious. I\'m not the best gauge of seriousness.But if you can look past the admittedly jarring character appearances, you;ll find a solid drama.While it\'s mostly known for being ""Club Penguin in Vietnam,"" Mike is out of the Vietcong-invested battleground within twenty minutes, meaning that most of the movie involves our main character trying to adjust back into life as a civilian. This doesn\'t go well at first, with everyone egging him to talk about the war he wants desperately to forget. Not being able to take it anymore, our avian ally flies the coop and leaves his hometown.I believe the movie handles PTSD really well, and I felt some of the best parts where when Mike initially tries and fails to live his life.In a new town, Mike finds love and the drama amps up. While the middle of the story is pretty ""meh,"" the story gains its footing again towards the end, and I was surprised that I found myself legitimately invested in the characters. The characters all act logically, and no one is annoying that isn\'t supposed to be. The ending may or may not surprise you, but this reviewer,at the very least, was pleasantly surprised.--Spoiler--One of my biggest gripes was how Jill was encouraged to give up her dream just so she could be with Mike. I guess I can chalk it up to a different time and/or society, but it still doesn\'t sit right with me.--Spoiler Over--Overall, I thought Penguin\'s Memory was a solid drama. It wasn\'t phenomenal or anything and if you\'re a diehard drama fan, you\'ve probably seen this story before, though probably not with cute penguins. Despite this, I had a surprisingly good time, though I\'ll admit my expectations weren\'t too high, and me being a sucker for romance gave it a few points. I could do without some of the songs, as I felt they didn\'t add anything to the movie, but I adored the ending song.7.69(8)/10Give it a watch if you have some free time. around Mike dealing with his PTSD and finding out if he can lead a normal life after the horrors he\'s been subject to......yes, it is an utterly odd as it sounds.

I wasn't expecting much from an old, niche anime movie, but everything about it is extremely solid, and deals with some rarely discussed topics in a subtle way. It becomes a narrative discussing the aftermath of traumatic experiences in a very realistic manner through the main character's daily life. It's very relaxing, and there's no over-the-top acting. The simple art style becomes very charming, with the core story dealing with some more serious, thought-provoking topics, so it is enjoyable for all audiences. It is a nice refresher and doesn't become draining as one...might expect. The pacing is a little slow compared to a lot of shows made recently, but it never drags on.

Alas, you just can\'t have everything now, can you? Somehow though, this movie became something of a guilty pleasure.I won\'t soothe the point here, this movie isn\'t technically good, and it is clear as day. Any human being watching this would have eyebrows raising at the wack, cheesy dialogue and question where these directors found the desperate salaryman who would now want to work as a voice actor on top of their already garbage job for that extra yen. I mean, seriously, you can be one of those people that likes everything,...but this is not passing your innate detection ability to understand something is off. Nonetheless… there\'s something in Penguin\'s Memory that makes it worth the while anyway; in my case, even worth the praise a lot would be unwilling to give.The plot is inherently entrancing, but the execution is mostly unengaging. It\'s fascinating, really. I felt the need to sleep the first time I tried to watch this, the second time was close, but I managed to prevail. I suppose the times in both cases were initially very late anyway, but I will leave it to you to decide how my case reflects your style. As the aforementioned stated, the dialogue is amateur, in addition to the unenthusiastic animation, disheartened delivery of every line and the somewhat haphazard jumps to suggest this was some kind of Disney musical on every occasion. It\'s just not good. However, the saving grace pulled a miracle and a half, balancing the tragic execution. The story is actually something enjoyable and a little unique. Mike, his PTSD, and his journeys all mix very well with each other when called for. When the scene sets and you know the clear intent of what is being relayed to you (found more so in the more philosophical and dramatic parts of the movie), you do get a reasonable and thoughtful section to consume and reflect upon. I suppose the dull voices masked in calmness do provide from time to time, but the whole movie doesn\'t work as a LOTGH type-beat dialogue or whatever has characters talking to each other as if it\'s just another day, especially when the scene is supposed to be heartfelt. Maybe cute penguins and the Vietnam War has bad chemistry.I will say that this guilty pleasure doesn\'t come with bad OST, though; it\'s anything but. It wouldn\'t even be so unreasonable to have this OST in your top 10. I will admit that one upbeat song with the children was kinda wild, but most of the tracks here are impeccable, immaculate, and pure elegance. I am mostly speaking of Seiko Matsuda\'s Sweet Memories (it\'s one of those songs you can truly have on repeat without it being tiring), but the others aren\'t even bad at all. They work so well at conveying what the scene tells and can stand alone with zero issues. Hell, there\'s even some decent symbolism which is something else considering what was going on with the production value. Aside from that note, the music does have more meaning when you actively see where it is used; it\'s not something that is mastered a lot in anime for some odd reason. Penguin\'s Memory hits the nail on how to present with music, allowing for stylish moments to come basically on command. It\'s all in all a blessing. Begs the question, does time have to do with anything? This is the city pop era, after all. I\'ll leave that to you.Try not to reject watching this after coming from the Club Penguin meme. Chances are you might not find it the most enjoyable thing in the world, many people do have a heart attack over anything before the year 2010, but I\'d say this one is not that bad. If not the movie, then I\'d recommend the commercials Suntory had using this movie and just find the OST on YT or something. You aren\'t missing out on a whole lot. To be honest, this anime might serve better to some as ""some obscure stuff I came across"", but I wouldn\'t use that label to describe it in its entirety. There is something legit going on with this movie, and it is enough to have my praise.

Shangri-La,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5220/Shangri-La,"['Everybody knows of at least one anime that, while being rather decent for the most part, is sorely let down by certain rudimentary failings which a little more planning could have easily resolved, and it\'s unfortunate that as anime has gradually become more commercially viable, this phenomenon steadily been increasing. It\'s a sad fact though that one of the main avoidable flaws is also one that a little common sense could fix.A case in point is Shangri-La.Adapted from the manga of the same name, which in turn is an adaptation of a series of science fiction light novels by Ikegami Eiichi, the anime version is...a reasonably good envisioning of the story. In what is effectively his first time directing a full series (movies notwithstanding), director Bessho Makoto has done a pretty decent job of bringing the series to life.Set in the mid 21st century, the world has become a very strange place indeed as an international committee forcefully imposed a ""carbon tax"" on all the CO2 producing nations of the world in order to mitigate the effects of Global Warming. The financial and economic markets of the world altered greatly because of this change as more nations poured their money into the carbon markets in an effort to offset their current tax levies. Unfortunately, Japan suffered a major earthquake which destroyed most of it\'s infrastructure during this time, and to further compound matters, Japan\'s carbon tax rate was not lifted out of fear it would set a precedent, making Japan one of the poorest nations on earth.However, a lifeline has been thrown to the ailing nation in the form of ATLAS, a project to rebuild Tokyo far above the ground, while the land itself is given over to the jungle.The story begins with a young girl being released from a Japanese detention center, where she has been for two years. She is Hojo Kuniko, the ""leader"" of the anti-government group known as Metal Age, and her newfound freedom sparks a chain of events which will shake the world.As far as the story goes, it can honestly be said that Shangri-La has almost everything anyone could possibly want, however this is also it\'s Achilles\' Heel. The plot, which is generally paced quite well, has a tendency to go off the beaten track in an effort to justify events in the anime, and this is where the whole thing begins to unravel.Quite simply, Shangri-La tries to cram far too much into 24 episodes. The rather lengthy introduction to the story earlier is an example of just how much content is in this anime, and while one can appreciate the effort that has gone into producing a viable screenplay, an experienced screenwriter like Onogi Hiroshi should really have known better than to try and put the whole story on screen. Likewise the director, having had some experience with the Ah! Megami-sama and Armitage: Dual Matrix movies, should have made the effort to keep things a little more simple.As it is right now, Shangri-La isn\'t a bad series, however the numerous twists, turns, plots, counterplots, double crosses, extortions, blackmails, vendettas, factions, and characters who have a stake in the future of Japan, all serve to cloud the story proper, and confuse the viewer who may be left scratching at some new direction to which the show has suddenly veered. While the series does try to tie up the various loose ends and explain what has actually happened, there is simply too much to absorb in one go, and many people may find themselves stretching the series out just so they can absorb what has already happened (and maybe make sense of it).For the most part the series is fairly well animated and the characters move nicely. However, whenever the show takes a turn towards action or combat, then the cracks begin to appear. The action sequences are decent enough in their own way, but there are numerous occasions when the characters somehow defy the laws of physics (Kuniko\'s spinning boomerang attack outside of ATLAS being a great example of this at work). One can only attribute this to a marked lack of attention to detail, or an attempt to make the show look ""cooler"" than it is. Whatever the case may be, Gonzo have let themselves down with Shangri-La as it is a long way from being their best work.On the plus side though, the backgrounds and settings are failry well realised. Likewise, the characters are also reasonably well designed, although there is degree of naivety inherent in this, especially in the case of Kuniko, as while the characters appear as individuals facially, their clothes never really seem to change at all (except for Momoko).To be honest, I was expecting somthing a little more in keeping with the theme and setting of the series given that the characters were designed by Range Murata (who also designed the characters for Last Exile and Blue Submarine No.6), but like everything in this show, this department is a bit of a mixed bag.Musically the show is a bit hit and miss. The OP, a boppy little J-Pop track called ""Kimi Shinitamo Koto Nakare"" by May\'n, has some extremely well choreographed visuals to go along with it. The ED is another J-Pop track, this time by Midori, called ""Hajimari no Asa ni Hikari Are"", and while it\'s a nice enough little ditty, it\'s not really memorable  in any way. Both the OP and ED are decent enough tracks, but the series is let down by some poor and cliched thematic music. That\'s not to say that all of the mood music in the anime is bad, no, it\'s simply that the usage of certain tracks is a bit on the silly side. One example in the very first episode occurs when the viewer is shown ATLAS for the very first time - cue the dark and foreboding ""Castle of Ultimate Despair"" style music. It\'s this cliched music usage that really spoils certain parts of the series as the viewer is left in no doubt who the bad guys are.Even if the show had tried to be a bit more ambiguous with their definitions of right and wrong (and oh how I wish they\'d gone down that route), the music would have simply given the game away.As far as the voice acting goes, it\'s pretty good on the whole. The cast are fairly talented, and are able to express a good degree of emotions, however there are several occasions where the drama is really ""hammed up"", which somewhat ruins the mood of the scene.One of the biggest problems with Shangri-La is it\'s wealth of characters. The show has several leads and numerous supporting characters, which on paper would make for some great development if handled correctly. Unfortunately,the development of most of the characters is often haphazard, or stunted completely, and the reason for this is because the series attempts to justify everything. In simpler terms, the show tries to give every regular character a reason for their actions, thoughts, idealogies, feelings, etc, and because of this there is no real focus on the lead roles because the show simply runs out of time - which is why many people find the ending to be extremely rushed.Shangri-La isn\'ta bad series, and I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t enjoy it. The show has many interesting concepts to recommend it, but none of them are ever fully explored due to the attempt by the screenwriter to cram the entire novel series into 24 episodes. The sci-fi twist is coupled with a supernatural angle later in the story, and while this is not a bad thing, the show uses this as a justification for certain actions and events without ever fully explaining the link. The trade shenanigans in virtual carbon could have made for an OVA at the very least, as could life in the show\'s version of Akihabara.Somewhere along the way the environmental message also went missing. Being ambitiousis all well and good, but it shouldn\'t be taken so far as to be a detriment to the series.On the whole this series has much to criticise about, however don\'t be fooled into thinking it\'s godawful because of it\'s flaws. It\'s said that the whole is greater than the sum of it\'s parts, and Shangri-La is an example of this at work. Even with the numerous flaws I was extremely surprised to find that the story was pretty engaging, the characters were amiable and relatable, the settings were nice to look at, and the majority of the music was fairly easy on the ears. It\'s these positives that are the reason why the series is raised above the level of medicority, and while the plot may be a little garbled and far too convoluted and involved for it\'s own good, that doesn\'t mean that the premise or story are bad. It simply means that one has to work that little bit harder to figure out what\'s actually going on.It\'s just unfortunate that, with so much potential inherent in the story, we didn\'t get to see the show as it should have been. Still, better luck next time, and hopefully Gonzo et al will learn from their mistakes. a reasonably good envisioning of the story.

Likewise, the characters are also reasonably well designed, although there is degree of naivety inherent in this, especially in the case of Kuniko, as while the characters appear as individuals facially, their clothes never really seem to change at all (except for Momoko).To be honest, I was expecting somthing a little more in keeping with the theme and setting of the series given that the characters were designed by Range Murata (who also designed the characters for Last Exile and Blue Submarine No.6), but like everything in this show, this department is a bit of a mixed bag.Musically the show is a bit hit and miss. The OP, a boppy little J-Pop track called ""Kimi Shinitamo Koto Nakare"" by May\'n, has some extremely well choreographed visuals to go along with it. The ED is another J-Pop track, this time by Midori, called ""Hajimari no Asa ni Hikari Are"", and while it\'s a nice enough little ditty, it\'s not really memorable  in any way. Both the OP and ED are decent enough tracks, but the series is let down by some poor and cliched thematic music. That\'s not to say that all of the mood music in the anime is bad, no, it\'s simply that the usage of certain tracks is a bit on the silly side. One example in the very first episode occurs when the viewer is shown ATLAS for the very first time - cue the dark and foreboding ""Castle of Ultimate Despair"" style music. It\'s this cliched music usage that really spoils certain parts of the series as the viewer is left in no doubt who the bad guys are.Even if the show had tried to be a bit more ambiguous with their definitions of right and wrong (and oh how I wish they\'d gone down that route), the music would have simply given the game away.As far as the voice acting goes, it\'s pretty good on the whole. The cast are fairly talented, and are able to express a good degree of emotions, however there are several occasions where the drama is really ""hammed up"", which somewhat ruins the mood of the scene.One of the biggest problems with Shangri-La is it\'s wealth of characters. The show has several leads and numerous supporting characters, which on paper would make for some great development if handled correctly. Unfortunately,the development of most of the characters is often haphazard, or stunted completely, and the reason for this is because the series attempts to justify everything. In simpler terms, the show tries to give every regular character a reason for their actions, thoughts, idealogies, feelings, etc, and because of this there is no real focus on the lead roles because the show simply runs out of time - which is why many people find the ending to be extremely rushed.Shangri-La isn\'ta bad series, and I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t enjoy it. The show has many interesting concepts to recommend it, but none of them are ever fully explored due to the attempt by the screenwriter to cram the entire novel series into 24 episodes. The sci-fi twist is coupled with a supernatural angle later in the story, and while this is not a bad thing, the show uses this as a justification for certain actions and events without ever fully explaining the link. The trade shenanigans in virtual carbon could have made for an OVA at the very least, as could life in the show\'s version of Akihabara.Somewhere along the way the environmental message also went missing. Being ambitiousis all well and good, but it shouldn\'t be taken so far as to be a detriment to the series.On the whole this series has much to criticise about, however don\'t be fooled into thinking it\'s godawful because of it\'s flaws. It\'s said that the whole is greater than the sum of it\'s parts, and Shangri-La is an example of this at work. Even with the numerous flaws I was extremely surprised to find that the story was pretty engaging, the characters were amiable and relatable, the settings were nice to look at, and the majority of the music was fairly easy on the ears. It\'s these positives that are the reason why the series is raised above the level of medicority, and while the plot may be a little garbled and far too convoluted and involved for it\'s own good, that doesn\'t mean that the premise or story are bad. It simply means that one has to work that little bit harder to figure out what\'s actually going on.It\'s just unfortunate that, with so much potential inherent in the story, we didn\'t get to see the show as it should have been. Still, better luck next time, and hopefully Gonzo et al will learn from their mistakes.', 'I happened to have caught the first episode of this anime on it\'s air date and I stuck it through all the way to the end.  I must say that I am very pleased as upon finishing this anime I am left with that ""epic journey"" feeling.

Lots of awesome explosions, nice backgrounds, action scenes and the characters were drawn well (particularly the transsexuals who definitely looked like transsexuals)SOUND 7/10 - I personally can\'t remember any of the background music and I don\'t think there were any notable inserts which says enough for itself.  The SFX were up to date and what they should be, sounded great.  I give it a 7 cause I enjoyed the opening and ending credits which to me can sometimes make or break an anime if it\'s borderline.CHARACTER 8/10 - Main character is very like-able, cute but not drenched in ""moe"" which is a plus in my opinion.  A lot of the other notable characters are cute little girls as well.  What I found the most interesting was the presence of a couple transsexuals in the main cast that played a big role in the story.  They fit their roles really well, ironically playing motherly roles with those touchy family like bonds as well as having their own sense of transsexual humor.  They may be one of the more memorable assets to this anime.ENJOYMENT 7/10 - Simply put, I enjoyed it : ).

The so called Earth as we know it now has suffered damage from global warming and now nations have systems that could eliminate the carbon footprint to save itself.

And this was the case with the beautifully drawn, beautifully enacted, and beautifully thought over Shangri-La.', ""To all the budding writers and screenwriters out there, I say this: there are a lot of models of what to do.  No doubt you know them, stories you've watched or read that moved you, made you feel, or made you think.  But if you ever need a sample of what not to do, or how to put things together wrong, I have good news!  You've got Shangri-la.In some ways, this is a hard one for me, because when I review something, even something bad, I'd rather be sparing with the vitriol.  There are plenty of reviewers who curse a lot,...or even come up with good creative smackdowns, so I try to keep a somewhat more academic tone.  But there are only so many times I can say “That didn't work.”  “Why was that here?”  “That was pointless.” or other such critiques before the litany becomes nothing more than conceptual noise.  I suppose that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, however, as 'Conceptual Noise' is a fair descriptor for Shangri-la.In that vein, let me introduce you to a concept you may have heard of, but probably not in the context of reviewing an anime: Signal-to-Noise Ratio.  Basically, it's the ratio of what you actually want (Signal) compared to the meaningless garbage that does nothing but waste your time and effort picking through it (Noise).  Shangri-la's Signal-to-Noise Ratio is terrible.  I think this is the biggest problem of the show – screen time is constantly wasted on themes, ideas, characters, and plot arcs that go nowhere and ultimately add nothing to the core of the show.  They exist, they waste your time, and if you cut them out entirely you would find you missed out on surprisingly little.  Here's a quick list of the characters who were utterly worthless: Kunihito (a theoretically main character), Yuri, Souichirou, Nagiko, Leon, Shion, Kanaria, Shougo, Takehiko, Tarsian, and Tomoko (though at least she was briefly entertaining).  More characters like Karin (along with her supporting cast of Klaris, Zhang, and Medusa.  More on them later.) and Mikuni (along with her supporting cast of Sayoko and Mi-ko) failed to amount to anything in the grand scheme of things, but don't really count as completely wasted because at least they provided some material of intrinsic value in the middle.Some of this is down to the fact that the actual conflict in the climax comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere.  I'm not opposed to twists, not by a long shot.  But to do a twist well – and this can surprise amateur writers – it needs to be set up, and still flow from what came before.  When the truth is revealed in the movie Psycho, it's entirely consistent with what you've seen up until that point, even if it is surprising for the unspoiled.  Just because something couldn't be predicted doesn't make it a good twist.  I wouldn't have predicted it if after 22 episodes of Shangri-la everybody was eaten by Titans in 23 only for Eren Jaeger to show up in 24... but that wouldn't have made it a good twist or a good climax.  Shangri-la doesn't quite do that, but it gets about as close to an unintentional Outside Context scenario as a real narrative, even a poorly-constructed one, could be expected to come.The thing is, it's not just the climax.  The climax is the worst about it by far, but the whole show establishes and sheds elements, clearly not caring about how its universe ties together, disregarding any concept of thematic consistency.  Its structure is a wreck, a decaying Frankenstein's Monster made of pieces cobbled together and not caring when one happens to fall off.  The show starts with an environmental message that's about as subtle as a brick... but that falls by the wayside pretty quickly.  There's a major plot about market manipulation, but while that's setup for more of the show, it really isn't supported as a theme itself.  Even Kuniko's revolution isn't the point in the end; at about the two-thirds mark it falls by the wayside, never to return to focus.  Instead we get new, different arcs, that are often not really predicated on what came before, and many of which don't bear on what comes after.As a result, the story is a wreck.  It's a rare failure in that any given component part could be at least decent in isolation, or if supported by a different plot or setting but here's the thing...  Lego bricks are fine in isolation.  They're great toys that can be used to build up any number of creative constructions.  But if you take a bunch of Legos, put them in a bag, squirt in superglue, and shake until the glue dries, the mass of plastic waste you'll dump out won't have any of the good qualities it could have had despite the quality of the parts.  Shangri-la is like that, and the more you stick with it and realize that, the more painful it becomes to watch.Even the characters, while better constructed than the plot, suffer the same problem of adapting to serve the flavor of the moment, disregarding logic, consistency, and their own potential.  For instance, when we're first introduced to Mikuni, we see her use her psychic powers to kill a retainer who lied to her.  Over time, her habit of asking tough questions to those who see her is referred to as a “test”.  She seems unrepentant, even pleased with such an outcome, and I labored on the mistaken assumption that her abilities were mind-reading and psychokinesis until at least halfway through the show and that she deliberately killed liars.  Only towards the end are we supposed to believe that the painful death is out of her control and not something she likes to see happen.  It doesn't add up.  There are a lot of other reveals like that; some of them aren't set up or given the time they need to have an impact, while others feel like they downright contradict themselves.The flaws, though, do extend all the way down.  They're more glaring and terrible when the show has built up, but from very early on you can start to recognize something wrong: the show doesn't have consistency in its theme.  Far be it from me to say something like “You can't have a setting with both cyberpunk and magic”.  Because that's blatantly false.  A ton of good pieces of media can have very unique settings that include both a scientific understanding of the world and a mystical one, advanced technology right alongside arcane sorcery.  There is, however, a right way and a wrong way to create a setting like that, and the hallmark of the right way is going to be that the disparate elements feel like they're parts of the same whole.In the RPG Shadowrun, you can have elves and trolls and shamans alongside megacorps and hackers and techno-future cityscapes because the trolls can be hackers, or the elves might be executives in a megacorp, or the shamans cast their rituals in the dingy alley of the futuristic city.  In Shangri-la, the themes it juggles spend a lot of time compartmentalized.  When we check up with Mikuni, she doesn't feel like she belongs in Atlas, or the world that Atlas exists in: her palace of perpetual moonlight, for most of the show, could be an entirely separate dimension from the one in which Kuniko and her Metal Age friends live.  If it weren't for the occasional character visiting the 'other world' you wouldn't even know you were in the same show.  Karin and Kuniko aren't quite as far from each other as either of them is from Mikuni, but they still represent fairly divorced ideas from one another.Kuniko is, at least in her pitch, a rebel.  The story she wants to engage in, that her existence naturally gravitates towards, is a story about the struggle of have-nots against oppressive elites.  Karin, at the same basic level, is a white-collar criminal.  A likable one, perhaps, but that's what she is.  Her “natural” story is much more of a high-concept thriller, about the nature of AI or attempting to get ahead within a broken system.  They're both cyberpunk stories (more or less) but they're so different that they shouldn't intersect.  These characters shouldn't be in the same narrative with the emotional weights and investment they're given.  Kuniko's character type doesn't exist in Karin's story, and Karin's is a villain in Kuniko's sort of story, which isn't how she's portrayed.It seems like that was probably deliberate, but it wasn't a good choice.  With a lot of skill and effort, some writers might have been able to pull it off, to have these characters from different sub-genres or even genres meet and interact and make it interesting and consistent, but that's not what the writers behind Shangri-la do.  And it gets dramatically harder to pull off when there are at least three 'worlds' rather than just two.  And the narrative capable of pulling off the X meets Y meets Z scenario would know how Outside Context Problems work, and how to make them compelling for the viewer.  It could be interesting to have a Mikuni-type character living in this strange bubble world-within-a-world have to go out and encounter a whole new genre, but to do that, and to get the emotions of the viewer on the same page with the emotions of the character, you'd want them to explicitly have an initial separation.  Mikuni both exists in Atlas and in her own little world.  Kuniko both follows her own story, the arguable main plot, and gracelessly intrudes on Karin's.  This is a case where the writers tried to have their cake and eat it too, and it just doesn't go as is.And... I've talked about the climax already, and how a show with an already cracked foundation falls apart, but I think it's worth the time to say: it's worse than that.  The downfall of Shangri-la isn't just that the core problems add up and cascade into major issues.  Which they do, but it goes beyond.  The skill showed in setting up Shangri-la, or the lack thereof, continues throughout and frankly gets worse in the story's final act.  Multiple times in the last third, increasing into the final few episodes, my train of thought came to a screeching halt to demand “Why?!”.  Reveals are made that are utterly nonsensical.  Why?  Characters drop in and out of the story in a continuous roulette wheel of appearing to die only to show up fine.  Why?  Entire new plot elements emerge that belong to nothing before and sometimes have no effect on anything that comes after.  Why?  We waste tons of time on lame exposition telling us things that had already been explained in fewer words, with no emotional investment in the new explanation and no reason to do it with soulless narration when it could have been effective with either real scenes or visual storytelling.  Why?  The vast majority of everything done by every character over the course of the show has absolutely no bearing on the final act, which has different stakes and different conflict from anything that was set up before.  Why?  Why any of this?  Why did we even bother with the vast majority of the show?The answer is that the writing is just that bad.  If the writers knew what they wanted to do they didn't know how to do it, and I'm not sure they even knew what they wanted.The closest thing we get to a good story is the story of Karin and Medusa.  Barring the episode with Kanaria, which comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere the show couldn't have gone without it, her story is internally consistent and has some good emotional notes.  If you just threw the main plot in the trash, and many of the other side plots, Karin's storyline at least resembles the skeleton of a good story, rather than jumbled pieces.  It has a beginning, middle, and end that go together alright; I felt like I understood her character and her struggles; her chain of events was logically consistent; she had a solid and consistent theme; and I even felt something from the climax of her arc – which is more than I can say for the main plot or any of the other side stories that Shangri-la throws away.There are aspects of Shangri-la that aren't bad: the technical aspects.  The art looks pretty decent, and while you should tone your expectations way down from the opening (this isn't an action show, and the action scenes there are run the gamut from alright to actually kind of bad) I can't say it's actually terrible.  At least there's some flow, some good backgrounds, and the characters do move when they're supposed to be moving, which is more than I could say for some other shows where the writing is as bad as Shangri-la's.  The sound too, is... fine I guess?  The music is inoffensive and usually fits the scene, and the character voices usually sell what they are pretty well.  There can be times when a performance is just a bit annoying or a delivery sounds forced, but I'm not sure what actors could make some of the lines they're given sound natural.  Some, particularly Nagiko and Tarsian, could have done better about not sounding like they were reading off a script they didn't really care about, but even if they didn't give 100% they gave more than the writers.Shangri-la is a disappointment.  A huge disappointment.  It didn't start strong, but even with that being the case it just got weaker and weaker as it progressed.  Sometimes Karin or Kuniko approached at least decent writing, but Shangri-la as a whole utterly fails to accomplish any level of quality.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 2 (and one of those points is just for Karin and MEDUSA in isolation.)Art: 6Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 2Total: 3 (3.8)Verdict: Unless you want to spend about twelve hours getting an object lesson on how NOT to create speculative fiction, skip Shangri-la and try to forget you ever looked its way. or even come up with good creative smackdowns, so I try to keep a somewhat more academic tone.  But there are only so many times I can say “That didn't work.”  “Why was that here?”  “That was pointless.” or other such critiques before the litany becomes nothing more than conceptual noise.

This is a case where the writers tried to have their cake and eat it too, and it just doesn't go as is.And... I've talked about the climax already, and how a show with an already cracked foundation falls apart, but I think it's worth the time to say: it's worse than that.  The downfall of Shangri-la isn't just that the core problems add up and cascade into major issues.  Which they do, but it goes beyond.  The skill showed in setting up Shangri-la, or the lack thereof, continues throughout and frankly gets worse in the story's final act.  Multiple times in the last third, increasing into the final few episodes, my train of thought came to a screeching halt to demand “Why?!”.  Reveals are made that are utterly nonsensical.  Why?  Characters drop in and out of the story in a continuous roulette wheel of appearing to die only to show up fine.  Why?  Entire new plot elements emerge that belong to nothing before and sometimes have no effect on anything that comes after.  Why?  We waste tons of time on lame exposition telling us things that had already been explained in fewer words, with no emotional investment in the new explanation and no reason to do it with soulless narration when it could have been effective with either real scenes or visual storytelling.  Why?  The vast majority of everything done by every character over the course of the show has absolutely no bearing on the final act, which has different stakes and different conflict from anything that was set up before.  Why?  Why any of this?  Why did we even bother with the vast majority of the show?The answer is that the writing is just that bad.  If the writers knew what they wanted to do they didn't know how to do it, and I'm not sure they even knew what they wanted.The closest thing we get to a good story is the story of Karin and Medusa.  Barring the episode with Kanaria, which comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere the show couldn't have gone without it, her story is internally consistent and has some good emotional notes.  If you just threw the main plot in the trash, and many of the other side plots, Karin's storyline at least resembles the skeleton of a good story, rather than jumbled pieces.  It has a beginning, middle, and end that go together alright; I felt like I understood her character and her struggles; her chain of events was logically consistent; she had a solid and consistent theme; and I even felt something from the climax of her arc – which is more than I can say for the main plot or any of the other side stories that Shangri-la throws away.There are aspects of Shangri-la that aren't bad: the technical aspects.  The art looks pretty decent, and while you should tone your expectations way down from the opening (this isn't an action show, and the action scenes there are run the gamut from alright to actually kind of bad) I can't say it's actually terrible.  At least there's some flow, some good backgrounds, and the characters do move when they're supposed to be moving, which is more than I could say for some other shows where the writing is as bad as Shangri-la's.  The sound too, is... fine I guess?  The music is inoffensive and usually fits the scene, and the character voices usually sell what they are pretty well.  There can be times when a performance is just a bit annoying or a delivery sounds forced, but I'm not sure what actors could make some of the lines they're given sound natural.  Some, particularly Nagiko and Tarsian, could have done better about not sounding like they were reading off a script they didn't really care about, but even if they didn't give 100% they gave more than the writers.Shangri-la is a disappointment.  A huge disappointment.  It didn't start strong, but even with that being the case it just got weaker and weaker as it progressed.  Sometimes Karin or Kuniko approached at least decent writing, but Shangri-la as a whole utterly fails to accomplish any level of quality.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 2 (and one of those points is just for Karin and MEDUSA in isolation.)Art: 6Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 2Total: 3 (3.8)Verdict: Unless you want to spend about twelve hours getting an object lesson on how NOT to create speculative fiction, skip Shangri-la and try to forget you ever looked its way."", 'Shangri-La is a weird show to me because I honestly can\'t tell who this show is for. With a long list of story lines and plot threads all mashed up together, all trying to tell there own stories with varied tones and subject matter, you would think in all of that there would at least be something you can like about this show, or at very least something positive to take away from it. In actuality this show feels like what was intended to be many different ideas that were intended to have their own series devoted to them got crammed together like some sort...of anime soup. I don\'t mean to take away from the writer though, in actuality I thought that many of the plot elements in this show had potential.What could have been is sort of the tune I\'ll be singing to though. From the very start of episode one I felt this way. At first it seems like a interesting take on the post apocalyptic setting, In which the worlds polar ice caps are melting at such an alarming rate that populations across the world are forced to consolidate their living space and leave most big cites to be taken over by the forest out of necessity to keep the worlds carbon balance at bay. This show also shows what a word economy based on carbon would be like, these are actually some of the most entertaining parts of the show to me but I realize I\'m not everyone.And this is where the biggest problem this series is put in full spot light, the main character Kuniko is one of the least interesting people in the story. There are a TON of interesting sub-plots in this show that easily overshadow the ""main story."" The only interesting things that happen in this show are things that usually have little to nothing to do with Kuniko. I guess I just personally dislike her to some extent simply because I was much more interested in the side characters. So I beg ask the question, Is it that Kuniko is badly written or that the supporting cast is just written better than she is? I don\'t rightfully know myself, if you decide to watch this then I guess you will come to your own conclusions. The supporting cast I mentioned before is quite interesting, and in some resects is worth checking the show out for. You have Momoko, the trans-sexual motherly figure to Kuniko ( wow, I never thought I\'d write that). Karin the carbon terrorist (sort of) and just over all economical badass. And Mikuni-sama, the mysterious little girl that carries a strange disease that doesn\'t allow her to go out in the sun, but does seemingly give her some horrifying powers. And Kuniko has a boomerang, riveting. The characters do give this show some redeeming qualities so if you are just looking for a few neat characters to tickle your fancy (not like that) then you could pick a worse show.The story is still a mess though.""Okay, lets have an episode with a lot of action in it!""""Wont that drain our budget and force us to spend way too long focusing on the supporting cast since Kuniko is a action based character?""""Shut up! No one will care about this show if we don\'t blow most of our budget on the first half!Now animate some more explosions and have that one chick beat up the waiter guy again, that doesn\'t make people feel uncomfortable at all.""Shangri-La is very average in my opinion. It has some good things going for it, but at the same time a lot of stupid crap as well. Mediocre is probably the best way to describe this in short.This show has been licensed by Funimation, and is relatively cheap on DVD.

It took them 10 years but after the repeated failures even the fanboys started to have their doubts. So as soon as this show is announced, most tried to find some hints that may lead to the series being good for a change. The cover picture sure didn’t look promising, since all we see is a pink-haired loli with a boomerang. But alas, the character designer is Renge Murata, who drew the casts of Last Exile and Blue Submarine No.6. With such a great...character designer, this show can’t possibly fail!... Or that is what they thought. Silly gonzotards, this was the best claim they could come up with; anything vaguely reminded of Last Exile is auto-win. Since when was Last Exile a great show to begin with? And since when is something as unimportant as character looks the most important thing in a show? Maybe in storyless moe this stands true but this is not the case. Anyways, the show turned out to be indeed nothing more than what the main picture was showing all along: A pink-haired loli with a boomerang. OBVIOUS OR WHAT?So what is the story about anyway? Basically it is a retarded version of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. It is about the world being taxed on how much they pollute the environment, and how some cities are redesigned as places where the air is filtered. It is about jungles and cities mixing together and security organizations attacking civilian areas if the slightest change in carbon dioxide is spotted. This interesting concept is of coursed completely trashed at the hands of the idiots writing the script, so all attempts at trying to make the series to appear intelligent, pro-ecological and social-political are turned to a travesty… Oh, did I tell you there are actual transvestites in this series?Although the setting is a mature sci-fi dystopia, the characters living in it are a bunch of shounen and moe archetypes, completely irrelevant to their surrounds. This alone destroys any credibility in getting to like the themes, since what you get is like a tropical forest full of pink polar bears.- Here you are watching a world trying to recover from a devastating ecological catastrophe and then a loli appears that to the most part she is being vulgar to her peers and jumps all over the place while her mini skirt mysteriously doesn’t follow the laws of physics and stays down all the time. She fights by using a boomerang that somehow is more powerful than a hundred soldiers and a dozen tanks that are constantly firing at her. She is not all alone of course; she is aided by her transvestite friends who love to molest soldiers during battles. Yes, you just see the quality oozing from the scriptwriters’ armpits.- Here you are watching a rather complicating economical system of taxing based on carbon dioxide emissions which is deciding the fate of entire nations. And then a blond hacker loli with a teddy bear hacks everything with a magical creature and the balance of funds changes as it feels like it. Woah, amazing tactics there you guys.- Here you are watching a jungle that feels closer to a Wizard of Oz forest.- Why the devil is the heroine dressed as a school girl in a setting that has no high schools? Why is her hair pink? Half-assed otaku bait bullcrap; that’s why.- Everything is explained in forced monologues and in your face, in the most fake way possible. There is no way they would be so explanatory about things they know so well for decades.- And despite the forced explanations, almost nothing seems to make sense in the logrun. It’s like the characters break the fourth wall to tell you how their unicorn turns invisible but otherwise never tell you where the devil did they found the unicorn in the first place.- The directing is horrible as usual. Most events are hardly presented with the gravity they deserve, they are either too superficial, or too vague, or too slow, or too rushed. It makes you thing everything is, like GONZO, a farce.The production values are also not good. Although the sceneries are quite captivating with their detailed jungles and industrial areas, the foreground is one big mess of generic and usually crudely drawn character figures, random action scenes, and messy BGM that is thrown almost randomly at each scene. So much for Murata’s designs saving the show you gonzotards! They look awful! Especially the trannies.What is even worse is that you will not be able to remember any of the characters. Theirs looks and personalities are so simple and stupid, they get automatically deleted from your brain five minutes after the episode is over. Most of them don’t even have backdrop stories, and those who do are barely hinted but never clearly explained. Their motivations also make no sense at all and they seem to change their minds for no reason, all the time. You can’t even remember them based on their clothes because the main loli is dressed as generically as it gets, while the more flamboyant personalities such as the trannies and the crazy company mistress change clothes on every episode. So no wonder that the only things I remember from the over fifty characters in this show are a boomerang thrown by some generic moe girl, some power that kills you by telling a lie to another boring loli, and TRAAAANIEEES!And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks good superficially)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (eye-catchy)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 3/10Voice Acting 1/3 (retarded and corny)Music Themes 1/4 (forgettable and unfit)Sound Effects 1/3 (basic)STORY SECTION: 4/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 0/2 (chaotic)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (rushed and messy)CHARACTER SECTION: 2/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 1/2 (generic)Backdrop 0/2 (barely exists)Development 0/2 (random to the point of not existing)Catharsis 0/2 (what who where what?)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (no point in doing so)Memorability 1/4 (it will give you nightmares but you will forget it eventually)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Nice setting but otherwise horrible.

I can't say it's the best show ever but it certainly ranks pretty high in my book."", 'Overview:The post-apocalyptic genre is one that has been done to death in just about every form of media you can think of, yet has proven to remain popular even to this day. ""Shangri-La"", an anime by Gonzo originally released in 2009, is one of the lesser known examples of the genre, and is in equal parts an example of what to do and what NOT to do with it. It\'s an intriguing series to be sure, but it never manages to make the most of that intrigue, and is a very mixed bag overall.Story (6.5/10):Set many years after an earthquake ravaged Japan, the human population...has been split into two main factions- the elite, who live in a grand, futuristic tower named Atlas, and the refugees, who live a ramshackle town called Duomu and have to regularly take up arms in order to get through day by day. Belonging to the latter group is our protagonist, Kuniko Hojo, an 18-year-old girl who has recently been released from a detention centre and is being trained to become the future leader of a resistance group called Metal Age, who serve as the main providers of supplies for people in the slums. While Kuniko and her friends are performing a raid on Atlas, Kuniko discovers an unpleasant truth- Atlas has more than enough vacancies for everyone living in Duomu, which can only mean the higher-ups are selfish jerks who would rather keep it all to themselves. After this, Kuniko becomes determined to take what she and her people are owed and fight for a better future.The story is interesting and complex, I\'ll admit. Unfortunately, it also has a serious problem with getting to the point! Even though the truth about Atlas is revealed at the end of the third episode, it isn\'t until just over halfway though the series that any meaningful attack on it is launched. Between all of this is a set-up that feels like it goes on for much longer than necessary. There\'s even some attempt to question as to whether Metal Age are really doing the right thing, which would probably have had the intended impact if it wasn\'t for the fact that the supreme leader of Atlas is clearly shown to be a selfish psychopath who openly admits that she sees everything and everyone as tools for her amusement, and whatever problems the people in Atlas might have can\'t even begin to compare to those of the people in Doumu, something Kuniko herself even points out. There\'s even an arc where Kuniko is sent back to the detention centre for a few episodes, during which pretty much nothing noteworthy happens aside from Kuniko\'s first face-to-face meeting with the main villain, making it feel like empty padding more than anything. Fortunately, I can say that the second half of the series is a lot better than the first, but that really isn\'t saying much since it was a pretty low bar to clear.Even beyond the very slow-paced beginning (which I\'ve honestly come to expect from Gonzo anime, anyway), the series often ends up confused and entangled in its own narrative. Throughout the series, there are no less than four stories going on simultaneously, and while some of them are decently enjoyable (Mikuni\'s story being a highlight), there are others that I couldn\'t make sense of for the life of me. The biggest example of this would be that of Karin Ishida, a young girl and genius programmer who enjoys messing with the world\'s economy at her leisure. Throughout the series, I couldn\'t make heads or tails of the scenes involving Karin and couldn\'t really figure out why they were even in the series, considering the plot mainly revolves around a resistance group trying to overthrow a tyrannical government, and Karin\'s economic endeavours don\'t exactly lead to anything important. Ultimately, it\'s hard to say whether the series would have benefitted from more episodes or less, since while it does try to ram an awful lot into 24 episodes, a lot of the stuff it puts in feels really unnecessary and the series wouldn\'t lose much by removing it.Art & Animation (7.5/10):As is typical of a Gonzo anime, ""Shangri-La"" visuals are... not great, to put it bluntly. While the animations are good enough and there are some pretty decent character designs and minimal fanservice, dull colours, muddy textures and rough edges are very frequent. While the series doesn\'t look horrible by any stretch of the imagination, there\'s nothing about the visuals that stood out to me either, and so the best way to describe them would be ""average"".Sound & Dialogue (8/10):There really isn\'t all that much to say about ""Shangri-La""\'s soundtrack. It\'s barely even there a lot of the time and even when it is there, it mostly just blends into the background. The opening is also rather forgettable, though the two ending themes are both good in their own way and I will admit I enjoyed listening to them. The voice acting is generally very good, with Lindsay Siedel and Apphia Yu being particular highlights as Kuniko and Mikuni, respectively, and Austin Tindle doing a respectable job as Kunihito. Still, it can be very jarring to hear the voice of Kent Williams coming out of a transgender woman like Momoko, and I don\'t really know why they didn\'t go for a softer voice. All in all, the sound design has its problems, but it is still probably the best part of the series.Characters (7/10):The best way to describe Kuniko is that she\'s determined- once she has her mind set on something, she will not give in until she sees it through, and sometimes gets pissed at people who are easily willing to give up simply because they see no point in trying. Of course, determination won\'t get you far unless you have the strength to back it up, which Kuniko thankfully absolutely has, skilfully wielding a boomerang as big as she is and showing no hesitance to kill if necessary. What\'s more is that you can certainly tell that\'s she\'s been trained for a long time to take over Metal Age, as once things get going, she proves herself to be a very capable and charismatic leader. Unfortunately, while she is a likeable protagonist, she doesn\'t really undergo any major growth over the show\'s 24 episodes, which is especially noticeable give that she\'s the character we see the most of. The closest thing she gets to character development is becoming more determined to improve the lives of her people, something she\'s attempting to do even in the beginning. Also, and this is a rather minor criticism, but I found her character design to be rather lacking, as she looks like a kid despite being supposedly 18. Personally, I think they should have either made her a few years younger or have her look closer to her age. I\'d have been fine with either, honestly, because what\'s the point in making her older than the usual anime protagonist if she\'s not going to look it?Second in importance to Kuniko is Mikuni, a very pale young girl who lives in Atlas and is treated as royalty over there. Initially, she comes off as really creepy and ruthless, even habitually putting people to death for lying (which she is able to see through easily). However, it\'s later revealed that this isn\'t her fault, with the heavy implication being that she just doesn\'t know any better due to her upbringing in Atlas (as well as the fact that her power appears to be out of her control), and she is actually quite innocent and kind, if also rather annoying at times, as any child is. She also suffers from a condition that makes her vulnerable to sunlight, and as such rarely leaves her chambers. Her story runs parallel to Kuniko\'s for the majority of the series, with it not being until the second half that the two girls meet. While she\'s not quite as important to the story, I slowly but surely found myself liking Mikuni more than Kuniko (and every other character, for that matter), due to the fact that she actually has a character arc and undergoes some very noticeable changes over the series. Her story also has easily some of the most emotional moments in the anime, and towards the end I just wanted to give the poor girl a hug after all she had been through.The last member of the main cast is Kunihito Kusanagi, a military officer who resides in Atlas and works for their corporation, which naturally puts him at odds with Metal Age, whom he initially sees as a bunch of selfish rebels. That said, it\'s hard to call him a villain, as at the end of the day he\'s just a soldier doing his job and is more than willing to negotiate, even if he\'s not the best at it due to his refusal to see others\' points of view. Unfortunately, there isn\'t an awful lot to say about him compared to Kuniko and Mikuni, with his character type being one you\'ll find in many other anime, especially the ""Gundam"" franchise. Besides the main three, ""Shangri-La"" has a pretty sizeable supporting cast, some of which are interesting and likeable while others are forgettable or annoying. Among these is two transgender women, who rather than being treated as offensive jokes, are instead major characters with their own feelings, dreams, friendships, and roles to play, which is practically unheard of in anime. In general, the women in the series tend to have bigger roles and importance than the men do, with even the main villain being a woman who constantly expresses dominance over her male subordinates. As a whole, the cast is good, but there isn\'t anyone I found to be all that memorable.Enjoyment (7/10):""Shangri-La""\'s poor pacing not only hurts the storytelling, it also means the series can be pretty boring in the first half. While there are some action scenes, they aren\'t as common as you might think and multiple episodes can go by without their being any action at all. Ultimately, whether you\'re invested in what\'s going on or just bored out of your mind really depends on what part of the series you\'re currently watching, though I can at least say that things get a lot more exciting in the second half, though it can also be rather dark at times, with a number of notable character deaths.Overall:While ""Shangri-La"" isn\'t a bad anime per se, there isn\'t really anything about it that makes it stand out among other stories of its kind. The plot is all over the place, the visuals are dull, the soundtrack is passable at best and the characterization varies wildly in quality. It\'s worth watching if you\'re a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, but if you\'ve already had your fill of the genre, I would recommend either giving it a miss or saving it for when you have nothing else to watch.Score:6.5+7.5+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10 has been split into two main factions- the elite, who live in a grand, futuristic tower named Atlas, and the refugees, who live a ramshackle town called Duomu and have to regularly take up arms in order to get through day by day. Belonging to the latter group is our protagonist, Kuniko Hojo, an 18-year-old girl who has recently been released from a detention centre and is being trained to become the future leader of a resistance group called Metal Age, who serve as the main providers of supplies for people in the slums. While Kuniko and her friends are performing a raid on Atlas, Kuniko discovers an unpleasant truth- Atlas has more than enough vacancies for everyone living in Duomu, which can only mean the higher-ups are selfish jerks who would rather keep it all to themselves. After this, Kuniko becomes determined to take what she and her people are owed and fight for a better future.The story is interesting and complex, I\'ll admit. Unfortunately, it also has a serious problem with getting to the point! Even though the truth about Atlas is revealed at the end of the third episode, it isn\'t until just over halfway though the series that any meaningful attack on it is launched. Between all of this is a set-up that feels like it goes on for much longer than necessary. There\'s even some attempt to question as to whether Metal Age are really doing the right thing, which would probably have had the intended impact if it wasn\'t for the fact that the supreme leader of Atlas is clearly shown to be a selfish psychopath who openly admits that she sees everything and everyone as tools for her amusement, and whatever problems the people in Atlas might have can\'t even begin to compare to those of the people in Doumu, something Kuniko herself even points out. There\'s even an arc where Kuniko is sent back to the detention centre for a few episodes, during which pretty much nothing noteworthy happens aside from Kuniko\'s first face-to-face meeting with the main villain, making it feel like empty padding more than anything. Fortunately, I can say that the second half of the series is a lot better than the first, but that really isn\'t saying much since it was a pretty low bar to clear.Even beyond the very slow-paced beginning (which I\'ve honestly come to expect from Gonzo anime, anyway), the series often ends up confused and entangled in its own narrative. Throughout the series, there are no less than four stories going on simultaneously, and while some of them are decently enjoyable (Mikuni\'s story being a highlight), there are others that I couldn\'t make sense of for the life of me. The biggest example of this would be that of Karin Ishida, a young girl and genius programmer who enjoys messing with the world\'s economy at her leisure. Throughout the series, I couldn\'t make heads or tails of the scenes involving Karin and couldn\'t really figure out why they were even in the series, considering the plot mainly revolves around a resistance group trying to overthrow a tyrannical government, and Karin\'s economic endeavours don\'t exactly lead to anything important. Ultimately, it\'s hard to say whether the series would have benefitted from more episodes or less, since while it does try to ram an awful lot into 24 episodes, a lot of the stuff it puts in feels really unnecessary and the series wouldn\'t lose much by removing it.Art & Animation (7.5/10):As is typical of a Gonzo anime, ""Shangri-La"" visuals are... not great, to put it bluntly. While the animations are good enough and there are some pretty decent character designs and minimal fanservice, dull colours, muddy textures and rough edges are very frequent. While the series doesn\'t look horrible by any stretch of the imagination, there\'s nothing about the visuals that stood out to me either, and so the best way to describe them would be ""average"".Sound & Dialogue (8/10):There really isn\'t all that much to say about ""Shangri-La""\'s soundtrack. It\'s barely even there a lot of the time and even when it is there, it mostly just blends into the background. The opening is also rather forgettable, though the two ending themes are both good in their own way and I will admit I enjoyed listening to them. The voice acting is generally very good, with Lindsay Siedel and Apphia Yu being particular highlights as Kuniko and Mikuni, respectively, and Austin Tindle doing a respectable job as Kunihito. Still, it can be very jarring to hear the voice of Kent Williams coming out of a transgender woman like Momoko, and I don\'t really know why they didn\'t go for a softer voice. All in all, the sound design has its problems, but it is still probably the best part of the series.Characters (7/10):The best way to describe Kuniko is that she\'s determined- once she has her mind set on something, she will not give in until she sees it through, and sometimes gets pissed at people who are easily willing to give up simply because they see no point in trying. Of course, determination won\'t get you far unless you have the strength to back it up, which Kuniko thankfully absolutely has, skilfully wielding a boomerang as big as she is and showing no hesitance to kill if necessary. What\'s more is that you can certainly tell that\'s she\'s been trained for a long time to take over Metal Age, as once things get going, she proves herself to be a very capable and charismatic leader. Unfortunately, while she is a likeable protagonist, she doesn\'t really undergo any major growth over the show\'s 24 episodes, which is especially noticeable give that she\'s the character we see the most of. The closest thing she gets to character development is becoming more determined to improve the lives of her people, something she\'s attempting to do even in the beginning. Also, and this is a rather minor criticism, but I found her character design to be rather lacking, as she looks like a kid despite being supposedly 18. Personally, I think they should have either made her a few years younger or have her look closer to her age. I\'d have been fine with either, honestly, because what\'s the point in making her older than the usual anime protagonist if she\'s not going to look it?Second in importance to Kuniko is Mikuni, a very pale young girl who lives in Atlas and is treated as royalty over there. Initially, she comes off as really creepy and ruthless, even habitually putting people to death for lying (which she is able to see through easily). However, it\'s later revealed that this isn\'t her fault, with the heavy implication being that she just doesn\'t know any better due to her upbringing in Atlas (as well as the fact that her power appears to be out of her control), and she is actually quite innocent and kind, if also rather annoying at times, as any child is. She also suffers from a condition that makes her vulnerable to sunlight, and as such rarely leaves her chambers. Her story runs parallel to Kuniko\'s for the majority of the series, with it not being until the second half that the two girls meet. While she\'s not quite as important to the story, I slowly but surely found myself liking Mikuni more than Kuniko (and every other character, for that matter), due to the fact that she actually has a character arc and undergoes some very noticeable changes over the series. Her story also has easily some of the most emotional moments in the anime, and towards the end I just wanted to give the poor girl a hug after all she had been through.The last member of the main cast is Kunihito Kusanagi, a military officer who resides in Atlas and works for their corporation, which naturally puts him at odds with Metal Age, whom he initially sees as a bunch of selfish rebels. That said, it\'s hard to call him a villain, as at the end of the day he\'s just a soldier doing his job and is more than willing to negotiate, even if he\'s not the best at it due to his refusal to see others\' points of view. Unfortunately, there isn\'t an awful lot to say about him compared to Kuniko and Mikuni, with his character type being one you\'ll find in many other anime, especially the ""Gundam"" franchise. Besides the main three, ""Shangri-La"" has a pretty sizeable supporting cast, some of which are interesting and likeable while others are forgettable or annoying. Among these is two transgender women, who rather than being treated as offensive jokes, are instead major characters with their own feelings, dreams, friendships, and roles to play, which is practically unheard of in anime. In general, the women in the series tend to have bigger roles and importance than the men do, with even the main villain being a woman who constantly expresses dominance over her male subordinates. As a whole, the cast is good, but there isn\'t anyone I found to be all that memorable.Enjoyment (7/10):""Shangri-La""\'s poor pacing not only hurts the storytelling, it also means the series can be pretty boring in the first half.

When I think of this series, I think wasted potential. A post-apocalyptic anime focused around themes such as reduction of a country's carbon footprint for economic stability and dealing with the corrupt creator of a utopian city would seem like interesting ideas on paper for an anime series. However, Shangri-La chooses to mix said ideas around while sticking to conventional territory in its focus on our lead heroine Kuniko and her comrades of the radical group called Metal Age. This results in some pretty mixed and often sloppy results as the anime attempts to spin...mature storytelling with exploring the dark side of Atlas, yet also tries to pander to otaku and has some immature comical elements it usually incorporates into its episodes. The anime does explore some interesting aspects and developments to its world with pollution affecting the grounded populace and corporate corruption running amuck with some exploiting the strict carbon laws enforced in the world of Shangri-La for their personal financial gain or abusing their power at the cost of the impoverished who are trying to gain citizenship into Atlas. Yet at the same time, the series has ridiculous characters like Kuniko's transvestite bodyguard known to creep out male soldiers with his flirting in battle and a trio of otaku living in the remains of Akihabara who are black market dealers that Kuniko and Metal Age buy supplies or information off of. Comical moments such as the mentioned flirting of the transvestite bodyguard and jokes cracked about Kuniko's chest add to the show feeling a bit juvenile despite the seemingly mature themes it pushes with its setting and story. Many other characters in the series were either cliched (Kuniko and Ryoko, the former being the always optimistic and lively youth who is always right in her convictions and the latter feeling like a clone of Last Exile's Maestro Delphine), are lacking in depth or their characters are too over-the-top for me to take seriously (Shion and Sayoko are masochist and sadomasochist respectively).The storyline for Shangri-La also has its fair share of ups and downs. The series mixes focus around between several characters at differing points between Kuniko, Kunihito, Karin Ishida and Mikuni. While the four arcs may seem irrelevant at first glance, they slowly come together as more about the darker side of Atlas and Ryoko are revealed as all have their connections to Atlas that are hinted upon. Kuniko's story is fairly typical, yet engaging, as she tries being outsider to the activities of Metal Age before prolonged exposure to the corruption of Atlas drives her to make decisions that lead her to become more involved with Metal Age and Atlas' dark side. Kunihito serves as an opposing side to Kuniko for the first half of Shangri-La, but he doesn't get as much focus as the other characters and is fairly dull character as a result. Karin has the better developments in this series as her seemingly corrupt actions have purer motives that are revealed throughout the course of the series and she learns to accept experiencing the world. Mikuni's developments are also weak here as she is one of several catalysts that introduce mystical elements to Shangri-La that are poorly incorporated into the series and her character doesn't get much in the way of development. The later episodes to the series build up to the mentioned mystical elements that Shangri-La attempts to mix in with the anime's futuristic setting, yet feel very out of place and do not feel smoothly integrated into the show.The one element that the series managed to pull nicely is its visual presentation. Scenery shots such as the inside of Atlas, toxic jungles and Kuniko's hometown of Duomo sport vivid color and high levels of detail. Character designs are drawn in a typical style, yet sport just as vivid color and detail as the scenery. Action scenes sport solid choreography with some unique approaches like Kuniko's use of her boomerang and Sayoko's use of medical equipment as weapons, though there are occasional animation shortcuts and the CG-animation employed at points still sticks out from the regular animation.Overall, it felt like Shangri-La was trying to juggle too much throughout its run. The series tried to implement mature themes and storytelling with its setting, yet features elements of pandering to its audience and implements humor and content that make it seem juvenile. It sets up a solid futuristic setting, yet sloppily tries to incorporate mystical elements. It lays out focus on several character storylines with some occasional solid developments, yet two of said characters are bland or lacking in development.

I could not have picked a better first shojou ai series. Although it is basicly about the love between two girls, it is way lighter and more fun then some of the more dramatic shojou...ai series out there, making it a perfect introduction to the genre.Sumika Murasame is an intelegent, tough as nails highschooler with a big problem: she has fallen in love with another female, her best friend, Ushio Kazama. The problem isn\'t that Ushio doesn\'t like girls--in fact, she\'s absoluely crazy about them--the problem is that Ushio only likes ""cute"" girls. Small, weak, shy girls that one would feel compelled to protect. Sumika, being unusually tall and a martial arts expert, does not at all meet this description.Sasameki Koto presented a very simple story, and was able to do a lot with it. Something different happened every episode, and they managed to bring in very satisfying romantic scenes and wonderful comedy without being too unrealistic. The only problem was that some episodes had no real significance, and could have been skipped over in order to make room for a decent ending. Note before you watch Sasameki Koto that the ending is very abrupt, and will probably leave you unsatisfied and thinking \'That\'s it?\'The characters made this series what it was. Each character was unique and quirky, and you pretty much had to love every one of them. We start out with the two mains, Sumika and Ushio, and their friend, the happy-go-lucky Kiyori. Later, we are introduced to Akemiya, a dorky boy with a huge crush on Sumika, Tomoe and Miyako, a lesbian couple who hopelessly attempt to start a school club for lesbian girls, and Aoi, a passionate fan of a series of yuri novels. The characters are all very well developed, and it\'s very entertaining to watch them in their everyday lives.The main reason I like Sasameki Koto is that you can feel the characters\' emotions as if they are your own. There are several scenes in this series that will make one think ""I\'ve felt that way before."" The series manages to perfectly execute the drama of one sided love without being melodramatic, and seeing as this is a Highschool story, this is a major accomplishment. ai series out there, making it a perfect introduction to the genre.Sumika Murasame is an intelegent, tough as nails highschooler with a big problem: she has fallen in love with another female, her best friend, Ushio Kazama.

The story revolves around few girls Kazama, Ushio and Murasame, Sumika also their many friends which they encounter. Murasame Sumika feel in love with her best Friend Kazama Ushio who falls in...love with all the ""cute"" girls she see, for Murasame its the worst thing that can happen because she isn\'t the ""cute"" type if you think about it shes more like guy shes tall , strong and also knows karate ... well in other words the opposite of the type that Kazama likes because of that Murasama suffers alot. She also suffers because of seeing Kazama always getting hurt by other girls ... and getting her heart broken. Story goes into many misunderstandings and alot more sufferings but only to be relieved by some humor and joy of main characters ""after bad things happens there are always something good awaiting"". When going further into story we see some development of feelings from both sides still that was a mystery for me because it was my first Shoujo-ai anime ... with that i got into it and wanted to see more. Because of that i came across even more changes in their characteristics after some time i noticed Jealousy coming from Kazama who i thought had no interests in Murasame. With that i will end my review.Art: Well art is beautiful all the characters are beautifully drawn and all the atmosphere is warm.Characters: It was a wonderful character development and characteristics of each protagonist every moment of jealousy and such was shown nicely.Enjoyment: well i enjoyed these series alot because it was my first shoujo-ai anime.Overall: its a great love story which makes some difference from these plain every day anime romances which we see happening and after 4 eps you can already tell what will happen in the end ...

What I would give to remove the show in my brain and watch it again to get that ""first time"" feeling.Story 9/10Sumika Murasame, a high school girl is secretly in love with her best friend Ushio Kazama. Unfortunately, Ushio only likes girls that are cute and small. Sumi  is not cute, tall and very athletic. The anime follows exactly the plot of the manga version of the same name (Except episode 12). If this was a stand-alone anime then story rating would have been lower due to the ending of the show (the ending of the show...was the ending of manga version volume 1). Since they were following the manga version\'s plot, it\'s getting a high rating. I\'ve read the manga version until the end and it was wonderful.Art 8/10The show has a great animation with few minor flaws that are not distracting.Sound 6/10It\'s getting a low rating because they keep using it every episode.

To me, it's been about the subtle interpersonal character drama based upon fear of social ostracisation or lack of mutual feelings, and it's about the quiet tempo of character growth and romance. I felt like Sasameki Koto got this, but didn't know what to do about it.To start off, Sasameki Koto allures with the prickly thorns of unrequited love between our tall and boyish protagonist, Sumika, and her best friend, Kazama, a girl that likes cutesy...femme girls. At the onset, Sumika is very, very easy character to relate to, trying her hardest not to ruin a friendship but knowingly unable to further it - it's the kind of dynamic everybody knows, regardless of sexuality. Paired with the gentle pace, the quiet but simple piano score, a beautiful OP where the characters stand, together, in the wind... and you'd think Sasameki Koto was onto something. For the first 3 or so episodes, anyway.So begins a small arc of one of Sumika's male admirers realising that he stands no chance because of her sexuality. The show manages to find a nice balance between showing Sumika's frustration with herself as well as making you laugh. It works with the unrequited love aspect, but some of the jokes are in bad taste and draw Sumika as a quite cruel character.Thankfully, Sasameki Koto then takes it's time to focus on the protagonist. We've learned that she's a karate-expert, but in the next arc, featuring being blackmailed by a lesbian couple that wants to make an exclusive homosexual club for girls, we learn that she's very socially awkward. But it's charming to see her come together and make friends (even if they're as toxic as her) and finally begin to enjoy her school life. It takes it's time to build the relationships, and while it lacks strong side characters, it's still a strong series of episodes that tie in nicely to develop Sumika. Despite the comic missteps, it was at this point that I thought the show was really beginning to come together, as it was leading to either Sumika moving on from Kazama or getting together with her.Which leads onto the next arc, where Sumika comes across a yuri fan in her class, Azusa, but fails to recruit her for the Girl's Club. While she keeps trying, she accidentally gets a little too close to her and ends up spending a little too much time with her, helping her with her yuri doujinshi. While I understand the point in this arc - where Sumika begins to move on and then does a heel-turn before coming back to Kazama - this arc was handled very poorly and really began to drag, rendered boring by the dull characterisation of Azusa (probably an insult to doujinshi writers everywhere). It takes a little too long before coming back, and never fully commits to the idea that Sumika could move on. And, moreover, the gentle pacing has been lost for an entirely stagnant one.I've described the structure of this show as if I know exactly what's going to happen and when. That's because it's a fairly typical structure found within homosexual or, in general, love stories where the author introduce the characters, develop them, attempt to move them on and then bring them back together but closer. It's at this point, this final hurdle, that Sasameki Koto truly crumbles.Three standalone episodes, in a rather bizarre fashion, take place. Firstly, our protagonist and her love interest are reunited in a swimming-pool episode. This could have been the gentle finale, where are characters truly come together romantically; all of the side characters realise there is something between Kazama and Sumika in this episode. The problem is that it doesn't feel like anything happened to cause it.The second episode features an afterschool treasure-hunt of sorts, where they find notes telling them to go to different places in the school. A strong episode with lots of charm and fun that builds on the group's friendship.Finally, Sumika and Kazama are split up when Sumika goes on a short holiday to see relatives and her phone breaks, and is unable to contact Kazama. It's suggested that Kazama comes to accept she has feelings for Sumika when she misses her when she gets worried about the lack of contact, but other than that the episode is mostly kind of boring. The entire series then ends when her phone begins working again and she calls Kazama.Huh?Despite some comic references to a character within this story, a reluctant yuri writer that attracts attention on the back of actual romance, you'd think they'd give us that. Sasameki Koto wasn't far from doing that, but instead of leaving a series to be remembered for it's strong characters, there was only one and she couldn't pull it out from mediocrity. femme girls.

The anime adaptation only covers the first part of the manga's story. It was made in 2009 by AIC. Sadly, there has not been a second season yet. Now, I liked this anime when I saw it a couple years ago. Just let me re-watch it so I can properly articulate why. And then I'll tell you all about it.The story is a relatively simple romance plot. A girl named Sumika is in love with her best friend, Kazama. There's just one problem, Kazama likes cute girls and Sumika is really tall and...more cool than cute. As for the story itself, it does a really good job of showing a gradual relationship progression and it blends in some charming slice of life aspects and some well done comedy. That being said, I do have one complaint about the story layout and that's episode seven. Just episode seven. It has no charm, no funny jokes, does nothing to advance the plot whatsoever and is just generally horrid. To make matters worse, it doesn't even get mentioned or alluded to again after it's over. Meaning that they just put it in to take up space. I genuinely pity anyone who saw this as their first episode because they were hanging out with a friend who was watching it or some such thing. That aside, the anime does a really good job of setting up the characters' relationships to each other and starting their development. The story is incomplete, but that's because the manga is fairly long and they really couldn't have completed it in thirteen episodes. They do pick a pretty good ending spot though and if you're curious about the manga the anime will certainly provide a good sample of what's in it so that you can ascertain whether you'd like it or not.Now, with a simple story Sasameki Koto relies a lot on its characters to carry the show and they do so magnificently. One of my professors once said that well written and developed characters can make even minor tension seem important and dramatic, whereas poorly written characters can be involved in global stakes without anyone caring. Sasameki Koto confirms the first part of her claim. Sasameki Koto makes waiting for a phone call into a dramatic event. It works because all of the major characters are portrayed very realistically. They're largely sympathetic while having faults. I can especially identify with Sumika. She loves Kazama which can cause her to act petty and say thoughtless things, but she's also always there for her and genuinely wants her to be happy, even if it's with someone else. She wants to tell Kazama her feelings but she's afraid of losing her friendship so she puts on a straight girl act and keeps things bottled up. Azusa is another very sympathetic character. In many ways she's kind of a brat, but she's also sensitive, shy and creative. All the characters in this can be petty, thoughtless and do stupid things, but their faults aren't exaggerated or done in an overblown or obnoxious way. Instead they serve to make them more relatable. Even the minor characters feel like real people, mostly. The one major exception only appears in one episode. In case you can't guess which one, it's episode seven. And that's Akemiya's sister. Okay, technically she makes a very brief appearance in an earlier episode, but she only gets two lines and there's nothing to indicate that she might be what seven develops her into. Seven develops her, but it does it very badly. Whereas every single other character has sympathetic qualities, she's portrayed as a sociopath and you're supposed to forgive her for being horrible because she's young. Ruddy episode seven.The art is excellently done. There are some really good details, the characters are well done, the scenery looks good and the backgrounds are nice and lively. There is one problem with it, and that's that it abuses art style changes for comedic effect. I mentioned this when I talked about Fullmetal Alchemist, but for those of you who didn't read that I'll go over it again. I don't generally mind when the art briefly changes style to a more deformed mode for comedic effect. The problem I have is when an anime does it too often. It's used for emphasis and it loses its impact when it happens too often and Sasameki Koto uses it too often. Now, one thing I really like about the art is that it mostly refrains from using fan-service. Even when there's a setup that could easily lead to it and I admire that restraint. The most fan-servicey scenes are fantasies and even then it's kept pretty tasteful.The voice acting is really well done. Both Takamoto Megumi and Takagaki Ayahi give really strong performances. I'm not sure how closely they actually worked together since their lines were recorded, but I can say that they have really strong chemistry. If there's anything wrong with the acting in this it's that there are quite a few exaggerated scenes, but I'm not going to complain about it much since I honestly think they work in context. I didn't like the music as much. Don't get me wrong, it's good but it doesn't add a whole lot to the atmosphere. Most of it is just really mellow. Which is fine, but I would've liked to hear more of a variety.The yuri factor is a 10/10. Who ever would have thought that yuri anime month reviews would have such a high yuri factor? In addition to the budding relationship between Kazama and Sumika there's a more advanced romance between Tomoe and Miyako and there's Azusa's crush on Sumika. One of Sasameki Koto's strengths is that the yuri is handled fairly realistically. Unlike some yuri anime, they go to a school with a largely straight population and Kazama's crushes tend to be one-sided as a consequence. It's a move that makes the characters more sympathetic since they are outsiders of a sort. The relationships themselves are really strongly developed in a way that feels completely natural.Now, my final rating for Sasameki Koto is an 8/10. It's a great anime, except for bloody episode seven. My biggest complaint is over the terrible episode seven but ignoring that, the characters are excellent, the romance is handled very well, the voice acting is great and the art, when not shifted to the humorous style, is amazing. I do suggest giving it a try, and skipping episode seven because it seriously is just awful. If you enjoy the twelve good episodes you should check out the manga, because it unfortunately hasn't gotten another season yet. Well, that's it for yuri anime month. Next month I plan to look at Katanagatari, Blood+, and Durarara because my lovely fans requested it and I can't say no to reasonable requests from you guys. Even in those rare cases when I know it's going to be painful to re-watch something. There was something else coming up, but I can't recall what it was right now. Oh well, I'm sure I'll think of it eventually. more cool than cute.

Instead it's somewhere in between, it's an anime which is gentle and light-hearted but at the same time it feels genuine and it's for this reason alone that it's my favourite Yuri/Shoujo-Ai anime.Another thing that sets it apart is the lack of ambiguity when it comes to the girl's sexuality. The story doesn't exist in a vacuum where there aren't any boys and the suggestion is that the...girls are just pretending until 'real' love comes along. Nor does is exist in a parallel universe where everyone is gay, making it unbelievable. Instead it's set in a co-ed high-school in an anime version of the real world. One main character is openly gay, the other is very gay, even if she keeps it on the down-low and the other two main girl characters are in an open, committed relationship. Again, a rarity in the Shoujo-Ai genre.The tension in the show doesn't come from whether or not Sumika and Kazama's feeling are real or not, instead it's from them trying to make the delicate transition from best friends to lovers.Yes, as per the synopsis, one of those the roadblocks is the fact that Sumika isn't Kazuma's 'type'. In saying that though it probably the least significant issue standing in their way. The second, more important problem is that Sumika is still in the closet, and as a result her best friend has no idea she's even interested in girls. The other, and I think the main issue is the fact that Sumika is scared to death of ruining the most important relationship in her life which is pretty relatable if you've ever had a crush on a friend.The characters are all interesting and loveable. Sumika is the typically athletic and academically gifted tomboy, but she's insecure and adorkable enough to make her relatable. Kazama is the generally calm, mature and motherly one, except for when it comes to 'cute girls' where she slips into manic immaturity. Thankfully these moments are only there briefly as an early plot devise and slowly become less of a thing. Tomoe and Miyako are the funny and (mostly) supportive lesbian couple who help encourage Sumika while also acting as an example of what could be if she'd only finally confess. Even Azusa, the Shoujo-Ai fiction fan girl, there to act as a brief 'cock-block' was far less annoying than I though she would be. My heart even broke for her a little bit at one point, which is an achievement in my book.Despite it's light heartedness Sasameki Koto doesn't shy away from some issues most Shoujo-Ai tend to ignore, mainly the stigma that comes from being gay in society which prizes conventionality above all else. Kazuma's bullying at a previous school, to the point she had to leave and the insinuation that she would still be a victim of it if it weren't for Sumika's presence not only makes her character seem even stronger but also adds to the story's reality. It's never really a main plot point but serves as another hint of reality.Overall I love this show. It's gentle, beautiful and romantic. The characters are delightful, the art and animation are good and the music is great. Only the 'Read the Manga' ending stops me from giving it a perfect 10.

I know there are manga chapters that wrap it up, but I\'m not surprised this never received the second season it was obviously planning to use to wrap things up nicely.Story. 5S.K. is a Yuri romance, meaning, many of the characters and love displayed is lesbian in nature. Yuri has a very small representation in anime, and only a small amount of it is really anything worth watching.The concept is a good one. Girl A is a lesbian, and she likes cute lesbians, as a matter of preference. Girl B is a lesbian, but only for Girl...A. Girl A is oblivious, and goes out of her way to point out how ill-suited Girl B is for her, often in casual conversation.The story revolves around Girl B trying to win the love of Girl A.----SPOILER-----At some point, we assume she succeeds. Without any real turning event, reason, or explanation, Girl A starts becoming very timid about Girl B, and shyly in love. This sounds nice, but it\'s such a sudden flip without explaining WHY Girl B suddenly became her type, you start wondering what you missed.Now add in a Lesbian Club, a boy who cross-dresses like a Boku no Pico reject to win the affection of Girl B, some loli-con, and a nii-san complex, and suddenly you fill out the itinerary of the shows remaining episodes.Art. 7The character designs are good. They do a good job of making Girl B fairly plain looking most of the time, then highlight her pretty features when she relaxes. The animation uses lots of stills screens, crayola backgrounds, and bodies without faces or detail, but since it\'s not really a chibi-friendly tale or setting, it looks bad rather than cute most of the time.Sound. 6There\'s a obnoxious piano score that\'s almost always present, and it overpowers a lot of the subtle action in the screen. A few voices are really bad, and a few are really good.Characters. 6Usually Yuri\'s strongest points are characters that you want to see succeed. In this case, there\'s a giant alpha-yuri that is a mary-sue, a loli-yuri that\'s her girlfriend and the ""sassy one"", a couple of side characters that only needed one episode to explain them, not multiples like they got, and the main pairing.The problem is that no one ever confesses, or even makes a subtle overture to explain their feelings, other than alpha x loli. You never get the feeling it\'s love, and not bicurious crushes.Enjoyment. 6The pacing was pretty horrible. The first 6 episodes made me almost quit. The next 4 were okay, then a strange last second curve ball and horrible ending. I hear the manga ties things up, but even though I\'m a completionist I might skip it. I liked things better once they formed the Team Yuri, but even that made me start wondering why they chose that as a thing in episode 7/13.Overall: 5I say this a lot. This show is exactly why we need MORE Yuri, so shows like this get exposed for their issues and future writers can learn from it.Too often, the plot becomes, ""Lets see if these lesbians ever hook up."" But in this case, they don\'t. Even worse, there\'s no actual portrayal of a good relationship in this anime. AlphaxLoli try to be the stable relationship, but even they just poke fun at stereotypes in an anime that is supposed to be a realistic portrait of a lesbian couple.It\'s not very good.If you want to see yuri relationships. Skip this.If you want to see some yearning and a lot of stuttering. See this.If you want any kind of heavy petting or physical love. Skip this.If you want to see a little character growth, pay attention to Girl B.The show ends without resolving anything. So there\'s that too. A.

So there\'s that too.', ""So before I start I have to admit I am one of the people who read and completed the manga before I watched the anime so I am a bit biased. Sasameki Koto or Whispered Words in English is the Story of Sumika, a girl who is good at sports and has great grades but even though she has the shy girl with glasses look she is far from shy and Ushio her best friend who is a sweet girl who has a love of cute girls. The problem is Sumika is in love with Ushio but she herself doesn't fit the qualifications of cute...and her feelings are unnoticed by Ushio.Now I will go on record to say that Sumika IS cute, she is probably one of the cutest girls I have seen in a manga/anime. Anyway being a fan of the manga and story I have to say the anime is good for what it is but it lacks in a lot of ways. For one the manga wasn't finished when the anime aired and so there is no conclusion to the story, its left open heck one of the episodes is an anime only episode that wasn't in the manga.Many people who have watched the anime have complained about the lack of conclusion and how there is no confession in it which they are right there isn't one....in the anime. The manga however has both a conclusion AND a confession. You have to understand the anime only covers the first 12 chapters of a 53 chapter manga. So if you felt unfulfilled at the end of the anime, then read the manga.The art and sound is great and the characters are the selling point for this short anime that leaves out a great bit of the story. There are characters that show up later in the manga that are not in the anime that is a shame since they would of made it really enjoyable.But being a fan of the story I wil lsay having the anime is a plus to any yuri collection but to get the whole story you will have to read the manga which you can do by reading it online OR by buying it since the manga is now being released in English finally. and her feelings are unnoticed by Ushio.Now I will go on record to say that Sumika IS cute, she is probably one of the cutest girls I have seen in a manga/anime.

It has a balanced set of characters, which are really well developed, and they all bring something to the fray, be it comedy, or a serious point of the storyline.Although the anime was a little predictable in the storyline, it didn't matter, as it was enough to keep me watching and not dismiss it. Generally it...focuses on the relationships of the protagonist and her struggles but it makes you wonder if they made it into strictly a romance or a comedy whether it could have been better.However, despite this, as a result this anime is thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully drawn, made and developed, its the characters, laughs and warm feel it gave that kept it going until the end with a good conclusion.I'd recommend it to people who are regulars to the shoujo-ai scene and also to people who are new to it as I was. It has an enticing story and it kept me watching. 7/10 :) focuses on the relationships of the protagonist and her struggles but it makes you wonder if they made it into strictly a romance or a comedy whether it could have been better.However, despite this, as a result this anime is thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully drawn, made and developed, its the characters, laughs and warm feel it gave that kept it going until the end with a good conclusion.I'd recommend it to people who are regulars to the shoujo-ai scene and also to people who are new to it as I was.

Today we’re going to be talking about Sasameki Koto (Whispered Words) but I have a feeling you may have already known that! This is a nice little series that fuses some fairly heavy dramatic elements with regular doses of comedy, which for the most part, makes for an enjoyable watch. A glance to the right at my overall score should indicate that I do recommend giving this anime a chance. If you wish to go in ‘blind’, please stop reading at this point as I cannot certify a 100% spoiler-free review. So let’s get to finding out just...who makes the RTRL wall of yuri worship! (It’s kinda getting hard to think of new labels!)Story: 7The entire anime can be basically summed up in two words: unrequited love. That’s at the core of most of the characters’ motivations. There are a couple of cast regulars that aren’t caught in the vice grip of unreturned feelings, and I do mean a couple, in both senses: there are two, and they are the only romantic couple throughout the series. Otherwise, everyone else gets bitten by the bug. This is the heavier part of the plot, as the longing for someone that does not long for you is often a painful place to be, just ask anyone who’s been in that position.Even our main character, the dark haired, glasses-wearing Sumi is having to struggle through those feelings for her best friend, the blonde Kazama. Our blondie is open about her love for other girls, though she herself has known unrequited love. We don’t see Sumi being known as open about her sexuality, because she seems to only have eyes for Kazama, which she doesn’t confess openly to her friend, but in just about every other aspect, is quite transparent in her feelings. But unfortunately for Sumi, Kazama has a thing for feminine, cute type girls, and not for the athletic type, which is what poor Sumi is. Couple that with Sumi’s unusual height and she seems to turn quite invisible to Kazama.Yet when Kazama falls for other girls, and gets her feelings shattered when they don’t return her affections, Sumi is the shoulder she seeks first to cry on. Sumi of course is always there, and the movement of the main plot line is the story of how their relationship grows and changes.To counter all of this heavy feeling stuff, the series is injected with a great deal of humor, usually centered around Sumi and the younger girl in the lesbian couple who plays the comedic foil to Sumi’s over the top reactions. The older of the couple also plays a role in the humor, often with indominable spirit and determination to establish a ‘Girls Club’ for young ladies with similar feelings to meet and socialize. No matter the obstacle that arises against the founding of the club, this girl cannot be deterred leading to some very funny moments of her own.The addition of the humor to the overall storytelling gives the series a bit of distinction. Yes, I know there are other funny yuri anime series out there. I’m aware of ones that are funny on purpose like Sakura Trick and ones that are funny unintentionally, such as Strawberry Panic, but Sasameki Koto seems to strike a balance for me that makes it notable as well, for daring to delve fairly deep into feelings and mixed emotions and jealousy, and yet still have enough amusing moments to keep from bogging down too deep. This is most decidedly not Maria-sama ga Miteru or Aoi Hana (though I *really* loved those two) and it’s a good thing, not every romance has to be filled with only dramatic moments. This anime proves that you can have a fairly serious plot but still not lose the humor completely.Why have I knocked the score a little on the story section? Mainly because of some dropped characters that interested me and then kind of go and disappear. First we have a young man that is a fashion model, but as a girl. In fact, Kazama kind of falls for the girl in the magazine which leads to Sumi researching the model and finding out it’s the guy from school. He’s totally in love with Sumi who is in love with Kazama who starts crushing on him in his ‘her’ persona. He, as a female, joins the Girls’ Club and attends a few of the sessions before kind of dropping off the radar as Kazama’s eye moves on to another.Secondly another tragic character comes along that also gets left behind, and also falls in love with Sumi, a young woman who is deeply inspired by a female author of yuri romance who actually turns out to be Kazama’s older brother writing under a pen name. This anime does get a bit like Star Wars where everyone is related to everyone else in some manner, that’s another scratch, but the poor girl does her best to impress Sumi, and while Sumi feels badly for her, she just doesn’t have those feelings for anyone other than Kazama. Eventually the heartbroken girl realizes the truth, and comes to accept that Sumi will never be hers. She then immediately exits, stage right. Not a further peep about her. I kind of wondered where these two went off to, and would have liked a deeper look at their post-situation lives. Does the boy continue to model? Does he ever realize he’ll never have Sumi, like the girl did? And the girl, knowing she cannot be with her crush, does her life come together for her? Does Sumi continue their friendship? The girl’s arc deals with a passion project that Sumi helps her with, a project that due to her exacting standards is shown to have cost her friendships in the past. Does she learn to let go? Is she successful? New friends maybe? All it would have taken for her is one shot of the project doingwell to satisfy my wondering about her.As the series closes, the story focuses tighter in on Sumi and Kazama, which of course is expected, but I kind of would have preferred a more complete wrap for everyone else. Even the lesbian couple just give way to the center plot as the ending rolls around. I wonder, were they ever able to create a proper Girls Club? Did the older girl in the couple end up in jail for that whole‘beach’ incident? Things like that makes me lower the score some.Art: 8I liked the art on this one too. Sumi is well drawn, and I love the way her glasses look. The rest of the girls (and guy) are all well done, the backgrounds are nice, and the colors are vibrant. I didn’t mind the appearance one bit on this one.Sound: 7I kind of have an issue with the opening song. It is very pretty, light, airy, soulful. Reminds me a lot of the opening theme for Aoi Hana. Therein lies the problem. Often within 20 seconds of the theme ending, Sumi is blowing her top at something or some other crazy comedy bit drops. It’s a good song, but it’s not really all that well fitted to the show. Then end theme, however, works really well. It strikes the right note between being ‘love’-like and being playful. Just know that the beautiful vocals in the beginning might just be followed by Sumi karate chopping someone immediately afterwards.Character: 7I really kind of covered this aspect in the story section really well. The characters are sometimes a little flat, but for the most part work well, except for kind of suddenly disappearing. Kazama has an interesting development arc as she goes through the story. Oftentimes in romance stories, things can seem a bit like a light switch, flipped either on or off without much notice. Kazama follows a subtler arc as she comes to terms with her own feelings. Sumi does not waver in her devotion for Kazama for one instant but that does not really detract from her character, it just shows that she has a deep affection that is beyond silly lust or experimentation. She truly loves Kazama and seems ready to take on a life of just friendship if that’s what it takes to be close to her. As I said, refer to the story section for more of a breakdown on characters there.Enjoyment: 8I did enjoy this anime because it is well done in my opinion (who could have predicted a review comes down to personal opinions?!) and I really enjoyed watching it. I actually watched this one twice, which is not something I’m always so ready to do, with my list of recommendations being a mile long at this point. It was moving without being too sappy, it was funny without being too stupid, it was memorable for all the right reasons. The only note I have on the ending is that I could have used a ‘bigger’ scene, but it was not as ambiguous as many are (Aoi Hana once again comes to mind) but was still somewhat muted.So there we have it, another fairly well done yuri title that given a chance, might just sate that spot in your heart for girl love. I feel my heart full of determination for the establishment of the Girls’ Club! Too bad I’m a guy and they won’t let me join. For the RTLR wall of fame, Sumi scores a pretty prominent spot. who makes the RTRL wall of yuri worship!

The characters are sometimes a little flat, but for the most part work well, except for kind of suddenly disappearing. Kazama has an interesting development arc as she goes through the story. Oftentimes in romance stories, things can seem a bit like a light switch, flipped either on or off without much notice. Kazama follows a subtler arc as she comes to terms with her own feelings. Sumi does not waver in her devotion for Kazama for one instant but that does not really detract from her character, it just shows that she has a deep affection that is beyond silly lust or experimentation. She truly loves Kazama and seems ready to take on a life of just friendship if that’s what it takes to be close to her. As I said, refer to the story section for more of a breakdown on characters there.Enjoyment: 8I did enjoy this anime because it is well done in my opinion (who could have predicted a review comes down to personal opinions?!) and I really enjoyed watching it. I actually watched this one twice, which is not something I’m always so ready to do, with my list of recommendations being a mile long at this point. It was moving without being too sappy, it was funny without being too stupid, it was memorable for all the right reasons. The only note I have on the ending is that I could have used a ‘bigger’ scene, but it was not as ambiguous as many are (Aoi Hana once again comes to mind) but was still somewhat muted.So there we have it, another fairly well done yuri title that given a chance, might just sate that spot in your heart for girl love. I feel my heart full of determination for the establishment of the Girls’ Club! Too bad I’m a guy and they won’t let me join. For the RTLR wall of fame, Sumi scores a pretty prominent spot."", 'Similar to other anime adaptations of manga that has yet to be concluded, Sasameki Koto ends on a disappointingly limp note. With the manga ending in 2011 and the anime adaptation both airing and ending in 2009, its only natural for the show to end in such an unsatisfying fashion. The show overall isn\'t bad, but the ending leaves much to be desired with there being more questions than answers being presented at the show\'s conclusion.Sasameki Koti is a romantic comedy focused around a group of girls that come together to form the ""Girls Club"", a club dedicated to ""girl-lovers who had no choice...but to enter a co-ed school"". Sumika Murasame, our main protagonist, has fallen for her best friend, Ushio Kazama. Ushio, however, only falls in love with ""cute girls"" and Sumika goes unrequited in her love. The relationship between the two is not only used to comedic effect, but also as a set-up for the show\'s main conflict. Ushio as a character is extremely dense, with everybody but her being able to see that Sumika has eyes for her. Because of this, Sumika is often put into embarrassing situations where it initially seems that Ushio finally recognizes Sumika\'s love for her only for it to be a huge misunderstanding in the end. Over time however, it is implied that Ushio has also fallen for Sumika, yet the two remain oblivious to each other\'s feelings. From the beginning, you want to cheer for Sumika. All she wants is to be with the one she loves most, yet she is unable to manifest her feelings into words, leaving Ushio oblivious to how she really feels. The situations are made worse by Ushio\'s lack of understanding, often telling Sumika that she\'s ""not her type"" and ""not cute"". Even so, Sumika refuses to give up in her quest for love, and we as an audience are drawn to her resolve.The romantic subplot in this show is set up beautifully, yet it is never capitalized on. Because the manga was yet concluded, the romantic subplot is never closed and ends on a cliffhanger. As such, it isn\'t hard to be disappointed at the terrible ending to the show. The finale was without a doubt the worst part of the show. Twenty minutes were wasted putting that together. The entire plot in that episode is based around such a simple issue, one that could be used to deliver a somewhat satisfying ending to the show. For whatever reason, all of the setup in the episode and by extension the whole show, is flushed down the drain at the episodes conclusion.The art style is cute, perfectly complimenting the overall cheery nature of the show. The music is also good, and serves to accentuate the overall cutesy nature of the show. One thing I commend the show on is its social commentary. In many yuri shows, the relationships between two female characters are often used for comedic purposes or fanservice. Here, however, its used to tell a lovestory between two women. In the show, the social acceptability of gay relationships is often brought into question. In the show, two classmates confront Tomoe and Miyako, two of Sumika\'s classmates who are in a fairly open relationship. Though they seem innocuous about it at first, once Tomoe confirms it, the look on the girl\'s faces turns from surprise to something akin to disgust. The blunt nature of the question afterwards is fairly eye-opening. ""Lesbians?! Seriously?!"". What Tomoe says here is so important to not  only the show, but also real life as well... ""Does gender matter when love is concerned?"" And the girl\'s response was ""Yes"". This interaction got to me. I myself am not gay, but I don\'t understand why there is such a stigma surrounding gay people. They\'re people, like you or me, yet they face countless challenges everyday because of how they feel... About something they cannot change. The strength in this show comes from the fact that it doesn\'t use its yuri elements for fan service or to pander to a specific audience. The story is simply about love, and how love affects us. The only disappointing aspects are the lack of character exploration of the other main characters besides Sumika and Ushio and the ending to the show. Though the show progresses in a predictable fashion, the ride there was fun... until the train fell off the tracks. The show had the perfect set-up, two girls that perfectly compliment each other, conflict between the two... YET IT DOESN\'T CAPITALIZED ON AT ALL. Everything that you could have wanted from an anime romance was here, and yet there is nothing to show for it in the end.Ulimately, I enjoyed watching the show and had fun the majority of the time I was watching it. However, I have a special disdain for endings to shows that provide no closure, no satisfaction and no conclusion to the romantic subplot. Though it is excusable on the fact that the manga wasn\'t done yet, the adaptation could have waited at least a few years to allow for the completion of the story arcs in order to provide an ending that didn\'t feel so unsatisfactory or disappointed. With that in mind, you should definitely watch the show as it is a fun, cute little romp and will have you catching the feels the whole time you\'re watching, only for them to be thrown out with the garbage at the show\'s limp ending.Papa Bless. but to enter a co-ed school"".

But the anime adaptation only tells a quarter of that story and falls well short of a point in the narrative when Kazama, the primary love interest, begins to receive thorough characterization that explains her previously selfish actions.You see, before we begin to understand what makes Kazama tick she comes off as an obtuse annoying dumbass who opposes the aesthetic of Sumi almost entirely. Kazama loves girls who are short! Sumi is tall. Kazama loves girls who wear...frilly feminine clothing! Sumi has no fashion sense. Kazama loves girls who flaunt their femininity! Sumi practices karate...that she later gives up to appease her unrequited love. Imagine being told by the person you love that you aren't their type every single day? That's Sumi-chan's life. These awkward situations are often played as comedy, but it's not particularly funny watching insecurities being poked at so carelessly. There is a point in the manga where all of this becomes forgiven, but the anime never comes close to that moment.To make matters worse, only one chapter is covered per episode. This means twenty minutes is spent covering twenty pages. Which means the viewer has to sit through Sumi's torment for much longer than it would take to read the manga in one go.Unless you enjoy watching half assed romance adaptations that stop well short of a consummated relationship and are restricted by a (then) incomplete source material, there's no reason to watch this anime over the (now) presently completed manga. frilly feminine clothing!

I nearly fell asleep. I\'m surprised I finished it. If you\'re looking for random school activities with subtle Yuri hints, this is the one for you.

I this doesn\'t even qualify as Yuri anime apart from the protagonist\' unrequited feelings. Might only be interesting if you\'re 13-14 and there\'s something relatable in the content for you at how difficult it is to process things.The characters are themselves pretty dull and with nothing extraordinary.

The set up is always pretty perfect to bring you up and then send you crashing back down. This made Sasameki Koto kind of an...emotional rollercoaster at times.The OP song is beautiful but gets overused in the show itself. The art sometimes has some weird CG and characters suffer a lot from same face syndrome but they handle the ugly cry scenes so well that it makes me want to give it a pass.There are different levels of relationships explored throughout, but the longing, lonely feeling you get from wanting something you can't have in fear of losing what was there in the first place will hit home for almost anyone who has ever been in that situation. emotional rollercoaster at times.The OP song is beautiful but gets overused in the show itself.

Then I read the manga, and was much more satisfied after that.Sasameki Koto is one of those yuri shows that I feel like deserves more attention. Nice art style, good music (although, a bit lacking at times,) and the comedy is great. As a girl who like girls myself, I can safely say I enjoyed it thoroughly.This is one of those rare yuri anime that caught my interest more quickly than the others, because the plot isn’t just “new...shy and meek transfer student girl has a crush on the strong and powerful school star girl.”Sumika Murasame is portrayed as strong due to her karate skills, but she’s also portrayed as a total dork trying to get Ushio’s attention and it’s adorable. (Also, these sorts of yuri tales are almost always shown in the point of view of the “softer” girl.) Ushio is great because she’s wonderfully oblivious of Sumika’s love, and she’s quite overt about her feelings for girls that’s both comedic and empowering.I also enjoyed the side characters. Kiyori is cheerfully blunt and Tomoe’s particularly interesting for a princely type.On the other hand, I despised Miyako and Aoi. Their existence brought down my score a little, actually. Aoi especially grinded my gears with her over-the-top persona.Another thing that brought down my score was the fact that the last few episodes (aside from 11, I suppose,) were pretty filler. There’s even a few filler chapters after that in the manga, which I believe could have been cut completely and replaced with the ending from the first manga omnibus.As for sound, hit or miss. The soundtrack was nice at times but boring at others. The main song “Kiss,” is delightful, and the theme song in my opinion is amazing. But the music at least never feels overly out of place, even if boring at times.I suppose that’s all I really have to say for now.

Like Citrus and NTR: Trap, it’s very obvious that Sasameki Koto was written with men who like to watch girls kissing in mind other than actual sapphic women. This anime features a large breasted (and often objectified for that reason) airhead that has a crush on a girl solely for her looks and is coveted by her socially awkward and somewhat perverted best friend. Most of the side characters are uninteresting or disturbing like the only boy in the series who has a crush on Sumika but was forced into cross dressing by...his little sister. There is a scene in a restaurant where he and Sumika go out to eat while he is still dressed like a girl and it’s very difficult to watch. He goes to open a packet of creamer and it splashed on his face while he whimpers and winces (on one hand to show femininity and the other as an innuendo which you can probably assume by now). The whole story is a will-they-or-won’t-they between Ushio and Sumika and by the end of it, I could only think “they’re perfect for each other because they’re both bad characters”. I’d give this show a 3/10 at best (because the soundtrack was pretty decent and it had a fine art style for it’s time) but as for characters and plot, it was abyssmal.

Not fan of those, I mean yuri is nice, but for some reason how most of yuri stuff is made, is quite boring for me.Aside that I found that story was wrapped up in a quite weak way or maybe in a sense even open-endedPoint being, story was okay, it was a bit different that typical shoujo ai/yuri series. Had enough things happening, some cute moments, some sad moments, lots of gag moments and so on. So In my book. It was good enough.✦Art & SoundWell.. typical issue with art. It\'s quite old and I cannot really remember if for those years, it was good or bad art. So, thus I give it 6, meaning it was good enough. Nothing else to say regarding that.As for sound, it had few nice soundtracks, but for the most part didn\'t notice them much. Issue with OST.. in a lot of cases you have to listen to them separately, where sometimes you discover that Anime had really good tracks, but not noticeable at all in the Anime itself.  But, in the end sound/ost/music was good enough.✦CharacterWell, I did mentioned the main girl. Basically an ecchi harem protagonist, female edition. And the second main girl is a bit of a selfish ahem.., basically ""women  mind sometimes is just wtf..."" She was a bit of a tease as well. Kinda pulling around and never saying anything herself.. and then just build up drama and end up blaming others. Basically.There were also quite some interesting sidekicks. I cannot remember the names, but we had pretensions poet who acts like narcissistic prince. Then we have a cute moeblob who is actually an absolute nightmare. And kinda a straight act girl that goes at her own pace at things.Bunch of other characters as well, but those probably were the most worthy to mention. So again.. I found the characters quite okay, their development did exist to some point. But couldn\'t really grow into them or like as much. Thus the ""good enough"".✦Enjoyment & Overall""good enough"". Sums it up. It was semi-interesting lesbian Anime with a bit of a different approach than the stereotypical yuri Anime.

Which was a nice thing.', 'As an avid yuri fan, LA likes looking at all spectrum of a genre, be it the serious melodramatic kind or the more laid back slice of life look, Sasameki Koto itches LA\'s latter...Sasameki Koto is the story of one Sumika Murasame voiced by Ayahi Takagaki, a tall, tough girl who is in love with Ushio Kazama voiced by Megumi Takamoto who loves cute things and cute things...you can see where the ""obstacle"" is in this yuri relationship, of course other characters comes into light as the ""Girls Club"" is formed in which most of the cast is swept into but by the end they...are all friends by the end of it....but the main focus clearly goes into Ushio and Sumika\'s blooming relationship or if they can both mutually have feelings for one another.Sasameki Koto starts off rather serious though, having a third wheel ALREADY in the form of Chizuka Nishikigi voiced by Saori Hayami and having Sumika be by Ushio\'s side with the melodrama at hand whilst also trying to get closer to Ushio in the process, once that is out of the however Sasameki Koto takes on a much more comedic, slice of life approach to it\'s episodes, both developing Ushio and Sumika along with the cast of the Girls Club that joins.The main cast excluding the main yuri couple does get their moment in the spotlight at times, from Masaki ""Akemi-chan"" Akemiya voiced by Ayaka Shimizu and his butt monkey ways (who has a crush on Sumika), to the brazen yuri duo of Miyako Tamae voiced by Chiwa Saito and Tomoe Hachisuka voiced by Hitomi Harada that were the catalyst to Girls Club forming as well as Tomoe knowing quite naturally of Sumika\'s crush on Ushio and finally Azusa Aoi voiced by Mayuki Makiguchi being the shy type BUT is also a yuri doujinshi creator. Akemiya though being the only prominent guy in the anime, is nothing but a butt monkey to the entire cast and as we know quite clearly of Sumika\'s love is ALL towards Ushio..he never had a chance but getting some development in the form of how his *ahem* quirk came about through his sister Manaka voiced by Ayana Taketatsu is sufficient enough in LA\'s eyes. Miyako is the typical two-faced cutezy yet not girl with a quick temper in contrast to Tomoe\'s cool and collected yet wildly sharp personalities, they are something of a foil to Ushio and SUmika\'s friendship/relationship. Azusa as a character was something of an obstacle for Sumika at first but as Azusa assessed the situation she got herself into, she became a much more less restrictive character though at the expense of her interests (*cough*) AND lastly Kiyori Torioi voiced by Emiri Katou is the comedic relief character with the genki personality down pat and is initially Ushio and Sumika\'s best friend and was all throughout the anime.Sasameki Koto is something of character-driven story mainly focusing on Ushio and Sumika and to that, Ushio as a character is pretty vanilla in all honesty in which she has some grasp of Sumika\'s feelings but not in it\'s entirety but by the end of it, LA felt like she had an inkling of the sorts, as for Sumika, well she thinks of Ushio almost 24/7 and sometimes that can make her seem rude or impulsive many times (though some times it\'s taken for laughs) but that just shows she REALLY cares for Ushio and considering the anime has the major focus and narrative focus on Sumika LA can let...some...of this slide. Thing is, LA thought Sumika was LA\'s favorite character even with some of the character flaws LA mentioned abut her, her drive to wanting to make her relationship with Ushio not only work out in tough times but to bloom further is commendable to say the least...LA just wished she was at least slightly more courteous to the other members, which she does to some extent by the end of it.In terms of animation by AIC, the animation was just decent...nothing horrible or derpy but also nothing too grand, AIC just the basis of the typical anime look from the 2000\'s from the character designs and background and well was just decent. To be honest the animation is the least impressive thing LA found out, but ""not impressive"" is not an insult to Sasameki Koto\'s animation as well as the typical anime style at the time. Sasameki Koto also has the comedic facial reactions also in and again that didn\'t make the animation bad, actually LA was expecting it. ALl in all, the animation done by AIC was slightly average but not much to praise besides no derpiness and it was consistent.Voice work on the other hand is something different, LA didn\'t even notice so many noticeable voice actors in this anime before they got famous (or were famous at the time), like Cihwa Saito as Miyako, SAORI HAYAMI as Chizuka, Hitomi Harada as Tomoe and Emiri Katou as Kiyori, in which LA was most surprised by Saori Hayami and Hitomi Harada in their respective roles. The main voice cast was great to be expected for such an anime and yes...like favorite characters...LA liked Ayahi Takagaki\'s performance all round so she easily got MVP (pretty much Sumika being a Chris Yukine before Chris Yukine vocals).Sasameki Koto is not an overly dramatic yuri love story and that is totally fine as it plays to it\'s strengths of being a comedy slice of life anime involving yuri, mainly from MOST of the cast and for the most part with all the fluff and playing around the anime does, it not only develop it\'s characters with interesting quirks but also gives us an inkling towards the main romance focus...which -sigh- doesn\'t get any resolution by the end of anime thus LA\'s ""inkling"" and really LA can look at the anime\'s ending in two ways, a ""read the manga"" pessimistic look at it or to look at the ending\'s """"inkling"" as something will happen to Ushio and Sumika or they mutually know but just can\'t say it...and have an optimistic view on it but LA felt for both really, like the ending doesn\'t outright ruin the anime as it was pretty low key with ALOT of yuri nudges here and there and with Sumika\'s devotion to Ushio being a rather strong ship tease for the ""one true pairing"" that LA felt torn by it\'s ending but weirdly satisfied even if the ending didn\'t give us a resolution.Sasameki Koto has it\'s flaws sure from the ok animation and many intentional character flaws and especially with the ending it gave us but for what Sasameki Koto does which is mainly centered towards it\'s characters, then it did a good job on that hand and shows that yuri animes doesn\'t need constant melodrama to make a yuri anime, but Sasameki Koto keeps it\'s strengths too close to it\'s sleeve is what is LA getting at. Sasameki Koto is but a look at the daily lives of these girls (and one boy) and how they deal with and or their relationships in their lives, one step at a time and to that LA says that...it\'s fine. are all friends by the end of it....but the main focus clearly goes into Ushio and Sumika\'s blooming relationship or if they can both mutually have feelings for one another.Sasameki Koto starts off rather serious though, having a third wheel ALREADY in the form of Chizuka Nishikigi voiced by Saori Hayami and having Sumika be by Ushio\'s side with the melodrama at hand whilst also trying to get closer to Ushio in the process, once that is out of the however Sasameki Koto takes on a much more comedic, slice of life approach to it\'s episodes, both developing Ushio and Sumika along with the cast of the Girls Club that joins.The main cast excluding the main yuri couple does get their moment in the spotlight at times, from Masaki ""Akemi-chan"" Akemiya voiced by Ayaka Shimizu and his butt monkey ways (who has a crush on Sumika), to the brazen yuri duo of Miyako Tamae voiced by Chiwa Saito and Tomoe Hachisuka voiced by Hitomi Harada that were the catalyst to Girls Club forming as well as Tomoe knowing quite naturally of Sumika\'s crush on Ushio and finally Azusa Aoi voiced by Mayuki Makiguchi being the shy type BUT is also a yuri doujinshi creator.

They\'ve known each other for a while now, however, Sumika\'s developed a pretty hard crush on Ushio, who is completely oblivious to this.  We view the everyday lives of these characters, and those around them, until we see what ultimately comes of their relationship.  The beginning starts out strong and we get a strong sense of how our two characters are and where we...want to be.The main problem here is that the plot doesn\'t proceed save for some baby steps.  Don\'t get me wrong.  The finale is great and was really touching.  But it feels like the type of episode that should be somewhere in the middle.  This clearly shows that they know what makes up a good episode, but there just aren\'t enough of these moments.  The characters get very involved and I honestly enjoyed it.  But they explored Sumika and Ushio\'s relationship at such a slow pace, that there wasn\'t a satisfying conclusion at the end.  Series like these tend to have very long term stories and unfortunately, they just can\'t fit together in a thirteen episode series.  This is what the entire anime felt like it was suppose to aim towards and it didn\'t get close enough.  (5/10)Characters: The characters as a whole are mostly hit or miss for me.  Sumika\'s the class representative, though she doesn\'t really come off as super popular to us.  She\'s very athletic due to her previous involvement in the karate studio that her dad runs.  As previously mentioned, she has a crush on Ushio, but has a very difficult time summing up the courage to tell her.  She is actually pretty reserved until one of her friends does something that would make her outburst, akin to a character like Naruto.  It did get on my nerves a few times, just because it was getting more frequent the more the series went on.  However, she does have strong morals and does look out for her family and friends.  However, the finale does not do justice to her character.Sumika\'s best friend, Ushio makes it pretty well known that she likes girls, which is already different from many other series within the genre.  However, she openly makes it known that she likes, what she calls, ""cute"" girls.  She clearly judges more on appearance than anything else.  This isn\'t a problem really, as this doesn\'t interfere with the plot too much.  She lives with her brother, where she mostly acts as the responsible one.  However, past these, we don\'t get a ton of insight into Ushio\'s life.Kiyori is a strange one.  She\'s one of Sumika and Ushio\'s friends, and she\'s in a lot of scenes but... she doesn\'t add much.  Her personality is somewhat predictable and she doesn\'t even act upon what she sees between her two friends.  Introduced about halfway through, Azusa is an aspiring writer that Sumika helps shortly after she\'s brought into the main story.  She isn\'t noticed much in school because of her mostly reserved nature, but she has great aspirations.  In the middle of the story, her and two other characters act as observers to Sumika and Ushio\'s complicated relationship with each other and while she makes a key observation on the bus once, I wish they followed this up.  Tomoe & Miyako are a pair of Sumika\'s classmates that are (but not really, secretly) dating, they attempt to form a ""Girl\'s Club"" as a passable club.  Miyako\'s kind of a follower, while also being a little nosy, but Tomoe\'s a perfect compliment to her,  Tomoe, like Azusa, notices Sumika\'s problems about halfway through, but again, this doesn\'t accelerate the plot as much as you\'d like.  This makes me wonder what the point of introducing this pair into the plot was because they don\'t add much if the end goal approaches so sluggishly.  Masaki is another minor character and his point to the plot is actually very clear.  He adds an interesting layer to some of the episodes and I actually found myself liking him quite a bit.  I kind of wonder if they had more to his characters should this series have continued, but he had some comedic relief in some small spots here or there.  Sumika\'s really the only one who interacts with him much though.This cast has some fantastic characters and some... less than fantastic ones.  The problem is that character development on a lot of them was absent in places I would have liked to see more.  Some of the side characters are introduced well into the series, so this limits room to develop them, but Sumika and Ushio didn\'t develop nearly as much as I would have liked.  (6/10)Art: Keeping in mind that this series is over ten years old, the art was mostly fine.  They did tend to use still-pictures during the transition scenes, but it never got in the way of anything.  There were no obvious problems here.  (7/10)Sound: I really didn\'t care for the short track that reoccurred in the the OST.  It obviously felt like a light track, but I felt like it stuck out too much and didn\'t add enough - or wasn\'t used in the right spots.  Furthermore, I didn\'t care for either the OP or ED.  The voice cast were fine - as with most Japanese voice cast.  Like the art, no obvious problems there.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: I have a hard time giving this a strong rating, just because it had such potential and very little of it was followed up on.  We\'ve had a few series where the plot feels stunted due to the short series length, and it\'s really tough to swallow each time.  When you develop your characters so little, especially together, you\'re going to have a tough time engaging your audience.

(6/10)', ""sasameki koto is definitely an interesting show. it has many elements that i downright love, but many others i could definitely do without. keep in mind i haven't read the manga yet, but i'm planning on doing so - especially since the ending of the anime is quite abrupt and leaves many questions unanswered.many other reviews here echo the same sentiment, which is that the characters are far and above the best part of this show. i especially found myself loving sumika, one of the two leads. she had such a unique dynamic happening, where one side of her is no-nonsense, tough, and cool, while...the other side is bashful, shy, and loving. she's also the funniest part of the show for me, and her crush on kazama is so consistently adorable. some moments of hers were incredibly relatable, and i always found myself rooting for her, even if she wasn't always doing the right thing. that's another character-based aspect i really enjoyed about this show: from my perspective, a lot of the cast do things that are a bit flawed - none of them are perfect. however, it feels super realistic given their age, and i love that this isn't something that's shyed away from.the remaining cast members were if nothing else, continually enjoyable. some characters weren't really revealed as anything more to the audience than their initial characterization, like kiyori or miyako, but this was okay considering both are endearing and work for what they're meant to do. however, while there Were other characters that were given time in the spotlight and reasoning for their actions, i do feel as though sasameki koto's runtime wasn't properly dived out to let everyone get properly developed. the biggest offender of this is, i feel, misaki akemiya. i found their character to be very compelling, and it seems like the story seemed to be moving in a direction that almost implied them to be an egg (a transgender character who hasn't noticed it yet). plus, Their crush on sumika was very cute! however, it was a bit saddening to see that they didn't do much with their character past a certain point - something i assume happens later in the manga. they were sort of just forgotten about to make room for azusa in the cast, and that was disappointing for me.i do like that at the end of the show, we begin to see sumika and kazama become closer... however, there is nowhere near enough time to revel in this fact, as the anime ends soon after. it made me very happy to see this happening, but i think i would've loved to see more of kazama's side to her feelings deepening. it seems the way she feels about sumika change rather quickly, especially given how she was adamant in the beginning of the series to never want to go for someone like sumika. i assume her feelings changed when she realized sumika, having been her friend all her life, provided a closeness and safety that she hadn't gotten with anyone else - but this is all based on speculation. i sincerely hope the manga dives more into her side of the story a bit!i know that was a bit long, but i do want to say i still do think this show is enjoyable. the op and ed were both lovely, and the bizarre characteristics of the show make it unique and entertaining. i just think things could've been handled a bit better. however, if you enjoy GL that has a slow, slice-of-life air to it, i think it's still worth checking out. the other side is bashful, shy, and loving. she's also the funniest part of the show for me, and her crush on kazama is so consistently adorable. some moments of hers were incredibly relatable, and i always found myself rooting for her, even if she wasn't always doing the right thing. that's another character-based aspect i really enjoyed about this show: from my perspective, a lot of the cast do things that are a bit flawed - none of them are perfect. however, it feels super realistic given their age, and i love that this isn't something that's shyed away from.the remaining cast members were if nothing else, continually enjoyable. some characters weren't really revealed as anything more to the audience than their initial characterization, like kiyori or miyako, but this was okay considering both are endearing and work for what they're meant to do. however, while there Were other characters that were given time in the spotlight and reasoning for their actions, i do feel as though sasameki koto's runtime wasn't properly dived out to let everyone get properly developed. the biggest offender of this is, i feel, misaki akemiya. i found their character to be very compelling, and it seems like the story seemed to be moving in a direction that almost implied them to be an egg (a transgender character who hasn't noticed it yet). plus, Their crush on sumika was very cute!

I have the feeling that the production team made more changes than are typical in the adaptation of a manga. Perhaps they were told that they only had one season, but the anime only presents a small portion of the manga plot, makes liberal changes to events and the timeline of the manga, and is ultimately unsatisfying.The music struck me as strange, like something from an old movie from the 1950s or \'60s. The art was pale pastel, easy on the eyes except...when the characters were completely washed out with lack of definition. But it was the treatment of the plot that was most frustrating.The vital scenes of karate and the girls karate club, which occupied so much of the manga, were completely eliminated from the anime. Climactic scenes of confession, the ultimate pairing up of Sumika and Kazama, the growth and maturation of the characters with the events of later years in school, and the happy ending we all wanted, all were left on the cutting room floor.So it is the editing of the manga that ultimately gets this a rating of ""fair"", 6 out of 10. I don\'t think I will ever watch the anime again, but I will reread the manga, for no other reason than to recapture my happy memories of this beautiful love story. when the characters were completely washed out with lack of definition.

The show was so slowly and poorly paced, and it\'s not hard to see why. A mere chapter was adapted per episode, and when you compare the manga to the anime, you can see various embellishments and utter useless scenes being put in the anime to have a frustratingly slow paced show whose sole purpose of being slow paced was to make sure the animators needed to animate as little as possible.Unfortunately, Sasameki Koto suffers more than just poor pacing. I actually kind of enjoy the main cast of characters in the Girls club....Tomoe, Kiyori, and Tamae are fun additions to the story, but the other side characters are superfluous and fail to make an impact on the story other than pitiful attempts of drama and comic relief.I assume that Sasameki Koto is more of a romance and slice of life show than a slapstick comedy show, yet why is it that it borrows so much from the latter? For a show to be all about unrequited love with Sumika hopelessly in love with Ushio and the story making a big deal about it, why is it that Akemiya, who is in the same situation, being trivialized as comic relief for the show? Sumika and Akemiya are both in the same boat, yet the show does not really care about Akemiya at all other than for him to make a fool of himself as a crossdresser and being pushed around by Sumika, who also is uncaring and lacks empathy for his situation.The same can be said about Aoi, who is a  complete waste of space and time in the story. Her introduction into the story can be said to be unnecessary, and only brought it because it accelerates the plot and brings in a level of jealousy for Ushio. Her conflict is barely relevant to the plot, and you really wonder why she ever got introduced in the story to begin with.As for Sumika herself, she too, acts like an idiot half the time. Remember what I said about slapstick comedies? Sometimes, Sumika acts like a lovestruck idiot that goes beyond being infatuated with Ushio for the sake of ""comedy"" but all it does is make me lose any interest in her as a character since the show tries to portray her unrequited love as a painful thing, yet also tries to create low-level humor out of it as well.With all my complaints, I\'m probably still going to read it later, just because I am a bit curious as to what happens. As for the quality of the show? Not great. I think that the yuri theme of the story fits a decent bit, but at the same time, there\'s not too much involvement with the seriousness of that particular theme, but the show doesn\'t tokenize the characters and doesn\'t try to milk the genre, so you got that going for it.

Shaonian Ge Xing,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38918/Shaonian_Ge_Xing,"[""Great Journey of Teenagers follows several characters: An oblivious newbie disciple of a famous master Lei Wujie, a crippled former prodigy disciple and disowned prince that owns a snowy mountain inn Xiao Se, a famous assassin and disciple of a famous Master, Tang Lian, Tang Lian's Master's third-wheeling tsundere daughter Sikong Qianluo and Tang Lian's yandere companion Maiden Rui.Their fates become intertwined when they encounter Tang Lian's mission to escort a golden coffin - a heavily rumored coffin said to house many secrets of the martial arts world. Their journey of escorting this coffin ends abruptly when a young monk emerges from the coffin,...Wu Xin is the young monk who is said to have mastered all the Temple's secret martial arts and it is speculated that he is the last person to have them after all the secret martial arts manuals were destroyed in a fire.Wu Xin's journey involves disciple Lei Wujie and cripple Xiao Se as he scatters along the plains to put his mentor/old friend's soul to rest. On the way, they encounter many obstacles but Wu Xin's wit persists in order to fulfill his wish. All the while, he is being chased by several opposing factions set out to capture him.Story: 3/10Great Story of Teenagers tries to masterfully blend the different perspectives of the main characters as they give chase. It also tries to incorporate many different martial arts and Buddhist principles as well as a wide range of factions that fight over Wu Xin's existence. All of this detail makes the story hard to follow and they introduce details then never mention them again (i.e the 5 immortal swordsmen, the horse stealing gang etc.) The way we see progress in the story is by having the characters spoon feed it to us while they're talking to another character (i.e Lei Wujie asks Xiao Se and then Xiao Se explains it) Overall, this repetitive progression is just lazy and full of filler content that can be skipped.Art & Sound: 4/10 5/10The art and animation was pretty good. The subtitles were problematic the entire time I watched this series. Since many of the characters talk in idioms the subtitles are constantly popping off with explanations of the idioms or the Chinese respelling in English letters. This makes it even more difficult to grasp other character names because it's hard to tell whether they're talking about a character or idiom.The sound was average, nothing too notable.Character: 5/10The character establishment was actually pretty interesting. Many of the main characters like Wuxin, Xiao Se and Lei Wujie had mysterious backgrounds in the beginning but eventually on the journey they expressed their past based on the obstacles they encountered. If this was the main premise of character establishment I would have enjoyed this series much better than the current amount of characters in this series. At many points of the story it's hard to determine which of the 3 are the main characters and it goes back and forth between disciple Lei Wujie and the monk Wu Xin. I would have preferred if it centered around one character since we don't get confused on whos back story is developing (since each of the 3 have a backstory that develops as the story progresses it gets confusing to denote the main-main character) Overall, I enjoyed the main 3 character establishment and development but disliked how other characters were brought in and forcefully established to evoke emotional conflict in the end 6 episodes.Enjoyment & Overall: 4/10This series had me lost 85% of the time mostly because of the subtitles but also because it tries to establish a large amount of small fry characters in a short amount of time. This isn't the first time a series has tried to do this. The amount of story lore is a but much as well since it is only known to us once and then discarded. Overall 4 is a pretty blunt rating but I can't find anything notable about the series.

And that you were awestruck by the grandeur of the farthest, towering peak as you approach the nearer mountains? Shaonain ge xing is one such multi-faceted, layered story that got more fascinating as the plot unfolded.Shaonian Ge Xing (SGX) is a webnovel by Zhou Mu Nan. The anime actually follows the chapters of the novel rather closely (almost 1 ep = 1 chapter). Strictly speaking, SGX is a prologue of sorts. The story centers on Wu Xin and has a coherent...plot with a satisfying end. The central mystery that drive the plot and character development is well paced in its execution and reveal. But as the story progresses, another more intriguing tale is layered upon the main story, thrusting Xiao Se into the spotlight and expanding the narrative much more.The world-building is rich. The pugilist world is vibrantly set up with myriad sects, sword deities and distinct power levels that sounds awesome (for example 逍遥天境 – it was translated as “unrestrained sky realm” but it honestly doesn’t capture its true poetic essence). The political/court intrigues hum in the background and occasionally rears its head to intersect violently with the pugilist world, deepening drama and mystery.Character-wise, the development is rather uneven. Of the 4 main characters, Tang Lian's character development is the weakest followed by Lei Wu Jie. Since this anime is a Wu Xin tale and the novel is a Xiao Se story, the latter 2 get great character arcs. However, I do have a criticism on Sikong Qianluo. She does not actually appear so early in the novel. I suspect to prevent the show from descending into a sausage-fest, Sikong Qianluo was forcibly introduced early. The 2 underlings that she eventually acquired in the show was a low point in the anime since their attempt at humor was crass and not remotely funny (My only true gripe of the show).On production values, for a 3D Chinese animation in 2018, SGX stood out for me in terms of their facial rendering. The characters are expressive and complement their layered dialogue perfectly. The fights are visually appealing though nothing to write home about. There were a few scenes that stood out cinematographically for me – watch out for Xiao Se when he steps out of this inn in episode one. Revisit it after you learn his backstory and the scene will hit differently. The mark of a good show is rediscovering added dimensions in scenes, dialogues upon repeat viewings and SGX attest to that.In closing, Shaonian Ge Xing is a well-crafted wuxia story that gives a glimpse of further greatness (and yes Season 2 is already complete). The rich details in storytelling and dialogue thus demand high quality translation to capture the nuances and intricacies of the tale.

Show By Rock!! #,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32038/Show_By_Rock_,"[""(Warning: English isn't my native language)Before you assume I am a SB69 hater, please check my MAL. The first season is listed as my favorite and I truly love this franchise.The reason why it scored this low, is because of my disappointment.Yes. I am very, very disappointed in this season. Heck, even the specials had better writing.Sanrio could've done so much better. I wasn't expecting a solid or deep story, but Show By Rock # was a true trainwreck imo. The plot was all over the place. Whereas S1 had a very clear premise, it seemed like the creators themselves didn't really know where they...wanted to go with their story in S2.So we have this issue with the Dark Queen, then Dagger jumps in again, Tsurezure are plotting on something and there's also ACAREAFACT boycotting Shingancrimsonz. Oh, we also get Bud Virgin Logic's personal struggles as well. And some backstories (which were mostly really nice btw).But honestly, that's a lot for a series with only 12 episodes, especially if you consider they still managed to add some episodes where the story had little to no progress.Then again, the story itself felt like a carbon copy of season 1, except we got a lot of new characters, that had barely screentime.What disturbed me the most is how the series seemed to make a big deal out of certain events, that were solved in a few seconds. Evil characters turn into cinnamon rolls after they realized their love for music.I think it'd be a better idea if the series sticked to the games canon. It had so much potential... I know I was expecting too much, but the beginning made me expect those things. It seemed like they took a little bit 'too' much plot and weren't able to handle it.Look. This series wasn't bad. Just disappointing. There were a ton of great things too! As I said earlier, I was really happy to see some character getting backstories. As usual, the music was amazing too! I loved the song at the end btw! I also thought it was great how we got to see a lot more of the in-game bands! Every time one of them appeared, I was so happy! And I'm also really thrilled that my hc's about Ailane turned out to be canon!Even though I'm bitching a lot about this series, I hope (but doubt) they'll make a third season. At the end I still love the characters, artstyle, music and general idea.Yes this series was disappointing, but I still love it somehow, if that makes sense. wanted to go with their story in S2.So we have this issue with the Dark Queen, then Dagger jumps in again, Tsurezure are plotting on something and there's also ACAREAFACT boycotting Shingancrimsonz.

The first season of Show By Rock was a cute and fun show, but it was held back by adhering to tired cliches and a lack of expanding on its core cast of characters, especially Cyan. But it\'s rare for a second season of a show to...actually improve on the first season and make an effort to fix its flaws. Not all of them, mind you, but I can wholeheartedly say that Show By Rock # really improved on the first season!Taking place right after the events of the first season, life in Sound World is back to normal, with everyone going about their lives, particularly Plasmagica trying to make it without Cyan. Unfortunately, the peace doesn\'t last. Dagger has recruited a new band to restart his attempt at world domination, but ironically, his return is dwarfed by the revelation that a mysterious being known as the Queen of Darkness threatens to eliminate music entirely. The people of Sound World receive word from a band coming from the future, Ninjinriot, that the Queen of Darkness successfully took over Sound World, and went back to the past to warn them about it in advance so they can find a way to stop her once and for all. With this new knowledge in mind, there\'s only one thing to do: Bring Cyan back and have her work her musical magic to save Sound World a second time!So yeah, the second season still rehashes the usual ""save the world from an evil entity"" plotline this time around, and Cyan is still shilled as the magical chosen one without any real explanation whatsoever. Those parts of the show haven\'t changed a bit. But other than those two things, the creators seemed to make an effort to fix at least a good portion of the first season\'s flaws. For one, while Dagger as a villain is still as cliche and SatAm cartoonish as usual, he doesn\'t get any focus this time around, as the second season features a new main villain, and some minor ones, with actual, fleshed out backstories that explain their descent into villainy while still managing to make them somewhat sympathetic, even if said backstories don\'t excuse their actions. Not gonna lie, I like the second season\'s villain much better than Dagger.The production values and soundtrack are still top notch as usual, even if the show still goes overboard with its sparkly moe aesthetic. Then again, it wouldn\'t be Show By Rock without its overdose of sparkle and moe cutesiness, now would it? But more than that, SBR\'s second season fixed a major flaw that I previously had with the first season: Actually bothering to give the characters focus episodes and development. In the first season, the only characters who ever really got fleshed out were Chuchu and Rom. Season two finally got around to fleshing out a good portion of the main and side characters, many of whom desperately needed it, such as Moa, Aion, Rosia, Shuzo, and a few others. Not all of them got this treatment, mind you, as several other new bands are introduced just to be cameos from the game (Looking at you, Dolly Dolci. I don\'t like them. They were just really annoying), but the characters that actually matter are finally given the development they deserved. Granted, I\'ve seen other shows do it better, but considering how the first season struggled with it before, I\'m willing to give season two a pass here, as it still made the effort. The show also took the time to flesh out the members of the two new bands who appear, Arcareafact and Bud Virgin Logic, all of whom have their share of focus, strengths, weaknesses, and so on.Another thing that makes season two better than the first season is the fact that it also tried to flesh out its setting a bit more. In the first season, every person in Sound World has what\'s called a Melodisian Stone, which glows brightly when bands perform awesome music, but the show never bothered to really explain what they were or where they come from. Season two actually provides a solid origin story for the Melodisian Stones, something that honestly blew my mind when I first watched it when it first aired. Most shows of this nature generally don\'t bother with worldbuilding, or at the very least only put in a barebones effort. The fact that Show By Rock, a franchise made by a company that typically makes products for children, still cared enough about its setting to flesh it out somewhat is admirable, even though I admit I have seen other shows do it better.However, as much as I want to love SBR season two and lavish it with praise, as you can tell by the rating, it\'s still not a perfect show, and still has its own problems, barring the ones carried over from season one. First off, one character has a brief backstory established in the first season, only for an episode of this season to completely retcon it and give him a new one out of whole cloth, contradicting what it had established about him earlier. Granted, I like said character\'s new backstory, as I feel it makes more logical sense than what season one established about him, but it\'d be better to commit to just one idea rather than say a character is one thing and then going against it later. You\'ll know which character I\'m talking about if you watch both seasons, and no, it\'s not Rom. His backstory was actually consistent. Secondly, while I\'m happy that Uwasanopetals got less screen time this season and don\'t spend their time whining all the time, there\'s a subplot involving them that seems like it\'ll be the start of something bigger, but it never goes anywhere, nor does it really get any real resolution. Considering SBR has a fourth season coming out, for all I know they might address this in there, but as it stands, maybe SBR would have benefited from just saving that subplot for season four, rather than just hinting at it in this season and not doing anything with it. And in case anyone\'s wondering, yes, SBR still indulges in having certain characters show off a lot of cleavage and unnecessary close-ups of jiggling boobs. Though thankfully that\'s as far as any fanservice in this show gets. But does any of this kill my enjoyment of the show in any way? Hell no! I still love SBR and all its kooky, sparkly, musical moeness, and I\'m willing to be thankful for the progress its made rather than dwell on what it could have been.While the sequel still has its own share of issues, Show By Rock season two really tried to fix the first season\'s flaws admirably while still remaining a fun, entertaining show. And yes, you can bet your ass I\'m looking forward to season four. actually improve on the first season and make an effort to fix its flaws. Not all of them, mind you, but I can wholeheartedly say that Show By Rock # really improved on the first season!Taking place right after the events of the first season, life in Sound World is back to normal, with everyone going about their lives, particularly Plasmagica trying to make it without Cyan.

The fact that Show By Rock, a franchise made by a company that typically makes products for children, still cared enough about its setting to flesh it out somewhat is admirable, even though I admit I have seen other shows do it better.However, as much as I want to love SBR season two and lavish it with praise, as you can tell by the rating, it\'s still not a perfect show, and still has its own problems, barring the ones carried over from season one. First off, one character has a brief backstory established in the first season, only for an episode of this season to completely retcon it and give him a new one out of whole cloth, contradicting what it had established about him earlier. Granted, I like said character\'s new backstory, as I feel it makes more logical sense than what season one established about him, but it\'d be better to commit to just one idea rather than say a character is one thing and then going against it later. You\'ll know which character I\'m talking about if you watch both seasons, and no, it\'s not Rom. His backstory was actually consistent. Secondly, while I\'m happy that Uwasanopetals got less screen time this season and don\'t spend their time whining all the time, there\'s a subplot involving them that seems like it\'ll be the start of something bigger, but it never goes anywhere, nor does it really get any real resolution. Considering SBR has a fourth season coming out, for all I know they might address this in there, but as it stands, maybe SBR would have benefited from just saving that subplot for season four, rather than just hinting at it in this season and not doing anything with it. And in case anyone\'s wondering, yes, SBR still indulges in having certain characters show off a lot of cleavage and unnecessary close-ups of jiggling boobs. Though thankfully that\'s as far as any fanservice in this show gets. But does any of this kill my enjoyment of the show in any way? Hell no! I still love SBR and all its kooky, sparkly, musical moeness, and I\'m willing to be thankful for the progress its made rather than dwell on what it could have been.While the sequel still has its own share of issues, Show By Rock season two really tried to fix the first season\'s flaws admirably while still remaining a fun, entertaining show. And yes, you can bet your ass I\'m looking forward to season four.', 'Hello! Thank you for taking your time to read this review.Show By Rock!! # is one of those anime where you will feel the absolute cringeworthy scenes yet stay because of whatever reason you have. I don\'t hate this show, I just feel like the second season was a bit disappointing.If you watched all of the episodes you will feel a bit disappointment because it didn\'t end the way we actually wanted. It\'s like we were expecting something yet it wasn\'t the one that we were expecting. I will not review it separately because the score is pretty much the same, a 7. They...are somethings that they lack from the first season, some that got a bit better, but that\'s that.The reason why I give this anime a 7, mostly because it doesn\'t feel logical anymore given that the main character, Cyan, was teleported to Midi City using a phone. While in this season, she was transported here by a giant robot. It confuses you in the beginning, and this question will likely pop-up like, ""Wait, Sound World is not a game world?!"" or ""Wait, Sound World does really exist?!"".Then later more questions are added, only to confuse you.Art remained the same, but they left out the 3D animation a lot on this one, (that\'s what I feel like seeing anyway).This anime does give me some surprises and some clearance for characters about why they know each other.  But there\'s something missing on this anime that made me feel like giving it a lower score this time. I like that they gave us a second season for this series, but I feel disappointed.But I guess it is just me, but then again, it is up to you after all if you want to watch this anime yes or not. Because I also watch other anime that have like the average score of 5 to 6.Once more, thank you for reading this review and I hope it was helpful for many readers out there who are thinking if they watch this show or not. are somethings that they lack from the first season, some that got a bit better, but that\'s that.The reason why I give this anime a 7, mostly because it doesn\'t feel logical anymore given that the main character, Cyan, was teleported to Midi City using a phone.

Does the second season called \'Show by Rock!!#"" really suffer from seasonal rot? Sadly, I\'d have to admit it kinda does compaired with the previous season, but it\'s a no-brainer answer if your anime adaption is based of a mobile rhythm game. It\'s already impressive for the series to manage in getting a sequal because many anime game adaptations only manage to produce...only one anime season that doesn\'t really get recieved well most of the time.Story: 5/10 (Average)Compaired with the first season, the story of this one is a bit dissapointing to say the least. You can basicly kinda predict what will happen at the finale when you have watched the first episodes and if you\'re familiar with the previous season. For some that could be a bummer, but I didn\'t took the previuous season serious and so you should not take the story for this season serious iether. It just keeps on following the story what happend in previous season. If you liked the randomness and cuteness from previous season, you would probably like this season aswell. On the emotional aspect of things, I find the story bit more wholesome compaired with the previous season. But then again, I have to keep in mind this anime is still is a sequal of an anime adaptation of a mobile rhythm game for iOS and Android devices.Art: 6/10 (Fine)Sadly the bad & wierd CGI transaction does make a return just like in the previous season that in my opinion hurts the anime quite a bit. It\'s probably one of the key points why most people don\'t like this anime series I guess. It just feels it gets way less often used compaired with previous season. On the other hand the rest of the art-style is once again quite decent and cute enough to get diabetes.Sound: 7/10 (Good)The sound was atleast music for my ears and for sure indeed one of the main selling factors for this show. I\'m a fan myself of instruments that get used in mainly rock & metal music, so I really can\'t complain on the audio part. I also really can\'t say anything bad about the voice acting iether.Charathers 6/10 (Fine)All the charathers from the previous season make a comeback like the main cute kemonomimi girls from Plasmagica, the kemonomimi boys from ShinganCrimsonZ that like to pose, the girls from CritiCristia and several others you have seen from the previous season. Yet, there will be new charathers introduced. Even GAR lovers would get thier own fanservice with a new charather they would probably enjoy because how he got buffed.Enjoyment 6/10 (Fine)Just like the previous season, this anime season was a fun show to watch while lying back comfortable. Every now and then the anime made me chuckle because of the funny randomness, wich is an accomplishment already since I rarely chuckle or laugh during watching media.Overall 6/10 (Fine)In overall, I think I can let pass the second season of Show By Rock!! just above average. It\'s just because I enjoyed the first season and I really can\'t complain about the second one, but I do can reconize some seasonal rot as I really can\'t see any stories left you can squeze out of an anime adaptation for a mobile rhythm game.

Sora no Manimani,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6098/Sora_no_Manimani,"['One of my pet gripes about anime and manga is the over-abundance of school settings used throughout both mediums. Over the last few years there has been an increase in the number of stories that are based in or around a school, and while the majority of them are nothing more than mediocre offerings, some of them turn out to be rather good.It\'s unfortunate then that, of the good ones, many don\'t get the recognition they deserve.Sora no Manimani (lit. Sport of the Air, not ""At the Mercy of the Sky""), is based on the manga by Kashiwabara Mami that began in November 2005...and, at first glance, seems like just another school based comedy in the style of School Rumble, GA, Azumangah Daioh, etc. The story follows a ""year"" in the life of Ooyagi Saku, a freshmen student at Souei High School, located in the town he and his family lived in 7 years ago. Because of his love for books and reading, he is eager to join the school\'s famous Literature club, however he is somehow roped into joining the school\'s newly formed Astronomy club by a girl he hasn\'t seen for a long time.As far as stories go, this is a surprisingly simple and straightforward affair. While the concept of childhood friends has been used innumerable times in countless variations, Sora no Manimani is unusual in that the scenario doesn\'t follow the stereotypical conventions. There is no sudden blossoming of romance, no harem (even though some of the girls in the show are clearly interested in Saku), and mostly importantly, matters are allowed to progress slowly. Unlike many other shows of this type, the honesty of the plot, coupled with a healthy dose of comic relief and pacing that allows a degree of introspection amongst the characters, gives the show the same kind of feel that the original To Heart has.That\'s not to say that the plot is perfect though. The series adopts a quasi-educational stance with regards to astronomy, and explanations abound throughout the show. That said, those who have any kind of interest in astronomy or outer space will find these tidbits rather pleasing, and the fact that they are presented in a manner that maintains the flow of the story allows the viewer to absorb the information without disturbing their enjoyment of the show.Sora no Manimani is a bit of a dichotomy in terms of it\'s looks. Generally the series adopts a style of presentation and animation that isn\'t really any different from most other school based shows. The characters are all fairly plain in terms of design (although I did chuckle at the reference to Saku\'s ""Ghibli hairstyle""), and the series makes good use of various comic styles to enhance the viewer\'s amusement. The backgrounds and backdrops are nicely presented, and are surprisingly detailed in a number of scenes. CG is also well incorporated, and while it\'s sometimes easy to spot those moments, this doesn\'t impinge on one\'s enjoyment of the series.I will mention one thing that separates Sora no Manimani from the herd though, and that is the numerous, varying, and highly detailed skies that appear throughout the show. Given that there is a heavy emphasis on astronomy, it\'s to be expected that the sky would appear several times in any one episode. It\'s to the credit of Studio Comet then, that they have produced some of the best skies to appear in anime over the last few years. They\'re so good in fact, that the viewer may find themselves wondering if the real thing is just as good, such is the detail and sophistication of their presentation.One of the things that I liked about this show is that it\'s easy on the ears. The OP, ""Super Noisy Nova"" by Sphere, is a nicely choreographed J-Pop track with an upbeat feel. The ED, ""Hoshikuzu no Surround"" by CooRie, is also pure J-Pop, but has a much more melodic style. Both tracks, surprisingly, maintain the spirit of the show very well, and while I\'m not a huge fan of pop in any form, I found that these two tracks worked well with the series proper.Generally the show doesn\'t really place great emphasis on the use of mood music, with much of the series having no background accompaniment. That said, the tracks that are present are well used, and lend to the atmosphere of the scene.In terms of acting, the cast provide a repsectable portrayal of their respective characters, however there are no Oscar winners here. While the cast is able to emote rather well, the type of story, as well as the scripting, precludes the need for any stellar performances.That said, I have to admit that I did like the characters.Since the advent of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu there has been a glut of school based slice-of-life comedies involving a selection of odd characters from the annals of anime - Lucky Star, K-On, Seitokai no Ichizon, Geijustuka Art Design Class, Hyakko, etc. The one thing that each of these shows has in common is that character development doesn\'t really play a big part and the jokes are set to rapid fire. Sora no Manimani bears a striking resemblance to all of these shows in that there is a lot of humour, however this is tempered by some degree of development, especially where Saku is concerned.While the development of the other characters is sporadic at best, the show does present events in a fairly realistic manner, and although there is some predictability with regards to how the story will go, the show makes good use of what it has. In this respect the characters, while mainly being funny, are also more easily accepted by the viewer, especially when events take a more serious turn.That said, the characters are generally one dimensional, and while this isn\'t necessarily abad thing in a comedy, it does sometimes impact on how the viewer perceives any development that occurs.I will admit that I do like astronomy and comedy, so watching Sora no Manimani was an enjoyable experience for me. Whilst the humour is a tad juvenile at times, there is enough variety in the gags to keep the viewer interested, and the surprisingly detailed explanations of astronomy make a nice counterpoint to all the humour. Also, the characters, especially Mihoshi, radiate an excitement for the subject matter that made me remember what I was like as a kid first looking up at the stars.All in all, Sora no Manimani is a surprisingly enjoyable series that, while having it\'s flaws, displays a passion for it\'s related subject matter that many other shows lack. It\'s this passion that makes the show far more enjoyable than it would normally be, and while the series may not be to everyone\'s tastes, the honesty in which the series is presented allows the viewer to relate more with the characters.After all, sometimes it\'s nice to watch something that\'s just.... nice. and, at first glance, seems like just another school based comedy in the style of School Rumble, GA, Azumangah Daioh, etc. The story follows a ""year"" in the life of Ooyagi Saku, a freshmen student at Souei High School, located in the town he and his family lived in 7 years ago.

(At least for me, I started stargazing using the techniques I learned from the show.)  On the other hand, if you are not that into the subject, you may not enjoy it at all.Story:Sora no Manimani is a romance comedy, slice-of-life anime with an astronomy theme.  The story involves a bookworm (Saku Ooyagi) who really hates outdoor activities, but was coerced into follow...his hyperactive, childhood friend (Mihoshi Akeno) into the high school astronomy club.  At that time, the club was desperately recruiting new members otherwise they will be suspended.  Of course, they eventually could manage to find total of 5 members, and the story goes from there.The main focus and the most enjoyable scene of each episode are the stargazing scene.  The series goes over several important patterns and constellations of the northern hemisphere night sky of every season.  They cover the basics of how to stargaze with naked eyes, binoculars, and telescopes.  You can learn a lot of useful tricks on how to find some important stars as well.Comedy is another good part of this anime.  The humor is generally decent.  The series made me laugh out loud several times.  The show is overall refreshing to watch, and at least will keep you smile while going over it.There are also some stories about romantic relationship between each anime characters, especially the love triangle (or perhaps, quadrangle) between club members (Saku, Mihoshi, and Hime).  However, in my opinion, the romance part is probably not the strength of this series, and if you are looking into anime with this kind of plot, I would rather recommend other ones.Art:The character designs are generally adorable.  Studio Comet did a nice job with the animation.  The animation style is appropriate for this type of series, i.e., pretty easy to digest and simple on the eyes.   The animation quality is pretty high.Interestingly, the details of the night sky (e.g., the position of the stars and constellations) in this anime are quite accurate even in some very minor scenes.  I am sure the production team has done a lot of research on this.  I can even practice stargazing using some random starry night shots from the anime.Sound:The OP & ED songs are okay.  Nothing really stands out, but I think it they fit the genre of the anime well.  The background music is good in general.  Voice acting is nicely done.Character:All characters are likable, and most of them are adorable.  The interactions between the characters provide several enjoyable comedies and are fun to watch.  A few of the characters are quite well-developed especially the main ones, but most of them just come and go.  A lot of characters were introduced quite late in the season, so there was not enough time to explore them.  The studio claims that there will release some OVA or DVD specials later, which hopefully will focus more on the backgrounds of these people (e.g., the past stories of the President of the Astronomy Club).Enjoyment:Sora no Manimani is one of the most enjoyable series that I have seen.  Thanks to lovable characters, nice comedy, great voice acting roles, good quality animation, and most importantly, the astronomy theme.Overall:I would recommend Sora no Manimani to anyone who is interested in a romance comedy, slice-of-life anime with an astronomy theme.

You'll laugh out loud 12:00am in the morning watching this, disturbing your sleeping roomates.. well at least i did hahha!!! Very well drawn characters and I look forward to the story line. It's slightly like 'It started with a kiss' told in the guy version, only he is not as mean; with a humor like 'honey to clover' and it's just refreshing watch slice of life story.. I love the main characters they are soooooo funny! You JUST HAVE to watch this!! "", ""Ok. 1st I shall review this anime as an anime lover. I have one word to describe this anime. Underrated. Some people don’t even give a second glance when they hear it is about astronomy. What’s so nice about looking at stars? Boring… However, that is not the case. You DO NOT have to know anything about astronomy or possess any interest about astronomy to enjoy watching Sora no Manimani. (You may just watch it for the comedy).However, do consider this question. If right now, in the night, there is a telescope placed directly in front of you, pointing towards the moon, would you be...interested to take a look through it? If your answer is yes, then chances are you do possess some interest towards astronomy.Basically, Sora no Manimani is just a slice-of-life and comedy anime, but with an astronomy theme and some light-hearted high school romance. It begins with the quiet and reserved Saku Ooyagi returning to his hometown after many years, reuniting with his ever-energetic and enthusiastic childhood friend Mihoshi Akeno in High School (much to his dismay). There, she literally drags him into the astronomy club where his “misadventures” (in a good way) begins.Sora no Manimani has the comedic feel of K-ON! and Azumanga Daioh. It’s hilarious and crazy at the same time. With the constant antics of hyper Mihoshi and the constant misunderstandings of her relationship with Saku, you find yourself laughing out loud at every episode.( though it gets lesser near the end).There’s also the Sunohara-alike Edogawa to bring out more laughter.Romance in Sora no Manimani is light-hearted and forms most of the plot. We get to see some really interesting (and funny) relationships between the characters as the anime progress. Most of the time, the romance isn’t very deep though.The animation quality is quite amazing. The stars appear blinking and The Milky way and the winter night sky have been drawn beautifully. They’re almost like the real thing outside. The constellation art looks original and grand too. The stars have also been depicted in their correct positions, they're not just randomly scattered across the sky. Just look at how many stars of different brightness there are in the winter night sky and you will know how much effort was put in. Kudos to Studio Comet.Music is pretty good too. The opening and ending songs may sound quite average at the beginning but I’ve grown to like them. The background music is beautiful too especially in the stargazing scenes and some of the more moving scenes.Now comes my review as a fellow “astronomer”. (DO NOT read this part if you haven't watched the anime or know little about astronomy.) I was in the astronomy club during my junior college(high school). If there was one thing I learnt from there was that astronomy was not all about stars. Where were the deep-sky objects??? (pardon my ranting). Nebulas? (huge interstellar clouds of gas where stars are born) Globular clusters? (Spherical collection of stars that can contain tens of thousands to millions of stars. It’s really beautiful to view in the telescope). Where were the galaxies? It wasn’t as if they didn’t get the chance to use the telescope. Heck they even had the whole observatory (the gigantic rotating ones) twice to themselves!!! They could have even viewed supernovas with that!! (At least they did show M52, an open cluster). The moon they viewed was also disappointing since it wasn’t the side with most of the craters.(guess that can’t be helped).Putting those aside, Sora no Manimani is DEFINITELY still a joy to watch. I cannot help but smile and nod in agreement when characters share methods, tips and tricks about stargazing. The methods to identify neighbouring stars and constellations have also been explained very well too.Let me end my review with a quote from the anime (subbed): “There aren’t very many people who’ll buy a telescope to stargaze even if they’re curious, but given the opportunity, they will choose to. And fortunately, we can create that opportunity. And because we can, we want to share it with everyone.”. I believe this has been the intention of the manga’s author from the start. Sora no Manimani wasn’t meant just for astronomy enthusiasts. It was catered more towards sharing the world of astronomy with an audience who did not know about astronomy or “seemed” uninterested about it. (Maybe that's why deep-sky objects were left out).I’ve enjoyed watching Sora no Manimani. I’ll recommend this anime to anyone out there, regardless of his or her opinion about astronomy. After watching Sora no Manimani, perhaps you’ll find the “astronomer” in you. (Cheesy, I know). I’ll give Sora no Manimani an 8/10 (very good). Perhaps there’ll be more to watch and “see” if there’s a season 2.Finally, when you’re out of your house at night, going out with your family or friends… don’t forget to gaze up at the night sky every now and then...(My 1st review. Any comments/questions you have or wrong facts in my review do PM me!) interested to take a look through it? If your answer is yes, then chances are you do possess some interest towards astronomy.Basically, Sora no Manimani is just a slice-of-life and comedy anime, but with an astronomy theme and some light-hearted high school romance. It begins with the quiet and reserved Saku Ooyagi returning to his hometown after many years, reuniting with his ever-energetic and enthusiastic childhood friend Mihoshi Akeno in High School (much to his dismay). There, she literally drags him into the astronomy club where his “misadventures” (in a good way) begins.Sora no Manimani has the comedic feel of K-ON! and Azumanga Daioh. It’s hilarious and crazy at the same time. With the constant antics of hyper Mihoshi and the constant misunderstandings of her relationship with Saku, you find yourself laughing out loud at every episode.( though it gets lesser near the end).There’s also the Sunohara-alike Edogawa to bring out more laughter.Romance in Sora no Manimani is light-hearted and forms most of the plot. We get to see some really interesting (and funny) relationships between the characters as the anime progress. Most of the time, the romance isn’t very deep though.The animation quality is quite amazing. The stars appear blinking and The Milky way and the winter night sky have been drawn beautifully. They’re almost like the real thing outside. The constellation art looks original and grand too. The stars have also been depicted in their correct positions, they're not just randomly scattered across the sky. Just look at how many stars of different brightness there are in the winter night sky and you will know how much effort was put in. Kudos to Studio Comet.Music is pretty good too. The opening and ending songs may sound quite average at the beginning but I’ve grown to like them. The background music is beautiful too especially in the stargazing scenes and some of the more moving scenes.Now comes my review as a fellow “astronomer”. (DO NOT read this part if you haven't watched the anime or know little about astronomy.) I was in the astronomy club during my junior college(high school). If there was one thing I learnt from there was that astronomy was not all about stars. Where were the deep-sky objects??? (pardon my ranting). Nebulas? (huge interstellar clouds of gas where stars are born) Globular clusters? (Spherical collection of stars that can contain tens of thousands to millions of stars. It’s really beautiful to view in the telescope). Where were the galaxies? It wasn’t as if they didn’t get the chance to use the telescope. Heck they even had the whole observatory (the gigantic rotating ones) twice to themselves!!! They could have even viewed supernovas with that!! (At least they did show M52, an open cluster). The moon they viewed was also disappointing since it wasn’t the side with most of the craters.(guess that can’t be helped).Putting those aside, Sora no Manimani is DEFINITELY still a joy to watch.

But nothing I can do about that. :P~Art 10/10~The Art and Animation was superb. I can't believe that someone could portray the stars and the sky so beautfiully in an animation. I could swear that every star in our sky was in this anime.

I couldn't really believe I was watching something so great... but this moment doesn't only happen once, but serveral times through out this series. I wouldn't mind watching this show again to simply watch those moments.~Character 9/10~The characters had depth and detail.But a couple seem sketchy, and a main character wasn't fully developed in their history.I would definately look forward to seeing these characters be developed more if another series is created and to see if any romance is injected into it.~Enjoyment 10/10~I fully enjoyed this Anime series and there are parts that I will never forget.The thing that I enjoyed so much was the parts when they would escaped the lights and go watch the stars. With those beautiful stars and the epic music put with it... I simply can't explain or describe what it's like... you'll have to see and experience it yourself.

Street Fighter II V,https://myanimelist.net/anime/876/Street_Fighter_II_V,"['Personally, I really liked the approach the staff did with this series by making Ken and Ryu teenagers. Putting them at that age gives better and more sensible opportunities for character development and sets things in a whole new perspective. OK, what I am going to say is a spoiler, but I need to mention it for multiple reasons, one of the reasons is to mention a negative and to inform those who are fans of those characters who want to see this series: T.Hawk, E. Honda, and Blanka are not in this series, and Akuma only has on screen cameos. So fans of those...characters may find it disappointing. But I don&rsquo;t see how they could fit at some points and it&rsquo;s better to not have them, than have them and be useless which was a problem I had with Final Fantasy VII Advent Children which had many useless cast members. I also liked how the fights with Guile symbolized that Ken and Ryu only know what they have their training, and lack the reality combat experience Guile has on not just on the streets, but in the battlefield which defines that difference between them. And then, beomes a story of two young men trying to discover themselves goes on from there on how they must stop M. Bison, etc. But each thing is taken one step at a time to develop and connects very well. So because of the flow of the story and the liberties that was taken to open to new opportunities.Some of the character design has been changed and is not what you&rsquo;re used to. Ryu tends to look more like Ryo Hazuki from Shenmue except without his jacket, and his trademark bandana is not at all present. But it&rsquo;s not the bandana that defines the man, it&rsquo;s the man that defines the bandana, but in place of the bandana, Ryu wears a rosary given to him by a girl who worked with him at the island. Ken&rsquo;s design is faithful to the game design. Guile&rsquo;s haircut isn&rsquo;t really that exaggerated. Chun Li is really cute, but doesn&rsquo;t have her hair buns. But even if they are changed, they are still recognizable and I feel that this adds it&rsquo;s own dose of originality. Afterall, this is Street Fighter II V, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the game to be great sometimes. The Animated Movie already served that purpose. However, my main beef with the art is of course is how the guys look like they&rsquo;re on as much steroids as a pro wrestler.The action is just superb. It&rsquo;s nothing over the top by relying too much on the fireballs or other trademark moves, it&rsquo;s pure raw martial arts high-octane action. Granted it&rsquo;s not to the technical and dramatic level of the movie, but it does have it&rsquo;s own sense of intensity and style that stands out. It&rsquo;s really expressive in its own way and tells a story of what the fighters are fighting for, and how they&rsquo;re struggling. The characters&rsquo; fighting styles are well represented in the series such as Guile&rsquo;s experience, Ken and Ryu&rsquo;s power and speed, and Chun Li&rsquo;s agility. So fans will not be disappointed and those not familiar to Street Fighter will still be amazed regardless.This anime can be viewable in both Japanese and English. The English cast is very good. Ryu is portrayed as someone that is young, but yet mature and serious. Ken is portrayed as a guy who likes to mess around at times, and Guile sounds like a seasoned veteran. So the actors play their roles in a way that you expect to play them in. And naturally, I will know more and tend to favor the Japanese cast if you are at all familiar with my reviews. The Japanese cast, like the English cast, do their roles the way you expect them to do it. For seiyuu buffs, Ryu is played by Tsujitani Kouji, the voice of Miroku in Inuyasha, Seabook Arno from Gundam F91, and Bernie Wiseman in Gundam 0080. Chun Li is played by Yokoyama Chisa who is also famous for Sasami in Tenchi, and Sakura in Sakura Taisen. And believe me, seiyuu buffs maybe don&rsquo;t want to miss this one. Though you may like the Japanese voices better, the English voices, though not as big named as the Japanese cast, you have to give credit for doing their roles with accuracy to the personalities of their characters.The music is also an awesome addicting trait this anime has. Unfortunately, the DVD set that I have released by Manga entertainment took out the Japanese themes which were in the subtitled VHS releases, but still keeps the weird Eastern esque techno songs which are pretty cool, but it also hurts what also defines anime by promoting great lyrical songs such as the opening theme Kaze Fuiteru, and Cry, the ending theme. Both songs are very energetic and inspirational and go along to those themes of the anime.All I can say is, whether or you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re a Street Fighter fan, this is worth a shot. The story is a bit generic, but I still call it short being clich&eacute;. I mean, this starts out as a story about having fun, facing reality, conquering your fear, discovering yourself, and saving the world. But even though I describe the nature with negative labels, I feel I can describe this in a positive way that it does flow one step at a time, and the characters, at least the good guys, have excellent development, though it&rsquo;s what you expect in martial arts media in addition to great action. characters may find it disappointing.

Although the idea of an anime based on Street Fighter was exciting to me, I had serious doubts as to whether it would be worth watching. Furthermore, when I learned that the anime was in English, it further deterred me from watching it. During my anime watching experience, I have always despised the thought of dubbed shows because IMHO it loses a lot of character originating from the Japanese language (subbed). Anyway, for weeks the title SF2V was persistently sitting at the back of my mind until I finally decided to watch...the first episode. To my amazement, I was shocked to learn that all my preconceptions of this anime were wrong. Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that this is one of the best anime ever because it is not. But, it certainly exceeded my expectations and I must admit that I enjoyed watching this show till the very end.STORY: 7/10The premise of this anime revolves around Ryu and Ken's characters, who are 17 year olds btw. While training in Japan, Ryu receives a letter from Ken containing a plane ticket for the US, some money and the words &quot;come to America&quot; written in the letter. After giving it some brief thought, he decides to visit Ken. Upon arriving in the states, he is happy to have met ken after years and he is overwhelmed by Ken's luxurious lifestyle (yes, ken is very rich as expected). From this point onwards, the infamous duo get up to a lot of mischief, leading to major fist fights in a bar where they are confronted with a strong rival (I will not state the name of the character because it will spoil it for you). The conclusion of the fight motivates them to travel the world in pursuit of highly skilled warriors so that they can put their skills to the test in order to find out who the strongest fighter in the world is. The overall story has a nice flow to it and I am sure you will enjoy it.ART: 8/10To my amazement, the art was quite good. Please note that Ryu and Ken do not look like they do in the SF games so do not be disappointed when you find that their appearance is completely different. In my opinion, they were drawn very well and the fight scenes were nicely executed. The same applies to the rest of the characters.SOUND: 7/10I was expecting the anime to have music themes from the SF game, so I must say that this was quite a big disappointment for me :( Even so, the sound effects were good enough for the show but I think they could have easily included the original themes from the game which IMO would have improved the sound aspects of the anime considerably and would have probably received more of a fan base.CHARACTER: 7/10OK, first of all the chemistry between all the characters were quite strong. It is easy to see for instance the brotherly relationship between Ryu and Ken, so this was one of the strong points in terms of their characters. However, some of the dialog was quite corny and out of place at times but this is not a big deal. Also, for all you SF fans out there who are yet to watch this show, these are the characters that star in the show (other than Ryu and ken). Chun-Li, Guile, Balrog, Dhalsim, Cammy, Vega, Furlong, Nash aka Charlie, Sagat, M-Bison. If I have missed out any characters, then accept my apologies. Akuma does appear in the show but only as cameos so be warned that he does NOT have an active role in the show.ENJOYMENT: 7/10I found this anime to be fairly enjoyable. The story, character development, chemistry, fight scenes together with the overall presence to the show makes this a worthwhile watch. Overall, I score this anime 7/10. I must confess that I score quite strictly so a 7/10 for me may perhaps be an 8 for you. I am not sure but regardless of my score, I suggest that you watch this one especially if you are a SF fan.

After the laughably bad American movie and an even worse American cartoon adaptation on the USA channel, Street Fighter was finally going to get the masterful adaptation it deserved and bring our favorite characters to the small screen.Unfortunately, Street Fighter 2V really dropped the ball in my opinion. I had already seen Street Fighter get two  butchered adaptations, so I really wanted this version to actually stay true to the story of the games and the personality of the characters. It...isn\'t like Street Fighter was a literary masterpiece, but if you want to change everything about the plot and characters, then why bother adapting Street Fighter? Why not just make your own series with your own characters? Ryu is always dead serious in the games and never smiles...not....once! In the anime they turned Ryu into a Goku clone who is absolutely giddy that he gets to fight the next strong opponent and beat him up. Bison was always portrayed as a military mastermind who was like a mix between Napoleon and a 3rd world dictator with super powers. Yet in the anime, he takes his orders from a magical statue! Bison don\'t take shit from anyone! They turned Street Fighter into the Jacky Chan cartoon! It only gets worse. Instead of Vega and Sagat being Bison\'s 2 henchmen, the anime copied the American movie and made Zangief Bison\'s main minion. Why is this a problem? EVERY LINE Gief says is Russia this and Russia that. He is a diehard patriot that even invites Gorbachev to his victory if you beat the game as him. Why would he work for Shadowloo, who is at war with Russia? Zangief is stupid as shit, but he is NOT supposed to be evil, let alone a traitor to his country! They completely murdered his character! They try to pass Guile off as a legit badass with no tongue in cheek or comments about ""taking care of your family"". What is worse, he doesn\'t do the sonic boom. Not once. That\'s like the ONLY move he has! Yet the anime wanted to create a bullshit rule in which only Ryu and Bison can use Ki attacks. What the fuck? At least they didn\'t make Balrog a computer hacker who types while wearing boxing gloves for no reason. I guess 2V is still slightly less silly than the American cartoon. However, in retrospect at least the US toon was so stupid it\'s funny. Street Fighter 2V is mostly just boring.Animation: 3/10So you think you know bad 90s anime art right? You\'ve seen recycled animations, lazy use of still shots and key frames with a ridiculously low number of frames per second. You may not have seen animation quite as lazy as Street Fighter  2V. I mean this shit actually stands out as notably bad by even the low standards of 90s anime OVAs. At least the 2V movie looked awesome. It wasn\'t a good movie by any means, but the animation looked spectacular!Overall: 5/10If you grew up playing Street Fighter as a kid, or if you are younger and are simply curious about cheesy, old anime, you owe it to yourself to watch a few episodes of this show. At least you might get a few laughs. I\'m still going to give it a fairly generous score because I REALLY liked the Street Fighter games and this was still amusing for me despite its...flaws.

I watched this series (dubbed) in my ignorant youth when anime, to me, was all about badassery and hot blooded action. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this series: it had ""Street Fighter II"" connections, and the action seemed uber cool, making most western cartoon seem tame in comparison. Despite being vaguely aware of the corny-ness of the dub and the atrocious amount of reused animation, it was everything that anime meant to me at the time.Now, this trip down memory lane might seem out of place in a review, but (in addition to being...self indulgent,) there\'s actually a point buried within my ramblings: while I now look back and acknowledge that this probably isn\'t a great anime, it\'s tricky for me to judge it properly through the rose tinted veil of nostalgia. So with that in mind, time to move on to the meat of the review.""Street Fighter II V"", unlike ""Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie"", is not a faithful adaptation to the storyline established in the games. In fact, it takes an approach not too dis-similar to that other ""Street Fighter"" movie, you know, that awful live action one featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. No, I don\'t mean that ""Street Fighter II V"" features Jean-Claude Van Damme (not as far as I know anyway). Nor Kylie Minogue. The two are similar in their treatment of Ryu and Ken - in both they\'re portrayed as a couple of brats running around causing trouble. Unlike that Van Damme movie though, the two of them (and not Guile) are still the main characters, and the series follows them on their journey to become stronger fighters, and gradually maturing in the process.Being a purist at heart, I wasn\'t initally keen on the story deviating so far from the one in the game, but I warmed to it - it ends up as a more sophisticated story than the original, which was only intended to be an excuse to have a brawl. The show\'s treatment of Street Fighter side characters is also a pleasant break from tradition: instead of just throwing them in cameo scenes, they get a lot more focus and are properly worked into the main story, giving them a greater sense of depth. The roles of these characters deviate somewhat from the original but not without certain similarities: here, Sagat is a former Muay Thai champ wrongfully imprisoned after refusing to cooperate with a crime syndicate; Cammy is a former MI6 agent turned mercenary assassin; Akuma is... well, he still only appears in cameos. Presumably, they couldn\'t find a role badass enough to suit a guy with flaming red hair and glowing, demonic red eyes. Most of the role alterations in ""Street Fighter II V"" work out pretty well, but inevitably there are some stinkers - Balrog\'s pretty damn lame, for one... he can\'t even fight!Character design wise, there are some puzzling changes - why does Ken have ginger hair, for example - and overall it\'s a bit of a mixed bag. Ryu and Ken aren\'t particularly interesting, but at least they get some development. Chun Li is annoyingly like a typical anime school girl, and Bison\'s psychotic personality is criminally over done - he must have spent over an hour of screen time doing his villainous laugh (which also creases his face up like a hundred year old coffin dodger) and another hour strangling people (to the point where I wanted to strange HIM). He features more towards the later part of the series, and as you probably guessed from my description just now, his scenes kinda dragged.The problem isn\'t just with him though - while ""Street Figher II V"" was never what anyone would call fast paced, it slows down terribly towards the end. The episodes are filled up mostly by the characters dicking around, such as Bison laughing, Ken having recurring nightmares, Bison laughing some more, etc. The amount of reused animation and general meandering completely kills off any tension the anime is trying to build up in the climax. It seems likely that by then, the series was desperately trying to stretch its shoe string budget and the over extended story to cover the whole 29 episodes... god knows why they needed so many when the material could barely cover 20.Some of the fights themselves can be quite good when they\'re not being prolonged/recycled too much. There are some thrilling moments and the anime makes good use of tricks such as colour inversion to heighten the drama of the fights. One major complaint I have is that the special moves from the games are used sparingly, some of them not at all, and some of the ones that are used are toned down to give the fights a more down to earth feel. It\'s all very good watching Ryu and Ken learning their hadoukens and dragon punches and whatnot, but the problem is, when you\'re watching an anime based off a fighting game and you don\'t see the characters pulling off their signature moves with a certain amount of regularlity, then something feels severely lacking. Perhaps this makes ""Street Figher II V"" more accessible to those who unfamiliar with the game, but it\'s a bit of a let down to those who are. After all, why else would I be watching this show? For the story??It\'s hard to judge the audio department of ""Street Fighter II V"" fairly because I watched it in dub and the dub is very cheesey. Though it\'s possible that the original Japanese performances are better, at least some of the cheesiness is contributed by terrible script. In terms of music, the series has a few nice tracks, the most memorable of which is often played when Ryu is gathering up his hadou (some sort of spirit energy) - you know it\'s good when it can make these half hour training sessions tolerable. For the most part, the background music is handled well, though there were some very dodgy tracks that stuck out.""Street Fighter II V"" tries to find middle ground between satisfying fans of the game and those who know very little about it, and ends up not doing too well at either. But hey, though it has its share of problems, at least it doesn\'t suck sh*t like the Van Damme movie.

Its true to the story and the character representation is on point. What i like about this series it shows when Ryu was younger so he was not as serious as we see him to be in the games, but through his travel and experience and encouters with other characters, like Dhalsim and Sagat he matures, and grows as a person and character as well. The animation is really good, and the voice acting...is nice as wellThe thing i really love the music for this anime as well, particular the theme song, and motivational them they play from time to time, also a scene were ryu fights guile at a bar and the music in that particular scene is amazing.Its one of my favorite anime of all time. is nice as wellThe thing i really love the music for this anime as well, particular the theme song, and motivational them they play from time to time, also a scene were ryu fights guile at a bar and the music in that particular scene is amazing.Its one of my favorite anime of all time.', '(Note: I just copy+pasted this from my review at tv.com)(Also note that I watched the English dub)""There was a Street Fighter anime?"" I thought to myself when my sister had three Street Fighter DVDs in her hands; a Street Fighter movie and the complete first season of Street Fighter II: V. I watched the movie first; it was nothing special, and somewhat boring. A couple of weeks after that I started watching the anime. The theme song and opening was pretty lame... I would have preferred some Jpop or Jrock for the theme song over some sort of rockish song that\'s trying to be cool......and that opening sequence just went on and on... I was like, ""When does the show start?"".So the show started, and almost everyone\'s personalities were very suiting for their characters. The show had a few funny moments. There were quite a few cool fight scenes, and there was some pretty intense emotion a few times. When they introduced Vega... man, they did him perfectly. Vega and Ken\'s fight was pretty intense; the way how Vega stabbed his claws right into Ken\'s foot, and those brutal slashes he marked Ken\'s body with. I was hoping to see some of the Izuna Drops Vega does in the game, but then again the series used basically any special move as a huge deal. Who would have thought a simple Hadouken would be such an intense move? Anyhow, Vega and Ken\'s fight... That Shoryuken was beautifully executed.My main problem with the show was that they repeated scenes way too much... ESPECIALLY Ryu\'s practicing Hadou and Chun Li being hypnotised by Vega. Those things really interrupted some important parts of the show, which was very annoying. Overall a great show though, definitely worth watching. and that opening sequence just went on and on...

I also eagerly awaited certain episodes where they interacted with other Street Fighter characters in a new light (ie. Ryu being friendly with Sagat, Ken sparring with Fei Long).Unfortunately, this series ultimately failed to live up to my hopes all because of one major flaw: PAINFULLY SLOW PACING. It's almost as if after every sentence is uttered, there's a dramatic pause in between to lengthen the show. It also takes an entire episode for a hadouken that Ryu is charging to...finally fire; until then, it's just a horribly slow build up where they're staring down, and any viewers nearby have a mental monologue of what they think about the situation. That, right there, is bad editing and directing at its finest.SF2V had a lot going for it. Its premise is good, it's art style is excellent, and when some fighting scenes do happen, they're riveting.

I expected a lot more from an animated adaptation of the most popular fighting game ever made. SF: The Animated Movie, while it towers over the rest, isn\'t satisfying, and the Alpha movies are just wretched. So I thought I\'d put a retrospective on what may be the most forgettable Street Fighter rendition since the U.S. Saturday morning cartoon, Street Fighter II V, from Manga Entertainment.[STORY 5] I felt this TV series...had a lot going for it. Where the other movies failed is that we already know that Ken and Ryu are good friends, but very little is emphasized on that aspect. Audiences are kind of robbed of the bond that they share and negates character development or a reason to care. I know that sounds like asking for much, but it\'s the best thing this series had going for it. Watching a sort of backstory on the friendship of Ken and Ryu reuniting for the first time since training as little squirts and reuniting as rascal teens was incredibly refreshing and fun, like a pre-Alpha alternate universe, with a cute-as-a-button 15 year old Chun Li, and teen action star Fei Long. No other fighting game adaptation pulled it off this well in the beginning. However, midway through the series, the plot an M. Bison-esque turn for the goofy. Maybe it\'s just me, but this villian doesn\'t fit in with Street Fighter. (What\'s the connection with the martial arts buddies in karate pajamas and the Megalomanic?) Lots of things make no sense, some characters are rewritten for what feels like no good reason, and it gets fairly boring about halfway through. Ryu is just learning the power of Hado, so you\'re subjected to watch him practice this skill, which takes about as long as Goku charging up the Spirit Bomb, and it\'s the same footage looped over and over. It gets tedious, and bogs the series down considerably.[ART 7] The art is very good. I like the way some of the characters look, with the exception of Sagat and Cammy. First off, Sgat has two distinct features that signifies his appearance and he has NEITHER of them. Cammy just looks like a blonde assassin lady. I wasn\'t asking for a turtleneck thong ensemble (but I wouldn\'t be opposed), but she trots out in just boring black leather (yawn), she doesn\'t wear her hair in even remotely the same fashion, and she fights and kills with wires (remember her piano wire skill from Alpha 3? Me neither.) For a mid-to-late 90\'s anime, the action scenes are on par with Samurai Deeper Kyo or Outlaw Star in terms of animation. Lots of recycled footage gets noticable reather quickly and becomes grating. You\'ll find yourself saying, ""she just did that kick!"" a lot. Keep a close eye on Akuma cameos in the backgrounds.[SOUND 7] I\'ve only heard the Animaze dub, so I\'ll only judge the track off of that. The music is good, the voice acting is kind of cheesy, but cheesy-good. Nothing really spectacular about the score or the BGM, it gets the job done for the most part. Listening to Richard Cansino shriek as Vega was nails on a chalkboard for me.[CHARACTER 4] While the central cast of Ryu, Ken, Guile, and Chun Li are represented alright enough (except for Ken proposing to a jail bait Chun Li), most of the cast from the game just show up to less than their console counterparts. Sagat is in prison, Balrog doesn\'t fight, Zangief is...well Zangief. Dhalsim seems to be the only other character that serves a direct purpose, a mentor character, but it becomes an afterthought rather quickly. And Vega probably has the best story arc in his battle with Ken. Other names aren\'t present, E. Honda, Blanka, etc.Even without forced cameos from other members of the games, there was so much lost potential as to what to do with this cast. Guile is practically kicked out of the show until the final arc, where his beef with Bison is seemingly slapped together with the clumsy introduction to Charlie (Nash) who looks like Edward Norton crossed with James Lipton in this show. Cammy is wasted and disappears. Fei Long is useless anyways, but serves no real assistance in the fight against Shadowlaw. And M. Bison is just a pain to sit through. You\'re waiting to see this villian show up, but he really ruins everything, and has a completely classless scene with Chun Li that could\'ve ended ten minutes sooner. I can only assume the author hates women.[ENJOYMENT 4] This show starts on such a high note in the first nine episodes and then just cascades into boring really fast. Goofy subplots, cookie-cutter villians that don\'t belong in a Street Fighter storyline, underused characters, and a few throw-away episodes in the middle that could\'ve been utilized better. The first couple of episodes are incredibly fun until the heroine cartel comes in and becomes a long-winded PSA about drug use. I\'M NOT KIDDING.[OVERALL 4] Street Fighter II V feels like the longest 29 episodes I\'ve ever watched. It\'s not the worst I\'ve seen, but there\'s so much lost potential, it\'s just deflating. I\'m not sure why so many directors have failed with this sub-genre. It\'s just not satisfying, but it\'s not Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture.Pros: Good fight scenes. Good voice acting.Cons: Slow, not very interesting story. Poorly used cast. had a lot going for it.

And Vega probably has the best story arc in his battle with Ken. Other names aren\'t present, E. Honda, Blanka, etc.Even without forced cameos from other members of the games, there was so much lost potential as to what to do with this cast. Guile is practically kicked out of the show until the final arc, where his beef with Bison is seemingly slapped together with the clumsy introduction to Charlie (Nash) who looks like Edward Norton crossed with James Lipton in this show. Cammy is wasted and disappears. Fei Long is useless anyways, but serves no real assistance in the fight against Shadowlaw. And M. Bison is just a pain to sit through. You\'re waiting to see this villian show up, but he really ruins everything, and has a completely classless scene with Chun Li that could\'ve ended ten minutes sooner. I can only assume the author hates women.[ENJOYMENT 4] This show starts on such a high note in the first nine episodes and then just cascades into boring really fast. Goofy subplots, cookie-cutter villians that don\'t belong in a Street Fighter storyline, underused characters, and a few throw-away episodes in the middle that could\'ve been utilized better. The first couple of episodes are incredibly fun until the heroine cartel comes in and becomes a long-winded PSA about drug use. I\'M NOT KIDDING.[OVERALL 4] Street Fighter II V feels like the longest 29 episodes I\'ve ever watched. It\'s not the worst I\'ve seen, but there\'s so much lost potential, it\'s just deflating. I\'m not sure why so many directors have failed with this sub-genre. It\'s just not satisfying, but it\'s not Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture.Pros: Good fight scenes. Good voice acting.Cons: Slow, not very interesting story. Poorly used cast.', ""This is a show, i feel, that was made for Fans of the Street Fighter games who are already familiar with the characters and their affiliations. Though there are some interesting threads such as learning how Ryu and Ken harness their Hadou power, and learning who trained Chun-Li and Fei Long in Martial Artsfor the most part the story is quite light and flighty with very little character development or plot-twists or turns. This is where the show falls flat the most for me as i was looking forward to learning more about who trained Ryu and Ken how to fight and how they deal...with obstacles differently in their own way.I also feel that Chun-Li, who is a great fighter in her own right, never got her time to shine in the show like she did in the Street Fighter II Movie.If you are looking for a more in-depth look into the backstory or lore for Ken and Ryu id recommend the movie, Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist instead.That being said this show is a good time if you are looking to see more of the brotherly interactions between Ken and Ryu as they travel the world seeking new opponents and challenges. The action is entertaining for the most part (as well as surprisingly bloody) and the art and music ranges from ok to really well done. I think the highlight of the show by far is it's portrayal of the famous Hadou-Ken and Shoryu-ken and the sheer power both these moves possess, as well as how these moves feel for Ryu and Ken respectively when they learn to harness them.Personally i feel the show is a bit long winded, instead of 29 episodes i would have preferred around 24 but i didnt mind too much since i was having a good time. If you are looking for a similar experience i would recommend the alternate iteration of the show which is Street Fighter II: The Animated movie, which is a lot shorter but just as enjoyable as the show.Overall I would recommend the show to fans of the games or fans of 90's anime, i think there is enough here to keep both of those audiences entertained for the most part. If you are not a fan of the games though i do not think this show will get you more invested in the games or the characters. with obstacles differently in their own way.I also feel that Chun-Li, who is a great fighter in her own right, never got her time to shine in the show like she did in the Street Fighter II Movie.If you are looking for a more in-depth look into the backstory or lore for Ken and Ryu id recommend the movie, Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist instead.That being said this show is a good time if you are looking to see more of the brotherly interactions between Ken and Ryu as they travel the world seeking new opponents and challenges.

I didn't...like the voice actors though...go figure.Character- All your favorites from street fighter are here so yes enjoy.Enjoyment- I love martial arts and I love street fighter so I enjoyed this anime a lot.Overall- It's good I mean it's not liquid gold and it most certainly will not be enjoyed by most people who are not a fan of street fighter but for those of us who are we will find gratification in watching it. like the voice actors though...go figure.Character- All your favorites from street fighter are here so yes enjoy.Enjoyment- I love martial arts and I love street fighter so I enjoyed this anime a lot.Overall- It's good I mean it's not liquid gold and it most certainly will not be enjoyed by most people who are not a fan of street fighter but for those of us who are we will find gratification in watching it."", 'I finally decided to see this anime after trying firsthand and finishing Street Fighter II on my Switch for the first time (a unique emotion).I would say it helps a lot to understand the story behind the game and the reasons that push these ""street fighters"" to face each other.I state that I watched it dubbed in my language, but I was still positively surprised to hear the correct names of the moves and their reproduction. I\'m just sorry that the designs of some fighters are not very faithful to those of the original work, but I was very amused by the way they make...Akuma appear in different scenes, in a totally random way, and I would really like to know why (not is present in the game).Byson\'s style drives me crazy and scary at the same time: he has a superhuman build and even those vampire fangs don\'t help. 😆I\'m looking forward to see the movies too.

Super Lovers 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33417/Super_Lovers_2,"['This review is long overdue. I had wrote one earlier but it got deleted so that\'s a shame. Anyhow, Super Lovers 2 takes off right after the completion of the first season. Those who have completed the first season should know by now that this relationship is between an adult and a minor. Who are step brothers by registry. So if you know that\'s not your cup of tea, don\'t give Super Lovers 2 the time of day. You\'ll only come to dislike it more because of the couple\'s new problems that arise in this season. Most of which yes, involve the age gap and...the fact that Ren is still young when compared with Haru. Now if you\'re a fan, well that\'s great! You\'ll love how steamy it becomes between Haru and Ren. The second season covers the Natsuo arc almost flawlessly so his character is fleshed out and understandable.I am writing this review as a gay individual so I don\'t want people to pull the “only gross straight females will enjoy this anime” because that is not the case. I don\'t go digging for “LGBT rep” in anime or manga and I especially don\'t look for any in BL or Yuri. I enjoy works that have good stories to tell and I don\'t base my likeability of the series on if the story has a canon gay couple or anything. If we\'re being honest, this is the only BL I\'ve ever enjoyed. I\'ve tried a few ever since I was younger but none appealed to me. Anyway, I want to make clear before I start this review that people can enjoy any piece of work they want no matter their sexuality or age. We shouldn\'t generalize people and I know it does happen but I\'ve seen it happen more often than naught with BL works but that\'s the way the cookie crumbles. I know I\'m preaching to the wind here but my thoughts  and reviews are always full of heart. Enjoy!The soundtrack was memorable for me! It had a nice country and slice of life feel to it. There were moments where if the scene was funny, a nice melody would play while if the scene was serious, an ominous track would play. I really love the music that was composed for Super Lovers. This season definitely made good use of all the melodies. There was never a moment where music wasn\'t playing which I am grateful for. Sometimes in a series, if something serious were to happen, no music would play and personally, I think adding music adds a layer of suspense to a scene. The soundtrack isn\'t elegant nor is it ""one of its kind"" but it definitely is unique. We rarely get such soft music in anime since it\'s frequently elegant strings or upbeat tones. I have no problem with either but this anime\'s soundtrack is immensely refreshing. Another thing I love about the music is how the actors sing the ending song and they take turns! I know it\'s a lot of work for some series to do this so just the fact that the director thought it would be a wonderful thing to do, which it was, isthe best! The ending song and opening song always left you feeling refreshed and in a cheery mood. At least for me. There are definitely some tracks I\'m more of a fan of than others. I\'m sure if you listen to the music while watching this anime, you\'ll find just what I\'m talking about when I say a scene feels even better.I\'ve been watching anime since I was a baby so animation isn\'t a big deal to me. Though I have to admit, there were some sloppy parts but BL series never seem to get beautiful adaptations with the exceptions of the series being short. Thankfully, Super Lovers had cute end cards and illustrations to make up for such moments. Ahh, they\'re so pretty. I loved the ones from the first season so the fact that they did it with season 2 is even better. I believe my favorite animation slip-up is with Natsuo\'s mouth in episode 8. Though not too noticeable, it\'s there for like half a second. However, I gave it an 8 since the stupid animations got to me and I thought they were unique and laughable. To be honest, the animation could have been far worse. I\'m sure we\'re all familiar with ""yaoi"" anatomy. So really, I\'m just happy the anatomy was on point! Even in the manga, Abe\'s art is simply flawless and beautiful. One of my favorite manga artists really. I\'m happy to that see the anime managed to make some moments beautiful. I especially love the shadow on Ren\'s nose, it\'s a very unique shading style. Tanuki had the best animation. All the budget went to the dog and I\'m not even upset. A cute dog deserve grand animation. People that are saying it was horrendous and unwatchable are exaggerating. While the frames were anything but beautiful, it\'s not as if we had sliding characters or choppy animation. My only problems lies with the designs for some still frames but other than that, it was watchable and I didn\'t mind it at all!The characters are memorable! I have so much to say about the relationship between Haru and Ren. We get to learn more about Haru’s past and his personality so that\'s definitely a ton of points from me. People complain about Haru going back and forth between viewing Ren as a brother or love interest but the real issue is hardly black or white. It lies within his mental state that even he can\'t crack. I don\'t blame Haru for not seeing Ren only as a love interest but I do agree that sometimes he can be rough. However, Ren is dense when it comes to other’s influences and the outside world. The Natsuo arc is especially full of this. Ren and Haru both make stupid decisions but I can without a doubt say that I\'ve done just as much or even worse than what Ren has done. This season especially digs into Ren’s insecurities and doubtful attitude towards Haru. Ren really loves Haru and Haru really loves Ren but they both have such overwhelming emotions that, speaking from experience, can truly be difficult to convey to a loved one. It\'s not Haru’s fault for bouncing between the two feelings he has towards Ren because Haru has attachment issues while Ren knows he unfortunately can\'t fill the void in Haru’s heart of having a little brother and someone to take care of. Ren loves him and he just doesn\'t want to harm Haru emotionally because of Ren’s own feelings. I can say so much about Haru and Ren and why this season really digs deeper into their personalities and all the insecurities that surround them both as a couple and as brothers.The twins are important. Just as the first season, they\'re both Haru and Ren’s pillars of support. They make sure Haru doesn\'t cross over the line too far while also keeping Ren steady emotionally. They\'re like real brothers to Ren and Ren finds a deal of great comfort and reliance on them. Haru on the other hand will try his best as he takes the harsh but truthful words from his brothers. Aki and Shima don\'t beat around the bush and are there to support the couple in whatever way possible. The characters are hardly bland and nor is there “no development” because in season one, Aki was more possessive of Haru and seemed to not care one ounce for Ren but this season, he connects with Ren and even provides support for him while agreeing that this time, Haru is the one at fault. Natsuo plays a major role since he pretty much tests Ren’s feelings towards Haru and isn\'t afraid to cause an uproar. Compared to the first season which only consisted of minor arguments between Haru and Ren, the second season involves everyone around them. It\'s not just their own little world anymore. Natsuo is there to poke at it and challenge them in as many ways as possible. However, Natsuo is hardly just a “fanservice” character. His past is important in providing sufficient evidence for why Haru acts the way he does.All in all, don\'t overlook the side characters and don\'t think the creator doesn\'t know what she\'s doing. If you just take the time to understand Haru and Ren\'s feelings and even listen to what the therapist has to say about them, you\'ll see why they\'re simply perfect for each other no matter the challenges they come to face. Haru isn\'t manipulative and this season further amplifies just how far Ren is willing to go in order to “possess” Haru. He wants this man no matter the cost and will try everything in his power in order to make it happen. Ren is one intelligent individual who knows how to get Haru riled up but some people seem to overlook just how much Ren seems to control what happens behind the scenes. If it wasn\'t for Ren and Haru’s insecurities and back and forward personalities than Super Lovers would truly be a bland and generic BL series. Abe makes sure to keep attitudes and reactions realistic to some degree. You have Kiyoka and Juuzen’s initial reactions to Haru and Ren’s relationship and then you have Aki and Shima who eventually accepted the feelings between the two. There are many others but these are a few, minus manga only characters, that immediately come to mind.Overall, I really enjoyed this season because all of Ren and Haru’s fights felt so realistic in a sense. Relationships aren\'t all candies and rainbows nor are conflicts resolved so easily. I see people getting angry at the fact that conflicts remained unresolved but I\'m just confused as to what isn\'t resolved? Without spoiling, I can say that no conflict is annoying or childish or overused. The problems that arise really interest me because of how fitting they are with the characters. Ren reacts to a conflict in his own way while Haru tries to understand why Ren did this or that. What I really love is when they both apologize or one apologizes first and that\'s hardly anything you see in series. Not just anime or manga but it really reminds of the laughable trope that you can silence your partner if they\'re angry just by kissing them. I was never a fan of that because the conflicts were never resolved and it felt like the feelings beforehand were never carried over to their partner. That really isn\'t the case for Super Lovers. Haru and Ren care for each other, they value each other’s feelings, they want to support one another in anyway possible and they are both willing to take the blame for anything that goes wrong even if it\'s not their fault. That\'s a difficult thing to do considering pride exists but both do not care if it means the other will be fine and comfortable again.This is my review of season 2! I may add on when I feel like it but I thank anyone so much for reading this far. I say give this season a shot if you liked season one because this one is just a wild ride in general!! Many characters, development and situations that will indeed leave you fulfilled! the fact that Ren is still young when compared with Haru. Now if you\'re a fan, well that\'s great!

I may add on when I feel like it but I thank anyone so much for reading this far. I say give this season a shot if you liked season one because this one is just a wild ride in general!! Many characters, development and situations that will indeed leave you fulfilled!', '(SPOILERS)Okay, I just finished the last episode today, and all I can say is that I was incredibly disappointed. When I watched the first season of Super Lovers, I can definitely say that I was intrigued. The plot was somewhat interesting and it was a yaoi (i tend to have a huge interest and liking in this genre). But boy oh boy, this season was complete.... trash. I am so disappointed to say that, but I can\'t lie to myself and say that I enjoyed it, because I really really wanted to. I had to give such low scores because honestly, that is exactly what...I felt. As I watched each episode as they came out week by week, I would try to hard to hold back my cringes and push them to the side, but now I am just coming out and confronting them.First things first, let\'s begin with the story. Okay, so if I\'m wrong, the main focus is centered around Haru and Ren\'s relationship as a... couple? Brotherly love? Honestly, I don\'t even know. I continued to stay confused throughout the entire season because it would go back and fourth between each ""conflict"". One time, Haru would be talking about how Ren is his brother, and then the next time he would be kissing him and talking about something that doesn\'t even really correlate to the story? Oh, and speaking of Haru, things got somewhat interesting as the conflict with his parents came up. He had to go see a psychologist and he was faced with a REAL problem. But... they never really touched on it after that? I mean, it was brought up and he was being asked to go back, but after that, there was really no more insight. And when episode 10 finished up, the final shot came up on the screen that read ""Thank you for watching Super Lovers"", and I was soooo confused. It was over? Already? I felt so incomplete and just... incredibly disappointed. I literally had to search up if it really ended there, and when I found out it did, I instantly deflated. What about Natsu? What about Haru and Ren\'s relationship? What about Ren in general? I was left completely empty. There were so many plot holes in this series, it is almost impossible to count. I gave the story a rating of 3, and that\'s just being considerate to all of the things that aren\'t included in everything that was WRONG with the story.Okay, moving onto art. I gave this a rating of 2 because JESUS... It is so... dreadful. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks this.. I wish I could insert pictures of screenshots of all the scenes that I cringed at. The art was so bad that I was legitimately wondering if it had been messily sketched and colored the night before by someone who was running off of 5 cups of coffee and energy drinks. Jesus, in most of the scenes, Haru\'s nose was completely MISSING and everyone\'s eyes were a solid block of color. The only decent art was in the opening and closings, SOME close-ups, and scenes where Haru and Ren were being ""intimate"". I really don\'t have much to say further than just WOW.I\'m skipping sound because.. Idk what I can say about that?Character, I gave a 4. I wasn\'t too sure how to rate this because I wasn\'t sure if my judgement is worthy of any score lower. This was probably the most confusing rating I can give because of all of the plot holes and missing information I don\'t have. Throughout the series, Haru acted like a piece of trash that treated Ren like he was his lost puppy. The whole ""clueless overprotective dad"" scheme he put on throughout the episodes made me want to jump off of my house, and the way Ren really NEVER stood up for himself made it even worse. Haru has a really trash-like personality and the way that it was never resolved bugs the hell out of me! When the series ended, I kind of laughed because there was absolutely ZERO character development. I guess that just means that Haru really is just a stingy clueless man. Ren is a smart boy, but sometimes the things he did made me stuff a pillow in my face and question why the universe had made me this way. Like, why couldn\'t I just be as dumb as him and think ""yeah, this is a good idea!"" specifically, I\'m talking about the whole ""sex with natsu because haru wont have sex with me"" ordeal. Instant facepalm. And this is a little off-topic, but Haru\'s constant whining about Ren not sleeping with him would always annoy the hell out of me.ANYWAYS, this anime gave me a really sad and empty feeling. You know when you haven\'t eaten in a couple hours and there\'s no food around so you kind of have to just sulk and deal with it? Yeah, that\'s how it made me feel. I can\'t really do anything about how I am feeling because there\'s nothing to fill that empty hole with.I can compare this to an anime like Say I Love You or Orange. They are both romance animes with conflict (like Super Lovers). The only difference with those animes and this one is that yes, they had conflict, but they were RESOLVED and actually made sense without leaving me a confused mess. When it comes to Super Lovers, I have no idea if their conflict was resolved or not... In episode ten, was Natsu kissing Haru and Ren getting upset and yelling ""This is mine!!!"" the resolution? It\'s the only conclusion I can come up with.I am so sad that it had to be this way, because I genuinely wanted to like this anime..  I think the main issue here was that there was only 10 episodes in this season. There could\'ve been so much more growth and development with the characters and story line if it had the regular 25 episodes like most animes, but I understand if it was money issues or something related that hindered that from being able to happen.. I don\'t really have anything else to say except that I am really sad that I didn\'t get to grow attached to this anime. The direction and overall theme or whatever that the anime is mainly \'about\' goes right up my alley! If only it was better and more carefully written, I really could see the potential and success it could\'ve had. I felt. As I watched each episode as they came out week by week, I would try to hard to hold back my cringes and push them to the side, but now I am just coming out and confronting them.First things first, let\'s begin with the story. Okay, so if I\'m wrong, the main focus is centered around Haru and Ren\'s relationship as a... couple? Brotherly love? Honestly, I don\'t even know. I continued to stay confused throughout the entire season because it would go back and fourth between each ""conflict"". One time, Haru would be talking about how Ren is his brother, and then the next time he would be kissing him and talking about something that doesn\'t even really correlate to the story? Oh, and speaking of Haru, things got somewhat interesting as the conflict with his parents came up. He had to go see a psychologist and he was faced with a REAL problem. But... they never really touched on it after that? I mean, it was brought up and he was being asked to go back, but after that, there was really no more insight. And when episode 10 finished up, the final shot came up on the screen that read ""Thank you for watching Super Lovers"", and I was soooo confused. It was over? Already? I felt so incomplete and just... incredibly disappointed. I literally had to search up if it really ended there, and when I found out it did, I instantly deflated. What about Natsu? What about Haru and Ren\'s relationship? What about Ren in general? I was left completely empty. There were so many plot holes in this series, it is almost impossible to count. I gave the story a rating of 3, and that\'s just being considerate to all of the things that aren\'t included in everything that was WRONG with the story.Okay, moving onto art. I gave this a rating of 2 because JESUS... It is so... dreadful. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks this.. I wish I could insert pictures of screenshots of all the scenes that I cringed at. The art was so bad that I was legitimately wondering if it had been messily sketched and colored the night before by someone who was running off of 5 cups of coffee and energy drinks. Jesus, in most of the scenes, Haru\'s nose was completely MISSING and everyone\'s eyes were a solid block of color. The only decent art was in the opening and closings, SOME close-ups, and scenes where Haru and Ren were being ""intimate"". I really don\'t have much to say further than just WOW.I\'m skipping sound because.. Idk what I can say about that?Character, I gave a 4. I wasn\'t too sure how to rate this because I wasn\'t sure if my judgement is worthy of any score lower. This was probably the most confusing rating I can give because of all of the plot holes and missing information I don\'t have. Throughout the series, Haru acted like a piece of trash that treated Ren like he was his lost puppy. The whole ""clueless overprotective dad"" scheme he put on throughout the episodes made me want to jump off of my house, and the way Ren really NEVER stood up for himself made it even worse. Haru has a really trash-like personality and the way that it was never resolved bugs the hell out of me! When the series ended, I kind of laughed because there was absolutely ZERO character development. I guess that just means that Haru really is just a stingy clueless man. Ren is a smart boy, but sometimes the things he did made me stuff a pillow in my face and question why the universe had made me this way. Like, why couldn\'t I just be as dumb as him and think ""yeah, this is a good idea!"" specifically, I\'m talking about the whole ""sex with natsu because haru wont have sex with me"" ordeal. Instant facepalm. And this is a little off-topic, but Haru\'s constant whining about Ren not sleeping with him would always annoy the hell out of me.ANYWAYS, this anime gave me a really sad and empty feeling. You know when you haven\'t eaten in a couple hours and there\'s no food around so you kind of have to just sulk and deal with it? Yeah, that\'s how it made me feel. I can\'t really do anything about how I am feeling because there\'s nothing to fill that empty hole with.I can compare this to an anime like Say I Love You or Orange. They are both romance animes with conflict (like Super Lovers). The only difference with those animes and this one is that yes, they had conflict, but they were RESOLVED and actually made sense without leaving me a confused mess. When it comes to Super Lovers, I have no idea if their conflict was resolved or not... In episode ten, was Natsu kissing Haru and Ren getting upset and yelling ""This is mine!!!"" the resolution? It\'s the only conclusion I can come up with.I am so sad that it had to be this way, because I genuinely wanted to like this anime..  I think the main issue here was that there was only 10 episodes in this season. There could\'ve been so much more growth and development with the characters and story line if it had the regular 25 episodes like most animes, but I understand if it was money issues or something related that hindered that from being able to happen.. I don\'t really have anything else to say except that I am really sad that I didn\'t get to grow attached to this anime. The direction and overall theme or whatever that the anime is mainly \'about\' goes right up my alley! If only it was better and more carefully written, I really could see the potential and success it could\'ve had.', '[SPOILERS - sorry]I didn\'t write a review of the first season, because that was fairly fine. I had my problems with it (every cringe worthy moment with child Ren geez), but it didn\'t go deep enough into the story to actually get mad over it. Well, that changed with this season.The story tries to concentrate on the problem between Haru and Ren, why they aren\'t going forward even though living together, mostly sleeping in the same bed, etc. And with that, the poor writing just comes to the surface, because the storyteller obviously has no idea what is the problem, so they are just hitting...around the bush over and over again.When the problem is so CLEAR. It is Haru. This fucked up, dumb, self centered douchebag. You can argue with me, that his trauma made him this way, but I do not care. Nobody is making him realize that he is acting out, nobody is stopping him from lashing out on Ren. And with the 8th ep, fucking Aki even told Ren that go easy on him, because it\'s a hard time for him. FUCK THAT. I live for every moment when Ren tries to call Haru out on his bullshit, but the writers are so bad at what they are doing that it just gets pushed back to the corner everytime and never really discussed.What Haru is doing is disgusting. I am not okay with the idea that a 24yo going at it with a minor, but well, that could be handled well. It is not in this story. Haru keeps bouncing between looking at Haru as his baby brother, and a potential body that he can use for sexual attempts whenever he feels like it. And that is one of the key points with him, only when HE feels like it. He keeps pushing Ren to the limit, the poor kid wants him so bad, but Haru just backtracks everytime. And then calls Ren practically a slut when he goes and tries to get experience elsewhere, because he heard 100times that he is an inexperienced baby. Haru is an utterly self centered man, who can\'t be considerate while pretends that he cares for everybody. And yet, the story favors him over Ren who is actually doing his freaking best here.I always thought that in yaoi the uke is the absolutely annoying one, but this story proved me wrong, there is nothing worse than a seme who can\'t make up his fucking mind. And you know, after all this - especially the 8th ep because he even went as far as telling Ren, a kid who was abandoned, that he doesn\'t need to come home if he sleeps with Natsuo, that\'s just so low that I needed to wait two days to go back and continue the ep - he doesn\'t deserve Ren. This story should end up with Ren walking away. And it won\'t, and that makes it horrendous.And I don\'t know, I might want too much from anime, but if you make stories about two men in love, can\'t you just avoid shit like shaming trans people? I know that it\'s normal in Japan, I watch enough tv shows to see how they treat real life trans women, but I hate that even stories like this just use them as a joke. Even though one of them is a really important character in Haru\'s life.So there are many parts in this story that just makes you cringe if you aren\'t used to yaoi, or just you know, actually have some respect for the LGBT community. Yes, I know, I shouldn\'t watch shit like this if I want that... but come at me with something else that has representation? I\'m gonna sprint to watch it...To mention some positive things about the characters... I really like Aki and Shima, and the school nurse guy is funny. Story-wise they are doing a pretty poor job, though. Nobody is telling shit to Haru, and the nurse just avoids helping Ren with his sexual questions, which is a pretty shitty thing to do when you are supposed to be an aid for kids. But they are the good kind of comical relief, so I like their comments. Especially the twins tsukkomi moments at their stupid brother. I just really wish they actually had a part in the story.The art is nice, the sound- well, I have no idea, so it can\'t be too good, I don\'t remember any bgm.I\'ll wait for the end of the season to actually give it a rate, but it won\'t be better than 5. This is not how you should picture gay people. Or I don\'t know, is Ren demisexual??? Is Haru bisexual? Ah, I really wan\'t too much from anime x""DDSo that\'s that. It does not deserve the almost 8 points. Only watch this if you are a hardcore fan of yaoi, otherwise gonna get mad A LOT.(istg I\'m not watching yaoi anymore.) around the bush over and over again.When the problem is so CLEAR. It is Haru.

I think, it had more character development than the first season of Super Lovers, this also may be because of Ren, both is possible.As for the story line, it kind of repeats the events of the first season, the insecurities Ren had, were really repetitive. which honestly was kind of tiring.Things though take a nice twist in few of the last episodes of the season. It really shows the bond between Haru and Ren, I actually think it's the first time, we see the development in Ren's character which wasn't clear in...the other episodes.Overall, I gave this anime an eight because it was both nice and annoying. I can't say I didn't enjoy it cause I would be lying. It's a relaxing anime to watch, which includes a nice and cute love story! the other episodes.Overall, I gave this anime an eight because it was both nice and annoying.

But here we are, again, after my first review, my thoughts haven't really changed so drastically. I still think the show suffers with the weird, creepy and strangely unsettling atmosphere i get from watching it. So, here are my thoughts.I need to acknowledge this, but i know i am not the target audience. Tho, i am a sucker for cheesy romance animes, this is not one i would recommend to anyone anytime soon, and anytime ever.Story- Not much different than most other comedy-love romance shit. I don't like age difference...still, even though they have aged a bit. To think the brother was still attracted to a child, even though he has now grown up, is unsettling to me, including the fact that he has sex on his mind. Again, there is some strange attempts at dramatic moments that don't hit well, and aren't executed very....goodly?characters- There was SOME Development, not much to be acknowledged as a drastic change but there was still some advances in their characters.Art- An improvement from the last season, but still on the average side of things, with stiff movements, classic haha anime funny artstyle change whenever something even semi funny happens (i hate that trope) The lighting in some scenes were good though, so thats a plus.Enjoyment- I did not enjoy it. Shocking right.Overall i hated it. Yeah. Very creepy.goodbye! still, even though they have aged a bit.

Shocking right.Overall i hated it. Yeah. Very creepy.goodbye!"", 'Right after I watched the first episode of this anime, I already had a feeling that I am going to love this series. And man! I was right. This show was really so good I’ve given it’s first season a 9 out of 10 stars rating, *wink. Super Lovers have a total of 2 seasons, both with 10 episodes each and an OVA with 2 episodes.After the first yaoi that I have watched, I realized that I prefer 1 couple per show, and man! I can’t be happy enough that I am having that in this anime. Super Lovers gives us a very sweet (and...sometimes funny) narration on Haru and Ren’s romantic relationship.When I started this series, I was actually kind of confused with Haru and Ren’s relationship. It was really unusual and kind of nauseating (?) when you really think hard about the technicalities but with those wonderful graphics and the couple’s chemistry, it’s hard to dwell on that thought for long. So yep, as early as the first episode, I already accepted the fact that Haru and Ren belong to each other. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I am not going to explain more about that, instead, I’ll tell you that the age gap is really big. But that’s normal in yaoi anyway so I guess it’s fine.I don’t like stories with amnesia in it so I guess that’s the only thing I hated on the first season of this anime. The scenes we’re nicely done and I love how Haru and Ren’s relationship were progressing. And yes, you can definitely expect massive number of funny scenes in this anime in both seasons 1 and 2 as well as on its OVAS. As for the season 2, I actually don’t love it as much I love season 1, but I still ended up giving it an 8 out of 10 stars rating because in that season, it really focused on their relationship (a boy to boy relationship). And yes, there’s definitely a lot of times the S thing was mentioned which eventually became an issue to both the main characters. In relation to that, I really feel sorry (while laughing my heart out, haha) to a certain school nurse who’s always subjected to Ren’s question about a certain topic (it starts with S, haha) that is so awkward for a guy to answer, haha.Thinking back, I think it was a pretty good angle for season 2 because Haru and Ren’s relationship were really progressing. There were also some references to things couples do (if you get what I mean? haha) but it was usually done in a funny way so you won’t definitely feel uncomfortable. And nope, there’s definitely no explicit scenes here (but I think almost?, haha), but I’m still issuing you a warning though, because some kissing scenes we’re HOT AF! (Awww! haha)I love the graphics of this anime. Of all the yaoi (and possibly all the anime) I have watched, Super Lovers done it so perfectly. I’m a very visual person so imagine how my eyes turned into heart shapes every time I watch this anime. I just love everything – the character design (Haru’s definitely looks like Adonis and Ren is so cute I want to get him out of the screen and hug him), the animation, everything! And the music isn’t that bad either, *wink. Most yaoi anime features animals in them, and for this anime, it’s a dog!I don’t have any complaints about the characters either because my eyes were feasting on their good looks its hard to get mad at them, haha. But seriously, I don’t have any characters that I hated so much I want to kill them. Ofcourse there we’re some characters that was kind of against Haru and Ren’s complicated relationship but that’s normal, atleast in the end they we’re able to understand and eventually accept it.Super Lovers is definitely one of my top yaoi anime recommendations, curious?

I absolutely loved Season 1 so I had high expectations for this one.I ended up being disappointed.It went quite downhill from the first season. Character development is non-existent and it's just the same events recurring in different scenarios. While I do understand that the anime is revolved around Haru, being the eldest brother, and Ren, being the youngest brother, having some sort of relationship between them, it was still very confusing. I couldn't tell throughout the whole anime if they're in a relationship, brotherly love or just desperate for lust. I'm going with the third...one though.Every time there's sexual tension between Haru and Ren, something interrupts them and it was getting quite boring. I get it, it's Shounen Ai not Yaoi but the scenes were quite silly.They were traits of manipulation coming from Haru and while Ren was trying to be rebellious, he still fell for Haru. This is what I meant when I said character development is non-existent and the same events. It's just; Ren wants to do it with Haru, Haru doesn't YET he leads him on, Ren rebels, Haru punishes and the cycle repeats itself.I hope they will work more on Season 3 [if there will be one]. I'm not giving up on his anime. one though.Every time there's sexual tension between Haru and Ren, something interrupts them and it was getting quite boring.

The boy had been abandoned, mistreated and deeply traumatized as young child before he came into the care of a Canadian female scientist living in the woods. For reasons that escape me, this child does not get counseling or professional psychological help learning to deal with this early trauma, but what do I know? Through circumstance,...Ren is later adopted into a Japanese family consisting of Haru - the oldest brother, a 24-year-old man and the son of the Canadian scientist - and his male twin half-brothers in their late teens/ later early twenties.What I think they were trying to depict is that in a relationship the older is not necessarily the more mature; and that a teenager can be firm in his desires and sexual orientation. That would have been ok. But.Despite the pretty visuals, good music, and good dubbing, what we then see is how the adult man, the person expected to protect his younger siblings and ward, is a pedophile. Ren imprinted on Haru as 8-year-old since Haru was the first male to treat him kindly and with affection when he visited Canada. His feelings last into teenage years; he is in love with Haru and asks for a sexual relation. We then follow how Ren and Haru share a bedroom and the same bed daily. Haru initiates kisses on the mouth in private and in public and is otherwise overstepping the boundaries between caring, comforting and sexual intimacy. The twins and other side characters are entirely ok with this behavior; they laugh at their older sibling and excuse his naivete.How is this story ok?Why should we accept that the boy – this underage child - is being preyed upon and that his isolated upbringing following the childhood trauma gives him little protection from the advances of a man that he trusts and who is legally responsible for him? In a very cute way, this anime promotes pedophilia and makes it seem ok that an adult shares intimacy with a child; It does not help that Ren although about 15/16 is stunted and looks like an 11-year old. There would be an uproar if we would see a teenage girl looking 11 sleep next to her male guardian in the same bed and see how he takes intimate liberties. Many people would realize that that storyline is unacceptable yet just because Ren is a boy, we should think it cute or right or acceptable when an adult is out of bounds.The whole time I have been waiting for someone from the sidelines to step in and stop this atrocity instead of seeing the other characters smile, support this behavior and go along with it. When there was the opportunity, I chanted in my head: ""Go to Switzerland! Go to Switzerland!"".I wish that Ren had left Japan at that opportunity, be educated in Switzerland and work with the researchers at CERN, get distance and more life experience, explore his sexuality with peers, grow a head taller than Haru, bulk up, then return at 18 and see how things played out. That would have been healthy(er) – and maybe even a good story.I wish more viewers would protest and speak up to protect boys from abuse as much as girls.

It takes all of the problems from season 1,  no plot, lack of development of main characters, and overall creep factor and multiplies it by 10. Ren is becoming a young adult and he wants to start pulling his own weight, but everytime he tries to take a step forward there's something (someone) holding him  back. That someone is Haru, and like others have said he's a big problem  in this series in season 1, but this again is amplified in season 2.I...guess the problem for me is Haru's characterization, again he doesn't really change much in this season, there not really any satisfying explanation as to why he is the way he is other than quick snippets of what happened to his mom and stepdad, his own trauma never was expanded upon and in some ways it seems obvious that his trauma was never dealt with healthily but we aren't shown to how it affects him now other than a vague health problem that is never mentioned after said episode even after we are told he's completely healthy. Strangely enough for  a flat protagonist, his moods change in an instant almost like Jekyll and Hyde, in one moment he acts like a caring and concerning person who'd do everything for his brothers and in the next moment when nobody is watching he turns into a self serving jerk who only seems to care about satisfying himself and not about how his actions and words can affect Ren(an abused minor nonetheless), someone he claims to care about.Here we're introduced to a *rival* Natsuo, but like the other characters in the story except for maybe Ren, he doesn't have a lot of development. He plays second fiddle to Haru, and we learn nothing about him until the last episode. Just as soon as he's introduced in the story, he kinda fades to back ground when he's served his role as rival.Natsuo probably does better to do his own thing than be jealous, at least he seems more self aware than some people.The major disappointment of the season was seeing how Ren, was essentially blocked at every opportunity to improve his life and perhaps deal with his own trauma and insecurities just because Haru was being selfish and petty. Haru gets mad at Ren's recklessness but takes no responsibility in allowing the situation to happen, it's no secret that teens who aren't properly taught about sex ed, tend to make mistakes, had Haru been honest I doubt it would have played out like it did. Course if Ren was taught proper sex education, then he'd know about consent, which is likely why Ren isn't allowed to learn said subject cause it's not in Haru's agenda to ever be held accountable for his actions cause he's perfect and pretty and never does anything wrong.I like characters like Ren, and if he were in another genre, his story would likely be a lot different. But because this a romance show and characters can't live without each other without dieing,(actual quote). I'll feel like he'll never get the ending he deserves, because let's face it Haru is an abuser and he doesn't seem to feel much remorse because he does the same thing over and over again. Doesn't matter if Ren is 15 or 150, what Haru's doing is wrong and sets a tone for how unhealthy relationships start, especially in the LGBT community with the stereotypes of bisexual people being inherently promiscuous or that gay men are predators. guess the problem for me is Haru's characterization, again he doesn't really change much in this season, there not really any satisfying explanation as to why he is the way he is other than quick snippets of what happened to his mom and stepdad, his own trauma never was expanded upon and in some ways it seems obvious that his trauma was never dealt with healthily but we aren't shown to how it affects him now other than a vague health problem that is never mentioned after said episode even after we are told he's completely healthy.

Still, I don't recommend you if you're still under 18 but I believe people who come to see Super Lovers 2 must have watched the first season and wanted to see more Haru and Ren.Just like S1, the story still revolves around Kaidou brothers, focusing more on Haru and Ren but now, Aki and Shima got their spotlights with a few dramas. What I like the most is that this second season doesn't lose its sense of humor.There's a new important character which will come in between Haru and Ren that I...expected some sort of a love triangle drama.The art is just getting better with more character development.

This season, was basically centered around Ren and Haru's relationship (which I have a lot to say about that later on), but nothing made sense to me. The story was pretty much all over the place, there's too many plot holes and barely to no resolutions to anything that is told. Just poor writing overall. There's more I can say...about the story but this would be an essay! This gets a 3 from me.Art (7/10):The art is probaly the only positive thing i'm gonna say about this anime. I did like it and the colour scheme is nice. Animaton had good and bad days. That's all really.SOUND (6/10):Sound is okay... I guess lmao.CHARACTER (3/10):Girl...I have a lot to say on this section; especially on Haru and Ren, and their relationship.I know some may feel a type of way for me saying this but I'm just gonna say it...Ren and Haru's relationship is WRONG. I'm sorry. Haru is such an unlikable character, why is he pursuing a relationship with Ren who is underage and he's an adult? I just don't know how people are cool with that? I get that age of consent is different in Japan, but it doesn't make it morally right, you know? Throughout the show, Haru came off as a weirdo, very manipulative and forceful, at times having a go or being mean to Ren for no reason and pushing himself on him. There were definitely times where I just wanted my punch him through my computer screen, if only it were possible. He's just a terrible person. As for Ren, I feel bad for him because he's doing his best to keep Haru pleased and stuff, but he's really not doing anything wrong and I kinda wish he saw that, even though sometimes he would put Haru in his place, but still. I was kinda hoping he would've saw how much of a trashbag Haru was. I also hate the fact that the writiers were pushing this 'brother love' concept on Haru and Ren as they're step brothers, but they're in a relationship?... Make it make sense please. Even though they're not blood related, they're still family...its just didn't and still doesn't sit well with my spirit. I wish they didn't mix those two concepts together because they don't flow, like pick a struggle. I really hate this relationship.As for the other characters, they were either there for the sake of plot, or pretty forgettable. Some funny moments with them, but really had nothing to do with the whole story. Overall, the characters were either pretty weak or bs.ENJOYMENT (3/10):There wasn't a lot to enjoy about this, there's a lot more negatives than positives, how I watched 7/10 epsiodes, heck, even the first season is beyond me. *Sighs*OVERALL (3/10):To conclude, I didn't like this season at all. Even though season one is no better, it was slightly more bearable to watch. I don't know what more I can say about this other than the writers need to do better, MUCH better. Better characters, espiecially with a better and APPROPRIATE love story, and better story telling. If you're a hardcore Fujoishi or yaoi lover, you may be able to bare with this, I guess.

It might be a little different than what I usually do because it's the 1st time I'm reviewing an anime 2nd season so in terms of art and sound they might be very short cause not much changed in regards to those but it will be in the same format as the rest of my reviews and to be honest a lot of the reviews I see are done in this format.Story: I really enjoyed the 2nd season of this anime, like I said...in my season 1 review I know not a lot of people are gunna enjoy this type of anime with the subject matter it has. But it's an anime, not real life. The story introduced a new member of the Kaido family, a cousin that looked a lot like the MC Haru and he causes a little bit of trouble but nothing too serious. If you watched the 1st season you know Haru was in a car accident when he returned from Canada that also killed his father and step mother and Haru also lost his memory of his entire time in Canada with Ren until he watches a DVD of his time in Canada. This season he still blames himself for the accident and during the season is the 7th anniversary of their parents passing, it was one of the more emotional parts of the series but it was done well. Also pretty much a debate about when is the right time for Haru and Ren to move their relationship to the next level, basically Ren is tired of being treated like a child even tho he really is one. In my opinion everyone is different and just because one person is more mature mentally and may be ready for that next step doesn't mean the other participant feels the same way, the debate is should it be moved to the next stage and the new character Natsuo plays a big part at this part of the season.Art: the animation is on par with the 1st season and pretty much the same, the only difference is Ren might have grown a little bit.Sound: the sound was really good again, both the OP & ED were new from the 1st season and the ED was better this season in my opinion. Also the source music was on point again and really helped in the more serious moments and in the funny moments with well placed SFX it made me smile a lot.Characters: as I said before it's all the same characters except the addition of the cousin who just so happens to have the same same Haru used when he was a host at a host bar which is Natsuo. He brings a lot of drama at first because there's a little history between Natsuo and Haru. Actually there is another new character and that's Haru's Doctor from after his accident, and the Doctor from Rens school moves into their old apartment building and Ren always asks him questions about sexual education and its so funny.Enjoyment: like the 1st season I really enjoyed this season aswell. We got to know more about the characters and learned that Haru still holds himself responsible for what happened to his parents. We get to see Ren and Haru work on their relationship and start to understand each other a little better. It's worth watching and I hope you give it a chance.Overall: it's a really good anime, I enjoyed the 2nd season slightly more than the 1st but as an entire anime I thought it was done really well and tastefully done aswell. I'm no going to review the OVA's cuz if you didn't know there is 2 of them, 1 for each season and they are just little short stories that don't effect the series. I just wish this anime had more seasons or atleast a few more episodes per season but I'm glad to know there is a manga that I believe is still ongoing but I'm not positive on that.Reviewers Note: If you read any of my other reviews or looked at my anime list then I hope you can trust me when I say this anime is really good, it's not for everyone so if you are against this type of relationship or you just don't enjoy this type of anime then I suggest you not waste your time and just find another anime to watch.

Synduality: Noir Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56731/Synduality__Noir_Part_2,"[""Part 2 of Synduality: Noir - It's all about history, high stakes, and the Hidden Inventories that would object the fight against good and evil.It's no secret that Bandai Namco's newest mixed-media project of Synduality has been quite the ride, starting with the anime, which focuses on the Type Zero Mage of Noir to get an idea of how the totality of the Synduality universe is like. And I've said it before in my review for Part 1, and I will say it again: despite the project's origin that's co-written by highly acclaimed novelist Hajime Kamoshida of Sakurasou and Seishun Buta Yarou fame, this pet...project that's shared together with series composer Takashi Aoshima and 8-bit's in-house director Yuusuke Yamamoto, Synduality: Noir is nothing special in the vein of extensive mecha shows like it.This begs the question: does Part 2 live up to whatever Part 1 was lacking back in Summer 2023? In one word: Yes. In more words: It's still a mixed bag.The whole bit with discovering the true intent of the Type Zero Magus as a whole, Noir has been the sum of many troubles in relation to the people whom she belongs to. And this time, the plot thickens with Kanata and the Drifters discovering the root origin of her and her alter Magus of Mystere: a place known as Histoire, but that its location is fixed in space. And that has been the plot for the antagonists, under the Ideal group, which is commanded by Weisheit Blaurecht, the young man who doesn't believe in a future of Maguses. He built a reputation for himself that caused the divide in Histoire of either supporting or against a future where both humans and Maguses can co-exist, and sad to say that his objective of wiping out Maguses ended up being the reason why Ideal was created, and all of his followers, only tools to his ultimate plan.It's the reason why Macht Ewigkeit and Licht Alter a.k.a Tokio were his only close friends who are fully aware of the travesty that he's about to do. And fate interwines that despite them having their respective Maguses (Macht with Schnee, and Licht with Mouton), one ended up having to defect against Weisheit because he couldn't care less about his plans, which is how both Drifter and Magus ended up in Rock Town, meeting Kanata and the gang and being a double spy for both parties. At the same time, Kanata solving the mysteries of Noir/Mystere, which got him into real trouble at the expense of playing the Hero, his sorry ass was a problem in Part 1, which was much improved in Part 2 to having a bone and a conviction to stop Ideal, and more importantly, Weisheit from seeing his dreams of an alternate only human world come true. Of course, everyone stays the same, but the Magus Ciel is Kanata's biggest benefactor especially in Part 2, driving home the reason of his purpose of fixing Noir to a proper Type Zero Magus, once and for all.Everything else is kept consistent, from studio 8-bit's good production to the massive cast of characters all standing by for the biggest revelation of their lives, to save a best friend and his partner from harm. And even though Arcana Project and Stereo Dive Foundation exchanged places for the OP/ED pairing for Part 2, I feel that Part 1 had the better pairing resonance as a set-up for the series, paired by great songs than the decent try found here.As a series, Synduality just never clicked with me, I guess. Mixed-media franchises are especially even tougher to pull off, especially for a game production house like Bandai Namco with its many IPs (see Scarlet Nexus as a fine example), and the tried-and-true foundation of mecha IPs over the years has been pretty tame, even with its anime counterpart as part of the push for the series' marketing. The same likewise with this one, and it just doesn't really show that much when the game itself (Synduality: Echo of Ada) is just releasing right after the anime series finished its run, even if on a completely different story context.Despite that, I still think that you should give Synduality: Noir a chance if you're interested, it does have pretty good tried-and-true themes to its name.

It's really amazing in my opinion and it hits me at all the right places. You'd never guess a popular series like this would make something so obscure.If you love Gintama or youtube abridges, you'll love this !I said all that I wanted to say about these specials, but this site is telling...me I should write a longer review. I hope these words will suffice, because I don't want to drag out stuff that doesn't need to be dragged out. There really isn't anything else I could say other than that I love these specials. LEAVE MY REVIEW ALONE !!! me I should write a longer review. I hope these words will suffice, because I don't want to drag out stuff that doesn't need to be dragged out.

Usavich II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3738/Usavich_II,"[""This second season of Usavich is a direct continuation of the first so expect the same characters, animation design and general over-the-top craziness.The biggest difference is that the static setting of the first season (which was fun but had run it's course by the end of the season) is switched for a more dynamic one. The two main characters are on the run and most of the episodes deal with them fighting off their pursuers and doing crazy things to their car. I found it more engaging than the first season and the animation has also become even more fun to watch without everything being...confined to one room.Basically if you somewhat enjoyed the first season you will also like this one. In my opinion it is a slight improvement in terms of premise and animation while still being just as ridiculous and over-the-top as the first season. At time it might get too silly even for hardened comedy fans, but overall it is definitely worth the little time it costs to watch. confined to one room.Basically if you somewhat enjoyed the first season you will also like this one.

Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuuchou: Tou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1860/Tokyo_Majin_Gakuen_Kenpuuchou__Tou,"[""This anime has all the classic elements from shounen, action, anime and uses them to produce this eerie, confusing yet superb show. ^_^The story follows five students: Tatsuma, Kyouichi, Aoi, Sakurai and Daigo who never really have talked to each other, in their fight to protect the city. The 1st episode was extremely intense and exciting to watch, on the other hand it will leave you completely bewildered and wondering what was going on. Yet for the first couple episodes of Tokyo Majin not much was explained about the current plot and it felt unnecessarily confusing. It's only until episode 7 &quot;Multitude of Demonic Arts&quot;...that a lot of the main questions were answered, which gives chance for a less confusing show that can be fully appreciated.The animation was superb which looked like a mix between the anime &quot;Shakugan no Shana&quot; and &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;. The character designs were decent but the weird designs for the demons and undead definitely was disgusting but great. The fight scenes were definitely interesting to watch and usually it can become really intense and gory, combining all the popular fighting styles found in most Shounen anime and making it work well with the story. The only real problem with the animation is that some scenes can get way too dark and the quality of the characters faces degrades at a distance.The music was alright and suited the mood of this eerie, gory and intense anime perfectly nonetheless if you despise &quot;Hard Rock&quot; then you'll obviously have a problem with this anime. However there's also a superb orchestra score during dramatic moments and even though the soundtrack is limited, it's still great.Overall this anime has all the standard elements found in Shounen anime (team of good guys, special powers, the main bad guy, the minor bad guys under control and so on&hellip;) and it works well in this series. Nonetheless there is still quite a bit of confusion in this series, right through to the end of the Dark Law Chapters. Even though there was a fantastic build up to the end, with plenty of fights and surprising developments, the Dark Law Chapters ended at such an anti-climax. Yet the reason for this high score is because this anime has a lot of potential, with the coming second season &quot;Martial Fist Chapters&quot;.So I recommend this anime to any shounen anime fan, because you won't be disappointed with what you get.^_^ that a lot of the main questions were answered, which gives chance for a less confusing show that can be fully appreciated.The animation was superb which looked like a mix between the anime &quot;Shakugan no Shana&quot; and &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;.

It makes it almost painful to watch at times. But the male characters in this are the counter of that which made it bearable to watch this anime all the way through.The story itself is wonderful, and if they used better female roles I think this anime could have gotten an easy 10/10 from me.Story - 10/10Art - 9/10Sound - 10/10Character - 6/10...Enjoyment - 8/10Overall - 8/10 Enjoyment - 8/10Overall - 8/10"", ""hm.. alright so.. i'm not exactly sure why this anime hasn't scored a higher average.. it's one of the most fantastic things i've seen in awhile.. i was even tempted to rate it a 10 just because i enjoyed it so much..the story might sound a little familiar.. dragon veins, daoist monks, martial arts, spiritually-endowed high school students faced with an apocalyptic event.. but so what if the elements aren't anything new.. it works, plain and simple.. and compared with other end-of-the-world anime, this one wins hand-down as far as style goes.. the story is pretty easy to follow, though the spiritual stuff gets a...bit confusing [kinda has to be].. i really had no serious complaints.the art.. wow dude.. i loved it.. heh-i even watched the entire series streamed and the quality wasn't perfect.. and it STILL blew me away.. the character design is great and the fight scenes were riveting [no lie].. usually i get bored with the fight scenes, especially when they drag on forever.. but Tokyo Majin is the perfect blend of story and fighting.. all with eye-candy animation.. never a dull moment, in my opinion.. first episode is probably my favorite as far as the action  goes.. hell, they're all spectacular.. the fighting is so.. fluid.. i guess would be an accurate word to use.. bah.. can't get over it.. kind of like samurai champloo fight scenes.. but better.. bloodier.. heh if you don't mind that sort of thing.. plus the monsters/demons weren't cheesy like they tend to be in other series.. sweet designs.. and they actually creeped me out.. which doesn't happen very often.sound was definitely good as well.. nothing bothered me, but nothing really blew me away either.. it all blended together though so.. no complaints here.. they kept it dark enough to fit the mood, but not over the top..characters.. perfect.. there's just enough romance for those of you who enjoy that stuff.. but nothing that detracts from the story.. sometimes that sort of thing can really take away from the overall impression.. this is not a series about love.. though i guess no series would be complete without a good romance or two.. heh.. but yea.. i honestly couldn't pick a favorite character.. well, i'd definitely rule out the journalist chick since she's hella annoying.. so ok-one negative there.. but the dynamics of the rest of the cast are more than enough to overpower one stupid little girl with a camera.as far as enjoyment goes, i couldn't have asked for more.. just uh.. anxious to see the second season is all..so there you have it..i HIGHLY recommend this series. bit confusing [kinda has to be].. i really had no serious complaints.the art.. wow dude.. i loved it.. heh-i even watched the entire series streamed and the quality wasn't perfect.. and it STILL blew me away.. the character design is great and the fight scenes were riveting [no lie].. usually i get bored with the fight scenes, especially when they drag on forever.. but Tokyo Majin is the perfect blend of story and fighting.. all with eye-candy animation.. never a dull moment, in my opinion.. first episode is probably my favorite as far as the action  goes.. hell, they're all spectacular.. the fighting is so.. fluid.. i guess would be an accurate word to use.. bah.. can't get over it.. kind of like samurai champloo fight scenes.. but better.. bloodier.. heh if you don't mind that sort of thing.. plus the monsters/demons weren't cheesy like they tend to be in other series.. sweet designs.. and they actually creeped me out.. which doesn't happen very often.sound was definitely good as well.. nothing bothered me, but nothing really blew me away either.. it all blended together though so.. no complaints here.. they kept it dark enough to fit the mood, but not over the top..characters.. perfect.. there's just enough romance for those of you who enjoy that stuff.. but nothing that detracts from the story.. sometimes that sort of thing can really take away from the overall impression.. this is not a series about love.. though i guess no series would be complete without a good romance or two.. heh.. but yea.. i honestly couldn't pick a favorite character.. well, i'd definitely rule out the journalist chick since she's hella annoying.. so ok-one negative there.. but the dynamics of the rest of the cast are more than enough to overpower one stupid little girl with a camera.as far as enjoyment goes, i couldn't have asked for more.. just uh.. anxious to see the second season is all..so there you have it..i HIGHLY recommend this series."", ""The one thing that made me watch this Anime was it's genre; I just needed to see for myself whether this was really such a badass action Anime.It starts out weird, with monsters and them beating it up. The Animations seems to be ok. That was until I saw something that changed my whole perspective of this Anime. But more about that later, I'll discuss the story and characters first.The story revolves about a group of youngsters. Each one of them having their respected influence, as they all have different strengths, weaknesses, powers and personalities.It seems to be a pretty cool cast. You have the...silent boy no one really knows about, the strong and fierce delinquent, the protective girl with healing powers, etc. They're fighting to kill weird monsters they call &quot;oni&quot;. There is also a storyline to this all. I can't say this Anime gave me much to complaint about (yet). It seems like you've jumped right into a game, that together with your party.There are of course also minor negative things about this Anime. One of them being that whenever there is an action scene, it ends pretty quickly. But it are only minor things, nothing to worry about. Talking about the action, I think it's time to tell you whether the Action is really as great as I expected.The action is what made my perspective of this Anime that different. It wasn't just &quot;beating up monsters&quot; any more. The amazing thing about this Anime is in fact.. the action. I've seen my parts of action Anime already, but this one was different. Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuchou Tou has really cool action. You see all kind of different fighting styles used for fighting monsters; not just monsters, also other people with a sort of &quot;super power&quot;. I remember seeing one guy having the ability to use lightning. Using a large pole-arm or sort, it blows away the enemy's with his speed and power; it's still lightning of course, imagine how badass that'd be.I've been trying to think of a negative part for a while now. But there really aren't many. If you think that the monsters are actually one of this Anime' weak points; than you are wrong. I have to agree that the zombie like creatures look like they've escaped straight from Resident Evil. But no, they didn't, neither do they bother you when viewing the Anime. Not to mention that the zombie'-like creatures aren't of a big importance in the Anime.In fact, they don't have that big a role. The ones using and making these Zombie's are the ones controlling them. Those controllers are the ones playing a big role in the Anime, neither are they as bad in looks as the Zombie's, they look pretty cool. If you mix up a cool looking cast; mixed together with cool fighting scenes. Just what else can you wish for in an action Anime?The story continues with a second season, and after that there might even be a third and/or fourth season. So isn't it a waste to watch an Anime who will grow to have over 30 episodes?Uh, no. It's not even close to being a waste. I really enjoyed this Anime, and I think you will too.It's not the &quot;best&quot; Anime out there. In many ways it's just an average Anime. But the fighting scenes (when they fight), are awesome.So this could be considered a recommendation. silent boy no one really knows about, the strong and fierce delinquent, the protective girl with healing powers, etc. They're fighting to kill weird monsters they call &quot;oni&quot;.

The horror anime that I\'ve seen I can count on one hand. The reason for my reluctance is because I like to watch anime for things other than disturb-value, and since I like to complete a series within a couple of days, the grotesqueness of the genre can wear on me after a few hours. But I decided to try ""Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpucho: Tou"" because I like good romance coupled with good action, and ""Tokyo Majin""...was said to have both; and I also needed a new anime to watch. So I tried it, and let me tell you, it doesn\'t disappoint.It has the bizarre and fantastical villains of the horror genre, but what surprised me was the amount of emotional and relational development that filled up the majority of each episode. The art is, in my opinion, excellent, and it complements the avant-garde story progression in an aesthetically-pleasing way. The music by ACID in the opening theme sets the tone for the series as a whole: there is an anthem of hardness interwined with a melodic familiar (parallels the horrific villains versus the friendship of the five main teenagers).I mentioned that I initially watched ""Tokyo Majin"" partially for the rumored romance, and although the romance in the show is evident, it is softly presented, and I was glad. What I was more happy to see was the artistically ""gore-rific"" fight scenes and the character development of the two main male characters. The main female character has her moments of, ""Hello, I\'m a girl and I\'m whiny because I\'m more helpless than I want to be,"" and goodness knows the journalist female student can be annoying (which is her character\'s purpose), but I overlooked the flaws with the female characters in this show because I felt that they were eventually redeemed by later-revealed strengths.The story is so-so in this series, nothing completely original, and the dialogue is used to mainly progress the stereotypical persona of the bad boy, the mysterious boy, the ideal girl, etc of the core five. But all in all, the points of interest in this anime are, in a nutshell, and in order of significance:1) the visuals2) the portrayal of friendship (especially between Tatsuma and Kyouichi, the two main males)3) the portrayal of romantic love as something that can only be maintained through sacrifice (sacrifice of self, of life) was said to have both; and I also needed a new anime to watch.

The lead characters were likeable (more specifically, I\'m a sucker for series where the main character falls into the ""nice guy"" archetype), although somewhat stereotyped and coupled with cheesy and altogether clichéd dialogue. Much of the human drama was too forced, but the almost careless, apathetic way violence and cruelty were presented was very effective in setting the dark tone of the story. ', 'Sorry No STORY what so ever. i was ep 5 and all of a sudden it change to another time frame and a new chapter that doesnt even connect. wtf bu the animation is pretty good ', 'Don\'t be fooled by the first episode where it looks like this a zombie anime because it isn\'t.Story:(No, there really isn\'t any romance at all in this)Five Highschool students gain mysterious powers after a encountering a demon. Shortly there after the city they live in(Tokyo obviously) is having tons of crazy and gruesome murders, all caused by demons or other people with ""The Power"" they have but are insane. (The power really is never explained) These five students will to fight to protect their city. Or so they say anyways...Art:Compared to the god awful art of Bokurano(which came out the same year), Tokyo Majin gets...an Emmy for best visuals. Jokes aside Tokyo Majin has what seems to be a timeless art style that\'s held up well over the years. Characters faces display great emotion. However the background while very nice and detailed are also very drab and use lots of darker colors.Sound:Sound varies wildly and sometimes the characters speak so softly they can be hard to hear, and other times the music can be very loud. Speaking of music this anime has an awesome sound track. The OP and all the fight scenes have great music to them. Even the more emotional music works very well in this anime. The Dub version is fine as well.Characters:(O boy) While each of the three male main characters have vastly different personalities the two female leads do not.Hiyuu, Tatsuma - (Something about his face bothers me) He is the kind of guy who always looks at the good side of things, and smiles a lot. Tatsuma is always very calm and seemingly at peace with himself, and he never gives up or gives into despair. He fights to protect people, even his enemies.Houraiji, Kyouichi - (Personally my favorite of the cast) In the beginning he is introduced jumping out of the classroom window to beat up a gang of dudes after him. He is the guy who looks like a punk, acts like a punk, but is actually very wise for his age. Houraiji has seemingly endless contacts with people from the bad side of town, all of whom respect him highly. He is Hot headed when there\'s a good fight, but also very calm when dealing with others. When his friends are down in the dumps he\'s able to lift them up (in his own crude way) and set them back on track. He\'s the cool dude who can kick your ass or give you life advise.Daigo, Yuuya - (The nanny of the group) Yuuya is the wrestling teams leader and he is also the cook of the main group. He has a huge crush on Komaki and he even goes as far as making her lunches.(when its usually girls who make the lunches for the guys they crush on) He isn\'t one who is eager to start a fight but when push comes to shove he\'s ready for it. While Yuuya is strong unlike Houraiji and Hiyuu he is not as emotionally as strong as they are.Sakurai, Komaki - (The Shemale as proclaimed by Houraiji) Easily the weakest link in the group, Komaki would rather stay out of all the fighting and the only reason she seemingly keeps fighting is because of Aoi, who she has a thing for. Komaki constantly lets the ""What If"" and past events get to her, even though she acts all high and mighty she breaks very easily.Misato, Aoi - (All she wants to do is save people, and constantly fails at it) Aoi is the school president and lives in a big mansion. The power unlike the rest is a purely defensive power, most likely stemming from the fact she wants to protect people. She\'s a good girl with a seemingly pure heart however more often then not she doesn\'t help or save people but either gets people killed during combat or watches people she tries to save die. She is also more often then not pushed around by most of the other main characters because she is the weakest of the group. Emotionally she\'s stronger then Komaki though that\'s not saying much since she also has some breakdowns of her own.(Granted her reasons for breaking down are more understandable then Komaki\'s)Enjoyment:With decent fight scenes and lots of blood and Komaki being called a Shemale, this anime is fun to watch, though some parts where Aoi or Komaki are emotionally unstable seem to slow down the pacing at times. The demons are all very different looking from each other and all have different abilities. Did I mention that\'s there\'s also a fair amount of gore and a high amount of blood and also some creepy moments as well.Overall:While not a must watch if your into Gore, action, and demon hunting, with a badass soundtrack this will be right up your alley. There are a decent amount of plot holes and character development is all over the place. If you want some the questions answered you\'ll have to continue to watch the 2nd season which is a direct continuation. an Emmy for best visuals.

I have not played the game or read the manga.STORY: The name of the anime doesn\'t really fit it\'s story. The name means Tokyo Wizard Academy, but it doesn\'t really have anything to do with what most people describe as wizards. Instead, we\'ve got demons and ogres. However, the main cast also has some supernatural powers - which could very well be why the series has the name that it does. Anyway, the story starts out with mysterious deaths involving the ""Reborn Dead"" (referred to as ""Living Dead"" in the dub) occurring in...the nights of Tokyo - these usually involve people disappearing at night, reappearing during the day as a corpse; however, they\'re somehow able to escape from the morgue before being autopsied. This is where the main cast comes in, starting with Tatsuma Hiyuu and Kyouichi Horaiji. The two, along with the rest of their group stay up every night to find out what\'s causing the mysterious deaths. Soon after, they find out that there\'s a more powerful demon behind all the deaths.It doesn\'t sound that bad, does it? The summary of the anime is what draws you in, what actually happens keeps you pretty interested. The first thing you see is people getting stabbed - and who\'s the witness? A baby! Funny thing is, that baby is practically the main character of this anime (oops, guess I\'ve said too much).ART: The art isn\'t very good, to be honest. This anime was created in the late 2000s? I couldn\'t tell. It looked more like a 1990s production. The character design was pretty well-done, but the animation takes away from it. I\'ve seen FUNimation Entertainment put out downright amazing anime in terms of art and animation, but I have to say the animation for this was a disappointment - something I decided before I even knew FUNimation was involved in the production of the series.SOUND: I will separate this into two sections: music and voice. Why am I doing that? Because it will look way too cluttered if I try to put my opinions on the OP, ED, and voice actors all in one paragraph.Music - Screamo fans will definitely appreciate the OP. However, if one is more into pop/rock, they won\'t like it too much. That being said, it\'s not a very bad song, but it\'s not necessarily iPod-worthy. However, that depends on who you ask. The vocals for the track are done nicely enough, but depending on one\'s musical taste - the screaming could make or break the decision of whether or not it\'s a ""good"" song. ACID definitely did a great job with the song, and if you did away with the screamo bits - I\'d say it\'s one of my top 5 OP tracks. The ED is absolutely beautiful. I could say it\'s the most amazing ED that\'s ever been created, but as I haven\'t seen every anime ever created - it could very well be wrong. That doesn\'t, however, change the fact that the song is just spectacular. I can\'t stress how much I love the ED track for this anime. The song just showcases how talented ACID is when it comes to pure vocal abilities.Voice - The voice actors aren\'t really anything special. Kyouichi sounds like any other delinquent. Aoi sounds like the classic good girl, or girl next door. Yuuya sounds like a typical jock. One line from Hisui and you automatically know that he\'s one of those ""loyal servant"" types. Komaki and Tatsuma, on the other hand, are hard to describe in terms of voice; you honestly can\'t tell much about them from how they sound - while the other two are dead give-aways as soon as you hear them. Whether or not that\'s a good or bad thing depends on the individual viewer. On one hand, not being able to show the character\'s personality through voice acting isn\'t necessarily a good thing. However, Komaki\'s voice actress, Melissa Pritchett, redeems herself in that she can depict emotion very well (seen in ""Dream Hell""). Brandon Hearnsberger, the voice of Tatsuma, is also capable of this - making him seem a little less mysterious. Vic Mignogna once again shows off his skill by voicing the villain, Tendo Kozunu; I could just hear the evil in his voice. It\'s no surprise though, he seems to do a great job with any role he plays when it comes to dubbing anime.CHARACTER: The characters are pretty well-developed, the main ones anyway. It\'s hard to describe them without giving too much away about the show. We see that Kyouichi, despite his mean nature towards everyone but Tatsuma, seems to have a bit of a soft spot for Aoi - he\'s constantly protecting her, even when getting rid of her may prove more beneficial. We see that Aoi has a somewhat dark past despite her kind, gentle nature. The relationship between Yuuya and Komaki is great for comic relief, especially since she\'s so oblivious to Yuuya\'s blatant crush on her. Komaki, despite the strong facade she puts on in front of everyone, is very emotional - which is the exact opposite of what one would expect from her. She could be the most emotional of them all, and when her emotions get out-of-whack, her ability to fight is also affected - making her weaker than she really is. Yuuya is your typical jock - with the crush on probably the most oblivious girl in the show. It\'s honestly surprising Kyoko didn\'t just blurt it out. Tatsuma is just as mysterious by the end of the season as he was in the beginning. You have some questions answered, but at the same time you\'re left with more. He\'s possibly the most complex character in the show.On the other hand, Tendo Kozunu, is much more than just some malicious person off the street looking for revenge. On the inside, he\'s just a sad little boy that wants to be with his mother - or at least avenge her. He\'s haunted by his mother\'s death, making it a bit hard for one to outright despise him despite all the horrible things he\'s done. He has a strong hatred towards Tatsuma from the first time they meet - it\'s later revealed that he blames Tatsuma\'s ancestors for his mother\'s death. The man is extremely manipulative, but there\'s something to him making it hard to completely hate him. The little girl seen with him gets no character development whatsoever - well, aside from the fact that she\'s a little brat.ENJOYMENT: You definitely won\'t get bored. However, it\'s better to watch it over a long time. There\'s just a lot packed into one episode, but it\'s better take a break between viewings so you can take it all in.OVERALL: It\'s pretty good anime. I wouldn\'t call it one of the best, but it\'s not something that you should just brush off. Those who say it has no storyline are either not paying very much attention, or didn\'t even bother giving this anime a real shot. the nights of Tokyo - these usually involve people disappearing at night, reappearing during the day as a corpse; however, they\'re somehow able to escape from the morgue before being autopsied. This is where the main cast comes in, starting with Tatsuma Hiyuu and Kyouichi Horaiji.

When i looked at the description, i figured ""o boy. another mediocre anime with an uber-recycled storyline and characters"".....thank god i was wrong.storyline: a quiet transfer student named tatsuma hiyuu comes to magami high and his looks and his tendency to sleep in class earns him the name sleeping beauty. he connects with residential delinquent kyouichi horaiji after a brief fight and they both end up getting powers from the mysterious...dragon stream along with 3 other students. together they fight against the undead plaguing tokyo and struggle to find balance with their destinies.from that point on, the show falls into a somewhat monster-of-the-day plan. from zombies to insane psychopaths bent on revenge, they tackle tough opponents but despite that it proves itself to be decent anime. something to watch in spare time mind u but it does manage to hold some individuality despite the obvious stereotypes.p.s. the ending however is pretty ambiguous and unsatisfying. just a heads up dragon stream along with 3 other students. together they fight against the undead plaguing tokyo and struggle to find balance with their destinies.from that point on, the show falls into a somewhat monster-of-the-day plan. from zombies to insane psychopaths bent on revenge, they tackle tough opponents but despite that it proves itself to be decent anime. something to watch in spare time mind u but it does manage to hold some individuality despite the obvious stereotypes.p.s. the ending however is pretty ambiguous and unsatisfying. just a heads up', ""Ahh!

The fansub ""liner notes"" frequently link this to the Shin Megami gameline, in particular the Persona games and I have to agree that there are a large number of corollaries between the two - particularly in regards to the darkness of the world and the heavy apocalyptic symbolism. The series can be a little impenetrable at first at it starts ""in media res"" and the flashbacks and backstory are often intermingled with the main storyline without any of the common visual and auditory cues. While the first time this happens its a little...jarring I found it to be engaging (as it demands audience attention) and interesting. Its nice to see narrative experimentation likes this and I felt it added quite nicely to the feel of the show (akin to the disjointed chronology of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzuimiya). The action is well done and nicely animated and while there\'s a fair bit of it usually serves as a backdrop to the character development as opposed to an end in and of it itself. jarring I found it to be engaging (as it demands audience attention) and interesting.

It actually used the idea of making the pilot episode not the first in the chronological timeline of the show, and it manages to pull it off. The problem is after that. The timeline and chronological order is hard to grasp because honestly, most of the episodes are just episodic, so when you have random jumps in time between episode 3 and like 5, it does get confusing. Mainly the crow arc and zombie arc. Which one happened first? It\'s only through random flashbacks that you can understand that the crow arc happened first, at least...I think so, but at the same time, that leaves a lot of questions unanswered.This is the problem with this show. A lot of the combat, powers, and events are unanswered and either done off screen or not done at all with any explanation. You have a team of 5 people fighting demons, and all of them gain some sort of power to fight demons. Yet, there\'s not much training, and people just get more powerful off screen with no explanation. Like, Daigo gets a new weapon with no explanation on episode 9, and you\'re just supposed go along with the assumption that he figured out how to master a new weapon off screen.The show also does as little explanation on absolutely anything and everything. There\'s people dying all of the time in town, and you\'re telling me that no politician or police are doing anything? The only thing that you get in terms of government response is a detective trying to figure out how the person in question died. That\'s it. There\'s just a lack of any worldbuilding, and the story is stuck on this extremely narrow narrative that just ignores anything that\'s not needed.Why do people that the group of 5 know end up being demons? No idea, but it sure as hell made for some crappy character development and excuses for the show to shove flashbacks for cardboard characters. These characters are really bad, especially the women. Anko is just an annoying character whose sole role is to give the group important information to find and kill the next demon. Great. No plot device there!Aoi is basically a typical protagonist-like character whose only personality is to whine about people dying and how ""we should save everyone, even the bad guys."" She\'s so annoying because she wants to spare demons who are murderers on a killing spree, and she never even thinks of the consequences of doing so. What if, because you spared a demon, your teammates got injured or died? Or if they get away because you spared a demon, they would just go killing more people the next day? Usually there would be some sort of ""snapping to reality"" moment, where she realizes not everyone can be saved, but no, since she\'s a main character, her actions have no consequences, and thus, she can act like a static character the entire series. Sakurai\'s basically the love interest of Daigo, both of whom are completely bland and are only there to make up numbers, I suppose. Sakurai\'s a bit more complicated than Daigo, but she\'s just there to act as a childhood friend to Aoi, and sometimes a bit of drama. honestly, she\'s 100x better than Aoi since she actually progresses as a character. Still just crappy character in general.The 2 good characters are the male characters, excluding Daigo. They are the saving grace of this series, mainly Kyouichi. His personality and dialogue, with his personal jibes and comments are the only thing lighting up the series with any hint of genuine dialogue. He\'s a generic strong delinquent that hides his true feelings, but he\'s actually not bad in my book. Hiyu is basically Aoi\'s male counterpart: he\'s also there just because he wants to save everyone, but at least he\'s more realistic. He\'s not whining, and there was even a scene where he holds a dying girl in his embrace, knowing she\'s not going to make it. He and Kyouichi have a moment. That\'s basically the only good scene in the entire show. I\'m not even going to mention Daigo other than that he\'s the tank of the team with an obnoxious interest in Sakurai.Story? What damn story? The show just dangles down a random antagonist whose intentions and behavior you probably never find out until the finale, in which I really cannot give less of a fuck about, and other than that, the story is just Anko or someone providing information about a demon. That\'s it. Or, the ""demon killing group"" just patrols at night and finds the demons. That\'s all there is. Sometimes, there\'s a personal connection to someone in the demon killer group, in which there\'s some drama or sob backstory you\'re going to have to sit through.This show is cringe, and it\'s a crappy shounen. It\'s pretty clear that it\'s a game adaptation, and most of the show doesn\'t make a lot of sense, and there\'s little to no worldbuilding or pacing. A lot of the episodes are fragmented and poorly planned out despite also being episodic in nature.

The first episode makes no sense, but if you watch the whole thing, you will love it, trust me. I mean, maybe not love, but enjoy for sure. The characters start off not really knowing eachother and then become fast friends as they protect tokyo from monsters using magic.It also has some deep tragedy in there, worth watching out for, and is more on the darker side in some scenes. The animation is decent but overall it is pretty  good and worth watching. ', 'I was skeptical about this anime.  I bought the first 14 episodes on DVD for a cheap price and decided to give it a try.I must say I was impressed!  This is a good action-packed young teenager cast anime.  You have 5 main high school students who gain mysterious powers and fight demons.  The characters are built successfully.  I love this style of animation, good english dub voice acting, and such a gloomy yet amazing world.Overall good anime 8.5/10 ']"
Watashi to Watashi: Futari no Lotte,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3691/Watashi_to_Watashi__Futari_no_Lotte,"['Finally finished Futari no Lotte, something that has been burdening me ever since Ziu\'s cue to it misled me to thinking he refers to Lucy-May, but I decided to check out this thing as well just in case. While the premises are there, this series is not officially recognized as a part of WMT. But it deserves the title by merit.

Yeah, the show\'s pacing is limited, yet it may become lovely if you don\'t rush...it.The place and setting are rather unusual, but methinks the show only owns it to the original book.The underlying idea tho — twins getting separated after birth — even though I can\'t recall any other anime with a similar story, the very concept feels rather shallow, you need some heavy Dezaki duty to attach any significance to such a trifling premise. As the series progresses, the twins do exactly what you would expect them to do, seldom catching you by surprise. Although eventually, the show acquires a certain own comedic/dramatic charm and inspiring value, it sometimes wanders dangerously close to drooping into a lackluster, like some other shows do, content with occupying their specific niche without ever aspiring for unwarranted risks. I wish I could say it had a potential for being more imaginative and original, but I myself can\'t see a way how it could have been improved. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯No, actually, the ED song can be considered a fly in the ointment.

Albeit further down the series, particularly in a Munich piano concert arc, it gets actually gorgeous, I had to wait a hefty half of the series to finally find myself at the edge of the seat. Ep17 in particular had me.

This episode alone was almost enough to knock my score down to 8/10.This show has Kodama Kenji\'s usual hand and vibe to it — while his shows staged in Japan are majorly a lowkey disappointment, his shows staged in Europe blow me away.This series had made me a better person on so many levels.

Arata is powerful and competent, so he doesn't have to be protected by the girls all the time. He's also unapologetically perverted, and it's quite refreshing to see him handle the inevitable ecchi situations with humor and honesty instead of stuttered apologies.Most of the girls are rather likeable as well, from the prudish...and easily-embarrassed Lilith (a great target for Arata's teasing) to the mischievous and confident Levi, who developed a certain camaraderie with the MC and even goes along with his perverted jokes. Their interactions with Arata and each other are usually quite entertaining. Violent tsundere tendencies, while present in one or two characters, are thankfully toned down.TL;DR Trinity Seven is an otherwise average harem carried by an awesome male lead and charming female characters. and easily-embarrassed Lilith (a great target for Arata's teasing) to the mischievous and confident Levi, who developed a certain camaraderie with the MC and even goes along with his perverted jokes.

One thing that I realized I liked was that he wasn\'t as overpowered as any other anime would have made him.- Aiko: One of the supporting characters in the Trinity Seven. There was something different about her from other female characters of any anime. She stood out to me the most (besides MC).Cons:- Horrible plot development. Just so messy.I almost dropped it because...it bothered me that much.- The amount of fan service. I do like a bit myself, but there comes a point where it\'s too much. Trinity Seven goes past that point.- Every female character, other than Aiko.- Character development was atrocious. Nothing was explained well. For example, what are any of the ""processes""? What actual powers do the grimories have?- Hijiri: To not include any spoilers, I won\'t describe much. As I watched, I just wanted to say what the actual F? If you decide to watch the anime, you\'ll understand.I will say that this anime is on the lower end of my spectrum of choice. I think that the story would have been executed better in a longer season. it bothered me that much.- The amount of fan service. I do like a bit myself, but there comes a point where it\'s too much.

There many times at which the episode ended and I just wanted to be able to continue watching. It seems fairly well thought out and the happenings all seem to fit into the world well. There are times when parts could be explained a little bit more clearly, such as...in the Library section, however I feel that this did not detract from my enjoyment of the anime. Each ""section"" feels like it brings everything a little bit closer together and it is very satisfying to watch. There are very few times where I felt there wasn\'t progress in the plot, and yet still a good amount of character development is achieved. The combination of these two make this anime a worthy watch.~Sound~~7~Although I did not particularly enjoy either the OP or ED of this anime, I felt that the voices were VERY well suited to the characters, everything fits well and it certainly helps the ease with which one can watch this anime. I didn\'t find any issue with any background music that played in the anime, and wasn\'t distracted by any of it, but in the same regard, it didn\'t blow me away as anything incredible.~Visuals~~8~Personally, I enjoyed the visuals, I felt as if they were above average for an anime of this type and I was sometimes impressed by certain backgrounds or settings. You can tell that effort has been put in to make this anime look great, and it is another reason for which this anime is so enjoyable to watch. It is well detailed and there are few things about it which I would change if I had the choice. (You can tell they put lots of effort into the fanservice ;) )~Characters~~9~One of the strong points about this anime, the characters are all very likable and well made. There is sufficient character development (for an anime of this length), that you feel for some of the characters and get to know them a little bit more than in some other anime. There is an incredible mix of characters, and each on adds to the feeling of the anime. They each have their traits and they all seem to function well together in terms of interaction. It doesn\'t feel like any of the characters make any of the others redundant. The way in which they can synergise their powers is clever and I feel that this was a slightly more unique aspect.~Enjoyment~~9~This is one of the anime which I have thoroughly enjoyed. There are several reasons for this, though obviously as I don\'t want to give any spoilers, I will not mention many of them. A lot of they enjoyment I feel, came from the very well written script and the interactions of the characters with each other and their relationships.~Overall~~8~""This was more enjoyable to watch than the average anime, would recommend to others.""In my opinion, this anime is above par and one that I would recommend to people, even if they hadn\'t specifically mentioned the title themselves. There is a great mix of characters, their voices fit and the plot is great. This is one of the better anime out of the ones I have been watching this season (4th release date of 2014)For those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:This is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.E01: 7E04: 7E08: 7E09: 8 (Rated up 1)E12: 8 in the Library section, however I feel that this did not detract from my enjoyment of the anime.

Global warming, earthquakes, and solar flares are all major issues that scientists and those worried about the Earth\'s future are thinking about daily. They wonder if these types of disasters can be avoided, to prevent the destruction of the place we call home.Whether or not anything is ultimately preventable is certainly a courageous endeavor, often needing help from the many and not the few. This sets the stage for Trinity Seven, a stage...filled with breasts, harems, and not much more.STORYTrinity Seven begins with Arata, a young man who loses his cousin Hijiri to a ""collapse phenomenon,"" prompting him to leave with Lilith to a magical high school where he discovers he is the next ""demon lord candidate.""Trinity Seven is classified as a harem, and it puts a lot of stock into this portion of the show, focusing on the girls\' varying personalities, antics, and general adoration of Arata. The anime attempts to switch up the pairings where it can, giving the show comedy and the like to leverage. Overall, this gives the series a competent amount of shenanigans to follow.It all goes downhill when it is not focusing on this side, however. One of Trinity Seven\'s largest issues comes from the cast itself. The anime is constantly throwing out new characters from start to finish. This is not an exaggeration; literally until the final episode, new characters are being shown. Being an entirely character driven show, one would think that such an endeavor would be acceptable.But it doesn\'t work. As more and more characters are brought in, two more problems arise. The older characters are not given enough screen-time, causing them all to lack development and caring towards them needed by the audience. At the same time, the newer characters, given their later and later introductions, suffer the same fate. No character is given enough time to be properly explored, making the cast become props to ogle at rather than well-defined people. It\'s a vicious cycle that persists throughout the entire season, bringing about an unsavory amount of chaos.The biggest flaw comes from the plot itself. Much of what occurs is completely nonsensical in nature due to the exorbitant amount of terminology the anime throws at the audience. ""Archives,"" ""Themas,"" and other foreign words are tossed around as if the audience is supposed to simply understand why they are being used or where they originate. The anime never delves into any sort of world-building, merely saying phrases in passing or nonchalantly talking about how certain aspects of their magic work. There is no pretext, context, or subtext for anything that goes on. Both the overall arc and sub-plots contain this problem, throwing the entire experience into disarray.ANIMATIONGenerally less than stellar, Trinity Seven adopts rather awkward techniques for both its art and animation.Beginning with the art style, the characters are typically set to CGI backgrounds. This allows them to stand out more noticeably when compared to other anime, mainly because of the jarring juxtaposition of 3D and 2D elements. The anime looks better when it is not using such a trick, but even then, the unvarying amount of locations that are visited provides little in the way of intrigue.However, another part fares better, arguably being the best part of the show: the girls and their character designs. Ranging from elegant to slutty, bodacious to simple, they all maintain the same style but differ when it comes to overall looks, faces, hair, outfits, etc. They\'re varied enough and interesting enough within the anime to be a positive force.The actual animation, though, is sorely a negative. Character movements are often kept to a minimum and many shots consist of only one character at a time. The most notable drop in animation comes from the ""fight"" scenes. They are meant to be small duels or skirmishes, but they are never really depicted as such. Quick cuts, simple attacks, and more often than not refusing to show the action itself demonstrates just how little animation there really is.CHARACTERSBeing a harem, Trinity Seven contains a large main cast. More specifically, and perhaps obviously, there are seven young women who take the spotlight. I\'ll stick to talking about Arata and my favorite four.As a main character, Arata is actually not immensely dense. Perverse and funny, he allows the Trinity Seven themselves to shine as much as possible. Determined to see his cousin once more, he goes to great lengths to accomplish the goals he sets for himself. As a new demon lord candidate, he is able to control magic as he wills. It\'s this and his all-around likability that causes the girls to flock to him, despite his affinity for all things debauched.Acting as the head of the defense department, Mira is a shorter woman who does not tolerate any form of impure thoughts or actions. Extremely shy yet demanding, she usually butts heads with Arata due to their opposite, base ideals. Her strong suit is being capable of reflecting or disabling any form of magic. Her highly defensive combat abilities also manifest in her personality, making her difficult to approach let alone talk to. However, the more time she spends with Arata, the further her shell cracks, revealing a more comfortable and caring friend.Liese is a succubus first and magic-user second. Relying almost entirely on her well-endowed assets, she utilizes her sex appeal to its fullest potential. Her playful nature causes her to invade people\'s privacy regularly. She has no qualms making others feel uncomfortable, since she is so content with her own body and her sexuality. To aid her in this process, she is able to bend time to her will. Liese starts off as a tough antagonist, aiming to become the next ""demon lord"" before Arata. But due to his affable personality, she transitions from difficult foe to treasured companion, presenting an argument to the saying, ""time heals all wounds.""Yui is a strange girl, to say the least. She exists within two separate dimensions at the same time: one in the real world and another in a dream-like state. The former is incredibly happy, carefree, and quick to call Arata ""Onii-san"" whenever she is given the chance. Her dream-self is quiet and calm, producing an aura of elegance that the rest of the girls do not own. Her magic takes on a supportive role, boosting the power of those around her. Being the first of the Trinity Seven that brings Arata hardship to ""capture,"" when she is ultimately saved, her supportive attitude shines through, making her an extremely wonderful addition to the cast.Technically the poster-girl for the show, Lilith is Arata\'s mentor and first of the girls to give her trust. Easily embarrassed, sincere, and willing to guide people down the right path, she is most often found looking after Arata. Her beauty is unrivaled, and so are her skills as a professor. She is at maximum cuteness when she is blushing after being teased or hearing/seeing Arata say/do something slightly perverted. Her abilities take the form of handheld weapons -- guns -- that shoot out magic with high speed and intensity. While she incessantly yells at Arata for his continuous behavior, deep down, like the guns she wields, her emotions and feelings for him are incredibly strong and unyielding.Along with the other three (Levi, Arin, and Akio), and a few of the other side cast, each of them have their own descriptions and a connection between their personality and the skills they have. While the entire cast is neither fleshed out nor too memorable, there is bound to be someone here for everyone to enjoy.SOUNDThe OP for the anime is actually quite good. The beginning part with the hard guitar and choir-like singing starts the piece off strong. The middle section follows suit, with guitar, drums, and vocals working well in unison. The halfway point, with the ""falling"" effects in the singing and drums causes one to bob their head to the beat. Just the nice amount of variety from the piece makes it stand out from the pact.You may be able to choose the destination, but you shouldn\'t choose the first ED. It\'s a mess of singing and instruments that is not pleasant to listen to.The second ED takes a slightly slower approach that works miles better than the first. Its float-y feel and ""shavadava,"" alongside the more onomatopoeia vocals, make it a fun song to hear, coinciding with the stronger parts of the anime. It is Arguably the best of the EDs.ED number three goes back to being quick, and subsequently back to being bad. It\'s a rather strange song, containing a piano melody and both fast and higher singing that don\'t work well together.The final ED is the worst of the bunch. Nothing attributed to the song seems to flow, creating an even worse amalgamation than what the first ending piece offered. The techno background beat and mid-range vocals create an awkward arrangement that doesn\'t fit well with the anime, as well as making it rather forgettable.The soundtrack mostly consists of ambient pieces filled with violins and darker tones that fit the more ""evil"" vibe the show contains during the more serious portions. However, none of the tracks are noteworthy.The voice-acting within the anime is average, with no notable performances to be had.ENJOYMENTWhen it comes to an anime like this, it prioritizes the harem and the comedy first with story and characters coming in at a distant second. In that regard, the show does well, making me chuckle with its various scenes and silly moments.When the anime tried to make the action and plot its focus, I really just wanted them to go back to the comedy and the harem elements that it was doing so well at. And as the series progressed, it started fixating its eyes on its weakest parts more and more, making the experience less fun the further along it went.For what it\'s worth, Trinity Seven tried to be more than just a run-of-the-mill harem. But its inability to balance the characters, its rather awful narrative (even among the genre), and strange decisions in regards to animation and music make the entire package less than average.SUMMARYStory: Bad, harem shenanigans, too many characters, terrible world-buildingAnimation: Bad, jarring 2D/3D mix, nice character designs, little animationCharacters: Fine, Arata, Mira, Liese, Yui, and Lilith are okay, with someone for everyoneSound: Bad, good OP, bad EDs, okay soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, fun to watch only when the harem and the comedy are the focusFinal Score: 3/10 filled with breasts, harems, and not much more.STORYTrinity Seven begins with Arata, a young man who loses his cousin Hijiri to a ""collapse phenomenon,"" prompting him to leave with Lilith to a magical high school where he discovers he is the next ""demon lord candidate.""Trinity Seven is classified as a harem, and it puts a lot of stock into this portion of the show, focusing on the girls\' varying personalities, antics, and general adoration of Arata.

The harem is typically courted by a dense male lead and at least five girls -- each with a different hair color than the others. This male lead will then become involved in at least three scenarios (Per episode) in which he accidentally touches one of these girls in one of their private areas and thus receives a slap in the face, followed by blushing and an occasional punch that defies the laws of...physics and sends him skyrocketing across the galaxy. Trinity Seven is an atypical representation concerning this definition of ""Harem"".Kasuga Arata (Only dude pictured above) isn\'t your typical dense ""Omg I have no idea you want to bang me"" protagonist. This is where a lot of the charm Trinity Seven has to offer comes into play. We meet him as the world he resides in is being torn to shreds, ultimately ending humanity. In his final moments, his cousin hands him a necklace/grimoire-thingy (Before falling into a crevice opening up in the world) which contains a magical entity that will allow him to essentially re-shape the world on a journey to find that cousin. However, in order to do that, he must become acquainted with the ""Trinity Seven"" which is the name given to the seven magus females that all want to swallow his mana.But the cool thing about Trinity Seven is that it never really feels dull. It\'s predictable in a good way, which sounds weird at first -- but makes sense in context. You won\'t grow to hate the main character, which is a common flaw that harems typically encounter as they progress. This all culminates in one of the most surprisingly entertaining shows to come out of Fall 2014. In order to better illustrate this, let me break it up into a few key components.Music: 8/10Trinity Seven sports a soundtrack that is infused with hard-rock, techno, funk, and some sweet-ass bass lines. It\'s actually quite good when listening to it even out of context. The music never seems like it\'s ""Just there"". It serves as a good sidekick during fight scenes and allows the audience to keep their eyes fixed to the screen without feeling distracted or irritated by overly-obnoxious music typically prevalent in action-sequences. On top of this, the opening song is pretty damn catchy and becomes an essential part of every episode that almost anyone would look forward to.Characters: 8/10The best part of this show really lies within the characters. Each one carries their own distinct personality and complements the protagonist almost perfectly. In harems, another common problem is how viewers will basically choose one girl that they want the protagonist to end up with. This results in hate bubbling up for the other girls and eventually ends up on some message-board like /a/ where everyone argues about who is ""Best girl"". In Trinity Seven, it\'s actually pretty hard to decide who you want to ""Win"". To be perfectly honest, I still don\'t know which girl would make the best pairing with Arata. Maybe Mira. Or Lilith. I don\'t know, just let me keep Levi to myself. Anyway, it\'s this aspect that makes the characters enjoyable all-around. One thing I would have liked to see though, would be character development for anyone outside of Arata. Everyone seems kind of snug within their own niche, not ever changing from who they already are.Art: 8/10At first, I didn\'t know how I felt about the visuals that were put in front of me in Trinity Seven. Three episodes later, I adored it. There was just that period of ""Mehhhh"" time it took for me to feel it out. I felt the same way about Madoka Magica when I watched that, and now I think it\'s one of the most beautiful shows I\'ve ever seen. Trinity Seven shouldn\'t really be compared to Madoka outside of the ""Girls with magical powers"" thing, but you probably understand what I mean when I say you might not like it at first. Just give it some time. I promise. In addition to the general artwork, character designs were unique and impressive. It appeared as if the artists actually put love and care into each one, treating them more as actual characters than curious teenage girls waiting to be taken advantage of after meeting a boy for the first time. Each one was extremely different from the others (Apart from Lieselotte and Selina, but you know...twins) and I never got tired of seeing them.Story: 8/10Trinity Seven has a solid story. Is it great? No, not by any means. But it\'s more than you\'ll normally find in this genre. The protagonist actually has a goal that he is constantly moving toward. The side-characters try their best to aid him in this endeavor. It just works out. There are periods where things seem bleak, but those periods are then counteracted by others that seem hopeful. Each episode actually goes somewhere, which is a feat that so many shows struggle with nowadays. The series even ends on a note that will allow for another season or two if season one sells well enough. Hell, I might even pick up manga one day if I get bored enough. Once again, solid storytelling by writer, Kenji Saitou, and director, Hiroshi Nishikiori.All in all, Trinity Seven is a very well-rounded harem/comedy with a few fight scenes thrown in for action and a story that actually goes somewhere. If you are a fan of fan-service, character design, or laughing, I would give it a try. It definitely surprised me and became an easy favorite for the year of 2014. physics and sends him skyrocketing across the galaxy. Trinity Seven is an atypical representation concerning this definition of ""Harem"".Kasuga Arata (Only dude pictured above) isn\'t your typical dense ""Omg I have no idea you want to bang me"" protagonist. This is where a lot of the charm Trinity Seven has to offer comes into play. We meet him as the world he resides in is being torn to shreds, ultimately ending humanity. In his final moments, his cousin hands him a necklace/grimoire-thingy (Before falling into a crevice opening up in the world) which contains a magical entity that will allow him to essentially re-shape the world on a journey to find that cousin. However, in order to do that, he must become acquainted with the ""Trinity Seven"" which is the name given to the seven magus females that all want to swallow his mana.But the cool thing about Trinity Seven is that it never really feels dull. It\'s predictable in a good way, which sounds weird at first -- but makes sense in context. You won\'t grow to hate the main character, which is a common flaw that harems typically encounter as they progress. This all culminates in one of the most surprisingly entertaining shows to come out of Fall 2014. In order to better illustrate this, let me break it up into a few key components.Music: 8/10Trinity Seven sports a soundtrack that is infused with hard-rock, techno, funk, and some sweet-ass bass lines. It\'s actually quite good when listening to it even out of context. The music never seems like it\'s ""Just there"". It serves as a good sidekick during fight scenes and allows the audience to keep their eyes fixed to the screen without feeling distracted or irritated by overly-obnoxious music typically prevalent in action-sequences. On top of this, the opening song is pretty damn catchy and becomes an essential part of every episode that almost anyone would look forward to.Characters: 8/10The best part of this show really lies within the characters. Each one carries their own distinct personality and complements the protagonist almost perfectly. In harems, another common problem is how viewers will basically choose one girl that they want the protagonist to end up with. This results in hate bubbling up for the other girls and eventually ends up on some message-board like /a/ where everyone argues about who is ""Best girl"". In Trinity Seven, it\'s actually pretty hard to decide who you want to ""Win"". To be perfectly honest, I still don\'t know which girl would make the best pairing with Arata. Maybe Mira. Or Lilith. I don\'t know, just let me keep Levi to myself. Anyway, it\'s this aspect that makes the characters enjoyable all-around. One thing I would have liked to see though, would be character development for anyone outside of Arata. Everyone seems kind of snug within their own niche, not ever changing from who they already are.Art: 8/10At first, I didn\'t know how I felt about the visuals that were put in front of me in Trinity Seven. Three episodes later, I adored it. There was just that period of ""Mehhhh"" time it took for me to feel it out. I felt the same way about Madoka Magica when I watched that, and now I think it\'s one of the most beautiful shows I\'ve ever seen. Trinity Seven shouldn\'t really be compared to Madoka outside of the ""Girls with magical powers"" thing, but you probably understand what I mean when I say you might not like it at first. Just give it some time. I promise. In addition to the general artwork, character designs were unique and impressive. It appeared as if the artists actually put love and care into each one, treating them more as actual characters than curious teenage girls waiting to be taken advantage of after meeting a boy for the first time. Each one was extremely different from the others (Apart from Lieselotte and Selina, but you know...twins) and I never got tired of seeing them.Story: 8/10Trinity Seven has a solid story. Is it great? No, not by any means. But it\'s more than you\'ll normally find in this genre. The protagonist actually has a goal that he is constantly moving toward. The side-characters try their best to aid him in this endeavor. It just works out. There are periods where things seem bleak, but those periods are then counteracted by others that seem hopeful. Each episode actually goes somewhere, which is a feat that so many shows struggle with nowadays. The series even ends on a note that will allow for another season or two if season one sells well enough. Hell, I might even pick up manga one day if I get bored enough.

While they almost always get pound in the typical accidental pervert seens. This one is a bit different, with the main character being more open and honest, and all the women bashing him in a more realistic manner it brings a more refreshing feel to this anime that is rarely seen. Story leaves out some info on what is going on from the get go. And your left to piece it together throughout the majority of the anime. With the plot left on the stove to...thicken as you go it keeps you intrigued as to why exactly everything is going on and by the end found myself wanting more. I would definitely appreciate a 2nd season. thicken as you go it keeps you intrigued as to why exactly everything is going on and by the end found myself wanting more. I would definitely appreciate a 2nd season.', 'In my short time of reviewing anime, I\'ve covered quite a few different types of harems. I\'ve done dramatic harems, reverse harems, and even harems that didn\'t start out as harems. However, I realized recently that I\'ve never done a review for just a regular old comedic harem, so I decided to pick one up for this season. Upon finishing the series, I realized that everything I want to say about it could pretty much apply to every other comedic harem I\'ve seen. So, aside from the specific anime I\'m covering today, consider this as...an appropriate substitute review for any other generic comedic harem you can think of (Rosario + Vampire, Highschool DxD, Infinite Stratos, Maken-ki!, etc.), as I rattle off the list of traits that this genre keeps using over and over and over again to make itself as bland and marketable as possible.1. Fantasy setting or heavy fantasy elements, usually involving magicWhile more traditional and realistic settings may have worked back in the heyday of harems like Love Hina, the incorporation of fantasy elements serves as a replacement for actually making the viewer believe that this type of romantic setup could occur in the first place. Additionally, the use of magic creates a plethora of possibilities for getting the female characters into situations of a lewd and nearly-naked nature, with very minimal effort on the part of the writer. For Trinity Seven, we end up with one of Arata\'s main powers being the ability to make people\'s clothes disappear, providing plenty of fan service fun.2. Story still manages to take place in a high school of some kindI\'m not sure what the exact percentage is of anime that take place in high school, but I\'m going to assume it\'s a relatively high number, and within the harem genre the reason for that is very simple: it attracts viewers who are currently in high school. Additionally, with Trinity Seven, we get bonus points added for the high school being an all-girls school (while it\'s never explicitly stated that this is the case, no other male students seem to appear in this school). This further allows for Arata to be given free reign over whatever love interest the series decides to throw in for our enjoyment.3. Actual story and magic lore is incredibly convoluted and pointlessFor obvious reasons, writers can\'t just get away with writing absolutely nothing but fan service moments, so of course there has to be some kind of story. However, writing an actual story would make it too difficult for the viewers to focus on those wonderfully-animated breasts you just shoved into frame [heavy-handed sarcasm], so the plot needs to be flimsy, shallow, and easily tradable with any other generic plot. Every magic term in Trinity Seven is practically thrown in your face one after another with little more than a one-sentence description of what it actually does. That didn\'t really matter though, because I couldn\'t even count the times where I just flat-out looked away from the screen for a minute or so and then turned back to realize that absolutely nothing has happened other than some more flashy magic terminology and a panty shot.4. Random climactic battle at the end of the series...yeah that\'s just kind of a thing I guess. I suppose they have to at least pretend that they\'re putting some kind of effort into their writing at the end of the series.5. Always, ALWAYS leave room for a second seasonThe harem genre is surprisingly easy to market and sell to viewers, so it\'s important to keep the money train going until no one shows any interest in your specific series anymore.6. Main character has some kind of power that no one else hasTo be fair, this is a trait that\'s common even outside the harem genre, but within harems it adds something entirely different. With an action series, being the only one with a certain power or ability makes you humanity\'s last hope for survival. In a harem, it makes you an object of desire. Of course all the ladies want to jump your bones; you\'re the only person here who has this super awesome power. In the case of Trinity Seven, Arata is the ""Demon Lord Candidate"" who has the potential to turn into the Demon Lord, one of the most powerful beings in the world. Another important note is that the power in question is incredibly generic and normally just equates to ""I\'m stronger than everyone else because reasons.""7. Main character is either overtly perverted or a shy nice guy (who\'s still incredibly perverted on the inside), but is also incredibly nobleAgain, to be fair to Trinity Seven, Arata certainly falls into the former category, and he becomes so blatant with his perversity that it\'s almost hard to not like him for it (almost being the important word there). As for the nobility aspects, it plays into why the girls fall for him in the first place. I mean sure he\'s super perverted but he\'s just this super nice guy that I can rely on underneath all of that [more heavy-handed sarcasm]. Everything about a harem is designed to make the main male character look awesome, and Trinity Seven certainly doesn\'t miss its mark.8. Female characters have no depth other than their assigned archetypesWhen you have this many female love interests on your cast, it\'s nearly impossible to give them enough characterization to make them feel fleshed-out while still finding time for fan service moments, so the best course of action is to flood your series with as many archetypes as you can: the childhood friend (Hijiri), the plain Jane (Lilith), the loli (Grimoire), the tsundere (Mira), the kooky one (Levi), the childish one (Yui), the tomboy (Akio), ad nauseam.9. Primary love interest is as bland as a piece of notebook paperIf the love interest that the main character is eventually going to end up with actually has a personality, the writers run the risk of the viewers not enjoying that specific archetype, so it\'s always best to choose the one with the least amount of personality possible (and also the biggest cup size). Of course, the two characters in question will never actually reach the point where they could be considered to be in a relationship. I mean lord forbid that you actually do something romantically interesting with your characters.10. All animation budget goes towards character designs and boob physicsThe fan service is the main selling point of a harem, so it\'s absolutely vital that this is achieved, often at the cost of the rest of the animation looking terrible. Studio Seven Arcs knows this very well and gave us exactly that. While the action in Trinity Seven wasn\'t completely awful, the particle and light effects certainly weren\'t anything worthy of praise, and backgrounds and moving objects were often rendered in the most eye-jarring 3D I\'ve seen in a long time.11. Fan service out the wazooThis one doesn\'t really need much explanation. You\'re certainly not watching this because the romance is so unbelievably captivating.12. Soundtrack occupies the background for the majority of the anime\'s run timeI honestly can\'t even think of a single note from this soundtrack off the top of my head right now, and I just finished the last episode about an hour ago. In this case, the soundtrack was composed by Technoboys Pulcraft Green-Fund (Witch Craft Works), and I wouldn\'t necessarily blame them for the blandness of the soundtrack because this is a harem after all, and there isn\'t exactly a long list of standout harem soundtracks.Overall, I do think that anime viewers should experience a simple comedic harem at least once, but Trinity Seven certainly isn\'t the one I would recommend as an introduction to the genre. an appropriate substitute review for any other generic comedic harem you can think of (Rosario + Vampire, Highschool DxD, Infinite Stratos, Maken-ki!, etc.), as I rattle off the list of traits that this genre keeps using over and over and over again to make itself as bland and marketable as possible.1.

I mean it\'s very decent anime, but it\'s not good enough to make you start liking ecchi or something. Anyway, for those who have intention of going for this one, let me encourage you. I won\'t spoil anything.Story: 8/10A guy whose cousin disappeared one day decided to learn magic to get her back. Then he went to a magic school, where he met the Trinity Seven AND where his real story began... To be honest, the story is not really...impressive. It has some flaws, it\'s weird, it doesn\'t really have anything outstanding.

I don't even know why I went all the way watching it to the end. Still, its an interesting experience.Even though its just something along the lines of 'Whew, now I really can point my finger on an anime that is actually... bad.'Back to serious mode. Obviously I'm still going to be fair with this anime.First of all, storywise. What does this anime have in store for us?The mainstory is reasonable simple and catchy....Our MC Arata looses  his cousin Hijiri to a magical phenomenom. So far so well. Thats nothing too bad, it explains what we should have to expect for the next episodes. But why do I dislike the story so much then? Simple. That phenomenom is called 'Breakdown Phenomenom' and is just the first of billions of mechanics which is fired in your face with the speed of a minigun and the power of a railgun. Followed up by Themas and some latin words, sudden english imputs like Limit Breaks, irish legends (Brioriac and Fragrach), etc. The setting of this anime just sucks so hard. Nothing really gets explained in a roundabout way, and even after 12 episodes the only thing I got is that the thema is supposedly the exact opposite to your character. But its not like this is all which sucks storywise. The story is mainly a gauntlet of boobsfondling scenes, slice of life, and obvious plottwists. Just awfully done.So overall, I rated the story 3/10.Next are the artworks. The character designs aren't too bad, even though their colors are a bit pale. Also, I always got annoyed with their faces. They look mostly emotionless, and if you leave away the hairstyles, identical. The backgrounds are no awardwinners either. They are good enough to stand their ground. They aren't too sharp, but are rather colorful. A strange contrast to the grayish-pale characters. Lastly the battlescenes. Swordattacks are the usual black-screen/cut style ones. Uhh... really good, I guess? Nope. The magic isn't that much better, mostly laserbeams and glowing stuff and such.Which brings me to 5/10 for the Artworks.The sound is the best part of Trinity Seven. By far. Lets start with the voice actors. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu aka. Kirito returns. Matsuoka-san isn't new to ecchi by any means, as he also voiced the MC of Mangaka-san to Assist-san to. His performance is as good as ever. The rest of the cast isn't really memorable, but they depicted their characters good enough. The OSTs of Trinity Seven on the other hand were mediocre. As for battle soundtracks we have some mechanical/techno/futuristic kind of music, which reminds me of a worse version of Xenoblade's Mechanical rhythm. The rest of the time the BGM fits the situation without being memorable.Finally the OP/ED. Seven Doors by ZAQ is a fairly good song, which made it into my 2014 favorites. It got me hyped up for the following 20 minutes and is one of the sole reasons I continued to watch.7/10 for sounds.Finally we arrived at Trinity Sevens' achilles heel. The characters.If you wonder what exactly is bad about them? Probably everything.The Initial character designs are rather flat. None of the characters feel fresh or new. I've seen not completely dense MCs before, and the rest of the Trinity Seven reeks of stereotypes.I don't even remember whether the girls have backgroundstories or not. As for the interactions between the characters, those aren't any better. Most of the slice of life parts circle around groping boobs, or how lewd Arata is. Whew. Amazing... Finally, the character development. Basically the females all fell for Arata. Thats all the development I got. Thats rather disappointing.For the last of the obejective categories I go with 4/10.And now the last one. The enjoyment.Well, you can see on my profile how I rate enjoyment. So lets just say 3/10.Overall 4/10.A just below average harem anime with more potential than turnout.The production values are rather high, but the execution of the plot, the setting, as well the characters are rather bad.Feedback is appreciated, as usual.

Executing my Thema: Circumspicio!  What better way to introduce Trinity Seven, a series I\'ve personally dubbed one of the best entries in the harem genre, than an introduction like that?Story (7.88/10):  The story of trinity seven is as follows.  A boy by the name of Arata finds himself in his normal life.  Waking up with his normal cousin making him breakfast, his normal walk to school, and even his normal everyday boob grab.  But, soon, he notices something...different.  The world around him has no one else nearby.  There are no...people, and he notices that the sun is a malicious black.  Then, he gets threatened by a girl with a rifle saying to him about something called a breakdown phenomenon, and the fact that HE himself has caused it with his magic.  And from that point forward, Arata\'s life of leisure changes as he delves himself into the world of magic and gets to know the seven most powerful mages in the world, the Trinity Seven.Trinity seven is a very interesting show.  The best way to sum the show up in a few words is ""Harem with a Plot.""  What makes Trinity Seven so much more different than other harem shows is the fact that the show itself does follow a chronological order of events.  It doesn\'t use ecchi as the ""audience bringer"" (although, there are enough ecchi moments to fill up two whole episode slots), and it does follow a proper plot, following Arata as he goes through his new life as a mage with the Trinity Seven.Another thing that makes the show very unique is its brand of magic.  Like every other supernatural magic show, Trinity Seven boasts its own explanation for the idea of magic which is honestly one of the best points of the show.  This is due to the fact that the magic for the show is heavily integrated into the show\'s plot, giving explanation along the way for viewers.  But depending on the viewer, it can get a little difficult to understand due to the heavily thrown out terms that one must learn in order to fully enjoy this show.  (Things like macros, Themas, etc.)In addition, Trinity seven hosts its own brand of comedy which is...well, subjective.  (It\'s harem, what do you expect?)  The entire show is littered with all sorts of innuendos, sexual suggestions, and boob grabbing.  Lots and lots of boob grabbing.  What makes this such a refreshing brand of comedy is just how free the characters are.  Many characters play along with the whole ecchi thing rather than being all embarrassed and shy, which makes the situations not just a standard ecchi moment, but a rather funny one.  In addition, the show\'s perverted nature rolls with the show and to my knowledge, hasn\'t made the show any less quality than it is from my viewpoint.  That being said, the show does have many, and I mean MANY scenes like this (you can expect one every five minutes of watching this show.) and can get distracting and put people off due to its sheer amount, as well as sometimes its absurdity.  (Like the all-powerful stripping magic.)Overall though, this show was a very faithful adaptation to the manga that this was based on.  The pacing was decent enough so that the viewer wouldn\'t get left behind on anything that was going on, and the story while still harem-related, followed events that really didn\'t have to do with a generic harem show, making the show as a whole, surprisingly good.  But while the show itself proves to be good, it does lack in a lot of explanation at the end.  There are many questions that (unless you\'ve read the manga) become left unanswered and really require this show to have a second season in order to continue the story, because this show ends on a cliffhanger that at the end of the day, doesn\'t please anyone.  (Cause really, the real story of Trinity seven only JUST started with the end of the last episode)Overview:+  Harem with Plot   (you don\'t really see many of these.)+  Good story telling+  Decent pacing+/-  Interesting concept of magic  (Can ruin viewing experience if you don\'t quite get it.)+/-  Perverted comedy that works in conjunction with the show   (ruins viewing experience if you don\'t like ecchi-   Cliffhanger endingCharacters (8.11/10):  Now, onto the real high points of Trinity Seven, the characters.Kasuga Arata is the main protagonist/harem master of this series.  Now, what would we expect from a harem series from past experiences?  A guy with way too much luck having 3+ girls fall for him while being super nice and not noticing their feelings at all?  No!  Compared to many other harem protagonists, Arata is not a simple plot device, but rather has a personality of his own.  (Take that, Ichika.)  As something of a complete opposite to the normal harem protagonist, Arata has an extremely perverted personality, taking up any offers that the Trinity seven gives, and making any given perverted moment into a hilarious moment via monologue usually ending with ""Thanks for the Feast""; not to mention, he is aware of the fact that some of the girls actually like him romantically.  As a result, Arata truly becomes a unique character because of how he reacts to different situations he\'s put in, as well as how much he breaks away from what we anime viewers know of the generic harem protagonist.  He\'s not afraid to try out something new in terms of magic (or girls) and he really shows motivation for the goal that he\'s put in front of himself.And then we have the Trinity Seven.  Since they all account for the title of best girl, I\'ll try and summarize them the best I can in a few short words with a couple side notes for some of them.Lilith = Large chested tsundere that is a teacher and sort of the ""main girl"".  (stick in the mud)Arin = Kuudere girl that proclaims herself as Arata\'s wifeLevi = The ninja girl that is just as perverted as Arata is, making many suggestive suggestions.Yui = The big-chested loli Imouto character that has a crush on Arata.   (My personal favorite)Mira = The head of the disciplinary committee that\'s just a bit too strict. (Also a stick in the mud.)Akio = The big sister character that often laughs at Arata\'s constant perverted ancticsLiese = The dark horse of the Trinity Seven with the personality of an alluring mistress.  (According to Arata, has the nicest legs.)The trinity seven is the show\'s core characters, with the entire plot revolving around Arata associating with these seven girls.  What gives the show a plus, as well as a negative is character development.  Some of these girls do have some backstory given to them.  Why they are a member of the trinity seven, what are their motives, and who they are as a person.  As a negative, they don\'t really do this to many of the girls, leading to some of the girls being a bit fleshed out, while other still stay in their one-note, but still enjoyable personalities.As for side characters, the show has a wide host of different ones that get varying screentime, such as the Astil Codex Grimoire, the perverted headmaster, Arata\'s cousin Hijiri, and Selina.  These side characters for the most part are quite memorable.  They share similar traits to the main cast of being more unique and memorable than other characters previously seen before.  That being said, you don\'t really get to know TOO much about them, and they relatively stay in the role of providing conflict, or adding to the perverted moments of the series.Overview:+  FANTASTIC Harem MC+  Great Harem girls+/-  Character development is uneven amongst characters+/-  Side characters really only serve one of two purposesArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10):  The art for Trinity seven is done in a way that I feel really fits the show.  The show is drawn in a sort of darker gradient where the characters don\'t look as bright as other magic shows, but more as a more sinister way of expression, reflecting on the dark ideals and powers that the magic in this show really holds.In addition, character design is done relatively well, with the characters looking rather nice from scene to scene with little fluctuation between animated quality.  In addition, the magic circles used in this series are fantastically done with a great amount of detail done to them to make them aesthetically pleasing.Now, Ecchi.  The Ecchi in this show is overdone, in simple sense.  Very often, you will see boobs.  You will see clothes literally disintegrate off of females, and you will see pantsu, sexy poses, and faces that make the characters look like that they\'re in heat.  But what makes the ecchi in those show so memorable is the fact that it just looks so natural.  There are no insane dramatic closeups on the characters boobs really any of the ecchi scenes, and because the anime doesn\'t go out of its way to completely plaster the screen with breasts, the ecchi honestly doesn\'t feel as distracting as it could\'ve been.  (Ecchi is still VERY prominent, so beware.)As for music, the show hosts a very electronic sounding soundtrack, with its opening being a good example of what the music is going to be like.  It\'s a very interesting genre of music to use for the series, and it certainly is quite memorable.  In addition, the show has three separate endings that all use the similar electronic sound to it, whilst having different feels and emotions for each one.Overview:+  Good animation that fits the show\'s style+  Good music+/-  Cleverly done ecchi  (Can still be distracting if you don\'t like ecchi)Personal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  Yeah, I like this show, maybe too much might I add.  But I digress.  Trinity Seven is a perfect mix for someone like me.  It has plot, it has a great and very memorable main character, and oh so greatly done ecchi.  From the viewpoint someone who basically just watches harem, this is a great show.Did I like this show?Yes.  Very much so.  It combined every aspect of what I find in a good show in addition to the idea of harem.  A good first episode to hook in the viewer, a good and easy to follow plot with chronological events, and explanation for at least most of the plot while leaving a little bit of mystery.  The aesthetics were also very well done, and I congratulate the creators for making a show that looked both brooding and fun at the same time.What didn\'t I like about this show?For one thing, it ended.  I want more trinity seven.  Aside from that, the show really didn\'t tie up any of the loose ends it made towards the end.  While the anime does follow the manga to the letter, the reality is the fact that, as a downfall, the anime\'s story is incomplete due to it following only about 30 or so chapters of the manga.Would I recommend this show?If you\'re a harem lover like me and sick and tired of harem MC\'s, or would want to see a show that breaks everything you knew about harem shows, than this show is for you!  Until next time, Magic King Candidate Xadon, OUT!Overall Score: 7.85/10 people, and he notices that the sun is a malicious black.  Then, he gets threatened by a girl with a rifle saying to him about something called a breakdown phenomenon, and the fact that HE himself has caused it with his magic.  And from that point forward, Arata\'s life of leisure changes as he delves himself into the world of magic and gets to know the seven most powerful mages in the world, the Trinity Seven.Trinity seven is a very interesting show.  The best way to sum the show up in a few words is ""Harem with a Plot.""  What makes Trinity Seven so much more different than other harem shows is the fact that the show itself does follow a chronological order of events.  It doesn\'t use ecchi as the ""audience bringer"" (although, there are enough ecchi moments to fill up two whole episode slots), and it does follow a proper plot, following Arata as he goes through his new life as a mage with the Trinity Seven.Another thing that makes the show very unique is its brand of magic.  Like every other supernatural magic show, Trinity Seven boasts its own explanation for the idea of magic which is honestly one of the best points of the show.  This is due to the fact that the magic for the show is heavily integrated into the show\'s plot, giving explanation along the way for viewers.  But depending on the viewer, it can get a little difficult to understand due to the heavily thrown out terms that one must learn in order to fully enjoy this show.  (Things like macros, Themas, etc.)In addition, Trinity seven hosts its own brand of comedy which is...well, subjective.  (It\'s harem, what do you expect?)  The entire show is littered with all sorts of innuendos, sexual suggestions, and boob grabbing.  Lots and lots of boob grabbing.  What makes this such a refreshing brand of comedy is just how free the characters are.  Many characters play along with the whole ecchi thing rather than being all embarrassed and shy, which makes the situations not just a standard ecchi moment, but a rather funny one.  In addition, the show\'s perverted nature rolls with the show and to my knowledge, hasn\'t made the show any less quality than it is from my viewpoint.  That being said, the show does have many, and I mean MANY scenes like this (you can expect one every five minutes of watching this show.) and can get distracting and put people off due to its sheer amount, as well as sometimes its absurdity.

Until next time, Magic King Candidate Xadon, OUT!Overall Score: 7.85/10', 'I\'m backwards, so overall first: 8Coming into the show, you should know first off that this is an ecchi/harem/romance comedy with a sometimes serious aura to push the story along when necessary. If fanservice bothers you, Trinity Seven isn\'t for you, plain and simple. If that\'s part of the fun for you, then prepare to be along on a trip to Sexy Japanese Hogwarts.Story: 7.5 (rounds down to 7, more on that later)Continuing the Harry Potter analogy: MC Arata gets his life turned upside down when he finds out that there is INDEED magic in his world, and it\'s about to change his life......or at least introduce him to some beautiful new lady friends.The first section feels a bit disjointed, but it\'s mostly about character building. From about the halfway point on, it\'s pretty easy to tell where the plot is going, but that\'s not to say you can\'t have fun on the way there. The pacing can be a bit inconsistent, but again, from the midpoint on, it stabilized.Nothing groundbreaking here, a fairly simple setup of the oft seen ""I must rescue the one i love"", but with a couple of twists to keep it fresh.Art: 7There are a couple of moments I found really cool where they used real life photography with animation on top of it- had not seen that before. Otherwise, it just looks like your everyday normal anime. Character art is fine, and the action sequences are well animated, but nothing that will blow you away. (I compare things to Sword Art Online, which i find to be incredible well animated)Sound: 7The intro and four (count \'em) ending themes are all appropriately energetic and catchy. Not much to say hereCharacters: 9This is the meat of the show: the characters. You can\'t have a harem without breaking a few eggs, right? (woops, wrong idiom)MC Arata isn\'t a blockhead moron. He knows what he wants, just not how to do it. He\'s also not afraid to get his hands dirty.The titular Trinity Seven are a group of (all female) skilled mages who are cream of the crop in their particular area of study. They are varied, and fun, and definitely memorable. They aren\'t all introduced at once, so you get some time to know them before they all show up. I had no trouble remembering or telling them all apart, even though it felt like they introduced someone new every episode. The villains are varied, but I felt like they were rushed a little (in terms of development), but it is a 13 episode show, so not much time to work with.They are all motivated in their own ways, and each one has a reason to be there besides checking off boxes in the harem trope *yawn*. Each member plays their part: they do it with style and a healthy dose of sexiness, or tsundere, your pick.Enjoyment: 8One of the absolute best parts of the show (for me, the only person whose opinion matters) was the 4th wall destroying humor. I love self aware comedy, and Trinity Seven delivers with a sledgehammer. Arata is also (from what i understand of harems, this is uncommon) an incorrigible pervert, and thrives in the intensely tense estrogen filled environment into which he\'s thrown (sometimes with the help of a friend). I never found that the show took the scandalous content too far- it never devolves into anything porn-like- strictly pg-13.Final thoughts:Fun anime, and after going back and reading the manga, it follows it INCREDIBLY closely, which I thought was excellent. Seven Days took a fun little product, added some extra polish and a bit of movement to the tv screen, and here we are.

Kasuga, Arata and the trinity seven, mostly Arata's point of view in my opinion. He's out on a quest to get his cousin back after he destroys his home town. And his cousin (?) unknowingly doing so though. Because a circle of fate has chosen him to be a demon lord candidate.ART 10/10The art is is amazing! I love every bit of it, follows the art of the manga exactly. There are only a couple of anime I've seen that copy the art style of the manga. So it gets...a full 10.SOUND 10/10High quality sound, amazing songs. Both OPs are very nice and catchy.CHARACTER 8/10My favorite part of the review.

They change for the better, each and every one of them have there own unique personality that you grow to love in these 12 episode.

Kinda typical but he's acknowledging them one by one.ENJOYMENT 10/10There isn't much to say here as all I gotta say is you MUST read the manga first and catch up on that. Before watching the anime, otherwise I'm 100% certain your opinion on it will just be a cool MC with a typical harem. The developments in the manga are something of a masterpiece. And the anime does that very well to incorporate that also.OVERALL 9/10As for who he gets with it's going to be a harem ending. Sadly... but the relations he develops with each one is an adventure on it's own. If more harems were like this people wouldn't hate harems so much.

I find that although I will enjoy them, I\'m not fully absorbed in the world and plot. However, there were a couple things about Trinity Seven that just made it feel different.First, we have the world in which the series takes place. This is usually one of the things that separates an individual harem from another. Trinity Seven had a unique magic system that was quite different even to someone who has read, watched, or played material from thousands of fantasy worlds. The world details started to interest me, which was the...first thing that pushed Trinity Seven beyond a simple harem.Next, we have the characters. The MC was fundamentally different from the stereotypical harem MC. He isn\'t dense in any way I can think of, and therefore would be more easily described as a polar opposite. With the main heroines, you get a nice mix of new and interesting, along with some really well used cliches. More then once, the other heroines poke fun at the tsunderes and clearly emphasize the important personality aspects of each character (""Oh, so I see you have entered dere mode!""). Some of the characters even have complex relations with other characters that allow us to see another side of them. A clear example is seen when Mira explains her relationship with Akio.Finally, alongside these key factors, we are also provided with some small extras. Trinity Seven also included one of my favourite OPs of the Fall 2014 season, and some really humourous scenes and quotes that I will remember long after finishing the series.Overall, I found this series to be very well done. It stands out in the world of harems, which is quite a feat on it\'s own. first thing that pushed Trinity Seven beyond a simple harem.Next, we have the characters.

I\'ve never really been interested in harems, but this show had me intrigued. The reason i originally started watching it is because of the art style. It\'s very unique and i thought it looked pretty awesome. The plot of the story is pretty good, although not great. The show seems to focus on the character interactions more than the actual plot. I like the characters, especially Arata, seeing as he takes charge and isn\'t afraid to do what he wants. He\'s pervy and there\'s a lot...of fan service throughout the series.

Now I can review it!Despite how I enjoyed so very much, I have to give this anime some tough love.Here we go:STORY:In the first few episodes of the anime, it jumped around like nobody\'s business! Not as bad or as far as Baccano, so be at ease, but it was there and can confuse viewers. It leaps from and goes back to different points in time. Not like a flashback, but a rearranging of scenes.Instead of getting from A to B, you see part of B at first, go back to A to explain B, then jump back to B....Those of you who weren\'t caught up in the humor of the anime definitely raised an eyebrow.The start of the story itself was rushed and generic to a degree, but afterwards you can feel how the episodes pretty much felt like fillers before leading up to a final battle and ending of the series. The humor, characters, and ecchi scenes held me over to a degree, but I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head saying things like, ""When are we going to get on with the rest of the story?"" I hate to say I felt that form an anime I had fun with, but it\'s the truth.The anime can easily be compared to a twinkie with chocolate chips. You\'re wading through the fluff and filler, in order to reach the meaningful progression (the chocolate chips).Now for the anime played out. Oh god, how can I explain it so you can understand what\'s going on.We start off with our main character, Kasuga, Arata, waking up from a dream foretelling the viewers that he and a mystery girl will struggle to reach one another but can\'t. And before the two can grasp each others hands, he wakes up to find himself grasping said mystery girl\'s breast.After the usual morning skit with the mystery girl, Hijiri Kasuga, and showing off how close the two cousins are, they are off to school. Along the way, theirs another mystery girl who warns him and threatens to kill him.Aside from the death threat, the story seems to be come off as the usual anime in a town. But during the schools break time, our main character notices that the sun is black and misty, and his cousin turned out to be a fake after some seductive and creepy words as she straddled him! At this time, the death threat mystery girl appears, and explains that the world around him was ""created"" by our main character Arata. Once Arata remembers that the real Hijiri vanished right before him, and the fake Hijiri informs him that the real Hijiri is still alive, he immediately is able to get into a Magic Academy because wants to become a mage so he can learn how to get his cousin back.That\'s the jest of it, I left out some details but nothing you can\'t watch for yourself. It turns and twists, but I\'ll leave that for you guys to happen upon.ART:It combines a 3D environment, with 2D animation. I found this combination charming, and the inside of the Magic Academy to have interesting designs. But in some cases it was puzzling to look at. For example not in all cases but in some cases where the 2D Characters would walk along the 3D ground, it would make the 3D environment seem out of place. I quickly got used to it though, and it throw me off when action scenes came around.The characters design seemed to try and give a unique look to people, but the people looked d a bit off at first. Such as an oval shape glare at the bottom of the eyes of all characters. It made me think that quite a few people were watery or teary eyed, but that was just part of the design.I know how hard it is to apply something new to anime in regard to design, as viewers may want more of the same, so I commend the series for approaching art in its own way.The animation never seemed to miss a beat. It surprisingly kept up with the frames of the opening themes animation. Great detail and attention their.Surprisingly enough, the characters who were well endowed didn\'t have breasts, butts, or legs shining through clothing, or eating the clothing. The shining was saved and given in doses along side fanservice. I commend any anime who knows when to hold back on everything being oiled up for the sake of eye candy.SOUND:I loved the opening theme, but it took me sometime to get used to the closing themes. It\'s all good though, great choices in songs.The regular music that played throughout the anime was refreshing and imersing. It had tracks that hinted techno, orchestra/piano/stringed instruments, or just a combination of the two. And I\'m a sucker for classical music that plays well with animation.It had interesting and cool sound effects for spells being cased and used, and great voice acting from memorable voices. I think I recognized Arata\'s voice actor as the same person who played as Kirito from SAO.With pleasant surprises every, and good immersion, this anime isn\'t lacking in sound.CHARACTER:The first thing I noticed, is how our main character is very lively. He copes well with just about all situations and jokes from the characters around him, his voice actor made him instantly loveable and memorable. Just like the headmaster of the academy.Not all the girls are fodder that fall in love for the main character after an episode or three, they have their own personalities, opinions, and reactions to the main character! I was floored by this, but not so much to not realize how generic some of them were, ok?It\'s hard to not call them generic when there\'s the easily embarrassed sex symbol, the monotone girl who claims the main character as her husband, the big breasted Loli who claims the main character as her Onii-san, the TWINS with one who acts like the biggest fan/journalist and one showing off her tits and her intentions in the most sexual way she can, and the girl who\'s judgmental of the main character until she\'s forced to get to know him.The only unique girls I came across, was the rare rough neck girl who\'s tall and strong enough to break walls, who makes jokes, and doesn\'t act seductively AT ALL.And the seductive ninja girl who makes sexy jokes with only a few of the main girls, and the main character.But with all this said, these characters make the anime fun and rewatchable.ENJOYMENT:There\'s hardly anything I didn\'t enjoy from the anime.The bold main character who\'s a refreshing breeze in this anime world led by either either cry babies, accidental perverts who get their butts kicked left and right, or dopey goof-balls.A harem that feels alive, and not slaves to the plot.The fanservice, and action.It\'s like an abridged parody, how hilarious this anime is.But how generic, and lacking it is when it comes to story progression, is a painful blister that hurts when touched. Even if it only has 12 episodes to introduce 7 main characters to a MAIN-main character.OVERALL:With tough love, I give Trinity Seven:A 6 out of 10.It\'s a gosh darn waste! The story doesn\'t suck, it\'s just the fluff standing between me and meaningful story progression.""I would get you there, but let\'s go here and work our way to where you want to be."" ""I\'ll give you the information you\'re looking for, but... listen to me sing on stage, then buy me a drink.""I don\'t like having to wait for the story to continue. I had a wonderful time getting to where I needed to be over time instead of just getting their quickly, I love your song and I don\'t mind buying you a drink, but I can only sit and take so many detours and listen to so many songs so many times before it feels like I\'m playing a waiting game.Maybe the series needed to save up in order to make a 24 episode series. Because it\'s not like I want things taken out of the anime. Instead, I wanted story progression added into it. Balance out the chocolate chips with the fluff and cream. Make a kick butt twinkie anime. A twinkie anime that\'s made with everything enriched, and not with something set aside to hail the mindless hordes only in it for the fanservice.That said, this anime is a good buy. Granted the makers look up feed back, and improve any other work they put out. I\'d love to go to find other people and talk about the anime, or look up fan art. Because the enjoyment is there, the anticipation is there, but not the overall anime.And until it is, let\'s meet up at another review. Those of you who weren\'t caught up in the humor of the anime definitely raised an eyebrow.The start of the story itself was rushed and generic to a degree, but afterwards you can feel how the episodes pretty much felt like fillers before leading up to a final battle and ending of the series. The humor, characters, and ecchi scenes held me over to a degree, but I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head saying things like, ""When are we going to get on with the rest of the story?"" I hate to say I felt that form an anime I had fun with, but it\'s the truth.The anime can easily be compared to a twinkie with chocolate chips. You\'re wading through the fluff and filler, in order to reach the meaningful progression (the chocolate chips).Now for the anime played out. Oh god, how can I explain it so you can understand what\'s going on.We start off with our main character, Kasuga, Arata, waking up from a dream foretelling the viewers that he and a mystery girl will struggle to reach one another but can\'t.

Trinity Seven looked unfamiliar and not-so interesting for me to watch at first, and also, I hadn\'t known much about the studio producing the anime, Seven Arcs. But I was impressed by what it has shown for the past 12 weeks.Looking at the poster, you would known that the anime is going to be a harem in a magic school. While we already encountered many magic (and sometimes having a lot of female characters in the cast) anime, this is definitely going to stand out among the rest this year. The story started in a typical day for...Arata, living with his childhood friend Hijiri. With the sudden appearance of a magician, later a while, he found out something weird. He learnt that the town they lived was destroyed by a phenomenon and so a grimorie given by Hijiri before disappearing reconstructed it. The magician, Lilith, then invites him to Royal Biblia Academy where he has a goal to save Hijiri. But to do, he has to become a demon lord and gather the Trinity Seven.Sure, big words and seemingly generic story. But the way the anime executes the setting is great. Observing the timeline of this story is like piecing to make a puzzle. As the story progresses, more characters are introduced and usually they take their time in the episode to explain the audience about themselves and perhaps about this magic they possess. Yet again, it has a lot of explanation which you can either get confused of or forget along the way. Eventually, you can get some idea of it unless you are watching it for the fan-service. Each mage has magic based on their thema (theme) and basically they are different types of magic spells to their own desire.How the story closes leaves a sweet feeling. I really don\'t know how the story can continue, since I felt that everything is so clear for me already.Cramming many different types of genres into one story can sometimes be a trainwreck. Trinity Seven tries to balance several of them - action, comedy, ecchi, fantasy, romance and harem. That\'s a lot. The comedy is funny at times through characters\' interaction. There\'s some action included with battles between the opponents. The fan-service is definitely too much and sometimes repetitive, and it isn\'t as much as I expected when watching the first episode. The romance and harem aspects aren\'t fully explored, but there are crushes towards Arata from the characters. Indeed, some relationships develop along the way. In the end, as you can see, it\'s really hard to maintain, but I don\'t think this has ruined the anime at all. Of course, this depends on whether you like these genres, or you expected them.The Trinity Seven team is an interesting set of characters. It takes time to introduce them one by one and I say that I\'m satisfied how the story introduces the characters well with whatever character they have in themselves. I heard that they are based of the ""Seven Deadly Sins"", although I don\'t recall it being mentioned in the anime. Still, it is a nice linkage.It\'s true to say that you can expect some harem tropes in them. And unfortunately the anime didn\'t go perfectly in this section. Sure, I said they are an interesting bunch, but that depends on themselves. The girls are interesting because of how they act, but a very few has good development because of the interactions between themselves and Arata. Sometimes, a few of the them looked left out from the rest. But nevertheless, some of the characters also display some different emotions too.As for Arata himself, I must give extra points for his attitude. Never-ever dense, this main character knows how to interact, be it in a fan-service or an intense battle situation. From start to end, he knows what he wanted and how to achieve it. Thanks to the girls that helped along the way, he has a lovely development I like to see. Sure, he has his cute side as well - once in a while he feels embarrassed, and as well as having some deep thoughts over things like Hijiri.The opponents against the Trinity Seven are cool but doesn\'t have a wide character and development, possibly due to the time of their introduction.Trinity Seven\'s art isn\'t quite unique. The colour palette used for everything looks dull in some places. While some sceneries look great, the others look plain and boring. It is due to the fact that there\'s not much lively atmosphere in many of these sceneries. There are CGI used in some interior sceneries for the movement of the camera panning, and I feel it feels nice with the 2D moving animation most of the time. The visual effects are great. Magic circles, sparks flying and explosions feel so well-done. Fighting animation seems fair enough, but yet again there\'s not really much fight scenes that involve punching. Some battles have this nice impact that leaves a nice finish.The character designs are weirdly good. Their body shapes are fine but I feel that the character designs in the manga looked better, maybe because of more realistic details. Some faces might look weird but you will get used to it soon. The facial expressions vary and even from a multi-genre anime, I like how they show the feelings of the characters, either comedic or not.ZAQ decides to sing another single. If you know her by now, most of the songs have a different feel and style. Seven Doors has an epic rock feel that gets into the groove of Trinity Seven, along with her great voice that matches along the instrumental. It\'s definitely one that can stand out from the rest of openings in this season. Meanwhile, the anime has four songs of different styles as well. Each are sung by a pair of voice actresses that their characters are well-related. Overall, I enjoyed all but one but I love to see a nice variety of this.The background music has a nice take over the battle scenes, generating some hype and action that blends well. Other scenes are fine as well. Besides, its main genre focus is techno (electronic) music. The voice acting is done well, it helps to match whatever the character is acting or saying. I love to see some voice actresses acting out of their usual acting. One example is Yumi that voices Takane from iDOLM@STER, voices Lilith. And we all know who voiced Arata. Yoshitsugu is very famous and voiced many different characters, but it\'s good that he keeps it to Arata\'s character for the anime.I really can\'t say if this is a recommendation for everyone, but I personally enjoyed whatever Trinity Seven has offered. There may have been a lot of explanation to go through or maybe you can\'t stand a lot of fan-service, but I guess I\'m happy to see that this generic setting is executed well.I don\'t mind continuing the manga after the anime, and I don\'t know if we\'re getting a second season or not. There\'s still an OVA, so it\'s worth catching it for a fix of never-dense main character with his interestingly weird harem. Arata, living with his childhood friend Hijiri.

While at the start, i felt this just got in the way, it did (unfortunately) turn out to be slightly relevant during some later episodes.Still i WOULDN\'T say that ""it\'s all about Harem"", as there really is a...serious story to be told. I loved the plot twists, the suspense, and the realizations. Though, it\'s all presented in an ""immediate scope"" - meaning that there\'s no time for any additional character development, or details that could make it easier to become better acquainted with the Trinity Seven.It seems that at times, particularly near the start - they tried to rectify this, with a slower pace: which did help induce a definite sense of wonder and mystery when i begun watching.Though, with the added pressure of only 12 episodes to tell a story worthy of a much larger anime title, like a kid drawing ""bubble letters"", it seemed that after the half way mark, they were running out of space, and so a significant amount of content had to be lost in order to convey the bare bones of the story.If you\'re planning to watch as a thriller, then this really does do action, suspense, AND PLOT TWISTS!- rather well.

He isn\'t dumb as a sack of bricks, is perverted and very honest about it and often jokes about it when in an embarrassing situation which IMO is a MAJOR + that this kind of genre seems to lack.There is lot of ecchi, lot of ""accidental"" boobs touching but its of a different caliber than in other anime. Arata\'s jokes and overall attitude towards being a pervert...are refreshing rather than apologetic like in other anime.I like the art, sound and animation but have seen better.

It started off for a few episodes where I didn\'t know what was happening because I didn\'t care. T7\'s premise was generic fantasy where our MC finds power and has to save the world. Where it is different is he has a harem and you can\'t really tell what he\'s trying to save, except for his cousin. The magic system was original, but uninteresting, and the names for everything are the generic fantasy names that you see in many pieces. You have your Norse, Biblical, and other...mythological names that you see everywhere. Which is fine, usually; however, after so many pieces of entertainment have used it, original concepts go a long way. 3/10Animation quality is a bit above average for today\'s standard. It excels during fights and is decent the rest of the time. There is a lot of fanservice. MC is a ""lucky pervert"" and see\'s, touches, and fantasizes about all of the girls\' boobs. You can\'t go an episode without characters awkwardly falling on top of each other; either exposing their crotch or boobs. 7/10Sound quality is above average. The OP was really catchy and the ED\'s were ok. The BGM was very fitting for each scene and I noticed it a lot of the time. I found it exceptional. 8/10The characters were your run of the mill Tsundere, Kuudere, Dandere, etc. Liese best girl, don\'t you deny that. Each and every girl was nice to look at ;) and had somethings that were interesting about them. My only complaint was the shit MC who looks so very stupid. Every time I look at Arata, he seems a bit off, somehow. Also, he is  quite the average pervert and isn\'t really interesting. He has his moments, but wasn\'t a good MC. Characters are a bit too generic, overall, so 4/10 seems appropriate.My enjoyment for this skyrocketed about halfway through the series. This turned from a 3/10, overall to a 7/10 over the course of the second half.In the end, T7 isn\'t spectacular. It was fun to watch, but hard to get into. I wasn\'t expecting much going in; nevertheless, after watching the show, I was still thoroughly entertained. 54/100 mythological names that you see everywhere.

Is that the main reason why I really like Trinity Seven? Nope.Story: 9/10A great story this anime has. Each episode doesn\'t drag on and introduces a new problem every 2 episodes. I was really into the anime and to see what happens after each episode, even though some of the action scenes are anticlimactic. The action is best when it\'s around Arata, mainly because he\'s a badass. Comedy-wise? I\'d say it was mediocre, because it uses falling down and grabbing boobs almost...each episodes and that annoys me A LOT. Though, sometimes Arata can be funny because of how straight-forward he is when he\'s being a pervert. A lot of fan-service in the anime, though the story itself overpowered the fan-service. Mainly when the protagonist is OP/the \'chosen\' one, he would have a harem around him and of course, that theory goes with this anime.Art: 8/10The art was nice and smooth, the colors were very nice in fact. The animation of the magic circles is nice and smooth and there was this one episode were Lillith was walking down a hallway and the animation was really smooth. Overall, the art is very nice.Sound: 7/10The OST is alright, though sometimes the OST would be playing louder than the voice actors. The OP fit the anime nicely, with the drums,the electric-guitar and the fast-paced singing to fit with the action theme of the anime. The anime actually had 4 EDs. The first one, being my favorite as it sounded like a romance song. The second one fits more for a slice of life anime. The third one somewhat fit the anime mainly because it sounds like it\'s a song for a comedy anime. The fourth one sounded like it was for a really boring, 2000ish anime. Though, I usually skip the OP/ED.Character: 10/10I\'d probably say that the characters are what raised the overall points to an 8.Arata Kasuga, the protagonist of the story. The main reason I like him is he\'s a pervert, but not that type who\'s really annoying and can\'t control himself. He\'s more of the cool pervert, that can control himself and is always smooth, even when he\'s making pervert jokes. He\'s really kind to others that even try to kill him.Asami Lillith, probably the biggest tsundere in this anime. She\'s a teacher at the same age of the students (o.O) and likes to hit Arata whenever he\'s doing something perverted. She has a nice body figure and she always blushes whenever someone is talking about sexual stuff.Kannazuki Arin, a very monotone girl. She doesn\'t scream whenever someone is peeking at her such as Arata. The sentence she says the most is \'That\'s difficult for me\' or a long those lines. She always continues Arata\'s sexual jokes, like saying ""So you wanna have sex before marriage?"".Yamana Mira, also a tsundere, but rarely showed her feelings to Arata until the end. She always blushes whenever she sees something that looks sexual, but it isn\'t. She\'s bestfriends with:Fudou Aiko, a very roughly dressed girl who never buttons the last button, so that means her belly button will be shown all the time. She\'s very strong physically and only uses her hands and feet to fight.Kazama Levi, a very high-classed ninja. She doesn\'t show that much interest in Arata and doesn\'t have that much emotion.Kurata Yui, a very cheerful character and she\'s really cute. She shows a lot of interest in Arata, to the point where she kisses him on the cheek occasionally in public. She\'s a very childish character, but in a cute way.Sherlock Lieselotte, a main character who was revealed very late into the anime. She is an evil mage but after the fight, she started to show interest in Arata. She\'s a very cheerful character and doesn\'t look that evil.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed this anime a lot. I had first impressions of this anime when I saw the cover photo. I thought it was going to be a mystery, psychological anime but after watching it, I was wrong. I watched this whole anime in one sitting.Overall: 8/10A very nice harem+romance+action anime. If you\'re looking for an anime to kill time, then this anime will do. Would I re-watch it?

Yes, definitely.', 'There are many improvements that could\'ve been implemented during the creation of this show but that\'s not to say that Trinity Seven was in any way unsatisfying, particularly in the fan service department.  Trinity Seven does offer much more than this though like it superbly done 3DCG integration and memorable characters that break the boundary of most typical harem ecchis and this isn\'t even mentioning the variety of the characters that are provided. Anyways here\'s my review, continue to read and see if this show is for you.Art and animation gets a solid nine out of my book.  The one thing that...some of these action-harem animes do very good is focus on the aesthetics of a show; granted there is some very aesthetically displeasing shows of this genre as well.  Trinity Seven I assure you, is not one of them.  It does its action sequences very well as a result of the detailed animation and provides almost flawless integration of its 3D elements even during casual scenes that include no action whatsoever.  This also does well to improve some of the ecchi and fan service elements should that be something you\'re interested in. If not, then Trinity Seven will not be disappointing to the average viewer that pays no heed to such elements.As for the soundtrack that Trinity Seven provides it has its pros and cons.  I would be quick to rate some of the action sequences sound effects to be really high, but it\'s not impressive to hear good quality explosions from a medium that is widely used to convey action.  Another con of sound effects lies in the lack of atmosphere.  Sometimes background noise can be somewhat annoying if not really annoying, but lack of it completely seems dull to the viewer and was something Trinity Seven failed to provide. Trinity Seven did provide some pretty memorable audio from its music soundtrack however.  The OP was most impressive and complemented the visuals marvelously.  Soundtrack within the anime itself should it be noticed was vastly unique and worked well with the occasion presented withing the show.  With these things being said, the sound wins itself seven trinities out of ten.Even though Trinity Seven did have a knack for favoring some characters over others, it did extremely well on the characters it focused on. There wasn\'t any characters I would call rogue personally for most characters had some if not good history explained, and those vital to the story that was presented had reasons for what they were doing. In many of the most recent ecchi based shows I\'ve seen growing complaints about predictable and plain characters from those who are not avid viewers of the genre.  If you are one of these people; a refreshing look on the ecchi/harem genre may be taken from viewing this show. Especially since the protagonist is not average in any sense, but can also hold his own when he wants to. There is a theme here for him and he does grow stronger.  As a result characters get a commendable eight out of ten.Finally is the story, which I would regrettably say is very mediocre because of one major flaw.  Trinity Seven is a magic show revolving around mages and it seems like the magic never really gets explained properly.  Of course a valid counter-argument would just be, ""It\'s magic, leave it at that!"" but it doesn\'t really hold to much ground seeing as they tried to explain some aspects of it. Plus is the finer details that create some pretty extensive plot wholes that are probably better covered in the accompanied manga.  These finer details are of course more whys and hows, curiosities that trouble the observant and knowledge-seeking individuals.  Other than that is the fair but inconclusive ending.  A five out of ten for an entertaining but somewhat lacking story.Overall Trinity Seven is a good anime, and I would recommend to people that are slightly interested or actually dedicated time to read this review to watch it. I personally enjoyed it and would only stagger on a re-watch for those first six episodes, the later half was more impressive for me.

Most of the harems I have seen the guy has absolutely no friggin clue that the girls want him, however in this anime we get a guy who isn\'t afraid to say ""thank you for the tit show"".  Honestly I couldn\'t find anything that I didn\'t like about this anime.  If you are going to watch this anime I would recommend wearing headphones because the music is much better when you can actually hear the bass.  The music...is what turns this anime from a mediocre harem anime into a brilliantly done (in my opinion) masterpiece.  From the start I found the easy going perv Kasuna Arata to be very likable.   One of the biggest issues I get with harem action animes is that they never really have time to develop the relationships between the MC and his harem, no such problem with this anime.  Honestly, I am absolute crap at explaining these things.  This anime was so damn good I couldn\'t resist giving a review.  I honestly think that if you give it a shot you just might like it. is what turns this anime from a mediocre harem anime into a brilliantly done (in my opinion) masterpiece.

In short, Trinity Seven is magic, comedy, and lots of fanservice. I haven't read the manga so I can't really compare the two but overall I enjoyed watching the series.The story basically follows Arata, whose cousin and childhood friend Hijiri disappears during a big magical disaster, which motivates him to enroll in a magic school to become a mage in order to find Hijiri and bring her back (conveniently, Arata appears to be the only dude in the academy). The Trinity Seven are the seven most powerful mages at...the school. Arata befriends the Trinity Seven and harem-esque scenarios ensue.Probably the biggest reason Trinity Seven stands above the rest of the genre is that the MC isn't an incompetent idiot. Arata is driven, strong, and most importantly, not irritating. He's a very likable lead and his pervyness provides laughs throughout the series. 12 episodes doesn't give a lot of time for character development but you know right from the start that Arata isn't lame.The Trinity Seven are, as expected, a group of very powerful and very beautiful young ladies. They basically all fall into one trope or another, but were you really expecting anything else? The important thing is that they're all likable. In fact, I don't think there's an irritating character in this series. The show puts focus on Lilith, Liese, and Mira, which unfortunately leaves the rest of the Trinity Seven feeling rather one-dimensional. 12 episodes is just not enough to develop every one of them. This series could easily have been twice as long.But despite its short length, the pacing is, for the most part, on point. My biggest complaint is that the show stumbles in the last few episodes and the story gets muddled. Too many new characters are interjected and I felt a little confused after the last episode, but the ending sets up nicely for a second season, which I certainly hope will be produced.Trinity Seven does a lot of things right. This is excellent execution of a very familiar formula. Big props to the art team for the excellent animation job and the sharp, attractive character designs.

Instead he has a strong personality and no qualms expressing his enjoyment over the usual perverted situations that arise. Quick witted, amusing responses were a refreshing change.The OP music and animation is catchy and gives a good build-up to each episode. Also I can't quite put my finger on it, but for some reason the unusually wide mouths a few of the characters are drawn with really fits.The story doesn't really matter, but when does it with this kind of anime - to be honest I can't...really even recall it that well.

As for whether or not I was happy with the 12 episodes that were released, that goes a bit both ways.Story 7Again I read up to where the manga is at so I wasn't exactly coming into this show with no knowledge of what was going to happen. The story stayed with the route that the manga had which was a major plus for me. The only thing that kind of bothered me was it would've have been a much better ending if it...ended on the next conflict that would've happened after the end but that's neither here nor there. For what was giving it was enjoyable.Art 6The art was kind of disappointing to me. It seemed like the creators loved to gray tone everything.

I really never judge sound because I really haven't experienced a bad sound in anime.Characters 9Every character was unique.

The 7 in Trinity Seven means the seven harem girls which glomp on the MC. The main reason you\'d want to watch it is general attitude of the characters that are clearly aware that this is a harem anime. The male MC, Kasuga Arata, and many of the female ones being very upfront with sexual attraction. In fact this show is so clearly aware of its harem status, that within the first 30 seconds beyond the intro, our MC is literally groping boobs already.When I say old era of harem, I mean the era where harem...was all show-as-much-skin-as-possible, but not yet at the stage of doing extremely sexually suggestive actions. The farthest the MC goes being the classic slip-and-grope and flashing nudity. Nipples don\'t exist here though. Trinity Seven first and foremost is a harem anime and any motivation for watching it should start with that.As for the underlying element of a plot beyond \'plot,\' Trinity Seven takes on an apocalyptic Date a Live vibes with a magic academy focus. The motivations are extremely clear, but the plot progression is not at all. It leads to a very strange dilemma where Arata has a very clear objective in mind, but the story seems to stumble into random plot points instead of a clear path of progress towards his objective. A large part of it being because the concept of seven female MCs means that they must all be accounted for quickly. As such, you can summarize the plot as being rushed, and being a 12 episode anime most certainly doesn\'t help.The single biggest sacrifice to this rushing is the magic system. It is not explained, nor fleshed out well at all. Being the very fundamental action element of this anime, you\'d think that it would be simple and clear. Yet it pans out as a complicated system that has processes which are literally skipped over, all because Arata is an overpowered MC. It makes any form of combat in this anime a complete joke since it ends up being a bunch of random superpowers that manifest out of nowhere.That being said though, can\'t go ranting on how shitty the action is without talking about the most important aspect of the show: tiddies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The fanservice on this show is on a different wavelength. While it doesn\'t reach the levels of degeneracy as the notorious To Love-Ru and Shinmai Maou no Testament, and definitely not at the levels of borderline hentai from Ishuzoku Reviewers and Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo, the aforementioned attitude really switches up the reaction dynamic. While there most certainly is the classic ""KYAAA-"" *shoot male-MC with a rocket launcher* kind of reaction (practically the identity of Asami Lilith), there is also the reactions that go along the lines of: ""ooh~ you like that ( >w*)"", ""damn right, I do."" That kind of upfront and honest degeneracy won\'t be seen in any other harems. The only one that comes remotely close is Highschool DxD, when Issei makes heroic speeches. Yet this goes through that has the confidence to go even farther beyond.As far as characters go, half the cast are cliches while the other half has a bit of roundness. Though, some of the cliches make up for it with another kind of ""roundness.""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)They are all pretty slim, so no big-booty-bitches here. Lieselotte Sherlock is a bit thicker than the rest of the cast, but not dummy THICC like you see in characters like Akeno from Highschool DxD. Then there are some characters have cliched themes, but a distinct personality. For example, Kazama Levi definitely has the ninja theme, but here sexual honesty is very distinct as a personality in spite of some kunoichi being known for sexual assassination.Arata, our determined male MC, is a proud degenerate who has a strong sibling bond which serves as the primary purpose of his every action. His love for his cousin, Hijiri, is so great that he accepted his fate as a potential Demon Lord to save his cousin. His trust in Hijiri is so strong that he is willing to overlook at all the transgressions of things related to her, in absolute faith that she is acting with good intent. That fierce determination to find and save his cousin is very clear and easy to get behind, which is sorely lacking in many harem anime. It\'s one of the great positives of this show that makes it stand out in comparison to other harem anime. Many times, harem animes tend to have aimless male MCs who get strung all over the place without any real purpose. Arata has a very clear purpose and a very good reason for why he wants to take risks to achieve it. Familial bond is a simple, but extremely effective way to express motivation. Starting right out the gate with it makes Arata a very good character.The Trinity Seven are a conglomerate of quirky magic students. Lilith is the commando tsundere. Levi is the shameless kunoichi. Yui is the childish sleeping beauty. Arin is the kuudere cultist. Akio is the confident delinquent-senpai. Mira is the crusader tsundere. Finally, Lieselotte is the seductive witch. The school is lead by a degenerate overpowered headmaster and the bulk of the show involves their interactions. Which makes sense since that\'s also their opportunity for fanservice.Lilith carries that common beat the crap out of a guy for being silly that you see from characters like Tachibana Misato from Nichijou or Chidori Kaname from Full Metal Panic, the guns blazing variant. She\'s supposed to be a teacher, who is about the same age as Arata, but she ends up being a sexy body joke from being teased by the rest of the cast. She is one of the voices of reason in the stream of ecchi personalities clashing about. Her character ultimately amounts to being a tour guide for Arata with a splash of ecchi jokes getting forced onto her. Ends up feeling very tropey, leaning heavily on the guns blazing punishment for Arata.Levi is a kunoichi, which you don\'t really see that often as a character in general unless it is an explicitly ninja focused anime. As such she makes a lot of ecchi jokes while doing ninja stuff and fighting using the ninja way. She likes to pop out of the roof to join in on conversations and is usually the kicker for Arata\'s degenerate honesty. While her role is quite simple, she actively dives into one of the main motivations to watch the show, which is that unabashed self-awareness of being a harem anime.Yui is a sleeper OP character who uses dreams for magic and support. She\'s stuck with a childish mentality since she was secluded for a long time and only had an opportunity to wake up when Arata came along. She instantly glomped onto our male MC as soon as she woke up and is also another contributor to the ecchi talks since she has no hesitation to get down and dirty with Arata after his intervention.Arin is a silly kuudere who tries her darn best to act on tropes, but flops due to her emotionless reactions. She instantly glomps onto Arata for a seemingly random reason of being destined to be the Demon Lord\'s waifu. She draws many parallels from Tobiichi Origami from Date a Live for this reason, with the exclusion of the fierce vengeance factor Origami has.

Akio is rather lax and instead exudes confidence and care. Doesn\'t contribute much to the ecchi talks, but she doesn\'t really care when she gets stripped naked which adds to her confidence. Force of will is her magic and she\'s a devout believer in the power of friendship. Lots of good vibes all around.Mira is the disciplinary council president kind of tsundere. For the most part, has a lot of aggression toward Arata due to his Demon Lord potential being a threat. Mira tries to be the mature stoic disciplinarian. Yet when exposed to her childlike choices from the inevitable fanservice, that side of her breaks down completely and she devolves into an embarrassed brat. She\'s the last one to glomp onto Arata due to her wariness of his overpowered Demon Lord magic.Lieselotte is a sexy bad girl who is mostly debuted by her twin sister, Selina, the newspaper reporter. Being the bigger boob variant and the only character to actively try to charm enemies, she has the most dynamic fanservice and tries to be a sexy little devil to mask her abandonment insecurities. Gets intimidated very easily. Aggressively glomps on Arata for his Demon Lord power at first. Lovingly glomps on him later for his determination to save her from the dark side.All in all, about what I expected from a harem anime. When you look at it as a harem anime, it has distinctly good story points going for it in the form of self awareness and clear motivations. Though if you look at it as a fantasy action anime, it\'s got a lot of problems explaining its magic system and rushing through without properly carrying forward progress for our male MCs motivations. In the fanservice department, they do a good job of showing off all the girl\'s figures and even the Arata\'s at times. Though it stops at full nudity with things like light beam censoring and small patches of clothes, it is appropriate for that harem era and shows off their curves particularly well--especially Lieselotte\'s scenes. was all show-as-much-skin-as-possible, but not yet at the stage of doing extremely sexually suggestive actions. The farthest the MC goes being the classic slip-and-grope and flashing nudity. Nipples don\'t exist here though. Trinity Seven first and foremost is a harem anime and any motivation for watching it should start with that.As for the underlying element of a plot beyond \'plot,\' Trinity Seven takes on an apocalyptic Date a Live vibes with a magic academy focus. The motivations are extremely clear, but the plot progression is not at all. It leads to a very strange dilemma where Arata has a very clear objective in mind, but the story seems to stumble into random plot points instead of a clear path of progress towards his objective. A large part of it being because the concept of seven female MCs means that they must all be accounted for quickly. As such, you can summarize the plot as being rushed, and being a 12 episode anime most certainly doesn\'t help.The single biggest sacrifice to this rushing is the magic system. It is not explained, nor fleshed out well at all. Being the very fundamental action element of this anime, you\'d think that it would be simple and clear. Yet it pans out as a complicated system that has processes which are literally skipped over, all because Arata is an overpowered MC. It makes any form of combat in this anime a complete joke since it ends up being a bunch of random superpowers that manifest out of nowhere.That being said though, can\'t go ranting on how shitty the action is without talking about the most important aspect of the show: tiddies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The fanservice on this show is on a different wavelength. While it doesn\'t reach the levels of degeneracy as the notorious To Love-Ru and Shinmai Maou no Testament, and definitely not at the levels of borderline hentai from Ishuzoku Reviewers and Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo, the aforementioned attitude really switches up the reaction dynamic. While there most certainly is the classic ""KYAAA-"" *shoot male-MC with a rocket launcher* kind of reaction (practically the identity of Asami Lilith), there is also the reactions that go along the lines of: ""ooh~ you like that ( >w*)"", ""damn right, I do."" That kind of upfront and honest degeneracy won\'t be seen in any other harems. The only one that comes remotely close is Highschool DxD, when Issei makes heroic speeches. Yet this goes through that has the confidence to go even farther beyond.As far as characters go, half the cast are cliches while the other half has a bit of roundness. Though, some of the cliches make up for it with another kind of ""roundness.""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)They are all pretty slim, so no big-booty-bitches here. Lieselotte Sherlock is a bit thicker than the rest of the cast, but not dummy THICC like you see in characters like Akeno from Highschool DxD. Then there are some characters have cliched themes, but a distinct personality. For example, Kazama Levi definitely has the ninja theme, but here sexual honesty is very distinct as a personality in spite of some kunoichi being known for sexual assassination.Arata, our determined male MC, is a proud degenerate who has a strong sibling bond which serves as the primary purpose of his every action. His love for his cousin, Hijiri, is so great that he accepted his fate as a potential Demon Lord to save his cousin. His trust in Hijiri is so strong that he is willing to overlook at all the transgressions of things related to her, in absolute faith that she is acting with good intent. That fierce determination to find and save his cousin is very clear and easy to get behind, which is sorely lacking in many harem anime. It\'s one of the great positives of this show that makes it stand out in comparison to other harem anime. Many times, harem animes tend to have aimless male MCs who get strung all over the place without any real purpose. Arata has a very clear purpose and a very good reason for why he wants to take risks to achieve it. Familial bond is a simple, but extremely effective way to express motivation. Starting right out the gate with it makes Arata a very good character.The Trinity Seven are a conglomerate of quirky magic students. Lilith is the commando tsundere. Levi is the shameless kunoichi. Yui is the childish sleeping beauty. Arin is the kuudere cultist. Akio is the confident delinquent-senpai. Mira is the crusader tsundere. Finally, Lieselotte is the seductive witch. The school is lead by a degenerate overpowered headmaster and the bulk of the show involves their interactions. Which makes sense since that\'s also their opportunity for fanservice.Lilith carries that common beat the crap out of a guy for being silly that you see from characters like Tachibana Misato from Nichijou or Chidori Kaname from Full Metal Panic, the guns blazing variant. She\'s supposed to be a teacher, who is about the same age as Arata, but she ends up being a sexy body joke from being teased by the rest of the cast. She is one of the voices of reason in the stream of ecchi personalities clashing about. Her character ultimately amounts to being a tour guide for Arata with a splash of ecchi jokes getting forced onto her. Ends up feeling very tropey, leaning heavily on the guns blazing punishment for Arata.Levi is a kunoichi, which you don\'t really see that often as a character in general unless it is an explicitly ninja focused anime. As such she makes a lot of ecchi jokes while doing ninja stuff and fighting using the ninja way. She likes to pop out of the roof to join in on conversations and is usually the kicker for Arata\'s degenerate honesty. While her role is quite simple, she actively dives into one of the main motivations to watch the show, which is that unabashed self-awareness of being a harem anime.Yui is a sleeper OP character who uses dreams for magic and support.

Don't get me wrong: Trinity Seven is a typical harem anime and you can expect such tropes to appear in every episode you watch.

More often then not in ecchi anime your characters fit a checklist of generic cardboard cutouts. But to my great liking, Trinity Seven did not follow that mold.Our MC is not a predictable pervert, he is not one to stumble into a half-naked girl, get a...nose-bleed, stammer apologies, then get slapped. Now granted, he is still a pervert, but he is confident about it.  He was my personal greatest enjoyment in watching this show as he made an average ecchi situation into something glorious. He is also not a complete idiot, which was also refreshing.The remainder of our cast is unsurprisingly female. Now I personally found them all to be decent little characters. Now they still fit the bill of being cardboard cut-outs, but I would say are by no means generic. As if the creators went to a different store to buy them, one that is in an alley with a small sign and only a single employee.I did not find the character development to be very well done.

Just your generic school setting with magic with 0 relation to school life. the story seem to revolve ONLY its protagonist and its harem, everyone and everywhere else is inconsequential. Fights make NO SENSE. You have a bad...mage with world ending abilities, she can destroy a area the size of a library all fights in the show happen in a ridiculously small area; within a room, corridor etc. You have MAGIC, you have SWORDS, you have GUNS yet you fight in a 5m radius? GTFO. In addition there are many decisions that doesnt make sense.1) Why is does the teacher wear the same uniform as your students ?2) The trinity 7 are the strongest 7 on a magic school, but why does everyone else seem to be just backdrop for the characters to shine? you might as well strip the series of its school setting and have it elsewhere if you\'re not gonna make use of the school setting.3) There are other magical campus but all 7 of them are on the same campus? does the other campus have the set of strongest mage? NOPE because you\'re immediately told one was destroyed while the other was destroyed mid way in the story.4) His home world got destroyed and all he care about was his childhood friend? what about his family or friends from school? was he born from a tree and knew NO ONE prior to his apocalypse?Characters:Character designs are cute but dull in color, its like the world had a off palette lens around them. You get your usual loli, tsundere, yandere etc. These characters are introduced in 1-2 min and immediately they hit off like old friends and lovers.

The animation and art are good, a lot of fan-service if you're into that. What i enjoyed is the characters there fun to watch especially the main character Arata who is not the typical Ecchi/harem MC. He embraces hes pervy side and is the main source of comedy. Another character worthy of mention is the Ninja Levi. It doesnt have the solid ending though, sets up for a second season.If you have time to waste this is perfect for you. "", ""I'm just going to review this purely on my own enjoyment, and how I thought it all came together.Story: This is one of those stories where you get thrown right in, and you're not certain what's going on. It's also one of those stories where the Main character is one of the only males, and he is the top dog. He's randomly the top dog, when he joins a school of mages. That's right a school. So here we have, an easy setting to navigate, and the 'trinity seven,' three antagonists that don't show up till the last two episodes, and a sister of the...trinity seven. So that's 11 girls for this Main Character to chose from in his big harem. Basically, it's as cookie cutter as it gets. The Main MC, is an all powerful mage, right off the bat. The fan service is also off the charts, happening at one scene every three to four minutes. Not to say, fan service is bad, and shouldn't be put in a story, It just felt like it was over done. It was enjoyable, because of the magic factor. A decent portion of the magic was explained, and the way the world worked was explained, therefore I think that put it above and beyond a lack luster harem show.Art- The character designs were pretty cute, and Arata was decently handsome, same with the headmaster. When the shit hit the fan, the magical fights were fantastic. My biggest and most glaring problem with the show was that they DIDN'T go anywhere besides the school, and maybe a beach. So all we saw was a crappy 'cg' model of a school and it's rooms, and outside campus, and maybe a pretty background of a ruined world at sun set.Sound- I loved the opening song. I watched it 9 times! It had a very wild song, that reminded me of 'another's' op. If you've seen it! I can get behind the soundtrack as very soothing on the ears, and playing the right moods at the right times.Character: Literally no development for any of the characters. I thought the tidbits for the characters were lacking. The only real details we got were how the characters got along together and what trope they fell into in a harem world.Enjoyment: I liked it! It's probably not for the most critical players in the anime game, but you know its a decent watch being that it's 12 episodes. I can get behind it as being a 'hit or miss' but you can see for yourself. If you dislike overly undeveloped harems (and I don't mean their bust sizes), don't watch it.Overall: Seven. It's good, but it isn't THAT good. I can give it a seven due to it's soundtrack, decent magical background, and great fights. We all factor in different 'feelings' when writing reviews and giving anime a score. Up to you how you think it'll do. trinity seven. So that's 11 girls for this Main Character to chose from in his big harem. Basically, it's as cookie cutter as it gets. The Main MC, is an all powerful mage, right off the bat. The fan service is also off the charts, happening at one scene every three to four minutes. Not to say, fan service is bad, and shouldn't be put in a story, It just felt like it was over done. It was enjoyable, because of the magic factor. A decent portion of the magic was explained, and the way the world worked was explained, therefore I think that put it above and beyond a lack luster harem show.Art- The character designs were pretty cute, and Arata was decently handsome, same with the headmaster.

While this anime does have some things going in its favor, most of the good is smothered by the bad.So, why don\'t we start with the good first, hmm? I suppose I could start by saying that the original premise of the story is quite intriguing. You\'ve basically got a young man living in a small town that was destroyed by what\'s called a Breakdown Phenomenon, until the...appearance of a magus leads him to attending the Royal Biblia Academy... yeah, I know, the name kind of sucks. Just roll with it. You also soon learn that Arata, the main character, is a Demon Lord Candidate, which I guess is this anime\'s name version of a badass.While the story itself seems intriguing enough, there are a lot of cliche\'s here, first and foremost being the magical high school cliche. I sometimes feel like the only reason Arata was even sent to this high school was so he could find his harem and take over the world. While I don\'t dislike the harem genre, I do when the harem smothers the story into oblivion like this one does.Aside from the stereotypical ""magical high school with useless teachers who don\'t actually do anything"" setting, the story itself has a lot of pointless fanservice. Not the good kind of fanservice that makes you laugh, but the kind where you\'re staring at the screen and wondering why the hell some girl keeps getting randomly stripped naked. The fanservice in this anime isn\'t funny, and it doesn\'t add anything to the story. At the same time, it holds itself back, as if the animators tried really hard to make this a serious story with a deeper plot. Unfortunately, they failed epically at this. Trinity Seven not only has the feel of a stereotypical anime with no plot beyond ""give Arata a harem,"" it doesn\'t go anywhere with the harem itself. They\'re just sort of there.The battles are also really boring, the principle is supposed to be this badass but acts like a pervy old man, and all of the characters feel like cardboard cutouts of archetypes. Because of all the negative qualities this anime has, I can\'t really recommend it. appearance of a magus leads him to attending the Royal Biblia Academy... yeah, I know, the name kind of sucks.

Because of all the negative qualities this anime has, I can\'t really recommend it.', 'Trinity Seven is a unique harem anime in that it features a strong male lead that isn\'t afraid of groping ass and tits and a female cast that actually doesn\'t have a problem with him doing so. Now you\'re probably thinking - impossibru Simonian, how can such flawlessness be?  I assure you it can and it\'s right here.The story is rather bland. A generic school setting wrapped up in some magical theme. It\'s the weakest component of this anime. Slow progression and ultimately goes nowhere... but if you like ass and tits and moreover if you like them poked, stroked and groped -...story isn\'t really going to be a problem.Which brings me to the wonderful characters of this show. Now whoever came up with the concept of this show\'s MC (Kasuga Arata) deserves a cookie with viagra fillings. Arata\'s charm to the females in this show is like a ripe banana to fruit flies. This guy doesn\'t stutter, he possesses confidence like no other and a pair of solid balls. This guy makes no limp dick excuses either. He grabs the sexual goods either intentionally or by accident and calmly thanks the females for the opportunity afterwards. A rare sight in harem shows.But herein lies the problem. That\'s pretty much as far as the harem and ""romance"" component of this show goes. It\'s mostly jokes and some light frottage. The romance component never really seems to break through the comedy, limiting the vast potential Trinity Seven had. For example : Arata touches a tit, girls don\'t have a problem and want to take it further - suddenly both sides calmly play it off as a joke and go their merry ways. The fuck? If a girl has no problems with a guy touching her tit in real life, the end result is either a spent condom or a pregnancy.But I\'m going off on a tangent here. What I\'m saying is the comedy limits this show a LOT.As for the visual and sound departments they\'re honestly good. The scenery and characters look crisp in 1080p, opening and ending songs are decent and voice acting fitting and authentic. Sound effects accompanying various magical spells and battles alike are spot on and what one would expect.Enjoyment? Thoroughly entertaining due to the characters. Story-wise it\'s fairly weak. Arata and the girls make a near perfect combination. Ecchi in a harem setting is good thanks to MC\'s unstoppable sack while the romance is limited by the comedy.Overall, still a good series. Strongly recommended. story isn\'t really going to be a problem.Which brings me to the wonderful characters of this show.

definitely figure it out, so the trinity seven stands for like the most powerful students that are in the academy (Sorry though not going into detail as it will spoil it), these students are all unique oh btw forgot to mention that one of the trinity seven is a teacher and the main character well would be a boy, a regular boy and later on in the anime he turns into a demon lord, once this happens the story has an interesting turn of events,...the boy tends to go to the school that the trinity seven i at and he becomes friends with them (eventually) and then there adventures start.Coming onto the base story, yes it was structured in a really interesting manner, but i would have liked to see a lot more action and fighting parts in it, the Romance in the anime is good, as the demon lord wanted a Harem(Here that guys, he wants a harem, HE HE HE) Yes its a perverted anime alright in someways i think of it as the non serious version of High School DxD, because when comparing this anime to High School DXD, it does not really have that much of blood thirsty battles that most people would expect it to have, that's what kind of disappoints meThe graphic designs and animations are quite good, once again as usual if you want to get the best experience of anime, ditch the low quality anime and get the Blu-Ray 720P or even better the 1080P animes (The pervs are sure to enjoy this then ;-) The character personality's are quite  good, the headmaster (You will find out later) Who we all think has a serious personality and all that, but the fun fact is that he isn't serious, he is quite a comedian and a total perv, that said the rest of the trinity seven have there own personalities and they all suit the anime.The sound was something that made this anime look weird at times and sometimes awesome, I mean if you listen closely enough you will realize that at times it plays some quiet melody of Hindi songs, and at the other times in like serious battles the music gets fired up as well, so yeah its good in one way and bad in the other (Btw this is from my own personal view)Finally my conclusion on this anime is that its not a bad anime, if you like to watch an anime with a balance of fighting, romance, and comedy, oh yeah and ECCHI(HE HE HE) then this anime would be suited for you, but keep in mind that the battles are not thaaat serious.So Enjoy

-6-I\'ll be really honest here since this is one of my favorite series right now, but I won\'t let my enjoyment cloud my judgement.Critical Review:Story: 4Story was bland, generic, and overall just confusing. How does a series cover up confusing and unknown terminologies, plot and other story elements? By making entirely random stuff up with random descriptions and reasons for it. This cliché isn\'t new, and almost a lot of animes do this, and this one is no exception. But probably the bad thing about this is that, they don\'t do well enough to properly explain them, unlike other series with much more complicated...terminologies like To Aru Majutsu No Index, not a comparison of their plot, but rather how series like the To Aru does well with their detailed explanations and can get away with convoluted ideas like it.Plot development was horrible, everything was happening in a weird pace. The story arcs were all over the place, and there was contingencies everywhere, which was bad.Art: 6Art was fairly decent for the most part. Not bad, not entirely good either. There were times I actually liked some scenes, esp the fight scenes, but some scenes were just too bland. The character designs was pretty good though, which bumped my rating.Sound: 5I don\'t really know to be honest. I didn\'t hear anything out of place, nor was there anything that caught my attention. Music is not noticeable for me either. So I\'m sorry if this is somewhat biased for me, but I\'ll need to give this score.Character: 7Characters were pretty good. Most of them, while generic, are somewhat still memorable. However most of this score should be because of the MC. He\'s not your usual Harem character, who\'s weak, shy, ""innocent"", and such. He\'s one of the few ones out there that actually controls his harem, compared to countless others out there, where the MC is usually the one being exploited. MC is basically a near-Gary Stu, and while the pacing of his character development is dull, his personality somewhat makes up for it.The female cast are made up of a bunch of cliches from the big-breasted girls to the lolis, with the personality tropes ranging from different kinds of Deres, including, but not limited to your usual Tsunderes, Kuuderes and Derederes. I don\'t know who stands out the most, but personally my favorite out of them all would be the ninja. Overall, it\'s just your usual trope of characters.Enjoyment: 7While the story was sub-par, I enjoyed it. This is mainly due to the MC\'s interaction with his harem. I liked how he plays his harem quite well, even though he an unsatisfying development transitions, he gets away with it. The fight scenes were quite decent, and I enjoyed a few of them. Fan-service was present almost entirely throughout, but to be honest it wasn\'t that much eye-catching for my taste. It was good, if not for the story, it could\'ve been better.Overall: 5.8 rounding to 6.I\'m sorry if this is low. While I did enjoyed it quite a lot, the story was just too bland for me. They got me with their MC, and to be honest, if it wasn\'t for the MC, it wouldn\'t even be this high. If it was only paired with a better storytelling and plot development, I could\'ve scored this a lot higher.Don\'t take my word for it though, I still kind of recommend it for people who likes stuff like this and doesn\'t mind its flaws. I\'m still reading the manga after the anime ended, a testament that I really enjoyed it.--Reviewed on July 18, 2016. Recapped everything through memory.

This is my honest review, but there might be some errors due to time gap between my review and the last time I watched it. Don\'t take my review as the only reference for taking an interest in this series.', 'I feel it is only fair to write a review of an anime I initially dropped because I thought it was so bad.When this anime first aired I watched up to episode 3, then dropped it when they revealed the main characters ""super-power"" because it was so cliched.  Then I decided to re-watch a few weeks ago and boy am I glad I did.So here\'s the rundown.  This is a harem anime.  Usually I dislike harem anime\'s, especially when they use dumb cliches like \'hand on the boob\' on the first episode, or when the main guy is always somehow seeing the...girls panties and then making excuses while blushing intensely.So what makes this anime different?The main character.  He owns that he is a pervert, and expresses a desire to sleep with every beautiful girl he sees.  As you do.  Now is this creepy?  Yeah, but the way he owns it somehow makes it okay.  Also, the girls are, for the most part, totally okay with it.  In fact, there are only 2 girls that do the typical screeching-punch/slap thing when the guy touches their boobs or sees them naked.  The rest are like, okay I think you are hot/awesome and I\'m interested.Story: 7Good bordering on very good.  I feel like the series has a lot of potential, and I am hoping a second season will wrap everything up.  Is everything explained perfectly?  Nope, but thats okay, I feel like you get just enough of a taste to be on board and feel like you are invested.Art: 7Nothing special but not too shabby either.  Lots of boobs and cleavage, as you would expect with this sort of anime.Sound: 10This really stood out to me.  A beautiful OST accompanied this anime, with tracks that perfectly matched with scenes and action.  Was creepy at the appropriate times and beautiful at others.  Also the voice actors did a great job.Character: 9Also a stand out category.  Each girl is totally different, which is somewhat unique in a harem situation.  By the end of the season you feel like you know each character and will no doubt have favorites (mine was the ninja!)Enjoyment: 9I really enjoyed this anime.  I\'m actually not sure why because like I said, I don\'t typically watch harem anime\'s, and when I do I usually don\'t enjoy them that much.  But I think the great characters and beautiful OST really helped a lot.Overall: 7I feel like I should give this an 8, but it really isn\'t that good of a series, I just happened to enjoy it a lot.  I think that if you give harem\'s a chance and like fantasy/magic anime, you will probably like this show. girls panties and then making excuses while blushing intensely.So what makes this anime different?The main character.

The rest are like, okay I think you are hot/awesome and I\'m interested.Story: 7Good bordering on very good.  I feel like the series has a lot of potential, and I am hoping a second season will wrap everything up.  Is everything explained perfectly?  Nope, but thats okay, I feel like you get just enough of a taste to be on board and feel like you are invested.Art: 7Nothing special but not too shabby either.  Lots of boobs and cleavage, as you would expect with this sort of anime.Sound: 10This really stood out to me.  A beautiful OST accompanied this anime, with tracks that perfectly matched with scenes and action.  Was creepy at the appropriate times and beautiful at others.  Also the voice actors did a great job.Character: 9Also a stand out category.  Each girl is totally different, which is somewhat unique in a harem situation.  By the end of the season you feel like you know each character and will no doubt have favorites (mine was the ninja!)Enjoyment: 9I really enjoyed this anime.  I\'m actually not sure why because like I said, I don\'t typically watch harem anime\'s, and when I do I usually don\'t enjoy them that much.  But I think the great characters and beautiful OST really helped a lot.Overall: 7I feel like I should give this an 8, but it really isn\'t that good of a series, I just happened to enjoy it a lot.  I think that if you give harem\'s a chance and like fantasy/magic anime, you will probably like this show.', ""Trinity SevenFrom the title you can probably see the theme has to do with the concept of the 7 Deadly Sins, but in this case, as magical arts through the 7 Archives as well as your individual 'Thema,' (basically Class and Sub-class).  So without further adieu, let's begin this review!AnimationThe visuals in this show are quite appealing, both the animation of each individual character and the settings and backgrounds alike.  The lighting and shading as well help to invoke the feeling of every scene.  Sometimes background images and characters however can be either highly distorted or have a dramatic lack of animation,...but nothing too serious.  Otherwise, I would compare the style of animation, especially character-wise to that of the anime DanMachi, however, I would say it is not as good, or in-depth.StoryAfter watching the first episode of Trinity Seven, I admittedly had no clue what was going on.  Nothing about what was occurring within the plot-line was really explained, not even a little.  It did have an over-looming objective that the main character, Arata wished to accomplish, but nothing about the setting, people, events, etc. were really explained in the first episode, let alone the next few.  For being a 12 episode season, I felt that this was a definite issue with the series as a whole because I felt like I had to search for the meanings to things that I didn't completely understand all too often.  Also, I felt the progression of events within the plot went wayyyyyyyy too quickly.  I would say it is almost comparable to that of the Aincrad arc of Sword Art Online where everything felt extremely rushed and as though a lot of details and plot elements were missing.The story itself wasn't that bad, and nothing really stood out as being inappropriate for the plot-line, I was simply left wanting a lot more out of the 12 episodes.SoundThe music used in the show is absolutely fantastic.  That being said, there were definitely scenes where the choice of music was probably not the best (Ex. episode 3 the bath scene).  Otherwise, the moods of most scenes were captured brilliantly and sounded wonderful.  With regards to the voice acting, the only thing I have to say is that it was pretty good.  Every voice suited their character nicely, especially Arata's (Arata is voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who also happens to voice the main protagonist of DanMachi, Bell Cranel).CharactersAhh, the characters, possibly the most prevalent and amazing aspect of this show...  is what I would say if I felt there was any real character development other than with Arata.  I may rant a little here so bear with me.  The main protagonist is technically meant to be the most important character in a show, especially when a plot point states that each Trinity Seven becomes the harem of the Demon Lord Candidate, but when there is little to no real development of any other characters, whom I might add are considered main characters, I get a little annoyed.  I understand that this show has the Harem genre to it, but that doesn't mean the other main characters can't have more story than falling for the protagonist.  This whole lack of development really reminds me of Sword Art Online, which if you've seen the series, you probably understand what I'm getting at.Although, where the series lacks in development, it does not come up short in each characters individuality.  As magic is basically the main theme of Trinity Seven, it's not surprising that each individual has their own unique style and way of using it, but the characters that fit each style, simply make sense...  in a very good way.  Each character is what you would think of them as, and they absolutely excel at there skills, which is quite enjoyable to see.  Overall, their appearance and actions are pretty cool.Verdict!!So, should you watch this series?  Yes.  Trinity Seven, overall, was enjoyable to watch.  Though it had its fair share of mishaps I would still recommend it to someone to at least experience, if nothing else.  Especially when considering its opening, because holy s*** is it good.  I mean, resemblance to Death Note much?This series was fun to watch and has some great comedic elements as well, believe me, there are some REALLY funny scenes.  So yeah, I'd say give it a try. but nothing too serious.

Story is quite straightforward once it straightens itself out but still leaves us the question as to whether theres more to it.Art (9) - If theres something the series does right its the art and look of it. Every episode is very enjoyable to look at and even some of the more boring scenes are made up for by the good looking art and animation. Oh and those actions, god damn.Sound (7) -...Voice acting was decent and I really didn't have a problem with it at all. Also some really nice opening and ending songs.Character (7) - Alright, boobs and body figures aside, the characters were the typical variety of personalities you would see in any harem series. That is EXCEPT for the main character. Now what I liked about this series was that the MC was different to the usual harem leads you would see. This character isn't thick skulled when it comes to relationships and doesn't get a nose bleed whenever a girl touches him. In fact he does the opposite and knows when a girl likes him and knows how to act when a girl offers themselves up to him. He is a very self controlled and likeable character and the only reason why I raised the score up to a 7.Enjoyment (9) - If you like the harem/ecchi genre, then you'll LOVE this series. If your sick and tired of the MC in a harem getting a nose bleed every 5 seconds then you'll LOVE this series. If you like comedy in general then I think you'll like this series also. But if you don't like the harem genre then you probably shouldn't watch this...Overall (8) - Tbh, I enjoyed every moment of watching this series and it is indeed one of my guilty pleasures. Only downside to this is if you DON'T like excessive fan service and/or the harem genre in general. Other than that I think this is a real diamond in the bush if your a fan of the harem or ecchi genre. Voice acting was decent and I really didn't have a problem with it at all.

It was a great show, focusing on a perverts dream? Yeah, i will have to go with that. A perverts dream for sure.I think this show should go on for sure, but what i miss the most...was the lack of romance / relationship in these typical series, this was a different experience you could say, even tho i remember this kind of experience with the DxD series.Would love to see a season 2 and if possible, buy merch/DVD's with this series. This isnt something i would do normally, but it would be cool having this in a physical form to, not talking waifu-pillows for you reading :)-Multix aka John was the lack of romance / relationship in these typical series, this was a different experience you could say, even tho i remember this kind of experience with the DxD series.Would love to see a season 2 and if possible, buy merch/DVD's with this series.

It actually has PLOT. and a damn good one at that. The point that struck me most about this anime in particular regarding the story is that the plot begins quite quickly. Most generic harem anime stories wait until Episode 6, some as late as episode 9 before throwing in the conflict. This one started at episode 3. much better than 4 episodes of useless fanservice.  However, this...story is not without it's faults. One of the major problems with the story is that it is not very common sense. The characters seem to make decisions that don't make sense, and thus leads to plot holes. But overall story is very good. 8/10.Secondly, each character is great. They do fit well with the story. It doesn't seem as if this harem setting was the main reason for this anime, as the harem slowly develops and almost in an underhanded manner. Also, props to the storywriters for making a good MC who is not as dense as bricks. Yes, this MC is perverted, but he is (1) not shy about it, and (2) not shy about making/taking advances from the girls. That puts it about 5 steps ahead of a generic harem anime. So Characters get a solid 10/10 in my book because badass MC and girls who serve another purpose other than just being objects for the MC to play with/ignore.The biggest problem (personally) with this anime other than the story not following at times is the art, but only a small part of it. In particular the faces. I'm not sure what it is but something to do with the way the eyes are drawn and the mouths are draw irks me. Also, as most of the story happens at the magic school, so most of the colors are muted, antiquated, and medieval in a sense.  However this is just a small problem with it and doesnt detract from the overall enjoyment for me. Also there are good looking women/girls so I won't complain anymore.I happen to like fast songs so the Opening and the closing were real treats for me, I found myself listening to them more than once (usually i skip them).Overall, a great anime. Characters do follow tropes, but they vary from each other in age, height, and (not to be shallow) bust size, in addition to having a purpose. The MC is great since he is actually perceptive of the girls that like him, and is not afraid to act on those inferences. Fanservice is present, but not overt once the plot begins, and the fanservice does not intrude on the plot at all. Art is crisp and sharp, although some facial features look to be off on some of the characters. Overall 9/10. To break it down, 2 for ecchi/fanservice/art  + 2 for plot + 3 for characters +2 for enjoyment equals 9/10.Now to compare to the one and only, ever present, benchmark of High school Dxd, since this is probably one of the few harem ecchi animes that can do battle with DxD. So, extra review/comparison anime time! yes!1. MC: Kasuga v Issei: both are very similar. both have a latent power in them, both are openly perverted, and both are the center of their respective harems. however I have to give the edge here to Kasuga since it seems as if he is much more aware of the affection he is receiving. Issei is also aware but probably either has the biggest set of blue balls in the world because he doesn't know what to do, or is just plain dumb.2. Best girl for MC (personal opinion): Lilith v Rias: again both are similar. Both have red hair, both are powerful, and both are hot hot hot. But here the advantage probably goes to Rias. Although I personally think that Lilith is the hotter one, Rias' motivation and drive is a bit more than Lilith's despite both girls liking the MC about the same. In Rias' case it's Issei's idiocy that prevents little demon children from spawning.3. Story: waiting for more seasons from trinity seven, but comparing season 1 to season 1, I'd give trinity seven the edge here, just because trinity seven moves at a much faster pace, which gave us some more story. Honestly this story has a greater plot than HSDXD. It has a good story with a good premise whereas it seems that DXD was just made so the producers could draw as many tits as possible4. Fanservice: waiting for uncensored Trinity Seven to make an unbiased judgement, but i think its on par to DxDPeace story is not without it's faults.

This is one of very few anime where the main character is well aware of his harem and takes advantage of it.Art style is among one of my favourite I\'ve ever seen in an anime - very easy on the eyes, including a very unique facial structure for each character.  The characters have their own charm in that they stand out from each other quite substantially.  Soundtrack is good when it needs to be.  Storyline is there? I guess?All in all,...I\'d give this anime an average score of 8.I finished this anime a long time ago, so I\'m sure this review might seem quite short but the most important thing I want to say is this: if you want an anime where the MC isn\'t incredibly dense, you should add this to your list.Cheers, friends I\'d give this anime an average score of 8.I finished this anime a long time ago, so I\'m sure this review might seem quite short but the most important thing I want to say is this: if you want an anime where the MC isn\'t incredibly dense, you should add this to your list.Cheers, friends', 'So I just got around to watching Trinity SevenWell, I was looking forward to a Shounen anime having recently completed Kimetsu no Yaiba. I realised I should’ve done more research on the genre since this isn’t exactly what I expected.Nevertheless, this anime isn’t all that bad.The anime sets itself with a moderate storyline, a typical high-school setting and an attempt at exhibiting some sort of divergence amongst other similar anime.The animation was not particularly the anime’s strong suit either....What I enjoyed the most however, was the vast amount of fan service.The girls and their outfits as well as character design in which some were of particular unicity.I also thoroughly enjoyed the abrupt relationship development. Despite it being way too fast with barely any noticeable development the voice actors made it as though the female protagonists willingly want to participate in the MC’s harem.Or rather, the MC naturally attracts these hot bishojos. The male protagonist is however, something I found to be particularly intriguing. His character is unique, he isn’t the shy type and doesn’t care what others think of him. He openly expresses himself and is extremely straightforward to the point where he can casually express his perverted thoughts and personality.Realistically, as of late, 2019 there are multiple anime with MCs like that but considering Trinity Seven is 2014, I’d say the MC was a particularly nice touch.The girls all have very likeable personalities as well while not overly exaggerated like some other harem anime so thank the stars for that.I’d say this anime is very similar to High School DxD if not a less successful or shorter version. Not as much dedication to detail and plot development is put in place, the setting is not as big and the character base is small.Blatantly, a more subpar version of High School DxD.If you’re looking for a harem anime that features multitudes of fan service, echhi and quality waifus as well as a passable plot to stick to with not-so-well-done action scenes but isn’t as long as High School DxDTrinity Seven is what you’re looking for.To summarize, this anime features quality waifus from tsundere to even ara ara and onii sanThe best part is that the MC is fun to watch too because he’s very straightforward and is openly perverted but not too overboardOh and the waifus look so good too. Their character design and voice acting is really kawaii and sexy.Every girl in the anime is waifu material for sure.I enjoyed watching them from Lilith’s cute flustered looks to Yui’s cute and seductive onii chan titillations to Mira’s stern demeanour yet is easily flustered when you know the approach;) and there’s more to come too!If you want one more reason to watch other than the anime being a harem full of hot girls... the voice actors in the anime, some of which are community favourites.Take note that this review may be outdated.

This would've been a mediocre show if not for the two elements that blended together perfectly.To start off, let's talk about the plot. Again, your typical ecchi/harem plot where an ordinary boy meets an extraordinary girl and they fight off anything that stands against them, all the while doing pervy stuff with other girls. I guess the only difference is that the MC already had a love interest in the beginning and fate is just cruel for toying with their relationship.Heroines were disposable, in my opinion. The MC...was uncommon, but not unique. I say this because he does stand out, but only because he has a familiar trait shared with a certain character from another ecchi/harem anime.Yes, the plot wasn't that surprising, but the sound and animation was what caught my attention the most. At first, I thought the animation didn't fit in a series full of fanservice, but I was wrong. As I gradually got into the story, it didn't matter if it had fanservice anymore. The reason: The BGM. The background music really complimented the theme of the series. I saw the animation and the music blending together to make the perfect atmosphere. And I've only seen a few shows do that.All in all, it's a decent anime. I wouldn't exactly say it's good because it still didn't catch my attention. If you're into magic and beautiful girls, then I recommend this anime. It's not a new anime, but it at least deserves a (trinity) seven. was uncommon, but not unique.

Back to focus, i just said 1 sentence:If you wanna search a good show with a good story telling. You dont need to watch this anime first. Seriously, forgive me if i can't keep up myself for being such a dumb and so rude. But i...write this to the fact of my first impression after watching it from first episode. What i feel with this show was a huge confusion, a massive misleading and communication. Which will fail you to enjoy from the first sight.With the story, i wanna say, it is a good, nor the best action drama fantasy show i could really recommended. The idea was about a wizard, or something similar to put it onto your believe. I do not understand the detail, really. You should actually read more material resource story. You know what im talking about? Yeah, the manga. Even they had other spin-off which i dont really care about. Hell, i came here because i just so curious with the characterization, and art (you know what i mean), not with the story from my first thought. Lol, sorry for my intentions.Well, with all of that, i can say, the resource adaptation for this show was so hard for my dumb brain to understand the exact main idea for this show. To be precisely, what is going on this anime universe will get? What is the purpose this story made? Why the male character was so powerfull? Any history about this man? Hell no. And then, the history of the mantra, archive, or even the paladin, King Wizard? No answer. Why must be 7 wizard girls? Its because the 7 sins? What it is? What is the origin of the story? I can't see any explanations suit well with all of that questions at the anime lol. I sighed so hard at that Why, why, why? Many more question unanswered always come, as every episode as the show slowly ended with an open ending route. Sad by me. But not for you, eh? Yeah, hinted right there. Its supposed, we will serve with another season from Trinity Seven series. When? You go to the studio, idk.Ugh, i hate it. You make the show unfinished, for what purpose? To entertain? What are your intensed? The girls? The boobs? I just wanna watch a good story whom can touch my heart pretty hard. But not. You served with not much effort story progressed. But just boom your way with expected fan-service art by exploit ecchiness girls body with lame execution. Yeah, you heard me, lame, so boring. But, you could always like that. Any man reject it? Lol. But not like that. I need a good story with good end too, you god damn!Kinda sorry to myself for watching this. But, time never return back. And i must be warn all of you with this review. Thats why i just give this 7 point out of 7 to the overall point review to this shit show. The reason simply because the story progressing at each episode really suck. And the male character really not suit well to be the best harem character i ever seen. Am i jealous? Yes. Thats why i can't put this show better than 7. But i wont put it to 6 or even 5, though. Cause all the girl ecchiness really save this anime from my miserable review. Glad with that genre. Because the idea of the story really boredom me to the deeper darkness at non existent being.And with another excuse review by me. Such as from music and art section, the studio really put too much energy on those. 9 point for both of that section, to make such a blastous aura at music and art thingy really grown up. I am not joking here. I must thanked for this point of view, cause i really enjoy all of the art of the girl. Especially to the Arin and Yui-chan expression and their whole body! Oh man, that two angel really made my mind blown up. The art really confirmed the moe'ness of that two girls. That why i put some jealousness to the male character for being so fucked at this show. Hell, with one side, i hate this kinda harem genre thing. Eventhough this is not as nasty as harem that TWGOK Series (hope you understand here) show, lately. But fuck it. Why should i watch this show at first impression? Idk. My curiousity really overwhelm my mind for being such a stupid soul.For the last section of the enjoyment. Like my reason above i must give 8 rather than 10 refer to music and art sections reason. However, after 1, 2, 3 episodes, you should get the enjoyment more and more, if you could hold your confusion by just loving all the girl visualisation. What i meant here, 100% enjoyment from the girls moe and cuteness. No match from another series. This is good, yet to be the best. You know what i mean? Yes, genre ecchi really match this anime so much. Really well developed for that accusion. Not for many scene though. But, its okay, really well done, i guess.So, basically, i recommended this show for you, who can got a good picture of a whole cute girls along one season.

Never seen this type of show before at my life, and i really enjoying this until the end (since my main purposed to see a nice body from all of the girls. Lol). Because of that, it is what it is.

I don\'t think I\'ve actually heard anyone I know talking about it, so I thought I\'d take a shot at writing a review for it.Story - 6/10The story of Trinity Seven is, in all honesty, very complex and incoherent. In the first episode, the cast goes over some basic things about how magic in this world works as well as some other things that may need further explanation, such as Grimoires and Breakdown Phenomenons. I\'m not sure if it\'s just me or what, but following everything the characters say...regarding the lore and basics of their world is so complicated. I genuinely don\'t even comprehend what\'s going on half the time. Near the end, I was starting to understand everything a bit more, but certainly not enough for it all to make perfect sense. I suppose the word I\'m looking for in this instance is ""vague."" Then again, it could have just been a case of me not paying attention when they were explaining things, but I digress.Art - 8/10The art is one of many things I absolutely adore in this series. The art style is very nice, though if I were to give a complaint it would be that the colors don\'t really pop as much as some other series I\'ve seen. That being said, the character designs and color schemes are really, really nice, so that\'s why I decided to give the art a 9/10.Sound - 8/10Next, onto the sound. I wholeheartedly believe that all of the voice actors did a fantastic job. I wanted to also mention that this series has a few of my favorite actors, along with some very well-known ones, such as Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and Ayane Sakura. I do believe that each voice actor portrayed his/her character extremely well, which really added to my enjoyment of the series. As for SFX and Music, there\'s nothing too special there. It certainly wasn\'t bad, but nothing special either.Character - 10/10The characters of Trinity Seven are so unforgettable that I had to give this section a 10/10. Because there are so many girls in the series, everyone can find at least one that they can either relate to or consider waifu material. Personally, I adore everyone except for Arin. I\'m just not a fan of her character design, but her personality is fine by my standards. As for characters that particularly stood out to me, I\'d have to go with Arata, Yui, and Lieselotte. I absolutely love Arata\'s character. I would actually consider him one of my favorite MCs in all of anime if I\'m being honest. Yui and Lieselotte are definitely best girls of the series for me, I really can\'t get enough of them. Again, though, I really like all the characters save Arin, but these three really stood out to me.Enjoyment - 9/10This series really sticks with me because of the diverse cast and just how big it is. That\'s really the main reason I found this series so enjoyable, I simply wanted to see a bunch of cute girls and this series was perfect for that.Overall - 8/10With all that being said, I decided to rate it as an 8/10 overall. I really feel like the story is holding this series back so much. If everything was more coherent, I could definitely see Trinity Seven as being one of my favorite anime of all time.

Between the artwork, characters, and sound, I think this is a very solid series that is worth giving it a watch.', 'The interesting thing about watching Trinity Seven wasn’t about the fact that this was a harem. I’ve been watching a lot of anime as of late, where the subjects deal with a lot of harem material, and this show in particular makes it much more than that. The lead character in particular (Arata) doesn’t seem like the male character that goofs up when it comes to being perverted. He leads by being the master of grimorie magic and more importantly he cares about his cousin, Hijiri. In first viewing, the middle half of the series does seem to feel a little clunky, but the jokes...are what keep this show entertaining. The supporting characters like Lilith, Mira and Akio keep the show fresh, and they’re also the reason as to why this score is given.This anime would feel best if you were to able to (literally) separate fantasy and reality, and realize that this isn’t just about a harem. It’s the first male character that does not feel like a stooge for just being pervy on women. This show was a real good one, through and through. are what keep this show entertaining.

It’s the first male character that does not feel like a stooge for just being pervy on women. This show was a real good one, through and through.', 'Beforehand, I want to say that I had high hopes for this series after hearing that it\'s a Harem-based Anime that had an actually competent Harem-Lead/Protagonist.It didn\'t disappoint on the Harem aspects of my expectations up until the final episode which seemed to derail the entire point of a Harem in the first place by showing obvious favoritism towards, of course, the ""best looking""  emotional, jealous, and/or sexually awkward one, who just so happens to also be the first member of the Harem as well.I don\'t know how many times I\'ve seen this trope now, but it needs to just stop because it leaves...the Harem obsolete when you can see this happening from the very start and ""sinks every ship"" while they are still under construction in the dock yard, so to speak.Story 3/10: The story is bad and it should feel bad. The story shouldn\'t be what you are watching this anime for in the first place. Especially after the opening scenes which are virtually the most understandable part of the story to date despite being only 1 episode, if even the full episode long. An important thing to note is that peoples abilities are often inverted from their personality, resulting in differing levels of irony.Don\'t read the manga/source material either, because after the events of the anime and OVA it turns into a complete mess. And it almost completely removes the main drawpoint of the series, the Harem-Ecchi, so that it can try to continue the main plot in a way that feels as though it is made up on the spot page-by-page.Art 7/10: Decent art, especially good when the Ecchi comes into play as the Ecchi is the main drawpoint and therefore gets emphasized. It is also obvious that they reuse scenes and animations at some points, although not to a large detriment.Sound 5/10: Average, nothing downright terrible or good. Sometimes you get thrown off by a bizarrely poor sound effect(s) and it leaves you reeling in shock or makes you question what you just heard.Character 7/10: Most of the characters are entertaining to at least some degree. The most entertaining being the Ecchi or ""Harem Happy"" ones, which is basically all of them but Lilith. A quick description of the main characters:Arata - Protagonist, inherently perverted and admits it. Everybody knows that he wants to save his ""Girlfriend"" Hijiri, but in most cases ignores this fact for their own gains. Great chemistry with Levi.Hijiri - Main love interest and cousin. Not actually his cousin though. Appears to be Arata\'s Achilles-Heel and is liable to make decisions based around her future.Lilith - Boring prude that ironically has one of the most attractive bodies. Sexually awkward and almost always jealous or embarrassed. Her only key feature for comedy, although it becomes very redundant and old, is her being a literal stalker or otherwise having inexplicable timing to ruin anybodies chances of getting farther with Arata.Arin - Generic Emotionless Albino. Can be funny when she tries to poorly imitate emotion. She is also identical to Hijiri and believes herself to be Arata\'s destined wife before even meeting him.Levi the Ninja - One of the best characters in the show. Is willing to do anything to help the Harem-Lead Arata ""get off"" so to speak. Frequently fondles other girls breasts, sabotages their clothing, and suggests/approves perverted ideas. Has some sort of sexual attraction to Arata as well, leading him on with extremely provocative ""word choice"" in the Manga. A Fan Favourite for obvious reasons.Liese - The older of a pair of twins. She is more ""developed"" and sexually aggressive. Has strong feelings towards Arata because of story events, but gets derailed in her attempts to further their relationship because of a certain someones jealousy.Yui - A loli with large breasts and a big-brother-complex(Instant-Harem-Win). Unlike other characters, she is perfectly fine with being Arata\'s mistress instead of future wife.Mira - Overly serious and sexually awkward. Closet pervert apparently with conflicting conscious about it. Very conceited.Akio - The daughter of a nun... what. Not specifically part of Arata\'s Harem, she is more of a supporting friend.Enjoyment 6/0: The anime itself is fairly enjoyable as it never tries to force the nonsensical story and focus\'s more on the Harem and Ecchi Elements. The story is obviously there to direct the latter elements forward, but it is by no means the main driving force behind wanting to watch this anime whatsoever.If there is a Season 2, it will be rather disappointing. The story becomes the focus for some reason while at the same time being entire leagues worse, like, what the hell is this worse, and removing a majority of the ecchi/harem elements. It becomes borderline undo-able nonsense past the story arc that gives 2 characters a backstory, 1 good backstory for Akio, and 1 unbelievably-dumb backstory for Lilith that made no sense.Also to note is that the ending of the anime starts to derail its own Harem with obvious favoritism. The Manga however does have the upside of subverting the obvious favoritism by leading two of the other characters onto the ""viable ship"".Overall 6/10: It was a fairly enjoyable watch, and I actually hope this Anime doesn\'t get a second season because of the sad state the story arcs that follow are in. the Harem obsolete when you can see this happening from the very start and ""sinks every ship"" while they are still under construction in the dock yard, so to speak.Story 3/10: The story is bad and it should feel bad.

The plot is great but when the fan service kicks in for certain episodes you get the headache of dealing with an ecchi episode/scene. They are okay but it often doesn't go along with a plot and is really unnecessary. However the main story is great, just the fan service sucks... Art is great in every scene, no cheap shortcuts. Characters just suddenly lose their main characteristic that distinguishes them against the mc which I rated an 8.

If you hace an ounce of self esteem don't waste your time in it."", ""Well, it's happened again.  I've gone into a show with no expectations, only to find a surprising little gem that's somewhat outside what I would consider my typical fare.  Unlike with some other options, Trinity Seven does at least somewhat advertise as something with elements that I would want – the story of Arata, a relative nobody who seeks out magical power only to turn out to be fairly awesome, is pretty cliched and has been done a lot of times, but some of those times it's been done smartly, and I'm something of a sucker for smart and/or stylish fantasy worlds, the...likes of which such a premise will often serve up.I was not, however, prepared for how far into Ecchi this show goes.  It's not just having the occasional “harem comedy” moment or designs for the female characters that are focused on their assets, it's a pretty constant barrage of non-explicit nudity and grabbed boobs, with a pervy attitude from our lead to encourage the matter beyond what the writers could have contrived on their own.  It gets... awkward.  And shame-inducing.  And the show puts its worst foot forward, where the first couple episodes don't have a ton else going for them (or so you might think) other than the Ecchi/Harem game.But, I decided to see the show through to the end, and I'm glad I did.  While some works will use fanservice aspects alongside plot without the two really interacting outside of maybe one or two moments, and others will even attempt to use an avalanche of fanservice to replace actually having a good story and compelling character, Trinity Seven manages to actually use its ecchi moments in a constructing manner, springboarding through jokes to interesting characterization and an actually somewhat compelling story.The cast is... really good.  Counting Arata, there are at least nine major characters you have to keep track of for this show.  Some of them are pretty one-note jokes (looking at you, Arin) but more of them... aren't.  The girls, and their relationships with our lead, become more and more realized over the course of the show, and none of them, not even the most thinly sketched, is entirely bereft of a personality outside of their visual design.  Lieselotte, Mira, and Lilith go a step beyond, where I think they could hold their own as interesting people even divorced from their current narrative magnetism.  Hijiri, Levi, and Akio aren't far behind.  They're memorable characters, and not at all because they're sometimes rendered nude by their circimstances.And yet, the Ecchi elements actually add in.  I'll use Mira as an example – because of Ecchi/Harem antics, she and Arata get off on the wrong foot, and she initially forms a negative opinion of him, meaning that they have a hard time at first when circumstances force them to work together.  In those circumstances, Mira ends up depowered and disrobed (it makes sense in context), and starts to bond with Arata because... he's a reasonable person and not a one-note slimeball, so he shows some character and humanity by treating her situation with decency and respect.  This also goes to show the audience how serious the predicament the characters are in is, because normally Arata would at least take the opportunity to make a crack or two, but in this case he doesn't, and it feels natural that he doesn't.  They have a chance to talk about their thoughts, feelings, and problems like reasonable people, and you can actually believe that they start to form a stronger positive bond that's later necessary to help overcome the challenges they face.Here, fanservice hasn't been served up alongside the plot and it's not trying to replace the plot; it's there, and not going anywhere, but it's fully integrated and actually kind of beautifully woven together.  The awkward Ecchi sequences, rather than existing half outside of continuity, can be springboards for character comedy, legitimate drama, and even sometimes poignant moments.  This kind of material is everywhere in Trinity Seven, particularly as the show goes on, and it makes what could have been a mindless exercise in titillation actually something greater, something that I'm glad has a continuing story because I'm actually looking forward to more of it.As far as the main story?  That's again, more interesting and involved than it had to be.  It's got some over-the-top cheesy bits (I think the Biblia Academy might be the only fictional school-for-specials with a worse Academics and Safety track record than Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted) but it also has intriguing elements, some legitimate moments of suspense, and interesting worldbuilding with a clever take on the nature of magic (which ties back to exploring the inner feelings of characters) and a good conflict between the main heroes and the antagonists that emerge, which is grounded in a topic of legitimate enough import to warrant the conflict in the show with a nature sufficiently two-sided that while we're rooting for the heroes we don't fail to see the villains as reasonable beings with something of a point to their actions and legitimate motivations with a goal that non-insane individuals could be seen supporting.In that, Trinity Seven is actually a surprising rarity.  Despite presenting a rather immature face to the world, if you're willing to look a little closer it actually treats its story with far more serious weight than many other shows do.  Villains aren't just evil for the sake of being evil or because they're insane, and while our protagonists are certainly hooked into themes that run very deep in their world, there's a palpable sense of a conflict that predates them and isn't predicated entirely on THIS incarnation, right now, as being uniquely special.  It's the one were' watching, and the only one these characters can interact with, but in a way it's a good thing that the grand conflict is about what the heroes are and not who they are while the more immediate conflicts are all about who the characters are rather than what.It's a very stylish show, too.  The voice acting and music, though nothing really special on their own, help support the necessary mood swings and strong characters and action, and the designs... I'll try to avoid saying too much about the Ecchi elements – the leading ladies are very much all easy on the eyes, as they should be – but the art is good in general.  The characters have well-defined designs and look good and also (except where intentional) distinctive in a variety of different modes, which also help convey the nature of the moment.  The animation flows well, and there's a decent artistry to the use of magic in the show that helps it feel like it has some weight to it.  The visual creativity for spellcraft isn't the best here, but it's also not too shabby, and you can look at some of Trinity Seven's magic in action and kind of tell what the spell does and probably how strong it is in a relative sense based on how it looks.  The action is on the good end of run-of-the-mill – it's not really epic, but there is some creative intelligence to it and a basic understanding that it's more interesting when brains as well as (arcane) brawn plays a part in conflict.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 8Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 8Total: 8Verdict: Trinity Seven is better written than it has any right to be, and has earned my respect because of it.  If you just can't tolerate Ecchi, you might want to give the show a pass, but if you're willing to give Trinity Seven the time it needs to grow into something bigger and better than what it looks like at first glance, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. likes of which such a premise will often serve up.I was not, however, prepared for how far into Ecchi this show goes.

This kind of material is everywhere in Trinity Seven, particularly as the show goes on, and it makes what could have been a mindless exercise in titillation actually something greater, something that I'm glad has a continuing story because I'm actually looking forward to more of it.As far as the main story?  That's again, more interesting and involved than it had to be.  It's got some over-the-top cheesy bits (I think the Biblia Academy might be the only fictional school-for-specials with a worse Academics and Safety track record than Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted) but it also has intriguing elements, some legitimate moments of suspense, and interesting worldbuilding with a clever take on the nature of magic (which ties back to exploring the inner feelings of characters) and a good conflict between the main heroes and the antagonists that emerge, which is grounded in a topic of legitimate enough import to warrant the conflict in the show with a nature sufficiently two-sided that while we're rooting for the heroes we don't fail to see the villains as reasonable beings with something of a point to their actions and legitimate motivations with a goal that non-insane individuals could be seen supporting.In that, Trinity Seven is actually a surprising rarity.  Despite presenting a rather immature face to the world, if you're willing to look a little closer it actually treats its story with far more serious weight than many other shows do.  Villains aren't just evil for the sake of being evil or because they're insane, and while our protagonists are certainly hooked into themes that run very deep in their world, there's a palpable sense of a conflict that predates them and isn't predicated entirely on THIS incarnation, right now, as being uniquely special.  It's the one were' watching, and the only one these characters can interact with, but in a way it's a good thing that the grand conflict is about what the heroes are and not who they are while the more immediate conflicts are all about who the characters are rather than what.It's a very stylish show, too.  The voice acting and music, though nothing really special on their own, help support the necessary mood swings and strong characters and action, and the designs... I'll try to avoid saying too much about the Ecchi elements – the leading ladies are very much all easy on the eyes, as they should be – but the art is good in general.  The characters have well-defined designs and look good and also (except where intentional) distinctive in a variety of different modes, which also help convey the nature of the moment.  The animation flows well, and there's a decent artistry to the use of magic in the show that helps it feel like it has some weight to it.  The visual creativity for spellcraft isn't the best here, but it's also not too shabby, and you can look at some of Trinity Seven's magic in action and kind of tell what the spell does and probably how strong it is in a relative sense based on how it looks.  The action is on the good end of run-of-the-mill – it's not really epic, but there is some creative intelligence to it and a basic understanding that it's more interesting when brains as well as (arcane) brawn plays a part in conflict.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 8Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 8Total: 8Verdict: Trinity Seven is better written than it has any right to be, and has earned my respect because of it.  If you just can't tolerate Ecchi, you might want to give the show a pass, but if you're willing to give Trinity Seven the time it needs to grow into something bigger and better than what it looks like at first glance, I would wholeheartedly recommend it."", ""Finally! An MC with confidence who's not afraid of pussy!Long reviews waste your time, so here's one short paragraph.TS has a very distorted magic system that's not much to care for. The music is nothing special. The plot is pretty lame. However, the MC makes this anime shine. The dude is not afraid of women and he's loaded with sly comments on the subject. There is a tiny bit of fanservice and it's highly censored so they don't draw nipples. The cast of women is very nice and I've heard some voice acting complaints. Let me just say that there is no problems with...the voice acting and all characters voices fit the characters fine. Thank god they didn't include some brat character with pigtails that slaps the MC every 47 seconds. All in all, TS is a good anime sprinkled with fanservice and loaded with comedy.Pros:-Funny as hell.-Medium fanservice.-Confident MC who's not afraid of women.-Great voice acting.-Great character cast.-Decent soundtrack.-No loud brat/sister with pigtails archetype.Cons:-Confusing magic system.-Mediocre story.-High censorship.-No nipples. the voice acting and all characters voices fit the characters fine.

From this, I expected a story filled with mystery, action, and potential character development.  Sadly, such expectations were not entirely met.  The issue lies in the method of explanations and fanservice.  Although I was thankful that this anime explained all magic related topics in great detail, the issue was that said explanations took too long and, for that reason, became a little complicated.  If I recall, I think half of some episodes were explanation alone, making much of the episodes a bit boring considering my initial expectations.  And what was happening when it wasn\'t boring?  It was perverted.  Given the protagonist\'s personality, he didn\'t waste any time to turn a conversation into something sexual.  And, like the explanations, these scenarios went for a long time.  As for the action, the fights were very short and anticlimactic given the protagonist\'s overpowered abilities, the constant dialog, and abrupt endings.  The biggest disappointment was itself with a very short and boring fight coupled with the fact that half of this episode (spoilers) suddenly becomes a ""normal"" day, completely destroying the tension the show built up to at that point.  In a nutshell, what wasn\'t slightly complicated was perverse.  If you\'re looking for a story driven anime, look somewhere else.Art - 7The fighting animations, as short as they were, were actually well done and the constant dark lighting definitely helps to set the mood, whether it\'s for the dark serious tones or the sexually-hinted tones.  And believe me, this is an upside considering the fact that you\'ll be looking at the same scenario for a long time.Sound - 10Now, THIS is something to praise this anime for!  Even though this is only a 12 episode show, there are 5 endings that are not only catchy but also spirit lifting (although, this show really isn\'t dark enough to you to require spirit lifting).  As for the one opening, it\'s intense drive definitely gets your blood pumping to build up for the assumed ""tension"" that the episodes would provide.  Even if ""Trinity Seven"" isn\'t your cup of tea, I would still recommend listening to its music on your own time.Character - 5Although there is some changes in fighting prowess for the protagonist, that\'s literally the only development that exists in this show.  The protagonist is openly perverted but an otherwise cool character, making the harem vibe a bit unique and, depending on your tastes, appealing for a lead role.  However, with his battles being boring and his personality slowly becoming a running gag, his personality might lose its luster to some viewers, myself included.  As for the female characters...sadly there isn\'t much to say.  The only two purposes they had, in my opinion, were to either power up the protagonist or to provide fanservice.  Otherwise, their backgrounds, personalities, and overall contribution to the plot felt quite irrelevant.  Sadly, this anime is more character driven than plot driven and that\'s not saying much.Enjoyment - 6I must admit, the first few episodes seemed very promising and I did enjoy the protagonist\'s unique personality (at least for a harem lead) for the majority of the show.  However, as the series went on, the same perverse content, short and boring battles, and the constant long explanations got to me and made me lose interest quickly.Overall - 6If you want intense battles, character development, more action and less talking, this anime isn\'t for you.  However, if you like a detailed magic system, a constant ecchi/harem vibe, and a unique lead, I would recommend this to you.  Granted, I wasn\'t too happy with the outcome, but the overall show, looking back on it, had lots of potential.  It was simply wasted potential.  Hopefully the upcoming movie will do better.

Hopefully the upcoming movie will do better.', ""Warning possible SpoilersNow I'm a guy who does love their Harems and fanservice, but that doesn't mean I'll enjoy every aspect of it and this series pretty much showed me how repetitive Harem anime's could get.The story begins with Arata Kasuga whose town is destroyed and his cousin Hijiri Kasuga kidnapped, however thanks to a magical grimoire that takes him to the Royal Biblia Academy he meets 7 girls who each represent one of the 7 Deadly Sins and he needs their help.First off this anime was pretty damn boring, it was difficult for me to focus on it since by the time I got...to it, it was the same stuff I have seen before in other anime's that was done better, there were some moments that were fun which were pretty much the fighting scenes, but that was really it to be honest.It was kinda interesting learning about the powers and how they worked in this anime, but it didn't keep me hooked for long considering I have seen these kind of powers done in other anime's that did it much better than this and of course as almost every Harem anime that has action it there is a cliffhanger of sorts from what I can remember that obviously set's up sequel which led to the Movie which is debatable whether I'll watch it or not.Now the main the characters are supposed to be the strongest part for an anime like this, but I really didn't like most of the characters in this show mainly because they were either boring or just annoyed me.The female characters consisted of Lilith, Levi, Lieselotte and her sister Selina, Yui, Arin, Mira and Akio whose powers each represent a piece of the 7 deadly sins.Lilith is the leader and has a giant sniper rifle as her weapon of choice plus she is pretty much a Tsundere as she's always giving Arata a hard time especially when he is doing pervy things, but she can be a nice person if given the chance to let her open up.Levi is a Ninja and mainly relies on her speed to defeat her enemies, she's a bit of a mischievous person and takes a liking to Arata straight away.Lieselotte is an ex member of the trinity seven who went her separate ways after an incident until Arata needed her help for something, she can be a very flirty person and always does this around Arata whenever she see's him.Selina who is Lieselotte's sister is a student reporter and because her sister is or was a member of the trinity seven is able to get closer to the members and is a bit of a bookworm too hence her higher knowledge of things.Yui is pretty much the cute member of the team and is very different to everyone else, she is considered a special mage and can communicate to others by dreams, she was rescued by Arata and the others which made her grew very fond of him very quickly.Arin is a mysterious girl who shows very little emotion and after being seen nude in the baths by Arata she immediately makes him her arranged husband and over time she does show more emotions thanks to Arata's actions.Mira is another Tsundere who uses a glass globe to use her powers and immediately hates Arata until he starts acting more heroic around her which makes her to start changing her mind.Finally Akio is Mira's best friend and her powers mainly rely on her offensive capabilities like punching or kicking, she is a bit more smug than Mira and can be a bit of a joker at times.Most of these females characters I didn't like mainly because they felt boring and just didn't get to me, the only ones I kinda liked were Lilith and Yui who were at least likeable in some way.Arata the main character of the series is surprisingly well done for a Harem protagonist mainly because despite being a big perv he isn't afraid be pervy around the girls and he has a very cocky, douchebag like attitude which actually made him a likeable character and then there is Sora who is the Grimoire that Arata acquires, she can be witty, but her character really doesn't go that far since you only see her in human form a few times.The artstyle didn't really grab me apart from the powers which did look pretty cool when they were used, but other than there really wasn't much that stood out for me, well maybe there was few parts like when Arata had to travel to the dungeon that was holding Yui I thought that was pretty cool at least.Hell even the fanservice or Ecchi was pretty disappointing, what is supposed to make your female characters gain some attention didn't really do much for me and just felt disappointing and out of place.The action wasn't too bad and the fights did get better over time, but it wasn't really enough to keep me very interested in the show.Overall this was a disappointing show and it was just another pure example of why most Harem anime' can be boring and repetitive, if you're interested in Harem's and fanservice you might find something here, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. to it, it was the same stuff I have seen before in other anime's that was

""Action, Harem, Comedy, Supernatural, Magic, Romance, Ecchi, Fantasy, School, Shounen"" That\'s the list of genres included in this 12 episode series, and there wasn\'t enough time to full encompass any of it, simply because all of these genres need different things. Romance and Comedy...genres work off character driven story arcs, Harem and Ecchi runs on fan service, Action requires plot driven arcs, and lastly, magic/supernatural/fantasy requires increased exposition. You simply don\'t have the time to complete all of that in a 12 episode series, which is why we end up with a bunch of random exposition dumps that are randomly interrupted by boobs. The magic system is over-the-top levels of complicated, without any proper explanation because boobs are easier than thinking so we\'ll just distract you with fan service so you don\'t question the logistics of the exposition that we think we need to deliver.Art; 7, The art\'s quality was both decent and it had a consistent quality throughout the anime, which is always a plus. However there was never any level of animation that I would go as far as to say, ""it impressed me"".Sound; 7, Honestly I enjoyed the OP and the ED of this series quite a bit, but wasn\'t a huge fan of a couple character\'s voices (English dub). There wasn\'t any background OST I felt was noteworthy.Character; 8, The shining point of this series as a whole. Like any Harem, you have your troupes, but the characters tend to feel like more than just troupes alone. I hate feeling the need to state this, but troupes are not an inherently bad thing, its actually quite the contrary. Troupes exist because they work, the problem occurs when the writer attempts to use a troupe, and think that\'s enough. The troupes simply serve as a baseline to quickly establish certain characters, but they need to be developed into more of than that over the course of the series. Certain girls in this show are developed better than others, but what do you expect, when it was a twelve episode series and they created a harem cast with (technically if we include the cousin) 9 girls. That means no girl is getting more than an episode and a half of development which certainly hurts the series and its characters.The shining point that we\'ve been awaiting though is the Main Character, Arata, who I found to be quite enjoyable. I\'ve tacked this onto a review before because of it being a harem, and I think now is another time to bring up my rule of ""there are only 3 types of MC a harem can be created around"". First, you have the oblivious idiot (think of the MC from Nisekoi), this character is so stupidly oblivious that he actually doesn\'t realize that all the women in his life are into him. Second, disinterested in love MC (MC from Haganai; I Don\'t have many friends), this character is typically aware that he all these women are crushing on him, but his disinterest in love keeps them at bay; he often acts like the oblivious idiot in order to avoid having to deal with the women in the harem. Harem King MC (MC from HighSchool DXD), this guy actually wants a harem, and is usually a massive pervert to boot. Arata (the MC of Trinity Seven) is one of the unique cases where the MC kinda falls into two of these categories. Arata is a massive pervert, and has no problem with the idea of having his own harem of women, but that alone doesn\'t truly make him a ""Harem King MC"", the defining factor that he\'s missing is that the ""Harem King MC"" usually has his goal as having his own harem, whereas Arata thinks more along the lines of ""if I ended up having a harem, that\'d be cool"", but his actual goal is finding out what happened to his cousin. Although he isn\'t completely disinterested in love, this does give him overlapping similarities with the ""uninterested in love MC""; specifically in regards to the fact that his focus in trying to get his cousin back, which helps to prevent things from completely derailing into full-blown harem and fan-service.Enjoyment; 8, I\'ll be the first to say that this might be a generous score, but at the end of the day, when I decided to watch Trinity Seven I wasn\'t looking for something with deep and amazingly well-thought out story. I was looking for something that had enough depth for me to be able to care a little about the characters, but past that, I wasn\'t setting the bar very high with my expectations going into this simply because I mainly only watched this to distract myself from own loneliness, sorry if that sounds depressing, but being quarantined has drastically limited my social interaction.Overall; 7, As a writer, giving a 7 overall to an anime when I gave its story a 4, feels wrong, but honestly Trinity Seven wasn\'t bad by any means. It certainly tried to do more than it could, perhaps if they had simplified the magic system we wouldn\'t be dealing with the constant info dumps which certainly would\'ve been a nice improvement, but hell, where\'s the fun in actually explaining stuff when it only prevents you from being able to make asspulls whenever you want? Oh, right, its more fun for the audience when they can actually appreciate the moves the characters do because its been properly explained to them, and they can sit there and actually use their brains while watching, whatever, my point is DO NOT watch this for its uninspired story or its joke of a ""magic system"". If you watch this, it should be for its comedy, its characters, or because you just want to see lots of fan service. If you watch it for almost any other reason, I\'m quite certain you will leave disappointed. genres work off character driven story arcs, Harem and Ecchi runs on fan service, Action requires plot driven arcs, and lastly, magic/supernatural/fantasy requires increased exposition. You simply don\'t have the time to complete all of that in a 12 episode series, which is why we end up with a bunch of random exposition dumps that are randomly interrupted by boobs. The magic system is over-the-top levels of complicated, without any proper explanation because boobs are easier than thinking so we\'ll just distract you with fan service so you don\'t question the logistics of the exposition that we think we need to deliver.Art; 7, The art\'s quality was both decent and it had a consistent quality throughout the anime, which is always a plus. However there was never any level of animation that I would go as far as to say, ""it impressed me"".Sound; 7, Honestly I enjoyed the OP and the ED of this series quite a bit, but wasn\'t a huge fan of a couple character\'s voices (English dub). There wasn\'t any background OST I felt was noteworthy.Character; 8, The shining point of this series as a whole. Like any Harem, you have your troupes, but the characters tend to feel like more than just troupes alone. I hate feeling the need to state this, but troupes are not an inherently bad thing, its actually quite the contrary. Troupes exist because they work, the problem occurs when the writer attempts to use a troupe, and think that\'s enough. The troupes simply serve as a baseline to quickly establish certain characters, but they need to be developed into more of than that over the course of the series. Certain girls in this show are developed better than others, but what do you expect, when it was a twelve episode series and they created a harem cast with (technically if we include the cousin) 9 girls. That means no girl is getting more than an episode and a half of development which certainly hurts the series and its characters.The shining point that we\'ve been awaiting though is the Main Character, Arata, who I found to be quite enjoyable. I\'ve tacked this onto a review before because of it being a harem, and I think now is another time to bring up my rule of ""there are only 3 types of MC a harem can be created around"". First, you have the oblivious idiot (think of the MC from Nisekoi), this character is so stupidly oblivious that he actually doesn\'t realize that all the women in his life are into him. Second, disinterested in love MC (MC from Haganai; I Don\'t have many friends), this character is typically aware that he all these women are crushing on him, but his disinterest in love keeps them at bay; he often acts like the oblivious idiot in order to avoid having to deal with the women in the harem. Harem King MC (MC from HighSchool DXD), this guy actually wants a harem, and is usually a massive pervert to boot. Arata (the MC of Trinity Seven) is one of the unique cases where the MC kinda falls into two of these categories. Arata is a massive pervert, and has no problem with the idea of having his own harem of women, but that alone doesn\'t truly make him a ""Harem King MC"", the defining factor that he\'s missing is that the ""Harem King MC"" usually has his goal as having his own harem, whereas Arata thinks more along the lines of ""if I ended up having a harem, that\'d be cool"", but his actual goal is finding out what happened to his cousin. Although he isn\'t completely disinterested in love, this does give him overlapping similarities with the ""uninterested in love MC""; specifically in regards to the fact that his focus in trying to get his cousin back, which helps to prevent things from completely derailing into full-blown harem and fan-service.Enjoyment; 8, I\'ll be the first to say that this might be a generous score, but at the end of the day, when I decided to watch Trinity Seven I wasn\'t looking for something with deep and amazingly well-thought out story. I was looking for something that had enough depth for me to be able to care a little about the characters, but past that, I wasn\'t setting the bar very high with my expectations going into this simply because I mainly only watched this to distract myself from own loneliness, sorry if that sounds depressing, but being quarantined has drastically limited my social interaction.Overall; 7, As a writer, giving a 7 overall to an anime when I gave its story a 4, feels wrong, but honestly Trinity Seven wasn\'t bad by any means. It certainly tried to do more than it could, perhaps if they had simplified the magic system we wouldn\'t be dealing with the constant info dumps which certainly would\'ve been a nice improvement, but hell, where\'s the fun in actually explaining stuff when it only prevents you from being able to make asspulls whenever you want? Oh, right, its more fun for the audience when they can actually appreciate the moves the characters do because its been properly explained to them, and they can sit there and actually use their brains while watching, whatever, my point is DO NOT watch this for its uninspired story or its joke of a ""magic system"".

The story is well paced and the characters put together create a well-rounded community. I suggest watching this with an open mind for this is one of the best harem anime out there.The MC Arata is perverted and admits it. He has the guts to do and say what most harem MC don't. The heroines are not well rounded, however there are pluses. The girls are all different and they go through character development throughout the anime. The downside is that if all the personalities of the heroines were combined into one girl...then that girl would be the best girl ever. Sadly it's not like that. Each girl is different and that's what I like.Watching this anime, you need to consider being open minded. The pacing is a bit rushed sometimes, but the story is well explained. Don't rush through and read every subtitle.Overall, the artwork is not too shabby. I think it was low budget to start out so be mindful. The Characters are great. Story is well explained.

And it is set in wague world with some (secret) magick.

That is easily more than half the ""what people watched all 12 episodes of Trinity Seven for"" piechart, and the rest is probably just people in denial about why they watched Trinity Seven. Like me, I just watched it to WARN YOU ABOUT THE NAKED LOLIs I SWEAR ON MY LIFE... *clears throat* and now we see if I can finish the review before the FBI get here.The Story is boring...and just there to setup the fanservice. The fanservice is kind of trash tier because they get 70-99% of the way to doin stuff and there\'s lots of dirty talk (one of the redeeming qualities of the show), but ain\'t nobody doin stuff. That is the essence of this show - missed connections, blue balls, and a wholesome harem of overpowered magical girls with cool outfits who are naked half the time occasionally fighting some truly incomprehensible good vs. evil battle for existence. There are some halfway decent ideas at play in the plot, and we discover that the bad guys are sympathetic and the ""greater threat"" is actually pretty interesting and would have been worth a more serious treatment. But alas.This show\'s artwork is like, 85% naked children. The other 15% is somewhat interesting fantasy character designs, surprisingly fun abilities, and very repetitious backgrounds with the occasional standout like the sunset over the town. A passable mix of CGI and animation for the fight scenes, it is unfortunate then that almost no matches between well matched opponents occur except for the ninja girl\'s fights which are all much better than everyone else\'s for some reason.

That would have made this something the could have lasted, because the problem with the show is really as simple as there being no time leftover after all the fanservice to develop a plot. Just the lecherous headmaster would have been more than enough to cover the creeper fanservice angle management clearly wanted covered here, and I feel that the powers at play would have been far more interesting without the MCs storyline being the one to set the stage. A journey of the kunoichi character through this world, looking for somebody and then finding them in the grips of an ""evil orginization"" that turns out to be not so evil would have been a great twist on the Shonen formula that would have worked because the ninja chick\'s personality is strong enough to support it.

The action didnt appeal to me at all, and the fact that they spend 5 minutes chatting before beginning the actual battle, felt...very unrealistic. Yes, dialogue is important in the fight sequence, but this anime makes it seem as if they were a group of friends having mock battles. They're wasnt any hostility. Overall, a decent anime, not too good, not so bad. very unrealistic.

Overall, a decent anime, not too good, not so bad."", 'In a nutshell, Trinity Seven is: a generic setting with a magic academy, a demon lord and such; heavily sexualized female characters with generic personalities and, thankfully, a better than usual protagonist.THE PROTAGONIST ISN’T SO BAD FOR A HAREM LEADThe protagonist, Arata, isn’t so bad in the sense that he doesn’t have the annoying characteristics that most harem protagonists have, namely: idiocy, naivety, the “white knight” attitude, weakness, shyness, and unawareness of the fact that most of the girls around him are desperate to have sexual intercourse with him. Rather, Arata is a pretty powerful dude with piercing eyes who speaks without hesitation and is...honest with the fact that he is a pervert. Well, to be fair he isn’t the only harem lead who is an unrepentant pervert, there’s also Issei in Highschool DxD. But contrary to Issei, Arata isn’t motivated solely by his desire to grope girls’ boobs, and doesn’t yell all the time with an irritating voice like an imbecile.STILL VERY GENERIC, THOUGHUnfortunately, the rest of the cast isn’t nearly as good as Arata. As in any harem / ecchi anime, female characters only exist to be either cute or sexy, and as a result most of them are just stereotypes: Arin is the inexpressive girl who doesn’t talk much and speak in a monotone voice; Akio is the tomboy, Lilith and Mira are two variations of the tsundere archetype – because one tsundere wasn’t enough, I guess! Of course they didn’t forgot to add a loli character to please the ped- I mean the “lolicons”. The only thing that’s slightly different from other harems is that many of the female characters are as perverted (or as straightforward?) as the protagonist. You also have the academy president, the only other male character, whose only personality is being a pervert, which is sometimes funny, sometimes repetitive.Though the comedy can be, at rare moments, quite funny, most of the time it’s the generic and predictable ecchi “humor” such as Arata always ending up fondling a girl’s boobs after a fall, or the fact that his magic can destroy magic clothing, creating countless situations where the characters end up naked. These situations aren’t funny. They’re cliché, repetitive and annoying. There’s even a scene where Arata and the girls are trapped in a room with no bathroom, and suddenly the girls need to pee, and they start moaning and blushing as if they were in a hentai. What is even the point of this scene? Comedy? Cuteness? Turning the spectator on? Well too bad! In all these categories, it failed.THE STORYAs expected from a harem / ecchi anime, the story is generic and weak. TL;DR: Overpowered demon lord protagonist comes to an all-girl’s magic academy to learn magic and find his cousin, meets a bunch of powerful mage girls called the “Trinity Seven”, and fights evil mages.There are tons of dialogues and explanations about how magic is supposed to work but it’s all bullcrap, and I doubt that anyone actually payed attention to it. Magic in this anime is just cheap shiny special effects, which sometimes doesn’t even look like magic, and can do pretty much anything, including teleportation, modern weaponry, and some sort of futuristic computer screens. The terminology is… ugh… extremely annoying. Attack names are just two random non-japanese words put together. Arata doesn’t know anything about magic, but it doesn’t matter since he is overpowered from the beginning, and needs little training.Other annoying elements in the story include a beach visit as early as episode 3, and the fact that the grimoire of one of the evil mages is a goddamn tablet computer.SOUND AND ANIMATION: ALRIGHTProduction-wise, this show performs fairly well. Though the outside backgrounds look dull –  there’s a lot of photographic backgrounds, which look ugly – and the magic attacks look cheap, the animation is nice and clean. The inside of the buildings and the props look good. Character designs and clothing were rather generic, but at least they were well drawn. The most remarkable thing in the animation is the face designs, particularly the eyes, which are really pretty. Sound-wise, there was nothing wrong with the voice-acting and, as I said earlier, the protagonist doesn’t have an irritating voice, which is a plus. The background music was alright and fitted the mood. The opening was also alright if you can forgive the awful engrish – so awful that the fansubbers have to translate it!CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, Trinity Seven doesn’t have much to offer. As any harem / ecchi, its characters are lackluster and its story is just a bad excuse to show the protagonist ending up with his face between one of the girls’ legs or boobs every two minutes. While its protagonist is pretty alright compared to other series of the same type and the animation does look nice, it isn’t enough to make the show good or enjoyable. honest with the fact that he is a pervert.

However I gotta admit Trinity Seven wasn\'t as bad as I thought it might be. Trinity Seven certainly wasn\'t no revolutionary anime that\'ll change how people view harems, but at least it had some decent fights scenes to distract me from how repetitive the harem scenes could be.The few fight scenes were one of the few interesting things about this anime, of course these fight scenes were nothing I haven\'t seen before but they were somewhat cool....For the most part they weren\'t overly ... ""Lewd"". Most of the time during the fight scenes it was focused mostly on action instead of trying to force some ""lewdness"" into the fight scenes, except a couple fight scenes did have quite a bit of ""lewdness"" in it... Especially the last few fight scenes.All the girl\'s we\'re just generic cute trash. And the main character (surprise, surprise, was a cocky son of a gun) However there is one thing I like about him, whenever he was making sexual jokes, they never tried to make him into this ""innocent child"" who just happens to get into the quirky issues, from the start of this anime they showed that he\'s not gonna be ""innocent"" and will certainly be fine with pulling a few strings to get some ""Fun"" time. In terms of characters that\'s about the only good / somewhat unique thing they had going for them.Honestly, I don\'t recommend watching Trinity Seven. At the very best it had decent fight scenes, However if you\'re looking for fight scene\'s i\'d just recommend FMA or AOT or something focused on action... If you want a reason to watch this show, watch it for the Harem side. I\'m not a fan of Harem\'s so I don\'t know too many ""good"" harems but I think this one did it\'s job pretty well and at least gave me a chuckle once or twice.

I have to force my eyes open so I can finish this anime.I watch it because the MC isn't dense like any other anime, but I can't help but find this anime boring. I personally don't like the art style too. well maybe bcs I watch it in 2021 so its not relevant anymore? idkThe plot is basic, a boy who got OP out of blue but can't control it > go to magic high school > make his own harem kingdom.what about defeating the powerful enemy? well if he can't, his...OP power or his uncontrollable self will do it eventuallyI've tried reading the manga, but yeah I can't lie about not liking the art style.

He\'s...arrogant and usually tells everything he has on his mind, including opinions on girls proportions and appearances. Sadly other characters are mostly cliche. Tsundere girl, check. That wouldn\'t be a problem, but most anime (mainly Ecchi) tsundere girls have pretty much the same personality with no unique traits, they pretty much exists to be always angry at the MC for petty reasons. That one person, who doesn\'t like our MC, but eventually begins to like him and later love him, check. Well that love isn\'t there just yet, but I am sure it will come.Character progression: 7/10There\'s a pretty decent character development on Ecchi, some bonding, MC abilities developing, characters background flashbacks etc.Story: 5/10Our MC Arata gets caught in storm called ""Breakdown Phenomenom"", his friend Hijiri gives a grimoire, which saves him and unlock his magic power. After an incident he joins mage school in order to learn about his new powers and save his friend. Season goes with Arata unlocking new abilities and researching the ""Breakdown Phenomenom"". Now problem with Trinity seven is that the series doesn\'t take time to explain a lot of stuff to us, mainly magic. I was hoping we would see some side episode going deep into the magic and 7 deadly sins libraries. If Trinity seven had like 6-12 more episodes, I believe it could have been really interesting and different season as it would cover more stuff. Since it\'s Ecchi how does it do it\'s job with teasing? Well there\'s no nudity obviously as it\'s rated PG-13, it\'s pretty cliche Ecchi where almost whenever something intimate happens, our MC get\'s beaten by either tsundere girl or that girl, who doesn\'t like him.Story progression: 6/10TS is linear without any side episodes, story goes fairly well, but I would appreciate some more details concerning magic and 7 deadly sins libraries, mainly because it\'s season 1 and 1st season usually introduces characters, world, etc.Since Trinity Seven has villains appearance in the last 3 episodes, I won\'t include villain category.Girls: 8/10Pretty good variation: small boobs, medium boobs and big boobs, there aren\'t any ""really big boobs"", which I don\'t mindSound: 8/10TS has one opening song and 4 ending songs, so that\'s pretty good variation.So overall rating of Trinity Seven is 6,71/10, that means 6/10. It\'s really shame, that Trinity Seven has only 12 episodes, I feel if they would have few more, it could have been solid 7/10, or maybe even 8/10, but that\'s only if. arrogant and usually tells everything he has on his mind, including opinions on girls proportions and appearances.

His goal just for Hijiri makes him need to overcome many issues, such as to gather up The Trinity Seven—7 mages who are excel in their own fields.As usual, I will start from the plot, visuals, and characters development. From these three...elements, I vote for the visuals eventho\' I\'m sorry to say that the graphic is not enough to be described as fantastic. It\'s good enough, nice battle the series has, and catchy magic circles lol When the school life enters the scene, there is not much to say. the graphic and artworks are proper. However sometimes from my point of view, this show miss the details except well-built architecture.I wish to skip the plot review because it\'s nothing special, someone who wants to save his family member and need to be stronger and involved others as party. Well, I think that\'s a good wish. Briefly the story went pyon-pyon, it was like there were so many shortcuts they clicked to advance towards Arata\'s goal. Occasionally, we will find the explanation of how the magic works in a battle rather than the battle itself, it was quite bothering me and made me wonder why would the show makes the explanation in words instead of making us understand from the fight? Summary, too much talk, babbling just about the detail of strategy or power or magic itself. So messy it is.Then what upset me the most is characters development. They are developing physically, by training and experiences in battle. Lack of improvement emotionally/personality, which makes the character seems so stagnant (aside from the story). Trinity Sevens\'s love for Arata is increasing bit by bit, and the show ecchi-ness, too, is leveled up considerably. Ecchi-ness in every serious situation, not enough real fights, the story is hanging and chimerical. That\'s what I could note up to now.The theme song for this series is much more than the usual. The OP song is only one, sung by ZAQ ""Seven Doors"". I like this one the melody has stomping rhythm. There are four different ED themes; ""BEAUTIFUL≒SENTENCE"" by Magus Two (Lilith Asami\'s seiyuu & Arin Kannazuki\'s seiyuu); ""SHaVaDaVa in AMAZING♪"" by Yui Levi♡ (Levi Kazama\'s seiyuu & Yui Kurata\'s seiyuu); ""ReSTART ""THE WORLD"""" by TWINKle MAGIC [Lieselotte Sherlock\'s seiyuu & Serina Sherlock\'s seiyuu); ""TRINITY×SEVENTH＋HEAVEN"" by Security Politti (Mira Yamana\'s seiyuu & Akio Fudou\'s seiyuu). These songs are sung by seiyuus of Trinity Seven, plus younger sister of Lieselotte Sherlock. These four are good, SHaVaDaVa in AMAZING♪ has cloudless tempo, mostly filled with somewhat electronic music technology and instruments.I appreciate various theme songs here. Alas, I give this show rate around 4.5 only.Cons:Ecchiness is sealing the seriousness (ecchi scenes are too much, out of place)Poor characters developmentToo much babbling like trash talk elements, I vote for the visuals eventho\' I\'m sorry to say that the graphic is not enough to be described as fantastic.

Its really gross and the characters are very shallow and uninteresting and all this combined makes the very few “dramatic” parts of the show just blend in with the trash.If the show was simpler it might be able to keep up with the 7.00 rating it...has currently on MAL but it doesn’t make the cut. Unless you have really bad taste, I don’t see this show appealing to anyone, would not recommend. 4/10 show. has currently on MAL but it doesn’t make the cut.

Don't me wrong, i can understand where the appeal comes from but the story itself and the concept feels very blurry and not very explained. I have watched a handful amount of anime, and yet this stood out to be horribly bad. Even the the plot was to find his cousin sister, the story felt very regressive towards the plot. Even though the anime had a finishing point, it just felt bland throughout the whole series. And the concept of magic was very confusing and weird, where I still don't understand the concept of what a...d*mn thema is. The characters are very forgettable and boring and had a very classic ecchi and harem concept like any other generic harem manhwa I've read.
