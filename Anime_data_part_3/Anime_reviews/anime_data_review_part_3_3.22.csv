Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den,https://myanimelist.net/anime/206/Lodoss-tou_Senki__Eiyuu_Kishi_Den,"[""No, it's not a sequel, but rather a retelling of the events that follow episode eight of the original OVA.  Actually, the Lodoss OVA are a somewhat streamlined telling of the novels they were based on.  This longer, more drawn-out 27-episode television series hews closer to its source material, but in doing so causes for inconsistencies between the two programs.  This has caused a lot of confusion for many viewers, although the booklet contained with the series (and the DVD-ROM bonus extras) do help to explain them.  There have been a lot of mixed reactions to Record of Lodoss War:...Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, with many who dismissed it as a cheap, inferior spin-off of the (arguably superior) OVA.  Once you get accustomed to its oddities, however, this series isn't as inferior as it has been made out to be.  In fact, it can be best appreciated as an interesting, if more sluggishly paced, &quot;alternate route&quot; for the final five episodes.That said, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight starts out less than promisingly.  The first eight episodes (the weakest of the show) concentrate on the struggle with the ruthless (and yet strangely not so evil) Black Knight Ashram for the Scepter of Domination which initially comprised episodes 9-10 of the OVA.  While it's nice to see Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, and King Kashue again, their roles are actually less significant this time around.  The only characters to receive any development are two supporting characters from the original, the headstrong mercenary Shiris and her quietly reserved (but easily enraged) Berserker partner, Orson.  (In what may be an example of one of the many inconsistencies in the show, both characters are reintroduced to Parn and company as if they never crossed paths in episode 8 of the OVA.)  There are several new characters, too, including a prissy mage apprentice, an easily deceived priest, a mischevious elfish grass-runner sprite named Maar, but all three are hardly memorable.  The slow pace of the episodes are what really work against them, however; there's less action and more talky moments; even the climactic showdown at Fire Dragon Mountain between Ashram and the vicious red dragon Shooting Star is longer and more drawn out than one might expect.  There is a surprisingly heartfelt sacrifice in episode 7, but the overall arc doesn't have the same energy or roller-coaster action of its predecessor.It is only at episode 9 and onward that Chronicles finally comes to life.  The story jumps ten years after the Fire Dragon Mountain events, where the focus shifts to the evil wizard Wagnard's desire to awaken the Goddess of Destruction, Kardis.  Again, Parn and company's roles are reduced to supporting ones, and consequently, come across as the least interesting in the show.  The hero here is Spark, a blue-haired knight wanna-be who, at the surface, comes initially across as a more pale incarnation of Parn, but his troop of companions do provide the kind of banter and chemistry one would expect for any fantasy adventure.  The smart-aleck mercenary Garrack is a well-realized character, as is his sassy half-elf partner, Leaf, who steals every scene she's in with glee.  Just as interesting are the loyal thief Ryna and the dwarfish priest Greevus.  This ragtag team of misfits are joined by a mysterious girl named Little Neese (daughter of Slayn and Leylia), who turns out to be one of the key ingredients Wagnard needs to revive Kardis.  During all this, Ashram returns in a last attempt to unite Lodoss (to fulfill his late master, Emperor Beld's dream) while the shifty Grey Witch, Karla, also lurks in the shadows.  It is the chemistry between Spark's comrades and the more lively pace that really bring much needed energy to this major story, which, many would argue, is just a recycling of the last story thread from the OVA, but this telling is more complex, introducing some twists that are alternatingly surprising and insightful.  And even though the grand finale is less exciting than the OVA, it still wraps up the show on a pleasing note.  (Although Wagnard's drawn-out rituals and Little Neese's continuous screams of pain get tiresome after a while.)Probably the only jarring thing about Chronicles of the Heroic Knight are the short three-minute Welcome to Lodoss Island segments at the end of each episode.  These are super-deformed versions of the characters in goofy, cartoonish sequences, each of which clock in at around 2-3 minutes each. These wildly bizarre skits (which parody the world of Lodoss) will either amuse or drive you batty; I personally choose to give them a pass because they just don't click with me, but chances are your mileage may vary. (Interestingly, it's worth checking out these interludes with the English version to see how the Japanese puns--which make up a majority of the dialogue in these skits--are adapted into English, namely &quot;I'm King Kashue, and this is my CASHEW! I'm really quite a nut!&quot; as opposed to the more literal &quot;I'm King Kashue, isn't my KATCHU (armor) nice)?&quot;The character development and overall entertainment value of Chronicles provides for a pleasant enough way to pass the time for fantasy fans, which isn't to say that it is the most aesthetically or aurally pleasing show to watch.  On the contrary.  The Lodoss OVAs had some beautifully detailed, if sometimes limited, animation, but Chronicles' production values are another matter.  Aside from a breathtaking opening sequence (underscored by a beautiful theme song composed by Yoko Kanno), the animation fluctuates throughout the series, with some episodes looking downright painful on the eyes.  There are several episodes which do get a boost in overall quality, artwork wise, particularly the last ones, but all in all, the artistry is not one of Chronicles' strongest points.The audio portions fare signifigantly better, thanks in large part to the epic musical score contributed by Kaoru Wada.  Fully orchestrated, with soaring, epic marches one moment and pounding, percussive action cues the next, this soundtrack arguably carries the whole show from start to finish.  As mentioned, the opening theme is remarkable and impeccably delivered by Ma-aya Sakamoto, although the ending theme is a bit on the kitschy side.  The sound effects are also very good.As far as the voice acting goes, the dub of Lodoss has received a mixture of praise and disgust from many fans, but I happen to be one of its biggest fans.  The Chronicles dub, on the other hand, is a mixed bag.  It does have its assets:  Crispin Freeman does a surprisingly fantastic job as Spark (making this potentially monodimensional character more interesting than he is) and Angora Deb is similarly good as Leaf.  (I might argue that both make this dub worth watching.)  It also reprises much of the cast from the OVA dub; even though their acting standards are lower than that of the OVA (Parn's more mature-sounding voice in particular takes several episodes to find his stride), it's still nice to have continuity.  Working against them, however, are the uneven performances by the lesser supporting characters -- several of which border into intolerable territory (Ashram's minions, Governor Rabido, and Prince Reona, in particular, are dreadful), and vocal inconsistencies (some characters receive new voice actors either temporarily -- Lisa Ortiz's Deedlit is annoyingly replaced for at least two episodes by a far duller A.J. Parks -- or permanently -- Garrack's Michael Gerard drops out after five episodes, Crispin Freeman plays him for the remainder of the show).  That, in addition to the sometimes awkward-sounding dialogue and hit-and-miss synchronization, rank the overall dub a notch below its superior predecessor.  It's by no means the worst around, however, and patient dub fans may find it to have some merit.In all fairness, the Japanese voice acting isn't all that stellar either.  The entire Japanese voice cast from the OVA are replaced; while some voices are less grating than their English equivalents, others are actually sub-par in comparison to some of the better voices on the dub, particularly the seiyuu playing Deedlit, who is nowhere nearly as good as Yumi Tohma or Lisa Ortiz. There are also some parts of the Japanese language track which come across as cheesy, particularly the scenes involving the talking dragons (these scenes come across as very laughable in the English version, and the Japanese track sounds every bit as fake in this part).  The common attitude I hear from dub detractors is that the Japanese language track is preferable, regardless of whether it has any weaknesses of its own, but in the case of Chronicles, I have to say that both audio tracks tie in quality. They have their strong points and are, at best, tolerable, but not particularly flawless.All in all, Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight isn't without its drawbacks and doesn't always live up to its predecessor, but it's still a fine series that holds its own ground decently. For every weak point, there is always an asset to counter it, making this one moderately enjoyable fantasy Anime series.

Sequels have a notorious reputation for being sub par in comparison to their predecessors. Luckily, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight breaks that stereotype in a fairly big and entertaining way.For some reason, I could not get into the original Lodoss, try as I may. However, Chronicles had me hooked from episode one, despite the fact that the first batch of episodes are basically a rehashed version of the OVA storyline. Fair warning though; don&rsquo;t get used to seeing Parn and Deedlit in every episode. After the...introduction, it&rsquo;s as if the original Lodoss story never happened. A new cast, and a large one at that, is introduced with new enemies and new motives. While it was great to see that the producers took the time to make sure that no one was just another nameless warrior, keeping track of a cast this size proved to be a daunting task. The story to go along with this new group was equally complex, but very intriguing and captivating. That is, until the end of the episode, when super-deformed versions of the characters make a parody of the story just displayed. It was funny at first, but then became just plain annoying and took away from the real storyline.Probably the brightest star of this series is, arguably, the music. Yoko Kanno, already famous for her work in such titles as Ghost in the Shell: Stand alone Complex and Vision of Escaflowne, whips up a fantastic orchestral score to fit every scene on the screen, making this series pleasing on the ears. The opening and ending themes, Kiseki no Umi and Hikari no Suashi, are a joy to listen to every time they play and are definitely two of my favorite anime themes. The animation sequences to go along with them were stunning. It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame that the series couldn&rsquo;t have the same luster in its animation. By no means am I saying that the animation is bad. I was just a little disappointed at the dip from the opening and ending sequences to the series.If you liked the original Lodoss, then by all mean, pick up Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. It&rsquo;s just about everything that the OVA was and better. Just skip the last three minutes of each episode and enjoy the ending theme instead. introduction, it&rsquo;s as if the original Lodoss story never happened.

However it is sometimes wise to sacrifice certain things, and to that I will explain further, but first, normally I do not write a review to the series I have watched unless what I watched was so bad that it was worthy of a cautionary summation to future viewers. Now mind you I did not find anything that bad or appalling in this series, but I felt that the viewer ratings didn't reflect the true quality of the series.So...I will begin this by saying that the author wrote this story well out of their normal comfort zone. It is hard to take and tell a tale that is not in relation to your heritage, for instance it is hard for a storyteller who lives in the West, to write a story about things that relate solely to the East, and visa verse. This author however did a very splendid job in doing just that.But, the story itself is very linear and predicable. Now while this can be a good thing in this case it is not. Since the story itself is so visible it cannot and will not be able to draw the viewer into the storyline. To complicate matters even more, the unnecessary amount of characters actually bogs the storyline down further.Characters were so numerous that any depth that could have been given wasn't due to the amount of them. The screenwriter chose to add characters in that really were not needed other than to provide a plot vehicle or romantic interest. Less is more, and in that allows for better character development and a chance for the viewer to connect with the characters. Unfortunately this story did not allow for that, and should have sacrificed some characters. For future screenplay writers, not all stories need romance, nor do they need characters who's sole responsibility is to help provide plot line.Production values were better for this series than the first. The characters were diverse in features to allow a pleasant indulgence in them. For the most part the clothing designs were true to a European style fairy tale, but there were a few Asian influences in them as well. I'm sure that however was the artists trademark and quite acceptable even nice to see.One of the problems however in production values were the action, or fight scenes. These were very far and few between with most of them being nothing more than SFX and quick color flashes and stills. I would venture to guess that the budget was shoestring and some sacrifices had to be made, I personally just wish they would have made them in the character department and not the action department.So overall with a huge cast of characters, poor production values in animation, this series has, in my opinion, a higher rating that it deserves. Storyline was weak, art values were high along with sound and styling, this series should actually rate closer to 6.5 than the 7.6 it currently holds. Which again is what triggered this review.This series would be good for a viewer who is wanting a simple plot and storyline with good art but poor production values.

I\'m a big lover of fantasy, I read a lot of fantasy novels and play D&D, I also loved the original OVA, but this one was far below what I expected.The writing was extremely predictable and often, I found myself wanting for more. Something unpredictable, something that would explain character motivations, particularly the villains who came off as ""evil for evil\'s sake"" and not someone with actual meaningful motivations for the things they did. I didn\'t care for most of the characters and honestly, it was a drag to get through.I still love the character designs, honestly, I...still think they have one of the best designs for elves and even if the animation is subpar at times, I can\'t complain about the art style itself. But I still wouldn\'t recommend this at all - stick to the original OVA and keep away from this one. still think they have one of the best designs for elves and even if the animation is subpar at times, I can\'t complain about the art style itself. But I still wouldn\'t recommend this at all - stick to the original OVA and keep away from this one.', 'Kind of like this one better over the Lodoss War OVA series, biggest reason being the greater amount of character depth and development. The OVA series just breezed by with its plot developments, leaving little time to develop its characters. Here though, many of the characters get fleshing out over their motives and some even grow over the course of the series. Even baddie Ashram gets focus to show that he has honorable reasons for fighting alongside the enemy faction. There are still some characters that were underdeveloped, such as Parn and Deedlit. But the character depth here is of great improvement from the OVA...series.As for the show\'s plot, it is your standard fantasy adventure series with the first eight episodes having a different take to the Scepter of Domination storyline from the OVAs and having another adventure years later with the knight Spark. I hear this TV anime is supposed to be a more faithful adaptation of its fantasy novel source material, but I don\'t know enough about the novels to know of how faithful it is. Regardless, the anime goes through the motions of having the audience know of its world, the gods worshiped and the creatures that inhabit it. To a great extent, the series follows the standard plot setups of a fantasy RPG game with our male hero of a knight (Parn for first eight episodes, Spark for rest of series) having a party of differing classes (mage, dwarf, mercenary, thief, etc...) accompany him in a journey to combat the plot of an evil baddie (Wagnard). The greater character depth here gives many of the characters more dimension than what their ""class"" archetype would give, though the fantasy setup occasionally milks cliches in its plot developments that cause the series to drag at points or suffer in quality. This is especially noticeable in the final several episodes of the series that milk enough cliches that you could find used in the final level of an RPG game\'s storyline. In addition, the series also comes with an SD omake mini-episode at the end of each episode to the show which is quite silly in tone compared to the main series and your mileage will vary on how well you enjoy them (winded up skipping them after a few episodes).Visually, Lodoss War TV appears to use a more traditional character design style here compared to the OVAs, meaning most characters in the show have the ""big eyed"" and attractive look you can find used in many popular anime titles. The designs are nicely drawn and have a good amount of visual detail to them. Same treatment is given to scenery which have a diverse number of environments drawn thanks to the different locales that the parties of warriors travel through and fight in. The animation for the TV anime isn\'t much different from the OVA, meaning you can expect frequent use of still shots, speed stripes and other animation shortcuts during heated battle scenes.The music to the series is perhaps the high point of Lodoss War TV for me. Insert music mostly consisted of orchestral music pieces that give the series an epic feel and Yoko Kanno\'s composition of the title\'s opener song, ""Kiseki no Umi"" sung by Maaya Sakamoto, make it among one of the better openers I\'ve listened to from an anime.Overall while still having its issues from its typical fantasy-adventure mold, Lodoss War TV is still an improvement from the OVA series thanks to its greater character depth and focus on exploring the world of Lodoss. If you have interest in medieval/ fantasy-style adventure titles, this is a decent series worth having a look at. series.As for the show\'s plot, it is your standard fantasy adventure series with the first eight episodes having a different take to the Scepter of Domination storyline from the OVAs and having another adventure years later with the knight Spark.

If you have interest in medieval/ fantasy-style adventure titles, this is a decent series worth having a look at.', 'This anime is sortof a sequel, sortof a retelling of the original Record of Lodoss War OAV. Continuity-wise, it seems to be something of a combination of the two. Some things distinctly happen after those events, some things seem to happen during the same period of time. In my own head, I think of it as a sequel.This anime is a more ""anime"" anime. The characters are more colorful (visually), and although it is good, I don\'t like the animation quite as much as I did the animation from the OAV. Although I think the characters are a bit more interesting. This one is longer,...and it has more time to flesh out the characters.The music is lovely.I also do really enjoy the short animations at the end of each episode. I think they\'re hilarious. and it has more time to flesh out the characters.The music is lovely.I also do really enjoy the short animations at the end of each episode. I think they\'re hilarious.', 'You could say this TV series ""Chronicles of the Heroic Knight"" picks up after the OVA which rolls back and roughly covers the second half of Ryo Mizuno\'s light novels. It takes place about after episode 7 of the OVA and follows the party members as they grow up, facing new enemies that threaten Lodoss as well as the aspiring new hero, Spark hence the title. Art\'s not quite as detailed which is usually the case for longer running TV series but character designs more or less look similar to the OVA. Some of the voices don\'t sound as well matched.The show\'s kind of aimed...at a younger audience with its ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" (horrible) mini shorts which is probably why there\'s no blood in it and more joking around. I actually found it a sleeper most of the time because it doesn\'t have the same build-up towards each event like the OVA did and the threats just don\'t have much impact. Not to mention the silly shorts just ruins the mood afterwards although the show does have an epic ending if you get that far. The only other highlight would probably be the OP ""Kiseki no Umi"" sung by Maaya Sakamoto (Mari from the Evangelion Rebuild movies). It\'s even better once you\'ve journeyed through the show.I think overall the character development is lacking. The trials that Spark face don\'t really have much impact and feel dragged out. It\'s kind of like once an event\'s over, that\'s it for the characters. Then it\'s a time skip and onto the next event but that\'s fine I guess considering the story is based on Dungeon & Dragon game sessions.Personally, I\'d go watch the OVA and forget about this series or just enjoy the OP. at a younger audience with its ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" (horrible) mini shorts which is probably why there\'s no blood in it and more joking around.

It might also not be fair to compare it with the shows that exist today, but I'll do it anyway.The STORYLINE is good... but it's implementation is concise and lacks details. Watching it felt like 27 episodes weren't really enough to briefly describe the events, character development, which are the MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES with this show.The CHARACTERS were really immature (especially SPARK), although the quotes they said from time to time were really motivating. The first 8 episodes...has PARN as its main character, but after that the mc role is taken by SPARK. I would be fine with any protagonist, but the immature personality of SPARK stopped me from liking him as a character. SPARK didn't develop as a character till the last episode, although we saw many other characters who praised him for things he barely did, sudden romantic development, his desperate decisions...ASHRAM and PARN matured a lot after episode 8, and they were my favorite characters in this show. DEEDLIT is also adorable when she tries to get attention of PARN. But their screen time just becomes less and less with the consecutive episodes, that it isn't enough to counter the dislike towards SPARK.The background MUSIC has classic RPG theme, and it's really compatible with the desperate development of the story events. The Op & Ed songs are perhaps the best aspect of this show imo.OVERALL : The show could have done better if not for its FAST PACING of the events which ruined the show significantly (from a perspective of someone who's watched this two decades later).As a note, I am thankful for the fact that many 'fantasy' based shows that exists today are refined from this show ; In this sense, Lodoss-tou Senki can be considered as the predecessor of many fantasy shows.

It also means you can watch and enjoy it whether you have seen the naruto series or not.It was good because it was a combiantion of seriousness and comedy so you dont get weighed down by either.It includes the characters Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi from the actual series, and you get to see all of them kick some butt! "", ""Well, I'm not a fan of Naruto. I didn't watch the series before the movie. I bought the movie to see if it would help me get into the series, and I can't say it did.First off, I found the story to be slow, although this could be because of my mindframe at the time. By no means should you base choices on my review; I'm not a huge fan of this kind of anime. The quality of the story was somewhat like that of the InuYasha movies, only even slower imo.The art was as good as any other basic anime really. I won't mark...it down simply 'cause I disliked Naruto's character design. All else was good, and there were some decent flashback shots.Sound worked well, but Naruto's voice sucked more than I thought it would; he sounded like a girl! Other than that, the voices were well cast and the music all worked quite well. Okay, it's not my kinda music, but considering what it is, it was good. Perfect for the genre.The characters were fairly decent; what I saw of them. I might have liked them more had I watched the series, but the only one I disliked at all was Naruto because he was a total stalker! All the other characters were nice enough, but I wouldn't recommend anyone else watch this movie without watching some of the series first. I lacked a lot of background knowledge and so, evidently, felt nothing for anyone.Enjoyment...well, take it for what it is. Since it's not my kind of anime, I found it slow, dull, monotonous and simply did not like it. But for those who enjoy this kind of anime, with lots of action and not a huge, complex plot: go for it. it down simply 'cause I disliked Naruto's character design.

I would buy all the action figures, video games, and pretty much all the merchandise but ever since I was able to view anime in a more critical perspective I started to notice that it had so many flaws and this is also including Naruto: Shippuden. The anime has a huge amount plot holes, the pacing in it is terrible, the setting doesn't know what it wants to be, there is gigantic amounts of filler, deus ex machinas, contains many underdeveloped one dimensional characters, and the whole...idea of being ninjas is thrown out the window with the absurd amount of power the characters obtain. So whenever I look back at all the Naruto stuff I have, all I can do is cringe. Does this movie in any way help the anime? Nope. Will this movie convince anybody to see the anime? Not at all.Story: (3/10)The story of Naruto Movie 1 begins with Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura watching a movie at a movie theater with Naruto starting to really like the lead actress of the movie. Kakashi then assigns them to go on a mission to escort the lead actress named Kazehana Koyuki to the land of the snow to film a new movie but at the land of snow old enemies start to rise and cause problems. From the get go I already found the story to be very predictable. Naruto and his team meet new enemies and fight them, main character of the movie gets kidnapped, the team then goes to rescue her, and finally Naruto is able to beat the main villain by using the power of not giving up and friendship. I have seen this type of thing happen all the time in the anime and the creators could of at least put a spin on it to make it seem different but that did not happen. There were many moments in the movie that didn't make any sense and were always answered by using the power of not giving up. Another problem I had with the story was how it would show modern things like a movie theater, a film studio and filming supplies, and as well as a blimp which doesn't make any sense to have in the type of setting that the anime establishes.Art and Animation: (5/10)The art in this movie is fine at best. The backgrounds are okay, the character designs are okay but would look off model at times, and the special attack visuals are good. The animation in the movie is good and is much better than the animation in the anime.Sound: (4/10)The soundtrack in the movie is very generic and forgettable with only the ending song of the movie being good. The voice actors did a fine job with the characters but no one stood out.Characters: (3/10)The characters are definitely the worst part of the movie. Naruto is still his stupid self that is the typical main character that is able to defeat every villain through nakama power even though he is the second weakest member of his team. Sasuke is still his not caring about anything self and he is barely in the movie with him only being in scenes whenever the group needs to fight. Sakura is still the character that does not contribute anything to the story and she is in the movie even less than Sasuke was. Koyuki, the main character, is not likable at all. All she does in the movie is be angry and whiny at what anybody says to her and suddenly changes her personality at the end of the movie. The villains in the movie are all very underdeveloped and one dimensional and this just makes them look like their whole purpose of being villains is to be villains.Enjoyment: (3/10)The only enjoyment I got out of the movie is how the action scenes were animated.Overall: (3/10)Naruto Movie 1: Dai Katsugeki!!

The story doesn't stand out to be anything that great at all. In fact it's actually quite predictable, that doesn't mean it wasn't decent though. While it is a typical Naruto story there's still some enjoyment in the action scenes and the emotional dialogue scenes. The conclusion also was in typical Naruto fashion which as always was a nice touch. The animation worked as always, and was enhanced for the movie making the environments and characters look and move around better. The sound was crisp and clean and...the soundtrack comprised of original songs and tracks from the anime worked as well. The characters are a mix of the main protagonists from the series, some new ones as well as new antagonists as well. This is a bit disappointing though, considering the villains were made out to look fairly strong in the first encounter with our heroes but were defeated fairly easily in the next fight. I do like the concept of the Hidden Snow Village, it was kinda cool but we didn't see much of them. The story revolved around a princess, she was a typical predictable character at best. She had her moments and she was functional, but you can't help but notice the typical scenario of the rogue personality type who eventually finds the good in herself blah blah. Like i said though, she was functional and worked in the story. The main villain wasn't that interesting, after his plan was revealed there wasn't really a sense of urgency because the story doesn't do anything to make you believe he can really execute his plan. He and his allies do show off some cool Jutsu, and watching them fight with team Kakashi was pretty cool because of the unique jutsu of the snow ninja and the better animation. If the story had a bit more depth it would've made the movie as a whole better. Still, like i said, the movie did have its moments and by the end i wasn't completely dissapointed.In all the story is nothing great, it's predictable and the story itself is nothing great. I still enjoyed it however, the snow ninja and action sequences are cool. The animation and sound are good quality as always and the ending is lighthearted and a nice touch. The conclusion is actually one of the highlights in my opinion, but anyway if you're a fan of Naruto you'll like the movie. It could've been better but i enjoyed it anyway.7/10.

Hope this helped (:"", ""So I recently watched this movie, having completed the first Naruto series, and I would definitely say it was nothing special.The plot seemed to have a very 'Naruto filler' feel to it and didn't grab my attention. I thought that the princess' issue with the season, Spring was pretty weak and not a good enough reason for her to hide or feel disappointed. The princess just screamed helpless heroine and it was very unoriginal. In fact, I felt no connection towards the newly introduced characters whatsoever.However I should mention, that the strength the main character, Naruto demonstrated was very endearing. He played a good role...in the story, though it is the same determination he has in the anime series, so for people who who are familiar with his character this will be no suprise.The art was just a tiny bit better than in the Naruto series and the wide range of new jutsu's made the fight scenes more exciting.

I think it mostly has to do with the conflicting elements this film has. It was jarring for me to see some modern features added to Naruto, which I always thought to be situated in older times. Even the clothes of some of the new characters contrast with the more traditional attire of our main characters, and it just looks uneven. The film also has a sci-fi-esque quality to it, with the Land of Snow’s emphasis on technology, and it...feels a little out of place in the world of Naruto. The presence of the camera crew also ruins a lot of the mood for me, turning dramatic moments into something bizarre. I know the main series always combines lightheartedness with deeper and more serious themes, but the film’s silly movie premise not only manages to make these two clash, but renders them ineffective as well.I do, however, appreciate how experimental they are with some parts of this movie, even though it doesn’t work out that well and the main plot line is fairly uninspired and involves the usual story beats.

Naruto, Saske, Sakura, Kakashi - the ultimate team) go through another action packed adventure full of surprises, with one of the best plots for...a movie from this genre.I won't tell you about the movie itself, so you could enjoy it entirely, but I'll say it was had a very original plot and wasvery fateful to the series itself even if you haven't seen it yet. a movie from this genre.I won't tell you about the movie itself, so you could enjoy it entirely, but I'll say it was had a very original plot and wasvery fateful to the series itself even if you haven't seen it yet."", 'This review is not serious in anyway, only for fun.So me & a couple of friends ended up watching this, as a joke, for some anime movie night after watching Time Bouken & Colorful.The whole time watching this, we ended up making fun of it in certain scenes. One scene was when Kakashi & Nadara were doing a contest on ""Who can finger who first"", both of them got fingered in the end.The movie was pretty ok. Sakura\'s falling for Sasuke, Naruto became a princess hunter, Sasuke\'s doing nothing & Kakashi\'s still cool reading his romance novels. The art style was nice,...especially when they placed Rainbow Chakra, where they ran out of ideas into this movie. The music is obviously the same as the TV series, its been overused to the point that it\'s become a laugh track for every naruto episode.I especially enjoyed the final battle. My excitement level is the same as if Eeyore were to have a birthday, nothing exciting. The change in terrain from an Icy cold land, to a spring grassy land looked so realistic, it\'s like I was there the whole time!  And the final boss wasn\'t that great; the only thing that made it is when you add a score & total it.Overall, it\'s an ok movie to watch.

So I would say that your enjoyment of these films hinges on what aspects of the Naruto series you find most appealing. For me, the fact that these movies do not take themselves as deadly serious as the canon series does is actually a point in the movies\' favor.The Land of Snow is a great concept, and I found myself legit interested in it, even though its denizens were...not the most compelling of characters. It just seems to fit a niche that was not explored in the actual series. We have villages in deserts, mountains, forests, and whatnot, it seems to make sense that there would be one in a snowy area. The plot is a bit strange in that it centers around Team 7 bodyguarding a movie actress - the technology in Naruto is truly bizarre, we see trains later on as well. But it is nice to see Team 7 doing normal missions, I wish we saw more of them being an actual team. This is the only of the three pre-timeskip Naruto films to include Sasuke.Ultimately, the plot about the actress secretly being a princess is fine, not particularly engrossing but suitable enough to set up fights, which is what I personally am here for. The Snow Village goons are quite memorable as far as goons go.

Thank God! The fights here are great. I really liked Sasuke and Sakura\'s team-up, it was great to see Sakura employing some strategy here. The ending bit with the ""Rainbow Rasengan"" was lame, but the battles against the minions were pretty lit, not gonna lie.In the end, the movie succeeds at fights and worldbuilding, and so I recommend it to any fan of Naruto. not the most compelling of characters. It just seems to fit a niche that was not explored in the actual series. We have villages in deserts, mountains, forests, and whatnot, it seems to make sense that there would be one in a snowy area. The plot is a bit strange in that it centers around Team 7 bodyguarding a movie actress - the technology in Naruto is truly bizarre, we see trains later on as well. But it is nice to see Team 7 doing normal missions, I wish we saw more of them being an actual team. This is the only of the three pre-timeskip Naruto films to include Sasuke.Ultimately, the plot about the actress secretly being a princess is fine, not particularly engrossing but suitable enough to set up fights, which is what I personally am here for. The Snow Village goons are quite memorable as far as goons go.

It's a fun watch. The beggining is a bit of a drag. The story is mediocre, to be fair. It's mostly cliched Naruto filler plot. However, this one is more ambitious, I suppose. The art is pretty good. Fight scenes are fast, fluid, exciting and action-packed thanks to it and it really does look pretty. That is the best part of the movie, I suppose. As I said, the story is nothing special, so if you want to watch it for that reason, you shouldn't expect a great story.The soundtrack was a bit underwhelming, compared to...the anime at least. But it's still good. Characters, however, lack. Sasuke and Sakura are just one-dimensional. They barely have any personality here. I mean, Sakura isn't really a great character but I am one of those people who actually like Sasuke. They are just...kinda there. Kakashi and Naruto are relatively cool here, however. The others are  pretty forgettable. So it's mediocre in that department.They screwed up the ending a bit. Not that I cared much as the story was average.Overall, Naruto Movie 1: Dai Katsugeki!! Yuki Hime Shinobu Houjou Dattebayo! (God, this is a long name) is alright. If you want some Naruto action, it's a decent watch. It's fun, at least. Did enjoy it. the anime at least.

This is my review for the first Naruto movie directed by Tensai Okamura.Story (8/10)The film starts out with Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura watching an action movie at a movie theater with Naruto really liking the main heroine in the movie. Their mentor, Kakashi Hatake, assigns them with a new A-ranked mission to escort and protect the main heroine actress from the movie that they were watching. Her name is Koyuki Kazehana. They need to...protect her in the Land of Snow where enemies arrive and start to cause problems. The story was very good but very predictable if you are a huge fan of the anime like I am.Art (10/10)I have always loved Masashi Kishimoto's art design. His art is just absolutely amazing in my opinion. The fight scenes are executed perfectly and Tensai Okamura's direction supplements it greatly.Sound/Music (10/10)The soundtrack is practically the same as the anime. It is perfect and I love every instrumental and track throughout this entire movie. One of the best aspects in not just this movie but in everything Naruto.Characters (7/10)Naruto and Kakashi have great character development, as well as Koyuki. However, Sasuke and Sakura are very one-dimensional ish and could have had so much more development and thought put into their characters.Enjoyment (10/10)I have always loved Naruto as it was my very first anime. I know Naruto isn't the greatest of all-time, but I love it so much. I love the action, drama, humor, violence, and most importantly the messages it gives to audiences both young and older alike.Overall (8/10)Naruto Movie 1: Dai Katsugeki!!

I don\'t think that this film is anything groundbreaking by any means, but it is for sure and enjoyable watch that is ripped on unjustly. It is difficult to match a complex story such as Naruto\'s in the space of 90 minutes, especially as this is non-canon, so plot points have to be introduced and concluded in that time period. The film seems to...be aware of that, and so hones its focus on Naruto\'s influence on the princess and her state of mind. The overarching theme of the plot is that there is always a way out, no matter how dire the situation may seem. Not much else really matters, and it doesn\'t have to.Story:The story itself is pretty generic. It is set after Tsunade becomes the Hokage, but before the final arc of Part 1, which I think is a pretty nice time for a filler/movie. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi get tasked with escorting a film crew to direct their film to the Land of Snow. The first few scenes up to and including the first battle reminded me a lot of the opening act of King Kong. They have a few fights, the film\'s mid-story twist is that the princess is actually a real princess from the Land of Snow, who has been exiled but is been chased down as she holds the key to a treasure. Her agent was her servant when she was a child and is very passionate about saving their country from the new leader. His leadership of the country is never really explained, the only thing we know about him is that he employed a few dirty, immoral tricks to get into power.The rest of the story is pretty predictable and nothing special happens. There are a few ninja fights, Naruto and the princess get captured, they break free thanks to Naruto\'s cunning wit, and a final fight happens ending in a pretty cool cinematic fight scene. One part I particularly liked was when Dotou brutally murders an entire militia. Naruto was just starting to get through to the princess, and then bam. Her resistance force, led by the man who looked after her from a young age, is completely wiped out along with any growth shred of hope she had. It\'s a very tragic scene, which adds a lot more understanding to the princess\' psyche, especially during the aftermath, and really emphasises the overarching theme of the plot. The man also stays dead, which I didn\'t really expect from a film like this, but it was a nice touch, and really changed the mood of the film to a more serious tone.The treasure turns out to be... Spring. Turns out the old king created a device using Rainbow chakra to end Winter. This does raise up a lot of questions, but none of much importance, and the poetic meaning behind the rapid change in scenery (and the artwork itself), is enough to make me not care about nitpicking this final twist.Art:The art itself is pretty much standard Naruto for its time but with a better budget, so the characters are drawn better, and the animations look a lot cleaner. I particularly liked the black Ice Style jutsu used by the main villain, and Naruto\'s Rasengan is also a beauty. The scenery is grey for nearly the entirety of the film, until the very end, where vibrant colours are everywhere. It illustrates the main theme of the film very well, and is a welcomed addition by the director.The use of 3D models with a 2D background is very difficult to get right, but the train scene seems to make it work without any complaints. The standard film techniques like slow motion and the use of distance shots are used pretty well, and overall this is a pretty well done visual piece for its time.Sound:Not too much to be said here. The soundtrack just uses the old Naruto soundtracks which we all know and love. It\'s used appropriately, and I don\'t have any problems with it. It would have been nice to have an original soundtrack for the film, but when you have a pretty solid one at disposal, I guess there isn\'t much point in wasting time, money and effort in creating a brand new one.Characters:A major criticism of this film is that Team 7 excluding Naruto and the antagonists aren\'t really utilised that well. I do not really think that Team 7\'s usage being more than it already is would make the film any better, outside of fanservice. In fact, I\'m glad that Sakura (a criminally underrated character in the fanbase) was given things to do and seemed almost as useful as Sasuke throughout the film. They are all given a couple of times to shine, but this film isn\'t about them - it\'s about Naruto and the princess.The antagonists aren\'t fleshed out either, but they don\'t need to be. The first three we face are just mercenaries. They don\'t need a backstory, as we already know all we need to know about them - they\'ve been hired to track down the princess. It\'s pretty common in the ninja world; our protagonists are hired ninja too. You could argue Dotou could have been fleshed out a bit more than the ""he\'s a bit of a dick"" thing the film told us about, but again, I don\'t think it is necessary. The film is about staying strong in the face of difficult situations. Dotou just needed to be powerful and evil enough to be a horrible dictator, but not powerful enough such that a fully motivated end of part 1 kid Naruto to defeat. Naruto at this point is pretty comfortably Jonin-level anyway, having defeated Gaara and learned the Rasengan, so it\'s not as if that\'s anything unbelievable.Naruto is supposed to be the voice of reason throughout the film with his powerful optimism, which he uses to try to win over the princess, who is depressed and has lost all hope. The film is centred around these two characters. The princess is actually really relatable and realistic. Her growth over the course of the film isn\'t rushed either, and it\'s pretty entertaining watching her develop, regress, and then finally be convinced by Naruto. It doesn\'t feel unnatural, and is heartwarming to see. This is ""the power of friendship"" done right.Enjoyment:I watched this with my 10-year old sister while babysitting her. We both enjoyed it quite a lot. It isn\'t anything groundbreaking, but it is not a bad watch by any means, and we enjoyed it enough. There weren\'t any scenes that I didn\'t like, and there were quite a few scenes I really liked. Naruto\'s speeches doesn\'t ever feel out of place, and besides the final twist which doesn\'t really have any bad consequences, there\'s not a lot of nitpicking to be done. be aware of that, and so hones its focus on Naruto\'s influence on the princess and her state of mind.

She is pretty similiar to tsunade in the show.The villian is also very formulaic and boring, but he has strong chakra armor which is a new element.The land of snow is very beautiful and a good place for it to...be set in.I like that the naruto music is used again here and they didnt make a new soundtrack for this. be set in.I like that the naruto music is used again here and they didnt make a new soundtrack for this.', ""First thing first I prefer that you watch this movie right after the 101 ep.Just to let you know there are little spoilers in the STORY part of the review.mine opinion:This movie is a better filler of NARUTO.

They also gave us a reasonable story that could cause you to shed some tears.STORYFrom the beginning, it was more miserable but then it turned into quite an interesting story. As always, Naruto reversed the opinion of the main...character or the person who quickly despairs. We saw the flea side of the princess with that and it really put me in a good mood. Soon after, the princess began to fall in love with him as he saved her from running away from the fear of dying.

Sayōnara"", ""<Potential Spoilers>As of writing, this is the only Naruto movie I’ve watched.It’s a shame because I truly enjoyed the movie and want to watch more Naruto movies. Despite the fact that the events of the movie are never mentioned in the anime and the driving conflict was boring. The film is saved by its amazing animation that is comparable to modern-day animation, along with the return of Naruto’s iconic soundtrack and the return as well as the introduction of memorable characters.The narrative follows Naruto’s team protecting a film crew from any potential threats to their livelihood. However, the lead actor of the film has a...much more important role in the land they are present in. The narrative itself seems generic when reading a plot summary, but despite this generic storyline, the film is a lot more enjoyable than you would think. While it isn’t as enjoyable as half the arcs that are present in the Naruto show, it’s still something I can watch and enjoy.The animation is surprisingly good considering the film was released in 2004, I’m unsure if I watched a reanimated version of the film. But regardless, the animation was brilliant, following all the necessary requirements for what is considered good animation. Consistent anatomy of characters, realistic movement, and consistent art style.The soundtrack or Naruto is iconic, anyone who’s a fan of the series can instantly recognize it. So the return of this iconic soundtrack is brilliant. The music can easily make a scene intense, or sad, or disturbing. Voice acting had a decent performance, I could only watch the English dub so I'm sure the performance of the voice actors in the sub was better.The return of characters like Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi and seeing them work as a team is nice to see. Considering that won’t be seen for the remainder of the show. However, the main villain was just boring especially when compared to other Naruto villains. And Yukie serving a greater role than what was originally presented I saw coming from a mile away.While there are flaws present in the film, that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy an anime film with amazing animation, soundtrack, and characters.Overall, I rank this 7/10 much more important role in the land they are present in.

It has an atmosphere much closer to that of its earlier episodes, when the show was still fresh and interesting. As far as movies go, you can of course expect far better production values and flashier battles. Yet it has something more than just an excuse for a parade of special attacks. It is by all means nothing more than a filler mission but it had a smart concept that went beyond the simple plot of “Let’s go save some petty village for money”.The basic plot is about our heroes...escorting an actress while she is being part of a film. Along the way, ghosts and a sinister plot come along to spice up the seemingly dull objective. So in a way it is like the first arc of the tv-series, which begins as simply escorting an old guy back home before the whole thing escalates to a nation-wide conflict. The twist of having movie-making in the story is also a nice catch, since not only this way it is an in-joke to the tv series itself getting its own movie for the first time, but also because the actress is in reality pretending to be “just” an actress. These things are very interesting to find in an otherwise short filler mission and it is definitely eons better than those dreadful tv filler arcs.You don’t need to have watched any of the series to understand what is going on with the plot; it is quite simple and doesn’t delve too much into anyone important character’s past. At least not in a canon way. Supposed Kakashi knows the leader of the enemy ninjas and he is inferior to him or something but you won’t see that guy again so no worries.Despite the twist with the movie, the overall story is still the typical Naruto fare: Some person is all emo, tragic childhood, greedy adversaries, people fighting in duels, Naruto end the battle with a Rasengan. It could be far more memorable and interesting if more time was invested into getting to know better the princess and the people of Snow Country but as usual you can’t find all that in the duration of a film. Plus, a lot of time is spent on completely irrelevant events called BATTLES! Seriously, this is an action movie and there is a lot of it but because you don’t care much about the characters you end up not caring about the action. And it’s not that exciting compared to the major battles of the main story so you can’t even like it as guilty pleasure too much.Yukihime is focused upon and fleshed out on a decent level, which I liked a lot, but all the other Snow characters are left completely one-dimensional and are thus boring. This matters a lot when it comes to the enemy ninjas who are less than caricatures. Even as far as the heroes are concerned, only Naruto was actually necessary to the story, as he was there to “melt the ice” from the actresses’ heart. Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi were just dragged along just because they are in the same team and the movie needed more people to fill in the fights. Ok, maybe Kakashi’s past mission in the same place has a little to do with it but it is mentioned only in passing and means nothing in overall.And thus you get a film based on two people who are not given enough time to become memorable for their interaction and lots of cameos that are there just to do some flashy but shallow fighting. It would of course be too much to expect more from a filler movie but in theory it would make it far more enjoyable if there was more interaction and less fighting. Although this is supposed to be aimed at kids who probably only expect to see emo kids fighting so I am not so sure if that would work either with that sort of target audience.Anyhow, I liked the movie to the most part and disliked how the secondary cast was “just there”. I also loath the ending which had some sort of magic gismo melting the ice, like this is a fairy tale or something. Not bad in overall but far from great and lacks replay value. escorting an actress while she is being part of a film.

Considering it was made in 2004, the animation is up to par with some of the newer anime animations that are out now in 2018! It truly was incredibly appealing to watch.The story line was alright for me, I definitely think it could've been better.

The humor is flat, the story is idiotic, the villains are all stereotypical, straight-forward, power hungry morons and the overall feeling just isn't there. I guess the artwork was a step up from the series if not too colorful and I guess the music fit the scenes, but other than that there really wasn't much to it. I'm already not a fan of the characters because I find them all to be annoying, right from that obnoxious little shit Naruto to the...whiny Sakura. The actress really wasn't much better. She was weakly developed and the cast and crew were boring. Honestly, I would say avoid this if you're looking for something more, but if you aren't demanding and you hate logic than this is for you. whiny Sakura. The actress really wasn't much better.

Not just because it took place in new settings, but because the villagers and their environment portrayed something closer to modern times. The modern looking clothing and technology was interesting to see in the world of Naruto and its art style, but it brought into question the consistency of technology in the world of Naruto.

Star guest character? She had a background that was overlooked and got like 10 seconds of explanation so I'm not sure if it made her seem like a better person but she came off as undeservingly rude. But of course, she eventually comes around because who can't resist Naruto's influence.I did say the film had it's moments and those were mostly when the music came in. It was a nice touch and amped up the scenes, but it wasn't anything particularly new. It was music you'd recognize from the show.

Nyan Koi!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6512/Nyan_Koi,"['One of the problems with harem rom-coms these days is the tendency to try and be creative in unusual ways. The problem, specifically, is that the writers and mangaka assume that by simply including something like aliens, youkai, body switching, etc, etc, then the story automatically becomes new and innovative.Fujiwara Sato, the creator of the manga upon which this anime is based, decided to adds cats. No, not catgirls, just cats (although girls are present in the story as well).Nyan Koi follows the life of one Kousaka Junpei, a high schooler who lives with his mother, sister, and pet cat, but who suffers from...a severe allergy to all things feline. One day he accidentally knocks the head off a statue belonging to the local cat deity, and from then on he can understand everything every cat is saying. His pet Nyamsus tells him that he has been cursed by the cat god, and that unless he helps 100 cats he will be turned into a cat himself.The only problem though, is that his allergy will kill him at that point.Now, I will admit to a certain bias here. This past year I have been following two particular manga dealing with cats and humans - Nyan Koi and Koi Neko, and of the two, Koi Neko has the better story. That\'s not to say that Nyan Koi is bad in terms of it\'s plot, but it does suffer from a certain genericism brought on by the fact that it\'s a harem story. That said, the anime adaptation follows the manga pretty well up to the last couple of episodes, at which point it goes off at a tangent.That\'s not a bad thing mind, but in the case of Nyan Koi it feels more like an attempt to entice the viewer into watching the second series, especially as, aside from one or two hints, the events in the show don\'t really support most of the final episode.However, the plot does have some redeeming qualities in that the humour from the manga has maintained, especially where the cats are concerned. The scripting is also well handled for the most part, barring a few odd inconsistencies come the last few episodes, however this should be no surprise given that much of the show is the anime form of the manga.The bright and cheery colour scheme reflects the fact that this is a fairly simple harem comedy. The animation is well handled and choregraphed, and the show makes good use of different animation techniques to emphasise the humour. That said, Nyan Koi does suffer from a degree of genericism when it comes to presentation. Certain scenes are reminiscent of many other harem anime, and the characters themselves are formulaic in their designs, and this includes the cats.In terms of sound the series is well served with it\'s cast of voice actors, all of whom are very talented in their own right (for example, Tanaka Atsuko, who plays the role of Nyamsus, is also the actress behind Kusanagi Mokoto of GitS: SAC, 2nd Gig, 2.0 and Innocence). The one problem though, is that their talents are underused, however this is purely an outgrowth of the fact that this is a comedy show rather than a serious tale. That said, they do portray their respective characters well, especially in the more humourous moments.The OP is a simple J-Pop ditty sung by Sakakibara Yui called ""Nyanderful"" that, while being upbeat, is nothing particularly special. Likewise the ED, ""Strawberry ~Amaku Setsunai Namida~"" (sung by Imai Asami), while being a more melodic than the OP, is again, nothing to write home about.In all honesty the music, although being reasonably well composed, is fairly generic throughout the series, and while the choreography is fairly well handled, there is a certain lack in terms of impact because of this.As far as the characters go, they\'re all pretty much what one would expect from a harem comedy. That\'s not to say that they\'re bad though, as they\'re nicely presented for the most part. It simply means that they\'re formulaic and, because of this limitation, they are only allowed to develop in certain ways. However, given the mass of harem comedies appearing over the last few years it has to be said that while Nyan Koi does have generic characters, they\'re nowhere near as bad as some I could mention.One thing I will point out though, is that the addition of cats, and their effect on Junpei, is actually beneficial for the series as a whole. While the overall effect isn\'t really telling to the viewer, the relationship between Junpei and the various felines he helps allows the viewer to relegate the harem aspect of the series, and this allows the humour to come to the fore.Now I will admit that I did find myself chuckling to this show, as many cat owners might find themselves doing in certain scenes. While I\'m not a big fan of harem anime in general, the cats allow one to appreciate the humour in amore defined manner, and the show has less of a need to place the lead male in various ecchi sitautions in an attempt to get some laughs - something which is a big plus in my book.While the series isn\'t a complete transposition of the manga, it does have the benefit of allowing the viewer to appreciate the visual humour in a way that the manga just couldn\'t convey. That said, the last few episodes, being anime originals, do suffer because the writing in them just isn\'t as good as it is in the rest of the series.Fans of harem comedies may be of two minds about the show to be honest. There\'s a number of good points to the series, however there has been no real attempt to step away from the generic nature of the typical harem anime, and this places limitations on what can and can\'t be done. This is actually one of the reasons why I prefer Koi Neko over Nyan Koi as, while both include cats talking to humans, Koi Neko takes a completely different approach.Nyan Koi is enjoyable though, and it\'s the humour that most will appreciate come the end of the series.It\'s just a shame that the lesson of Ai Yori Aoshi (i.e. the lead male doesn\'t have to be generic, mediocre, or a loser), still hasn\'t been learned. a severe allergy to all things feline.

Wahahahaha!”If you were like me, not sure whether to try watching a show about talking cats, then rest assure because Nyan Koi is more than your average pet-talking anime! Produced by AIC, it should come as no surprise if Nyan Koi manage to remind viewers of another “semi” AIC production known as Seto no Hanayome. Both are considered rom-com harem and they share many common traits in my humble opinion. Thus it is very tempting to make comparisons between them, but I will restrain myself to the best of my ability to not do so too often in the...review.Although the talking cats may not be the most adorable pets you have ever seen, but they are significant to the anime as they are used to push forward story events and in some cases, help develop character relations. While cats obviously do not talk like human do, but due to a curse on our protagonist Junpei, he gained the ability to communicate with them (hence the talking cat you have heard about). The story follows Junpei with his daily struggle with school, friends, love, and helping cats in need. While the plot may sound a bit generic, but what makes the show entertaining is the interaction among the characters.“Misfortune-moe” is a silly term used to describe the character behavior of one of the twins in the story. As one can probably imagine, those who finds misfortunate (or sheer bad luck) to be something liked about is pretty sick and cruel as far as their character is concerned. But viewers will often find themselves helplessly laughing at the cruelty of the “misfortune-moe” twin. Nyan Koi is the type of show that can bring out the funniness in even the weirdest of situations. Another entertaining character, who sadly did not have as much impact to the story as I would have liked, goes by the name of Nagi Ichinose. Here is the one flag that should make all Seto no Hanayome viewers go “ah, that looks (and the background music sounds) familiar … now where have I watched a similar show like that before?”.All in all, characters in Nyan Koi all contributed in their own unique way. However one thing that seems lacking is the character growth for the “slightly less important” characters. We certainly witnessed development to Junpei as a character, but other equally important characters like Kanako could have had more screen time for development. Anyhow, I understand that it can be very difficult for a short 12 episodes series to have much development for its second class heroes, but it has been done before in many shows. Thus in that regard, Nyan Koi may be a bit unsatisfactory.The animation style is mostly refreshing and unique, but once a while there will be scenes that look rather similar to Seto no Hanayome (not the art, but the technique used to create certain atmosphere). Although not a masterpiece level in terms of animation, there isn’t much that one can truly complain about. Smooth scene transition? Check. Non-repetitive scene usage? Check. Consistent animation quality? Check. Well drawn, well animated characters and pets? Check. The animation certainly is one of the stronger points of the show.The OP and ED both are pleasant to hear; just don’t expect anything catchy that could stay in your mind for more than an hour. The music department deserves some credit for matching hilarious scenes with funny BGM and so on, but they pale in comparison to the hard work of the voice acting screw, the seiyu. With great talented seiyu like Yuu Kobayashi, Ryoko Shiraishi, and most of all Jun Fukuyama, there are enough big names in the anime to attract a large number of fans (yes, in Japan seiyu are practically celebrities and have their own fan clubs etc). These skillful voice actors/actresses give life to the characters and made them much more enjoyable to watch.Nyan Koi certainly brought a great deal of joy and entertainment to the viewers. The one thing AIC could work on to improve the anime is the somewhat simple, linear plot. Otherwise, the animation and characters, combined with skillful seiyu, makes this show a worthy candidate to spend your time. review.Although the talking cats may not be the most adorable pets you have ever seen, but they are significant to the anime as they are used to push forward story events and in some cases, help develop character relations.

Here is the one flag that should make all Seto no Hanayome viewers go “ah, that looks (and the background music sounds) familiar … now where have I watched a similar show like that before?”.All in all, characters in Nyan Koi all contributed in their own unique way. However one thing that seems lacking is the character growth for the “slightly less important” characters. We certainly witnessed development to Junpei as a character, but other equally important characters like Kanako could have had more screen time for development. Anyhow, I understand that it can be very difficult for a short 12 episodes series to have much development for its second class heroes, but it has been done before in many shows. Thus in that regard, Nyan Koi may be a bit unsatisfactory.The animation style is mostly refreshing and unique, but once a while there will be scenes that look rather similar to Seto no Hanayome (not the art, but the technique used to create certain atmosphere). Although not a masterpiece level in terms of animation, there isn’t much that one can truly complain about. Smooth scene transition? Check. Non-repetitive scene usage? Check. Consistent animation quality? Check. Well drawn, well animated characters and pets? Check. The animation certainly is one of the stronger points of the show.The OP and ED both are pleasant to hear; just don’t expect anything catchy that could stay in your mind for more than an hour. The music department deserves some credit for matching hilarious scenes with funny BGM and so on, but they pale in comparison to the hard work of the voice acting screw, the seiyu. With great talented seiyu like Yuu Kobayashi, Ryoko Shiraishi, and most of all Jun Fukuyama, there are enough big names in the anime to attract a large number of fans (yes, in Japan seiyu are practically celebrities and have their own fan clubs etc). These skillful voice actors/actresses give life to the characters and made them much more enjoyable to watch.Nyan Koi certainly brought a great deal of joy and entertainment to the viewers. The one thing AIC could work on to improve the anime is the somewhat simple, linear plot. Otherwise, the animation and characters, combined with skillful seiyu, makes this show a worthy candidate to spend your time.', ""Mmmm, I see quite a few of Nyan Koi! reviews being presented at this present moment, and to be fair, if you want to read a well written review; read Archaeon's review. My review will not be as fluffy, nor as well written.Now let's start with Nyan Koi!'s biggest problem; it's a harem. Apart from harem fanboys, are there actually people that watch anime fairly objectively who enjoy harem anime? No, probably not. You know there's this thing about harem, mmm,..... what's it called? Generic? Ah yes, generic. This anime is no exception, it's generic, has a weak storyboard and try to save this already...sinking ship (and I mean this ship, which is an analogy for the anime of course, was sinking as soon as it embarked and tried getting out of the port it was docked to) by quirking it up with cats. (The paragraphs that follow mays contain minor spolers, nothing big though.)What's worse is that it's not a consistent plot carrying feature in the anime apart from the initial introduction of this feature which causes it to become a gimmick, a side thing that takes up too much space since it's not actually important to the plot. They just sort of dropped it on the way out of convenience. Why? Because of harem, because the male main protagonist has to be loved by a horde of all the stereotypical female harem characters that the producers could find. We have the sweet girl next door, the tomboy x 2, one being a hybrid between a tomboy, tsundere/yandere and childhood friend, the other one being a sempai (in one grade higher at high school, oh!, oh! and guess what she's actually a daughter of the yakuza!)  then we have the twins, one completely open with the undying love she feels for the guy, being a bit on the freaky side with some emo stuff going on then we have the tsundere/yandere that absolutely hates him, but she it's so cute when she gets those red cheeks as she blushes when she's fighting her inner self, because she just knows she really likes him.I probably forgot someone, but that's the thing, the characters are so forgettable they lose all importance and since the characters lose all importance so does the anime itself. Now please, let's not fool ourselves fanboys and others, there existed no plot to speak of in this anime, if you thought there was a plot or story to talk about in this anime, you either generally have really bad perception abilities, you're a complete fanboy of harem and/or cat shows or you've simply not watched many good anime series, which is unfortunate.The general concencus seems to be that this anime is worthy of a rating of 8 here on mal. I mean I know the toplist here on mal is pretty biased what with the making of multiple accounts and whatnot for the purpose of messing with the toplists, but 8? I gave GTO an 8. G. T. O..... (I chose GTO arbitrarily, could have been any other of my 8's, but I think GTO speaks even more for itself than perhaps many others.)Yes, I did watch this mainly to have something to bash on when it had finished airing, but I watch all shows objectively, I welcome all genres to try and surprise me, but Nyan Koi! did not surprise me, it is not the worst harem I've seen, but it certainly is not something I'd want to hang up my christmas tree.Thank you for reading, I doubt you read all of it though, if you did I am sorry for any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, it's just that I never recheck these reviews of crap anime I write because I simply don't care. Please do not share with me your opinion if you disagree with me because if you do you are not on the correct side of this battle we fight. sinking ship (and I mean this ship, which is an analogy for the anime of course, was sinking as soon as it embarked and tried getting out of the port it was docked to) by quirking it up with cats.

So every episode or so we get to see a new cat with some trouble, and our allergic hero trying his best to help the poor cat.Now unfortunately it isn't as promising as this might've sound. Nyan Koi! is...a harem anime, and you'll find that it does a lot of harem-esque episodes and setting, among others the school excursion, swimming pool trip and naturally a swing to the amusement park. Most of the settings have been done before in more than one anime, and it's just being re-lived here, no genre-shaking events, no brilliance to set it out from the crowd.When the show starts out the focus is much more on the cats, perhaps the reason being that all the characters aren't fully introduced yet, but it gradually turns more and more into a cheesy harem comedy, winding up as a lot more generic harem with every implication this brings forth. Dull and bland, with little to savor from it. Admittedly, it does present a few laughable moments throughout its whole, but aside that the entertainment value is very low, and unless someone is a big fan of harem series with little flair to them, it isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.Character-wise, there's nothing to write home about. Every character fills their standard harem role to an extent. The wimpy main. The wimpy main's out-of-this-world-cute love interest. The wimpy main's tombyish childhood friend. The crazy cross-dresser. Even a pair of twins; the yandere and the tsundere girls. And a crazy older girl. The others aren't much to talk about either; from the typical mom-and-sister pair to the crazed old man, and of course one or two filler guy friends of the male lead.Pretty much that's it. They're set in stone as charcaters and have limited potential. But Nyan Koi! at least tries to use that potential, salvaging what it could from the characters to make them better than bad, if not necessarily good.The art style is not particularly outstanding either. The color palette is bright and rich, filled with clear and hapyp colors. The character designs aren't particularly outstanding, and rather flat. The detail put into the characters' various attires is a redeeming factor though. Overall the depth of the animation isn't very present, much due to the rather simple effort put into shadowing and light effects in general. Most of the scapes and interiors are made a tad too background-y, and as such the characters and other nonstatic objects feel slightly awkward in comparison. What it does well, however, is the visual humor. From their expressions to effects and the like, it does help in provoking a good laugh when due.The soundtrack is just like the rest of the serious, rather average and nothing to really look forward to. The background music contains all the standard themes for the various harem anime situations and moods, and fits right in with said moods, but I found myself thinking how the music should've been better, which kind of deterred the mood. The opening theme is a rather typical upbeat J-pop song, with a bright, cheerful vocal line and likewise string parts. The ending theme is a tad richer in its build and thus more listen-able, but still has an air of ending theme written all over it.Overall Nyan Koi! ends up nothing more than an average harem series with nothing in particular to add to the genre, and save for a few laughs here and there is not something worth the time it takes to watch it. a harem anime, and you'll find that it does a lot of harem-esque episodes and setting, among others the school excursion, swimming pool trip and naturally a swing to the amusement park.

The design of the cats was better (um..yes better) then the characters\' one: a twist of colours for each cat making it easy to remark even in a croud of cats and again, everything was defined in a boring way that doesn\'t attracts your eye.Sound: 3 - PoorThe opening/ending songs are pretty lame and practically sends to the watcher ""waves"" of confusion (I mainly talk about the lyrics of the opening song) since it\'s not even a true love triangle (if you watched animes where there is a good accent on love triangle you know what I mean) and the curse is not an opportunity or even help to Junpei for almost all episodes.Character: 5 - MediocreThe characters of this series are totally predictable after watching them in action for like 5 minutes.Junpei is your nice doggy when he\'s around Kaede that is happy but still doesn\'t know how to express this (well he\'s a human in this anime so being incapable to discuss with the person you like it\'s not comic or romantic).Kaede is your innocent anime girl, with a childish look that could make almost all boys fall for her (in the anime of course).Of course , this innocence is taken to an extreme in situations like: talking about love, discussing with the boy she likes, understanding the meaning of things related to love, etc.She\'s the type of girl that would say in the middle of a Nyan Koi episode:""Junpei, will you let me wait for you in season 2 , too?"".""Kana-chan"" is the final person completing the so-called love triangle that realize that she loves Junpei , can\'t confess , but she manifests in different ways.I would say that she is the most normal person from the love triangle when taking things serious and her ""cons"" are excessivly ""attacking"" Junpei and of course incapacity to make him understand what she feels. (but I guess that goes for this kind of anime , excepting one thing: see Nyan Koi , genres, ROMANCE).In this case, Junpei it\'s the brainless one too because he tries figuring out something at some point ..but of course fails.Kotone and Akari are just 2 more characters added to fill the story and make it more boring.Of course they chain some events to them so we can\'t say they can miss from the anime.After watching the whole anime I really think the best character was Nyamsus (seriously).Overall: 3 - PoorI can\'t say I enjoyed this anime.For normal people that aren\'t addicted to this genre and just look an anime I frankly tell you to search another one because this isn\'t worth wasting your time.For people addicted to comedy/rom/harem I tell you the same thing a bit more detailed.This isn\'t your com/rom/har anime , it\'s just a pathetic fail that tries to impress the watchers with lame and hilariousscenes.In conclusion I truly regret watching this and I don\'t recommand it to you! relations between the characters is simple , as Junpei doesn\'t get to approach them very much (few exceptions).And when you think finally something interesting happens the moment gets ruined by another character (including the cats).In some cases this could be considered funny (depending on what\'s happening) but after countless times it gets boring and it\'s not even ""funny"" , so we can\'t even think about enjoying this.Art: 6 - FairWhen I watch an anime I don\'t really care about art but indeed there are a few points that need some attention.Well, the characters were pretty easy to remark since they where indeed made to look different from each other , but nothing that can catch your eye was in.

Nyan Koi is a complete work of art.==[Pros]==- Humor.  This comedy doesn\'t fail to deliver on its most important aspect.  Whether it\'s the sudden change from Mizuno\'s dramatic yakuza ringtone to a completely serene scene or a shot of Junpei and the twins licking popsicles, Nyan Koi never disappoints.  The humor in this show is both crude and refined, direct and indirect.  Nyan Koi is funny, and isn\'t afraid to show it.- Junpei.  He is a great male lead - one of the greatest I\'ve ever seen....At first glance, he looks average... almost... too average.

This was 2009 fall season's harem, and definitely an improvement to the usual. Nyan Koi! it's not an upgrade to the harem formula and doesn't add anything new to the lot but, at the end, managed to deliver lots of fun and, as a result of that, quality.Almost everything in this show it's a bit chiché, take for example the fascination that japanese people have for animals like foxes or dogs. Now it's the cats turn; meet Kousaka Junpei, a typical 2nd year high school student alergic to cats that has been cursed. In order...to prevent his body from becoming cat-like he has to make 100 wishes come true, wishes that come from cats. Aside from being slowly transformed into a cat, the curse brings other consecuences to Jumpei: he can understand and comunicate with cats. This makes the show entertaining to a certain point. The overall plot develops based on this wishes that Jumpei grants, accompanied with lots of comedy and incredible situations along the way.The animation it's decent. It doesn't stand out a lot and it doesn't look bad either. It's just right. It haves  minor ecchi elements that go on par with the harem theme and some models, like the cats, are very funny to look at due to their diversity.The music it's matched perfectly to the ambience in the anime. Nyanderful! has the perfect title and rhythm to make out an impression about the whole show at once. The BGMs are pretty lively as well and nice timed. Other than that the seiyus do a great job reflecting each of the characters personality. One of the biggest achivements this anime has acomplished; the sound and music are above average to what mostly one listens to.Typical coming from a harem anime we've got the classic steoreotypical characters that usually are created for this genre: the tsundere girl, the clueless girl, the yakuza-manly girl, the stalker girl and the real loved girl. The characters are funny and you get to see enough content of each one, so no specific character is missed. Added to that the cats have their own personality and problems as well, this makes the show feel somehow refreshing and unique.Nyan Koi! it's a blast to watch, you can laugh a lot or just check it out for the harem-partly ecchi experience. This anime can be extremely entertaining if the viewer can stand the clichés that surround it.So the typical harem formula is applied: the same use of characters, situations (somebody said a pool episode?) and somehow linear chain of events. Besides that some of this events are really funny and some of the characters stand out. Lastly the voice acting is awesome and the music is applied nicely.

(I like to finish what I start, okay?)Other than talking cats, there's really nothing new here. It's just a generic anime about a guy who for some ungodly reason has a plethora of cute girls are who are into him. Like a lot of harem anime, there are moments of big-breasted-ness, panty shots, accidental groping and purposeful groping (girls groping girls) but most of the comedy in this series is supposed to be from...the interference of Junpei's life from the cats, which he is severely allergic too. A lot of the anime is focused on Junpei juggling his need to lift his curse by helping cats and doing everyday things while the girls (Mostly Sumiyoshi and Nagi-sempai) make his life even more difficult.The characters... ugh. Sumiyoshi and Mizuno were both unbearable to watch. And they were the two main love interests. Sumiyoshi is the tsundere childhood friend and Mizuno is well... the girl that's good at everything, exceptionally beautiful, feminine and loved by all... blech.The ending... what ending? This series just should have ended but they left it open with no confessions of love from any character so they can have a second season. This show doesn't need a second season.

Please read the synopsis before reading this review to familiarize yourself with the story.This anime (short-lived only 12 eps long) is just average for an anime series.  First off, a show entirely about cats is bland.  There are all sorts of information pamphlets and such about cats, how they behave, and there are even ways to communicate with them.  For the over-the-top cat lover you might find some interest in this story.  Furthermore, this show is heavily accented with fan service (in the opening...theme of the show, each female character is given a chest/buttocks shot for reasons unfathomable).  If you want to drown yourself in the protagonist's plight to end his problems (including his romantic ones), see lots of annoying cats, and see what I originally thought was a BOY, then this show is the perfect fit.But, BUT, BUTTTT... Being a cat lover myself I did have a reasonable level of enjoyment with this show as I never thought they'd throw in a love triangle with the main character and two of his classmates at school.  Character development is fair/bland at best as the trials/calamities seem very very TRIVIAL (having a crush on one another, trying so hard just to squeeze in a date or kiss).  If they had accelerated the slow pace of the storyline I could imagine more people showing interest in this series.  As stated, if you ARE a cat lover then I would recommend this show as a light escape from the more serious shows that have intrigued you for a while. theme of the show, each female character is given a chest/buttocks shot for reasons unfathomable).

""Nyanderful"" is so fit with the anime itself. The lyrics i mean.- As for BGM, i think its just so so. there is nothing special on it.- The OP and ED is surely attractive, but for myself, but it doesnt so catchy. so dont expect too high on this OP or ED.CHARACTER 8/10- In this anime, we have a tsundere girl, a twin, a machosist, and a cute girl. What else? its just full of unique girls. Well, Typical of harem anime.- The development between the character is maybe the biggest problem in this anime since it just got 12 episodes, but it doesnt really matter, since once again, the attractive of how Nyan Koi presents of the character is surely interesting in so many ways.Overall 8/10- If you really like with harem anime, this will be worth to try. since, it was interesting for me if i should say, i\'ve never enjoyed harem anime this much.- one more thing, You better put this anime into your PTW. lol. cat? hmm..... thats WORKS!STORY : 8/10The story involves about the man who is been cursed by cat statue because of some accident, and for erase that curse, that man aka Junpei, must grant 100 wishes from cats or he will turned into a cat!- The story itself makes me interest to watch it, since usually harem anime is focussing on the development between each character, and for this anime is focussing on how Junpei cure the curse but i didnt said there aren\'t any development, there are. but its just the ""side dish"".- The jokes itself is refreshing, i mean i laughed a lot when watching this anime. the jokes really got the spot.- Its a light story, so its easy to understand. you dont have to think too much to see this anime.- Usually, based on what i seen, the ""main story"" just come in early minutes. like when minutes 1 - 13 and the others is just the fillers. but i didnt mind, since what i seek is ""Enjoyment""ART 9/10- Here is, the strongest point of this anime. the artwork of character seems so mature, and its so different between another harem anime which is usually using ""kid"" character.- The background is so well made. rich colours,and again, the character artwork.SOUND 7/10- The opening of the nyan koi, is surely attractive.

In fact, that was the sole reason I picked this up, blinded by my usual bias towards these kinds of things.  Which is why I had no idea what I was getting in to.  Arguably, it was probably for the best, since I wouldn\'t be expecting too much out of it.Despite the fact that most of the story was episodic at best, there was some semblance of a plot.  Given the premise of our fearless protagonist trying to remove a curse from himself all the while trying to...maintain the masquerade in front of anyone else out of the loop and chasing after his clueless crush, the set up was thrown aside pretty quickly in favour of the standard romantic comedy episodes; which are not bad by themselves but it is kind of a shame.  I thought it was going to evenly split the attention between the the cats and the girls but in the end the plot ended up putting emphasis on only half of the premise.  The better half of man that is.  During my time following the show, there seemed to be only two choices of which are, introduce new character, or silly harem-induced hijinks.  That is, until the last two episodes.  I bet the writers (since the anime differs from the manga plotwise, mostly) suddenly remembered that our dear protagonist was cursed.  In the supposed finale, I was waiting for them to milk the drama for all its worth, but, apparently it isn\'t worth a lot given the amount of time it took to resolve the mess and it let me down.  Any consolation for the poor overall plot is in the form of a sequel hook.The art is a different story.  Its colourful, solid and bold.  In fact, a lot of our protagonist\'s feline friends are even well drawn and animated like the cutesy critters that cats are. It is hard to find fault in the art for Nyan Koi even as it shifts style for various effects.Sound is also an artful triumph.  Though I don\'t follow Voice Actors, I have to give mad props to Yuu Kobayashi, Nagi\'s VA, who does stellar job of conveying the two extremes of character.  As for the normal background sound, we get various subtle but catchy and instantly recognisable tunes.  They\'ll burrow in to your ear and enhance the action on screen like any good soundtrack does.Character-wise, its unsound; the majority of characters are not given much in this department.  If there were any development it seemed I missed it.  In fact, a main offender of a rather typical archetype is Mizuno, the ditzy little lady that our protagonist has crushed on since they entered high school together.  To some, its always nice to see a cutesy character who seems to be perpetually locked out of a loop, to others, its ""been there, done that.""  As it all centres around our male protagonist the developments the harem has towards him is almost boringly predictable.  The near uni-dimensional nature of the characters extends to our supporting cast as well, but that\'s to be expected.Flaws aside, it is supposed to elicit a chuckle and be enjoyed moment by moment.  And chuckle I did.  In fact, the nature in which I enjoyed it reminded me of another anime with humour in the same vein (which I also greatly enjoyed).  Since its a quickie, it works well for me.  Also, I love cats, so if all else fails, the cats will at the very least distract me, in a good way, with their presence.  If you are not looking for some nice and quick laughs, you might want to pass.  Best summed up as came for the cats, and stayed for the silly antics, and cats.

Perhaps it just a form of Stockholm syndrome that some people can\'t objectively rate something when they\'ve invested so much time to watching it. Or maybe I\'m just a jerk who rates things lower than most people.Anyway...Story wise there really isn\'t much. A harem anime with cats as the gimmick(Somewhere along the line they add demon fighting for an episode.).  The show claims to be a romantic comedy but it isn\'t really romantic or funny. The climax...isn\'t very interesting and the ending leaves little accomplished in terms of Kousaka\'s relationships with the girls, and the actual plot of being cursed.The art and sound didn\'t stand out to me as being either good or bad.The characters were bland and I really couldn\'t have cared less about any of them. Worse they never develop at all throughout the entire series.Overall it\'s not the worse show out there, but I definitely would advise against putting it on your plan-to-watch list unless you really have nothing better to do. isn\'t very interesting and the ending leaves little accomplished in terms of Kousaka\'s relationships with the girls, and the actual plot of being cursed.The art and sound didn\'t stand out to me as being either good or bad.The characters were bland and I really couldn\'t have cared less about any of them.

Okay, I will try a little harder. The story is revolves around Junpei Kousaka, an average highschooler living with his mother, sister and a pet cat (we learn his father is away working but little else is said). On the walk home from school one day he accidently knocks the head of a statue of a cat deity and is cursed to turn into a cat unless he fulfils the wishes of 100 cats.The story order and events are pretty standard. However, not everything about this...was as typical as you would usually expect from a harem anime. For example, some the character development was actually the best parts of this anime, such as that of Junpei and Kanako (an old childhood friend of his) which develops for a minor relationship to a fully fledge relationship that really create some of the best scenes in the anime. It was also comical to a point it actually had me laughing out loud unlike most 'comedy' anime which can stifle a smile or a giggle at the best of times.The anime obviously doesn't possess the gripping serious scenes which you would expect from Evangelion or the cripplingly sad scenes of an anime like Angel beat but what this anime does brilliantly is enjoyment. It is a fun anime to watch when you just want to settle and be calm after a long day and is not meant to be taken too seriously.However, I must say the anime on a whole strays of the main storyline of the curse and him completing it and goes into full harem/romance/comedy genre at points and that sometimes it really just become a bit too generic to a point it cannot be ignored but these are really the only major criticisms I have for the anime.The sub for this anime saw some experienced voice actors comes in such as Yukari Fukui from animes such as Kill la Kill and Highschool of the Dead and Yū Kobayashi from Attack on Titan and Buso Renkin but from a listening point of view nothing much more than the ordinary which goes for the dub, however I must say the role of Nagi Ichinose played by Kara Greenberg was brilliantly done and added to the comical sense of the anime.In conclusion if you are looking for a fun and comical anime that you can just lose yourself in and don’t have to take too seriosuly, then look no further than Nyan Koi! was as typical as you would usually expect from a harem anime.

We've seen all the same tropes countless times. I usually enjoy these tropes, but in this show, they're completely boring, and almost painful to watch. Please excuse me I am not a native English speaker.StoryThe story is rather average, a lot of things are very predictable. I laugh at the show occasionally, it is funny but like I said...it's nothing we haven't seen before. I think the tasks that Junpei has to do for the cats are fairly funny, and creative, but his relationship with Kaede is what really put me off about the show. Personally I am not a fan of the ' Happy Girl', I find them to be too common in these shows, and I don't find them funny at all. They are boring. But in this show Junpei and Kaede are too similar to be in a relationship, they're more like brother and sister and it is boring beyond belief and that really put me off. The only reason I continued watching is because of Kanako. I find her relationship with Junpei to be fun and unpredictable at times, but I don't feel as if she got enough screen time. I got bored of seeing too much of Kaede, so I don't know much about the second half of the show. To summarise, the story is fairly funny, but the relationship with Junpei and Kaede is boring, and painful to watch.ArtThe art was good. I think that the art style is a bit outdated, but that isn't the reason I dropped the show. I liked the colour choices they used, it's very bright and vibrant, not to mention I highly approve of those curves. (☝︎ ՞ਊ ՞)☝︎ . It isn't as viabrant as many other series, but it's a good 8/10. The CG sections were.... present, but I like the use of blue and yellow, and I love the designs of the cats. That is why the art is an 8/10SoundI don't pay attention to the sound, but seeing that I did find the music quit relaxing, I give it a 7/10. Again I don't pay attention to sound so this review will be short. Sub>Dub.CharacterPoo. I already mentioned that I don't like Kaede, the boring rom-com trope that I hope will die, but now I'll talk about Junpei. I find him to be selfish, and a small, skinny, tic-tac dick. He only cares about his relationship with whats-her-name Kate or whatever. He doesn't care about anyone else as far as I'm concerned, and he gets onto these  awkward situations without him knowing. It makes me cringe. His allergy to cats does make for some funny moments, but it only takes up about 20% of what I have watched. He's one of them male MC cliches that I like until it gets serious. Did I mention I don't like Kaede? At least she's not as bad as Asahina from Suzumiya. The only character I liked was Kanako. I find those characters fairly funny and more interesting than the boring girl that the male MC always likes. I don't like anyone except for Kanako and maybe some of the supporting characters.EnjoymentI find the show quite enjoyable, but when I finished an episode, my first instinct was not to watch the next episode. I never cared what happened, I just wanted to see the relationship between Junpei and Kanako grow, and the relationship between Junpei and Kaesong shatter into a million pieces, get flushed down the toilet, and go into the state drink supply, only to be urinated out, and be drunk again, until it evaporates into the sky, and fall out into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. But the cats where very funny, and provided a great alternative to the relationship between Junpei and his second sister Kaedick. They only enjoyable parts where Kanako, Ichinose, and the cats. Everything else was fairly boring.OverallThe show was alright. I dropped after seeing too much of the unbearably boring 'Happy girl' but that's not what I came to see. I came to see his relationship with Kanako, and maybe the cats, but instead I got another These-Characters-Are-Too-Similar-It's-Unsettling relationships. I think there is potential for humour in these relationships, but it depends on the male MC, and whether he likes the cliche boring girl or not. I guess I didn't like the show because the show was bad, I didn't like it because I cannot stand the male MC always liking the boring girl. At least in other series it seems like by the end the MC leans towards the other, more interesting girl, but from what I've seen in this series, he ends up with ms Annoyingtrope. Then again, I couldn't finish the show because I can't stand these relationships. So mock me if you will. This concludes my review of Nyan Koi by Fujiwara Sato. it's nothing we haven't seen before. I think the tasks that Junpei has to do for the cats are fairly funny, and creative, but his relationship with Kaede is what really put me off about the show. Personally I am not a fan of the ' Happy Girl', I find them to be too common in these shows, and I don't find them funny at all. They are boring. But in this show Junpei and Kaede are too similar to be in a relationship, they're more like brother and sister and it is boring beyond belief and that really put me off. The only reason I continued watching is because of Kanako. I find her relationship with Junpei to be fun and unpredictable at times, but I don't feel as if she got enough screen time. I got bored of seeing too much of Kaede, so I don't know much about the second half of the show. To summarise, the story is fairly funny, but the relationship with Junpei and Kaede is boring, and painful to watch.ArtThe art was good. I think that the art style is a bit outdated, but that isn't the reason I dropped the show. I liked the colour choices they used, it's very bright and vibrant, not to mention I highly approve of those curves. (☝︎ ՞ਊ ՞)☝︎ . It isn't as viabrant as many other series, but it's a good 8/10. The CG sections were.... present, but I like the use of blue and yellow, and I love the designs of the cats. That is why the art is an 8/10SoundI don't pay attention to the sound, but seeing that I did find the music quit relaxing, I give it a 7/10. Again I don't pay attention to sound so this review will be short. Sub>Dub.CharacterPoo. I already mentioned that I don't like Kaede, the boring rom-com trope that I hope will die, but now I'll talk about Junpei. I find him to be selfish, and a small, skinny, tic-tac dick. He only cares about his relationship with whats-her-name Kate or whatever. He doesn't care about anyone else as far as I'm concerned, and he gets onto these  awkward situations without him knowing. It makes me cringe. His allergy to cats does make for some funny moments, but it only takes up about 20% of what I have watched. He's one of them male MC cliches that I like until it gets serious. Did I mention I don't like Kaede? At least she's not as bad as Asahina from Suzumiya. The only character I liked was Kanako. I find those characters fairly funny and more interesting than the boring girl that the male MC always likes. I don't like anyone except for Kanako and maybe some of the supporting characters.EnjoymentI find the show quite enjoyable, but when I finished an episode, my first instinct was not to watch the next episode. I never cared what happened, I just wanted to see the relationship between Junpei and Kanako grow, and the relationship between Junpei and Kaesong shatter into a million pieces, get flushed down the toilet, and go into the state drink supply, only to be urinated out, and be drunk again, until it evaporates into the sky, and fall out into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. But the cats where very funny, and provided a great alternative to the relationship between Junpei and his second sister Kaedick. They only enjoyable parts where Kanako, Ichinose, and the cats. Everything else was fairly boring.OverallThe show was alright. I dropped after seeing too much of the unbearably boring 'Happy girl' but that's not what I came to see. I came to see his relationship with Kanako, and maybe the cats, but instead I got another These-Characters-Are-Too-Similar-It's-Unsettling relationships. I think there is potential for humour in these relationships, but it depends on the male MC, and whether he likes the cliche boring girl or not. I guess I didn't like the show because the show was bad, I didn't like it because I cannot stand the male MC always liking the boring girl. At least in other series it seems like by the end the MC leans towards the other, more interesting girl, but from what I've seen in this series, he ends up with ms Annoyingtrope. Then again, I couldn't finish the show because I can't stand these relationships. So mock me if you will. This concludes my review of Nyan Koi by Fujiwara Sato."", ""Brief Summary: Rating: 7 (Good)A consistent Rom/Com harem with a solid love triangle, fueled by a quirky premise.Long Summary:Nyan Koi! is about a boy, Kousaka Junpei, that becomes cursed and can now talk to cats, and has to grant the requests of a hundred cats or else he'll turn into a cat himself. Naturally, he's allergic to cats, and even more naturally, he can't tell anyone about the curse or else it'll make the curse even worse. This hinders his plans at pursuing the girl of his dreams, and causes other girls to enter his life.This may sound like a typical Rom/Com harem, where...a nondescript high school boy gains a power/gets put in a weird situation and suddenly girls start randomly falling in love with him. While Nyan Koi! doesn't do anything particularly significant in straying from this formula, the character relationships and comedy do make Nyan Koi! a lot more enjoyable than many of its mediocre peers.Story: 7 (Good)The story is a mixture of romantic and comedic moments, as Junpei struggles to rid himself of the cat curse by interacting with cats as he deals with all the girls around him. The anime doesn't waste much time in setting up the cat curse, and does a good job of never straying from the curse as the central concept.The comedy and romance are both presented at a good pace, despite its short 12 episode length, and the story makes sure to give time to all major supporting characters as well. A couple things come out of the blue (such as the real professions of the twins), but in general the story stays consistent to its themes and isn't overbearing on either the comedy nor the romance aspects.Art: 7 (Good)The art in Nyan Koi! is appropriate for an anime airing in Fall 2009, with clear, distinctive character designs and detailed backgrounds. In particular, the cat designs were good, because it was not difficult to see a cat once and be able to identify that same cat later on in the series, which really helped make the cats become good supporting characters.Sound: 7 (Good)The opening and ending songs matched the lighthearted feel of the anime,  and the soundtrack as a whole, while nothing special, fit appropriately. The VAs were all solid as well.Characters: 8 (Very Good)I felt the characters in Nyan Koi! are what makes the series better than many other Rom/Com harems, because in general the more important characters have good, sensible core inspirations and motivations (core being a key word) that don't solely stem from the cat curse. However, the characters manage to avoid being predictable by being willing to alter their perspectives in situations that warrant it, instead of being totally clueless or stubborn in their beliefs.None of the characters are unbearably offensive or annoying, but still manage to have interesting enough traits to create a lot of funny moments. The members of the love triangle still suffer from some level of denseness, as usual, but it's a tolerable level.More importantly, Junpei, while relatively nondescript like most male leads, manages to avoid being unusually clumsy, stupid, dense, perverted, heroic, etc. Furthermore, most of the situations he gets into are because of his unluckiness, rather than numbskullness or pervsion on his part (exceptions do apply). This allowed me to enjoy the anime more, since I didn't have to constantly question the intelligence/motivations of the main character.Conclusion: Rating: 7 (Good)Nyan Koi! isn't a must watch, but if you're a fan of the genre, it's worth checking out. It's lighthearted and amusing, and while you won't be struck by a feeling of awe after watching, you likely won't be disappointed either. a nondescript high school boy gains a power/gets put in a weird situation and suddenly girls start randomly falling in love with him.

In the case of Nyan Koi! someone should have stopped the onslaught of nonsensical girls sooner and not stopped the plot as soon as they did.I know what you\'re thinking, ""but it\'s a harem show - there\'s supposed to be tons of girls."" BUT Nyan Koi sacrificed being a good romantic comedy or a good small harem (does 2-3 count as a harem?) for being a sloppy very mediocre harem rom-com of which there are all ready many out...there. Half way through they just threw away the decent plot and the few good characters they had, and said ""screw it, this is hard just draw more girls"". If you still feel their choice was justified you must be a 15 year old boy because plot does matter even in harems.For the first couple of episodes I rated this show as 7/8 by the end it was 4/5 so I went with a 6 for overall for the following reasons:So about the story...as you may have already gathered Junpei is a young man who has always been terribly allergic to cats. One day he accidentally destroys a cat statue in a local shrine and is then cursed by the cat god. As penance to have the curse lifted and thus avoid being turned into a cat, which would certainly be fatal for him, he must help 100 cats with their problems. This is a pretty unique and good story line that has lots of potential for comedic moments. The funniest parts of the show are Junpie is trying to fulfill cats\' requests, and it would have been so great if they had stuck with the story past episode 7 or 8 because it was genuinely entertaining. By the end it seems like the writers forgot that was a major part of the story because it is barely included anymore, although in episode 12 they seem to recover from their amnesia in time for a hurried conclusion. The first love triangle is pretty good - there\'s a girl Jupei likes who secretly likes him back and his childhood friend who he has grown apart from but still has a crush on him - it\'s pretty believable, cute and ripe for awkward moments and confusion. The rest is downhill from there as several random girls fall for him with barely even weak attempts at explanations on the writers\' part.Junpei is an unusually good lead male. He\'s helpless enough that it\'s cute, but not so helpless you want to punch him. Unlike many other harem guys, I do see why the girls like him (the first couple anyway) - he\'s cute and a little awkward but sweet. The first 2 girls are pretty good as well - a shy cute and awkward girl with a heart of gold and the rough and tumble but good natured tomboy. The rest of the girls might work as side characters in a different show because they have interesting and funny personalities, but in the context of just trying to get with Jupei they end up seeming utterly silly and ridculous. The best characters are the cast of cats who Junpei needs to help - each one is unique and all of them are hysterical. I wish we had seen more of them becuase they were so much better than most of the girls.The art while not spectacular, was pretty good. I liked the use of color, andoverall  it seemed to be executed with reasonable skill. The character design seemed fitting, and the girls were cute (with big boobs) without being stupid or offensive looking.It might be worth watching the first 6-7 episodes of this show then just skipping to the last one - you won\'t miss much. there.

One of my first and favorite anime that I had ever watched as a kid when I was being introduced into anime. This will be a long one, so bear with me folks!Story: (6/10)A BRIEF SUMMARY: (You don't have to read this you know. Just read the synopsis!) One day, the main character Kousaka, Junpei, a high school student, walks home after from school. On the way home, he sees an empty can on the road 'waiting' to be recycled. Instead of picking it up like 'any' bystander would do, he decides to kick it instead into the trash can. Unfortunately, the...can whirls out the trash can, and breaks off the head of the cat statue that happened to be there. On the next day, he is cursed as he knowingly can hear and talk to cats. To lift this curse off of him, a cat Tama tells him that he must be willing to fulfill 100 requests from the cats with all his sincerity and to not to tell anyone about the curse or else he will turn into a cat.Art: (7/10)The art was fairly decent. Not the best, but it was indeed fun to look at! Especially when it came to the OP and ED art designs.Sound: (8/10)The OP is extremely catchy, as it matched the tone coming into the anime which was one of it's a strong point in this anime. That can also be applied to the ED as well. The OSTs however were limited and overused in some moments of the anime.Character(s):Since I've watched many kinds of anime, I know what cliches and stereotypes about a high-school, romantic-comedy, ecchi, harem might have.  (That's a lot of genre tags there.) Especially when it comes down to this anime. You got the 'dull MC', the 'moe', the 'childhood friend', the 'twin-tailed tsundere', the college student who like to drink a lot, and etc. But, when it comes to the characters however, expect each and every one of them with interesting personalities.Enjoyment:My enjoyment of this anime was decent as I fairly enjoyed the anime throughout!Overall:As a kid, this anime was one of childhood favorites. Now, that I've come back to re-watch it again, it's just your typical high-school, romance, comedy, harem, ecchi anime. (That's a lot of genre tags there.) But, overall what makes it worth your time though is how the romance (even though it was a 'bit' forced) and comedy (even though it was a 'bit' exaggerated), is what made this anime fun to watch!(SPOILER)What's disappointing however is that this anime doesn't end with the MC ending up with someone. Leaving (you) viewers wanting to know 'who' and 'who' ends up together. Unfortunately, the story is left without another season and without a conclusive ending. The reason behind all this, is because the manga is left unfinished, for quite some time now, as the manga also leaves to an inconclusive ending as well. The manga has been on haitus since then, and there are no news about it continuing disappointingly. As of right now, we won't know for sure if there will ever be a concluded story of Nyan Koi in the near future. Just read a fan-fiction who ends up with who, that would be my advice!To paraphrase it, don't watch it if you don't like inconclusive endings! Well, that's my review folks!

A guy breaks a shrine for a cat and so is cursed by being able to talk to cats. Wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t allergic. Add this to a slice of life school life anime like this and well…. you have Nyan Koi.What kind of family would keep a cat when their son is allergic to them? At least get him some meds or something for it because...it’s really taking over his life. They are jerks in that aspect. Almost all the people around him are jerks to a pretty big extent. Take for example Kanako who is a perfect example of a Tsundere character. She always fights with him, even when she finds out what she hated him for was her own misunderstanding. All the characters are pretty much normal characters you would expect from a school life anime. The dunce love interest, the Tsundere and childhood friend, the crazy butch girl, the stacker, and the almost nonexistent male friends for the main character… It’s a basic romance. And then there is the random mail carrier who always gets lost. She has pretty much no reason to even be part of the show, just for comedic affect I guess.The animation is pretty ok, looking very similar to that of newer shows but you can tell that something isn’t exactly right. I’m not really sure what it is but as I sit and watch the show, it leaves a strange feeling when looking at the art style. Its that little bit of something off that makes this show hard to watch, not just because of the voices that I will get to in a bit. Weather it’s the faces looking a bit too pointy, Junpei’s eye balls looking really small, or even the background… I just can’t get into how the designs are for this show.The English voices are very close to ear shattering with how that script was made. Sometimes I want to bang my head against the desk with out annoying many of the characters sound including the main character. They all just sound stupid and the only thing that seems to save it (And that is very rare) is when Nyamsus talks about some things even though she has the voice of a smoker. Marcy Bannor who dubs her sounds like a raspy old timer. I guess that’s what she needed to be but it’s hard to listen to against all the other voices. Junpei sounds like a typical guy and yet seems to be too loud no matter what he is doing. Even when he’s trying to be quiet, he has a forceful tone that is way to loud for it like he has one volume. Kaede sounds like a dunce, especially when talking to Junpei. In fact, I think she is the only one out of the whole world who does not get that Junpei has a crush on her. That is exactly how she sounds too. You might say that’s good script writing or dubbing but it’s hard to listen to the whole time. That and Kanako screaming and fighting all the time and you make one show that is very hard on the ears.It was a ok show but I couldn’t marathon it. Between the animation and the voice acting, it just seemed to whittle me down. And like most shows that are based on the manga, they didn’t even give it a second season to have a decent ending. it’s really taking over his life. They are jerks in that aspect. Almost all the people around him are jerks to a pretty big extent. Take for example Kanako who is a perfect example of a Tsundere character.

Weather it’s the faces looking a bit too pointy, Junpei’s eye balls looking really small, or even the background… I just can’t get into how the designs are for this show.The English voices are very close to ear shattering with how that script was made. Sometimes I want to bang my head against the desk with out annoying many of the characters sound including the main character. They all just sound stupid and the only thing that seems to save it (And that is very rare) is when Nyamsus talks about some things even though she has the voice of a smoker. Marcy Bannor who dubs her sounds like a raspy old timer. I guess that’s what she needed to be but it’s hard to listen to against all the other voices. Junpei sounds like a typical guy and yet seems to be too loud no matter what he is doing. Even when he’s trying to be quiet, he has a forceful tone that is way to loud for it like he has one volume. Kaede sounds like a dunce, especially when talking to Junpei. In fact, I think she is the only one out of the whole world who does not get that Junpei has a crush on her. That is exactly how she sounds too. You might say that’s good script writing or dubbing but it’s hard to listen to the whole time. That and Kanako screaming and fighting all the time and you make one show that is very hard on the ears.It was a ok show but I couldn’t marathon it. Between the animation and the voice acting, it just seemed to whittle me down. And like most shows that are based on the manga, they didn’t even give it a second season to have a decent ending.', ""I stumbled upon Nyan Koi! when I had nothing else to watch. My opinion on this series is that it wasn't the best I have seen. When I first read the plot, it seemed really interesting, but I found the anime to be more annoying than exciting. I am not going to deny that I did enjoy this anime somewhat. The only parts I really did enjoy watching were Sumiyoshi's and Nagi's parts. The rest were ok, but not that interesting. "", ""A new anime to add to my recommended list. I was already excited about it just by reading the description.The main story is original, ironic and causes some really funny situations. On top of that the episodes are filled with standard high school plots such as pool/beach, school trip, Christmas, ...The biggest achievement of this series' story is its end. Unlike most other harem-comedies this one has a decent captivating and 'epic' ending.The conversations are hilarious, both with cats and the girls and especially with both at the same time.

You'll probably still like this. Now I'm not a cat fan but heck this show was pretty legit. The story isn't anything too grand but it kills time.

The only fault I found with the story is that it just ends. Very little is resolved, and the creators pretty much say “Read the manga to find out more.” And to that I say, “Oh, I will.” As of the time of me writing this review, the manga is still ongoing.Characters:  8/10The characters are varied and have their own reasons for being here. Keep in mind this is a harem-themed series, so they all share a mutual love interest....But they all like Junpei for different reasons. Whether it is due to him helping out, being childhood friends, comforting another due to fears,  or one of them just having a misfortune fetish, they all like him for different reasons and that is what makes them strong characters.Animation:  7/10Animation is decent if somewhat childish. But that childish style is the animations’ strong point. This is an extravagant rom-com (romantic-comedy) and the style really suits it. It displays the annoyance of Junpei and the shy, awkward moments really well; all while still maintaining a decent style, overall. They spared little to no detail at all, and one character was never animated better than another, with the exception of Junpei in certain circumstances.Soundtrack:  5/10Aside from the opening and ending, there were not any really worthwhile soundtracks that were present until the last episode. Or at least that is when I really noticed it. There were inserts of comical sounds here and there, but they were often repeated and rather short.-Genre-Based-Comedy:  10/10Being a rom-com, comedy had better been up there, and Nyan-Koi! delivers. There was not a single episode that I did not laugh. Sure I did not cry from laughing, but I don’t need to in order to give a perfect score for comedy.Drama:  5/10Being a harem-theme series and all the girls sharing one mutual love interest, there is bound to be drama. This anime did not have much, though I suspect the manga to have more. What little this anime did have, however, is worth mentioning.Romance:  6/10Being a rom-com I was expecting more romance, this anime did not deliver on that aspect. If you are looking for a romance where the main character gets with the lead role or in this case anyone, then look elsewhere. This genre falls because the story failed to come to a close. I suspect that the manga will have a more fulfilling romantic plot.Overall:   7/10A worthwhile watch and I would recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a rom-com that has a unique plot device to it.

However, note: Allergies, curse, fear of cats are inconsistent throughout the series, they come and go.Storyline was pretty original for the episodes introducing the characters, and had...kept the main focus on track throughout the series. However, after introduction of the characters, there was a lot of harem and fanservice.A lot of content other than the main plot was added, thus the main plot was not fully developed, and only in the last few episodes were there complications regarding the pliot and finally a climax. Halfway felt like Hiyoko Brand anime, kinda mono. Romance was scarace since the harem seemed mostly stagnant.Ending was kinda rushed and unsatisfactory. Cliffhangers remain, especially with the harem.One bonus to this anime is that the atmosphere/mood stayed relatively constant throughout the series compared to Princess Diaries, and it is overall quite a relaxing series.Art:9Art was good especially with some special effects, like the magical shoujo episode and the climatic scene in the last episode. The rest were good, though nothing spectecular.Sound:9Kudos to the OP and ED. The lyrics of OP was especially well written and the ED was extremely fitting with the series, and there were tons of characters and cats in the story, which the voices brought out the personalities well with.However, there were a lot of parts where some bgm could have made the mood better instead of mere narration.Character:7Way too many characters, too little development, even on some of the main ones. Character distribution throughout the series was rather random, some disappear for a few episodes before being involved again, while Junpei\'s father just come and go.Characters\' personalities were rather stable throughout the series, although lack of development made the whole series a little over on-the-surface.The main male character had a cat allergy, yet he seemed unaffected for most of the times he makes contact with cats. Plus the curse didn\'t seem to deteriorate until the last few episodes.And on a last note, there were a lot of personalities presented, making the harem interesting yet complex: tsundere, airhead, sadist, etc.Enjoyment:7Well, I enjoyed OP and ED and Mewview very much as they tell you 1 fun fact about cats every week. The relaxed mood of the series was good too, not much serious harem vying or so on. But, the lack of romance movement spoils the mood, with some of the main characters not confessing and not responding even when they knew their feelings for each other.However, halfway through the series, I realised that there was only one main plot moving: helping 100 cats so that the curse can be broken (well this is in the 1st episode so I dun think this is a spoiler, plus later on they dun even care about the number anymore).And eh... there were some conditions attached to it, but only in the last few episodes do you see the conditions being activated. And even in the last few episodes you still can see fan service. All in all, the plot is disappointing and this hurts the enjoyment.But if you like cats you should like this series much more than me :D .Overall:8Actually is 6-8. I gave this series a 8 cos it was presented well, although there were some flaws with the content. Cats were heavily featured in this series, although some scenes with the cats seem strange.Ending was pretty strange (given how the curse was broken), along with cliffhangers in relationships and poor ending of the romance between the main characters.Plus: At the 11 min of the last episode of Nyan Koi, ""Um, there\'s no season 2"" was said by Minoru in one commercial scene.

It is basically a love story with comedy incorporated into it.The protagonist Junpei Kōsaka has a crush on a girl who loves cats yet he's allergic to them. From reading this one line summary you can probably identify the irony from the plot. As mentioned above, the story was decent, but for me the funny comments here and there are what made the show interesting. It follows the archetype of one guy having a crush on a single girl and then having numerous girls falling for him.

I admit, the first few episodes were much better than I expected, and I was excited to watch more. I was actually having fun, most of the time I just force myself to laugh at comedy anime like this, but this one had me genuinely smiling and laughing.However, as I continued with the rest of the series, I was pretty disappointed. The main appeal to me, was the humor, and that's how it should be, Nyan...Koi! being a harem and comedy after all, but I couldn't help but feel like the comedy portion of the anime was dragged out and eventually got repetitive. The gags and jokes in the beginning, that initially made me laugh, were used over and over, lessening the effect of the humor. I mean, I still kind of laughed a good few times, but not as much as before. Maybe, it was because I was having high hopes after a marvelous first, second, third, fourth episode, that the rest seemed bad in comparison. But, despite that, the episodes in its entirety were fairly good enough to keep me invested.There are flaws, as goes with every anime, and a good portion of them were the generic character designs, lack of a unique lead, and generic characters themselves (there's also the dragged out jokes and gags I already talked about). So, Nyan Koi! is the textbook definition of generic, with the only distinguishing aspect being it involves dealing with cat problems. Yes, but for a generic anime, Nyan Koi! was one of the underrated and better ones. I actually really liked the male lead. He's pretty dense, not Itsuka level dense, however, he's one of the most entertaining characters that I've seen, in terms of how the usual harem lead goes. In addition to the likable harem lead, there's also other equally likable characters, not just the ones in the main man's harem circle, but the supporting characters were also pretty entertaining.One issue that I couldn't let go, though, was the kind of rushed ending. As the anime was coming to a close, it seemed to not have enough time for a great conclusion. The ending looked a bit rushed, and it doesn't help that they give hints to a second season, which I later found out isn't likely to happen (considering the anime is 8 years old now, by the time of this review).I guess, overall, if you want to have a decent cast of characters, a likable male lead, and an overall fun time, then this is most likely what you're looking for.

Wish it there's more 'cat request' though. That's all.Overall:I've actually learned something valuable from judging an anime between its score and actual enjoyment.For this anime, if you need to take a break from heavy-plot anime, I can recommend this one. Pretty cute, relaxing and heart-warming. No deep ass drama or tension. Just watch with an open mind. For the harem and romance part, well, pretty generic but not the worst. Same old cool lines and stuff. Mochizuki lacks of screen time BTW. Come on, no love for senpais?Art:Great art, animation and drawings. Beautiful characters designs too. The 2009 art style really brings me back to the past though. Nothing to complain much here.Sound:The OP is the one which made my reminiscing more stronger. I literally can't get the tune out from my head while trying to fall asleep LOL. But anyways, love the OP.Sound effects, music theme, all fits pretty nicely to the setting/scene/mood.

Yep, I like a lot cats so when this aniem was relase I began to watch it. But I really was dissapointed with the series: this series is another harem to the list of the animes of harem.The story is about Jumpei. He has to help 100 cats. If he doesnt do that he will turn to a cat. In the first few episodes was the story, but then this part was getting forget. The story turns to a herem story and in a few episodes Junpei doesnt help cats and dedicated to the...relatonship with a lot of girlsI identified the personalities of some girls with other animes: Sumiyoshi vs Narusewagua (love hina) Nagi vs Makoto (love hina) and a etc...This series is only for see once.

I thought it was funny with a good story. You might think its weird watching something about talking cats; then you may be correct. Although talking cats are kind of weird it makes sense to the story as well as making it funny and very enjoyable.Overall if you have a bunch of free time, or looking for a nice romantic comedy and cant decide if you want to watch this... Then...watch it! watch it!', ""Harem animes are about as common place as action flicks in America, hence I am not usually enthused by the genre personally. However, I did get some laughs out of this one.If you can't already tell by the synopsis, this a story that finds humor in irony. The story itself is nothing special, but the characters were what made this more enjoyable. Characters that were seemly opposite in actions vs feeling, pairings, and find enjoyment in gloomy situations.Overall it wasn't a bad anime, and I would recommend for someone who likes to watch a lot of anime and was looking for something more...light hearted for the moment. light hearted for the moment.""]"
One Piece Movie 05: Norowareta Seiken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/463/One_Piece_Movie_05__Norowareta_Seiken,"['I am a huge fan of One Piece, and I know for a fact that many people also love it! But something I really hate is when a bad movie is created using ""One Piece"" as the title. That\'s exactly what happened here with ""One Piece: Norowareta Seiken"".This movie doesn\'t even compare to the awesomeness that One Piece offers. I\'m guessing that whoever wrote the script for this didn\'t really have ""One Piece"" in mind. They very well could have just written a script and thrown the cast of One Piece into the roles.It\'s necessary to be harsh with this movie because it...is by far one of the worst One Piece movies, and anyone who loves the show shouldn\'t waste their time to watch this movie.Story / Character: 5Basically, the summary of this movie is that The Straw Hats go to some random island to look for a sword and then Zoro betrays his friends to go meet with his old companion and fights against the crew. Okay, already you know that this is ridiculous.How many of you have seen One Piece? If you\'re willing to watch this movie, I\'m guessing you have. And you should then realize that this is crazy because even though Zoro comes across as a scary, mean swordsman most of the time, he does care deeply for his \'Nakama\' and would never betray them, even if it were to help an old friend.That\'s mainly what made me angry while watching this. Seeing the characters personalities and values changed just for the convenience of the movie was a terrible idea.Even Luffy seemed a bit off while he was on screen. Luffy may be reckless and doesn\'t think things through, but he\'s not a complete moron. The writer of this movie didn\'t seem to understand that fact.Of course, in this movie we have a new character. That\'s right, Zoro\'s friend known as \'Saga\'. Now how can I put this? Well first of all, I hate him. It doesn\'t matter how \'justified\' his actions were; as an audience, I didn\'t feel any compassion for him.Sometimes in shows we end up feeling sad for a bad guy because you realize that he was just trying to do the right thing! It makes us think to ourselves ""wow, maybe he is really a nice guy that just went about doing what he thought was right"", or something along those lines. Trust me, you won\'t feel any of that while watching this movie. It\'s really pretty impossible to be immersed into such a shallow character such as Saga.Art: 8Now, even though the story is horrific, the art is actually quite good! The characters have the same general \'One Piece\' look to them, and then the backgrounds are quite beautifully detailed. It seems as though some computer animation was used throughout the movie as well, there are times when the camera shot moves around and looks almost 3D.The fighting is also very well done. We see some pretty intense fighting shots, angles and colours during the movie. So in a way, the art reminded me of the original show, which is sad that the story couldn\'t be as good as the art was.Sound: 9If you\'ve seen One Piece, you know what the characters sound like. You will also know that the voice actors always give 110% no matter what! Their voices are part of what make the show amazing! The way they can sound so emotional, sarcastic or angry is just incredible.As mentioned before, we have a new character in this movie. Saga. His voice actor, Nakamura Shidou, is not very well known, the only role he\'s done that is worth mentioning is Ryuk from Death Note. I think there may be a reason that he hasn\'t gotten a lot of voice acting roles, it\'s not that he\'s bad, but his voice only works for certain characters. And Saga isn\'t one of them. He sounds quite out of place and out of character.Enjoyment: 5Alright, so I\'ll be fair. I didn\'t love this movie obviously, but I didn\'t feel the need to fall asleep while watching it either. Being a Shounen anime movie, it focuses on fighting a lot, which is something most of us can enjoy even if the story is terrible. And since the fights were good, I was able to keep my eyes on the screen and watch the movie all the way through.I also love Zoro, he\'s a great character, so it was nice to see him get the spotlight for a movie.Overall: 6I certainly don\'t plan on watching it again. I\'ve seen fanfics that have better story and character than this movie did (which is really saying something)!If you like One Piece, feel free to watch this movie. But I\'m warning you now that it isn\'t the One Piece that we all love dearly. It\'s an insult to One Piece and Oda himself to make a movie that messes with the original story and the original characters.One Piece Norowareta Seiken (The Curse of the Sacred Sword) is definitely my least favorite One Piece movie.

So I will just jump into it section by section.Story:  Not bad.

I wish Luffy had a little bit more of a role, because it felt like he wasn\'t even needed in the entire movie, yet he was still the ""main character"".  No one else really seemed to matter in this movie except for Zoro.  I felt like they included all the other characters because otherwise it wouldn\'t be One Piece.  Really disappointing on how they used everyone.Enjoyment:  Made me laugh at times.  I watch One Piece to laugh, and get me really excited when someone is pissed off.  Surprisingly no one got that pissed off in this movie.  I thought I would have enjoyed it more because of this fact, but I didn\'t so now I appreciate it more when someone does get really angry.  Other than that it had its usual jokes that put a smile on my face.Overall:  I still enjoyed it, would never watch it again, and if I could have gone back in time to tell myself to just go ahead and skip it, I would have.

Why because it\'s basically your typical ""I\'m your comrade from the past now back out of nowhere and I\'m evil now"" story. And I\'m not hating on it because it was forced or I\'ve seen it done before because I have seen it done many many times before and I did like it in the past, I like The Bleach Diamond Dust when it did it there and that\'s plot is basically the same as this. I felt once again...the execution fell short and I think majority of the issue is pacing. They are given an hour and a half to do this and I think they realize that the substance/plot they have for this movie has to be stretched if they want to make this last as long as they have. With Luffy and Ussop running around for who knows how long in the cave, to having the remaining straw hat crew just sit in with the movie characters basically doing nothing for majority of the movie until Luffy and Ussop get back, to letting Luffy have two fights with the movie villain instead of feeling entertaining and like some sort of story progression is taking place it all felt like fluff kind of like what the anime does to stretch out certain scenes because they need to make this certain amount of content fit the amount of time they have in this episode. So if there\'s anything that killed it for me in this movie it\'s definitely pacing.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+This one does look a bit better than all of the previous films but not enough to give it too much of a compliment. The colors used did fell like it did bring out a more saturated feel and it made certain scenes look more lively but once the setting got dark or night time those colors aren\'t needed anymore and it looks just like the previous movie.Sound (7/10) GoodSound is good nothing in particular to talk aboutCharacters (8/10) Very GoodI was going to give this section a 7 because like some of the previous movies the Straw Hat Crew wasn\'t utilized and a lot of characters hit the back burner for majority of the movie and they usually let the movie MC or movie villain or villains have more spotlight. But not really in this one as the movie antagonist does indeed get more spotlight than majority of the crew yes but at least they didn\'t end this movie the way they ended the 3rd movie (the Chopper one) where basically you can tell other than Luffy himself you can tell that (just like chopper was in movie 3) Zoro has majority of the spotlight and he is a focused character in this movie. In the 3rd movie I wanted Chopper to have the final blow to the villain in that movie because I felt he deserved it but that didn\'t happen it he lost and Luffy saved the day. Even though Luffy saved the day technically in this one for plot convinces of finding the Orbs and bringing them back even though he had no clue he knew that were that significantly important at least they didn\'t let Zoro loose the final battle against the movie Villain and let Luffy obtain the final blow at least they let Zoro have that and for that I will give this movie a little more credit in the category than i did the 3rd movie.Enjoyment (5/10) MediocreJust looking at the poster for this film it got me a little hyped to start watching it because it looked (and was) Zoro focused and I\'m currently Team Zoro right now. And I was indeed enjoying myself for like the first 10 minutes but after watching Zoro go rogue and then pacing issues kicked it it went from an 8 to a 7 to a 6 to a 5.

As a Zoro fan right now I\'m disappointed I got my hopes up a bit too much for this one.

Luffy & crew are in search of treasure as usual, but Zoro ends up going off on his own after receiving a message from an old friend in the form of a knife. This old Friend of Zoro\'s is known as Saga. From there, there\'s lots of adventure and conflict between different groups, as well as a predicament that involves a ritual sacrifice....None of this is too interesting on their own, but they all come together and are presented fairly well to make for an entertaining enough plotline, one that is enjoyable to watch, but not super impressive.Art: 4The art, when compared to the One Piece films that came before this, really seems to drop the ball. The iconic One Piece character design is still here in full form, as expected, and there\'s plenty of good-looking, well-animated shots, but there\'s also plenty of instances of obvious-looking limited animation, making me think the budget was decreased a bit from the previous films. However, even aside from all that, the most baffling parts are the moments where the animation becomes so low-resolution that it looks like pixel art instead of a drawing. Honestly, some shots in this film look like they came directly out of a Sega CD game. It\'s just entirely unacceptable, and the moments of good animation can\'t excuse these moments of exceedingly poor animation, making the overall animation less than average.Sound: 7The soundtrack is what you\'d expect from One Piece, no surprises there, but it still sounds good. The audio design is loud and booming, as expected from a theatrical release. The voice acting from the Japanese cast is also just as well done as it normally is in the show, and the new characters they introduce also had solid performances from their voice actors. Overall, the audio in the movie is nicely done, but it\'s nothing to write home about.Character: 8The cast from the main show are in full form here and, for the most part, just as likable here as they are there. As for the new characters, they\'re a mixed bag. Maya is a pretty standard young priestess girl and isn\'t very interesting, and the main villain Saga is also a pretty standard bad guy, who used to be good but was turned evil by a cursed sword. However, Saga\'s underlings have pretty nice visual designs, and are a bit more complex than Saga himself, since even though they\'re the antagonists, they\'re not clearly on the side of good or evil. Also, the old lady from the village has some great moments.Enjoyment: 7Despite it\'s shortcomings, the movie was still pretty fun to watch. There were a lot of good moments, but also a few moments where I was bored and wondering how much more of the film I had left...I would recommend it to fans of the characters who want to see them on another (fairly standard) adventure who can forgive a little bit of roughness from the animation side of things.Overall: 6 None of this is too interesting on their own, but they all come together and are presented fairly well to make for an entertaining enough plotline, one that is enjoyable to watch, but not super impressive.Art: 4The art, when compared to the One Piece films that came before this, really seems to drop the ball.

With that being said, I thought it was a good movie! You had some memorable characters, Saga & Maya, & Esp the Old Lady she was great.You get met with a few inconsistencies (as per usual) for the canon. The ones that I noticed include them saying they came there to find the treasure. You can\'t just head to islands unless you get an eternal pose, so saying they came there for the treasure doesn\'t make any sense. They did this in the third...movie as well, they even had a map in that one lol.Also, at one point when they are first talking about it I believe Nami says that the Cursed Holy Sword, or Sacred Sword? is the greatest treasure of the Grand Line... I thought that was the One Piece? lolOne other would be when they are discussing Saga\'s backstory, how after the explosion he miraculously survived but his arm wasn\'t usable, so he ""wandered into the grand line to this island"" like, how? That must have been pretty hard right? Idk I guess at this point the Grand Line isn\'t as hard to get to as we thought at first.Some things I loved though where the fight between Sanji & Zoro, like damn that was intense!And the bit with Luffy & Usopp in the caves.Also when Sanji is fighting one of the goons and he goes. ""My steel armor can\'t be borrken by your foot"" and Sanji kicks him on top of the head and says ""Then maybe your head and your face need armor too"" That was great XDThe fact that this movie seemed to be centered around Zoro, with him even beating the antogonist, but still not having as much screen time as the others I thought was interesting.Also we did see more of his backstory though! If it\'s canon anyways?I enjoyed more than I think I should have if that makes sense. Definitely a fun movie all in all. movie as well, they even had a map in that one lol.Also, at one point when they are first talking about it I believe Nami says that the Cursed Holy Sword, or Sacred Sword? is the greatest treasure of the Grand Line...

I\'d even say good, overall. It just wasn\'t particularly moving or fun. It\'s a pretty standard standalone movie plot. I didn\'t spot any majorly gaping plot holes. (Though their description of Saga just ""drifting"" along the Grand Line until he reached this village after seeing just how hard it is to enter and navigate grated on my mind a bit...)Unfortunately, this entry is guilty of one of my all-time least favorite standalone movie tropes... The villain being an old never-before-mentioned childhood friend of one of the protagonists. Thus explaining away any motivations said protag might need...to justify helping them. It\'s just such a meh cop-out to me. I like to see more effort put into movie characters. Zoro\'s a simple guy. Stubborn, but I feel like they definitely could have found some way Saga could have appealed to him and gotten on his good side as a stranger. They probably would have had to cut out the dojo being a facet of the marines-- and thus being in opposition to everything he now is by default-- but that part never really flew with me anyway. As loyal as Zoro is, I\'m not totally sold that even keeping a promise to a childhood friend would have been enough for him to put up with this group loudly gloating about their intentions to separate him from his crew.And honestly, that final fight was a bit lackluster.

Yes, exactly, it takes place around the same time as the previous movie because the anime started to slow down considerably. The formula so far was to make one movie taking place after a new crew member joins (the first after Usopp, the second after Sanji, the third after Chopper, and the fourth after Robin) In this case, the anime took hundreds of episodes until the next member (Franky) was added, so they went for a tiny gimmick. They though “hey you guys, we...started the movies after Usopp but we had no movie dedicated to the earlier ones. So why not make one about Zoro?” And thus we get this movie. This was perceived very positively by most fans, who consider Zoro to be the coolest, most serious, and second stronger next to Luffy, yet had no movie.Beyond all that, just like all the OP movies, it is a filler mission with a good budget and a simplistic plot. And it definitely has a weak plot. The story is just about the Strawhat Pirates going to an island where a cursed sword is said to be able to awaken its demonic powers in a few nights. Zoro meets an old friend turned rival there, who plans to awaken the sword for vengeance and possible world domination plans. In order to do that, he needs to activate it by finding seven spheres that contain its powers. And no, they are not the Dragonballs.The whole thing plays out slowly and mostly anti-climactically. There is very little going on in it up until the last part where Zoro and Luffy start to kick ass. The problem is that there aren’t any interesting mini-bosses around to keep the rest of the crew occupied with doing something and outside of a few simple internal disputes, the entire crew besides the main two are completely worthless to the plot. I felt like the movie would fit better to be taking place chronologically even before the first one, where at least there weren’t so many in the crew to be in need to be doing something. And there would’n be a plot hole considering how his rival drifted from East Blue several years ago, all the way inside the Grand Line and to that island without being killed by the hundreds of perils that await in every corner.Of course most of the fans of Zoro didn’t care about that and were pleased to see him doing his cool three sword fighting techniques. The whole film was made just for him; hell, he is the one to deal with the big boss in the end instead of Luffy. But seriously, outside some fancy visual effects the action wasn’t than exciting since it was mostly magic than actual swordsmanship. Plus there was no interesting build-up to that moment to make you feel like it’s worth waiting one hour just for a piss-poor excuse of a showdown. The main rival, Saga, is completely uninteresting and there is nothing else besides Zoro acting all mysterious and serious to keep you looking forward to. Not recommended if you don’t want some generic excuse for Zoro to do some magic energy blasting.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 2/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 2/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 0/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Presence 2/2, Personality 0/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 1/1, Sound 0/2, Story 0/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 4/10 started the movies after Usopp but we had no movie dedicated to the earlier ones.

It had a decent premise going for it but missed a ton of marks.Review:Story/Plot - 3 - It\'s premise is decent, albeit cliche. It was relatively interesting and had plenty of potential, however, I feel like it was wasted. The first problem being the way it was presented, and how the whole thing started off. Zoro just flat out betrays his crew at the beginning... that\'s bullshit! Especially considering how deeply he cares for his friends! Talk about awful character writing! I found it dumb how Zoro didn\'t get the slightest clue that Saga had ill intentions until the...plot demanded him to do so. The way everything unfolded was really predictable and nothing interesting is done with the ideas the writers had in mind. My next issue is the pacing. It\'s just really inconsistent, and when the movie finally gets to the climax, it quickly jolts through it at lightning fast speeds! It doesn\'t build up to a satisfying climax and suspense becomes non-existent due to the poor execution. The other problem is how events just occurred for the convenience of the plot, and character actions and behavior were altered for the same reason but more on this later. The direction this movie takes is just awful! In the end it feels like it has no substance!Characters - 2.5 - I love the One Piece cast, however, whoever was writing the script for this film completely fucked up the characterization! Their behavior and personalities are altered to 1-dimensional versions of themselves and only barely resemble the bare outline of their character. It\'s as if the writers were given brief descriptions of the characters that summarized them into simple, run down versions of themselves. Luffy may be dumb and reckless at times, but he\'s not a complete moron who puts both him and his friends in danger while being unaware of it! ""Woah this is fun!"" he says as both he and Usopp are in a life-threatening situation. Next are the movie characters. None of them really had a hint of personality, even Saga, the antagonist. I just couldn\'t bring myself to care about any of them or feel any kind of emotion. The only good thing I have to say here, is that it at least let some characters share the spotlight.Visuals - 7.5 - One Piece movies always pull through in this aspect! If the story fails, at least there\'s cool animation! The final fight between Luffy and Saga was really well done and had very nice choreography coupled with flashy sakuga to compliment it! The art also has this nice, polished look to it. I do have some gripes with it though. My main one being the CGI used. There were attempts to create dynamic shots and fast, cool-looking camera panning, zooming and movements with it, but it ended up looking pretty jarring. This results in the characters looking like they aren\'t part of the environment and are just plastered on.Sound - 4 - The usual stuff. Except the voice actors feel like they\'re trying too hard to fit into their roles, which is strange considering how long they\'ve been doing it for. It\'s probably a consequence given birth from the script which gives the characters these awful lines that sound really forced and fail at giving life to the characters. Everyone sounds artificial and dead.Overall: I didn\'t like this film. Bad writing, poor characterization and usage of the characters, it\'s just not a well executed film. Take a mediocre idea, and do nothing unique with it.Final score: 3.83/10 Rounded to 4/10 for MAL score. plot demanded him to do so.

Pokemon Advanced Generation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1564/Pokemon_Advanced_Generation,"['*cough* I noticed no people wrote a review for this, so I\'ll make one myself *cough* And my first review...If you don\'t like to read this review, then go away >_>.Pokemon Advance is very enjoyable to watch, followed by Ash (Satoshi) and co. traveling on the whole Hoenn region. This anime also brought me to love Pokemon! How? Uhh...long story, but Pokemon Emerald was my first game and that game brought me on loving Pokemon.Characters: 8Anyway, let me start. I love the story of Pokemon, even I only watched *cough* five or more...I just watch random episodes of the anime, that\'s all. The characters? Hmm...Ash...(Satoshi) is getting boring, and Brock (Takeshi) has the same attitude...and May (Haruka)...I liked her attitude, and Max...I wished May didn\'t brought him all along. But I love how the team is big. Unlike the new season *ahem*...Story: 8Now, Ash (Satoshi) and co. did the same thing like on the first seasons, want their dreams to come true like Ash\'s, like May wanted to challenge all Pokemon Contest and to be the best Pokemon Coordinator, and so on. But, hey, this is like forever. I\'m an impatient girl, but not too impatient. And also, does Ash never age up or go through puberty!? I mean what the heck!? He should be a young adult right now!Art: 7Tsk tsk tsk...I didn\'t like the style of their eyes, it looks...simple. Not very creative. I like the style of the eyes in ""Pokemon Special"" manga. But...I guess it\'s okay, the story is nice anyway.Sound: 10Splendid!! I love the music and sound, both English and Japanese. Some are calming, some fit when you\'re going on a journey, some are rock n\' roll, and others. But, it\'s my opinion.Enjoyment: 9Yes, I mostly enjoyed some interesting episodes, but I skipped the boring ones. The boring ones are full of talk, so on so on so on...But, yeah, the interesting ones, I feel like watching them over and over again.Overall: 9It was the best season in my opinion. The 1st one with Misty and the 2nd one with May are the best ones. Until...with...Dawn, the most annoying girl I met. The season with Dawn has the most suckish story. I mean come on, the story is like all about ""friends"". It\'s getting annoying. I hope Dawn dies from a car accident.

The history of pokemon had done so well up until this point, as seen by many. However, hardcore/loyal pokemon fans stuck around and watched the entire ADV generation. We embraced the new characters, though many did not want to see old ones retire away. We took note of even more pokemon added to anime, though some felt the originals could never be replaced. The games were stellar, I\'ve played every single pokemon game out there and I can honestly say ruby/sapphire or emerald are must haves. So what is about ADV? I mean, it should...be better than Kanto\'s and Johto\'s saga, right?PMKN ADV features the return of our main heroine Satoshi (better known as Ash Ketchum) as he explores an entire new region, Hoenn. Here, he encounters totally new pokemon with different aspects and abilities nowhere seen in the previous regions he was in. During his journey, he meets new friends and some returning ones. Haruka(May) and Masato(Max) are some new faces this time around, both are brother and sister. May, a once serious trainer competing for gym badges, focuses on a new goal to be a serious PKMN contest challenger. Max provides the group with in depth strategies to PKMN battling despite given his age. He takes a real liking to Ash, since he too also wants to become a pkmn trainer. The final character to the group is Brock, a familiar face seen with Ash throughout the series. He is still is normal self, acting perverted anytime a nurse joy or any of the likes of a cute girl is near. Ash himself is still competing for badges, so that one day he can participate in the ""Hoenn League.""PKMN ADV is divided into several different titles. When the timeline gets serious enough and Ash gains more badges, the story is known as ADV Battle. From there, the story gradually gets deeper into harder challenges otherwise known as PKMN ADV Challenge. The style of ""Double Battling"" ie is introduced to where two pokemon battle another two in the same fight. Everything is still considered the ADV timeline, the story just gets deeper and possibly better.PKMN theme\'s around this time are very solid. Perhaps better than it\'s previous counterparts. I do enjoy the opening ADV Challenge theme A LOT. The art is slightly better than Johto, however much improved from Kanto sagas. Battles are better detailed, and animation is more fluid. So it seems like ADV is just perfect, right? Well no. The story lines between travel are STILL the same: Team Rocket attacks Ash and gang until he reaches a gym or certain point of relevance in the story. I do like presentation of different groups like Team Magma and Team Aqua, but still most of the time it\'s the annoying Rockets doing the dirty work. Another thing is accepting the fact of just understanding new pokemon and how they work. There\'s LOTS of names I wouldn\'t begin to remember then, there was like 350 known species in this timeline. Sometimes, I questioned ""oh what type is this?"" or ""what atk was that!?""Overall, I wouldn\'t be quick to say ADV is the ""rotten apple"" in the history of PKMN. There\'s good scenes and action waiting to be watched here if you haven\'t yet. I think it naturally depends on if you are willing to accept the many changes to PMKN when you brace this saga of pokemon. be better than Kanto\'s and Johto\'s saga, right?PMKN ADV features the return of our main heroine Satoshi (better known as Ash Ketchum) as he explores an entire new region, Hoenn.

However, its popularity began to decline during the Johto season, and the Pokémon phenomenon that rocked the world lost its luster. That didn't mean Pokémon was done with, as the Ruby and Sapphire versions rolled around for the fairly young Game Boy Advance on November 21 of 2002 in Japan, and then March 19, 2003 in North America (April...3rd in Australia and July 25th in Europe, can't forget you guys). The final Johto episode aired just weeks before the games' release in Japan, while in the U.S., it aired in late October of 2003, months after Ruby and Sapphire were released.Statistics say the Ruby and Sapphire versions sold 16.22 million copies world-wide total as of March 2013. However, when compared to Red/Blue (31.38), and Gold/Silver (23.10), there's a plummet of sales. Why is that? It could be because of the new handheld, or it could be because the fans are moving on. Or it could be because the Hoenn region was different compared to Johto complete with new gameplay, and (gasp!) people don't like it when a formula that already works gets switched up. Who's really to say when there's millions of people with their own reasons for why they never bought the games. The anime was still on-going at this time, why didn't that help boost sales? Maybe it did, just not to the same extent as the original series.Pokémon Advanced Generation is notable for being the first time the Pokémon anime tried something “new”, as in changing the location, changing companions (although Brock remained), changing battle strategies, and overall just better writing; and in America, there was a change in voice actors mid-series (more on that later). Saying there's “better writing” is a little weird to say since Pokémon's not the best story-driven anime in the world, not by a long shot. But when compared to the first three sagas, it's an improvement even without Takeshi Shudo's involvement (although it's sorely missed).THE HOENN LEAGUESTORY: Continuing on from where the original series left off, Ash Ketchum arrives in the Hoenn region with his partner, Pikachu, and shortly afterwards met the new trainer May from Petalburg City, who picked out a Torchic. Accompanying them are May's brother, Max, and Brock, who chose to return to traveling but still doesn't change in personality even with his new roster. Ash explores the new region and Pokémon in his quest to collect the badges to challenge the Hoenn League, and May discovers her love for Pokémon Coordination. Team Rocket is still adamant in catching Pikachu, but have convinced Giovanni they were setting the foundation for the rest of the organization to infiltrate the region. They develop a brief rivalry with two other teams, Team Aqua and Team Magma, who proved to be slightly more competent than the Rocket gang.That's pretty much it. There's not a lot of difference outside of what's on the surface. Likewise with the previous seasons, fillers still abound, but they're not taking up half of the journey like in Johto, and it's still used to give the illusion the Hoenn region is huge—although Ash and company don't cross the ocean as much as the player does in the games, and it's all in a later season anyway.There are improvements from the first season such as better gym battles, and the presence of Teams Aqua and Magma (mostly Magma), and the two teams do occasionally clash. The payoff, however, is disappointing to say the least. The Pokémon anime tends to do that. But even so, there's still some enjoyment to be had during the season, especially with a fresh Pokémon roster that aren't overshadowed by Ash's older Pokémon for once. The Pokémon Contests shakes up the formula a bit by giving May a character motivation of her own, as well as some different rules and performances, showing some impressive and uniques strategies in Pokémon moves both inside and outside of battle. Luckily, the journey to collect ribbons is given equal focus and importance as the journey to collect gym badges.ART/ANIMATION: A continuation from the late Johto episodes, the digital art and animation is the same, and remains rather consistent throughout, though wonky art still slips through on occasion—this WAS still the awkward early-to-mid 2000s transition. The biggest upgrade are many Pokémon moves being done in CG to make them look flashier. Sadly, outside of the Pokémon Contest events, nothing of note sticks out in this department. The two-parter episodes involving Kyogre and Groudon could've had impressive animation with their battles, but they were reduced to painted (or colored pencil) stills. They could technically pass off as beautiful paintings, though.I didn't know where to put this, but I figured I'd mention it here. One of Pokémon's well-known traits is its “Who's That Pokémon?” eye-catch halfway into each episode. While it's still on-going in Japan, in America, 4KIDS decided to go a different direction starting in episode 41 with Advanced Challenge. Up until their contract expired, “Who's That Pokémon?” was replaced with “Trainer's Choice”, kind of like a trivia question in which out of three choices, the viewer chooses basically the “best” choice for type advantages, or what Pokémon evolves into what. It's a pretty good idea—however, someone in charge of it apparently was not that knowledgable about his or her Pokémon facts, with some questions having either multiple possible answers or incorrect answers, and some Pokémon's names were misspelled. What most people remember is the most infamous moment of “Trainer's Choice”, episode 77's “Which of these Pokémon evolves into Seviper?”. Advanced Battle got better with it in asking actual trivia with match-ups, battle strategies, and callbacks to episodes, but the damage had been done.SOUND: The soundtrack is honestly the best part of this section and it's not just because it's full of trumpets—well, in actuality, the brass section (the trombone was the most prominent). Well, the reason is because most of the score, like with the previous seasons, are covers of the game score, and they sound fantastic. Unfortunately, the dub noticeably got iffy with the music by this point unlike with the previous seasons. The original soundtrack does still remain (which, if YouTube is anything to go by, consists of less new scores than with Johto), but more often than not, you're hearing the 4KIDS-implemented score from the movies or albums, and it's a little more easier at this point to not catch the original score if you weren't already familiar with it.Veronica Taylor, Rachael Lillis, Eric Stuart, Maddie Blaustein, and Dan Green still give good performances. However, by Advanced Battle, the vocal evolution of the cast becomes apparent, particularly with Team Rocket. Jessie had the least change to her voice, but James got noticeably whinier, and Meowth's Joisey accent had become almost slurred that he started sounding a little like Elmur Fudd.CHARACTERS: This is a bit hard to truly gauge because the Hoenn saga's a continuation. Ash, Brock, and Team Rocket are the same as they were from before (sort of with Team Rocket, I'll explain shortly), although Ash has some character development in becoming a mentor to his new friend, May—I say some since this is mainly up until after Advanced Challenge when she becomes able to stand on her own two feet, then he seemingly regresses back to the same-old Ash, just mature. There's also no shortage of COTDs, though whether they stick with you or not depends on your tastes.Judging the new main characters, they aren't bad. May is a rookie with some lack of self-confidence, and her brother is a know-it-all who gets annoying at times. What makes the two endearing, however, is their sibling relationship. They have their squabbles, but they truly care about each other. What also makes them a little bit different is they're the children of the Petalburg City gym leader Norman, and we do get to see them as a family on occasion. Sure, when it comes to Brock and Misty, we've seen them interact with their families, but not to the same extent. Still, the character development all went to May as she slowly became more confident and independent, who gained rivals in Drew, Jessie (in various disguises), and later Harley in Advanced Battle. Max was hinted at to have some gift with Pokémon bonding, but due to his young age, there wasn't much he could do about it, even though he once made a promise to a Ralts to be its trainer one day. He also later took up Misty's mantle of dragging Brock away by the ear whenever he got girl-crazy, but that's got nothing to do with his character in the slightest.Team Rocket... ehhhhh, this is basically a continuation of their Johto personalities, except it got taken a step further depending on the writer. The Giovanni fantasies were a thing at that time, but they became ubiquitous by this saga that it began to get rather uncomfortably annoying rather quickly. Sure, it's a possibility we as children loved those segments, but the older we got, the more creepy and “ho yay” (although not necessarily in the same boat) it became. Maddie Blaustein enjoyed doing those parts, good for her, but when looking at it from a character perspective, it's like looking into the mind of a mad man, or in this case, a mad cat who may-or-may-not have a thing for his boss. This is similar to how Brock chases after every skirt he sees, except this is how Meowth sees his boss and believes this is how he's going to react for every rare Pokémon they bring to him. The ways the Pokémon are being used in these fantasies are rather reminiscent of servitude, and Giovanni doesn't look like the man who treats his Pokémon very well outside of his Persian (who is absent from all of these fantasies, funnily enough), but I personally doubt he'd use rare Pokémon for such mundane tasks as breaking open coconuts for him or be his personal alarm clock or workout partners.THE BATTLE FRONTIERSTORY: Upon coming home from Hoenn, Ash stops by for a quick invited battle with Agatha, the temporary Viridian City gym leader and one of the Elite Four, accompanied by a man named Scott, who took interest in Ash because of his skills in the Hoenn League. Although Ash lost, Scott encouraged him to take the Battle Frontier challenge, and thus he travels the Kanto region once more, briefly visiting familiar places along the way, but there were more new places than there were old.ART/ANIMATION: Outside of CG becoming steadily more abundant, there are no changes, although the battles get more clever. But there is a funny scene in the Deoxys two-parter of Meowth having one of his fantasies of Giovanni riding on the back of a Deoxys. You might've seen it around.CHARACTERS: Everything still carries over, there are no changes to the main cast, not even to old faces who make appearances (since this is in the Kanto region). The Frontier Brains, however, fall under here. The problem(?) is, they don't all get the same amount of character development—well, screentime. The most notable Brains are Lucy of Battle Pike, Anabel of Battle Tower, and Brandon of Battle Pyramid, the former two because they had showed interest in either Ash or Brock (weirdly enough), though with Ash for the most part, it was mainly due to his skills.SOUND: The voice cast is where this gets messy for the dub. From the beginning of the saga until “Pasta La Vista!”, it's still the classic 4KIDS cast. But thanks to the previous airing of “Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon”, the audience knew the voice cast was going to change at some point or another and were fearing the worst. This didn't come to fruition until the contract expired and there was a change of networks from Kids' WB to Cartoon Network (this was a problem personally, but by then I was turned away by the replacement of the voice actors, though I was disappointed to see it leave the network). Pokémon USA, wanting to find a cheaper company to produce the dub, went to TAJ Productions (when it still existed) where they cast newcomer (and actual Pokémon fan) Sarah Natochenny as Ash Ketchum, plus others—although a few such as James Carter Cathcart (Jimmy Zoppi) still remained, but were cast in new roles, or in the case of the narrator, Rodger Parsons returned.Weirdly enough, the change wasn't AS jarring as people claim it to be. It's a gradual change in style in terms of the localization and script, but the quality wasn't any different. The theme and end credits songs are the only things I can say weren't as good as 4KIDS' themes, although they're both short and easy to brush off. On the plus side, the soundtrack from the original remained, so it's not a constant cacophony against your eardrums like it was before.But needless to say, the Battle Frontier can be the roughest sit of the dub if you let it get to you. Although yes, some episodes and characters were better dubbed than others.ENJOYMENT AS A WHOLE: Eleven years—that is how long it took to finish Advanced Generation. Hoenn was oddly enough not as memorable as the original series was despite being the “more recent” of my childhood. Upon my rewatch, I have no idea why that was the case, though it could be there was something different about it from the start. But there wasn't anything completely terrible about it, so I must've just had slowly lost interest. And even as an adult viewer, it was still a bit of a chore at times to watch even before the Battle Frontier saga, which had a noticeable change to the feel of the show. The season may not have had the 4KIDS touch, but it didn't really need to.Still, there were good moments, good ideas, and memorable characters that helped make the Hoenn saga stand out from its predecessor. The transition from Johto to Hoenn was a bit of a whiplash, and again with Battle Frontier, but over time, it calmed and felt more natural. There were more places to see in Hoenn than in the past regions, because this time, it was an entire region getting coverage. It left almost no stone unturned, though in the process, it still skimmed over a bit in order to progress.While not a personal favorite, Advanced Generation still left a good impression behind, generously rewarding those who stuck with it to the end. I'd dare say it was a better reward than the end of the Johto saga. But like they say, the journey continues, and so it does. 3rd in Australia and July 25th in Europe, can't forget you guys). The final Johto episode aired just weeks before the games' release in Japan, while in the U.S., it aired in late October of 2003, months after Ruby and Sapphire were released.Statistics say the Ruby and Sapphire versions sold 16.22 million copies world-wide total as of March 2013. However, when compared to Red/Blue (31.38), and Gold/Silver (23.10), there's a plummet of sales. Why is that? It could be because of the new handheld, or it could be because the fans are moving on. Or it could be because the Hoenn region was different compared to Johto complete with new gameplay, and (gasp!) people don't like it when a formula that already works gets switched up. Who's really to say when there's millions of people with their own reasons for why they never bought the games. The anime was still on-going at this time, why didn't that help boost sales? Maybe it did, just not to the same extent as the original series.Pokémon Advanced Generation is notable for being the first time the Pokémon anime tried something “new”, as in changing the location, changing companions (although Brock remained), changing battle strategies, and overall just better writing; and in America, there was a change in voice actors mid-series (more on that later). Saying there's “better writing” is a little weird to say since Pokémon's not the best story-driven anime in the world, not by a long shot. But when compared to the first three sagas, it's an improvement even without Takeshi Shudo's involvement (although it's sorely missed).THE HOENN LEAGUESTORY: Continuing on from where the original series left off, Ash Ketchum arrives in the Hoenn region with his partner, Pikachu, and shortly afterwards met the new trainer May from Petalburg City, who picked out a Torchic. Accompanying them are May's brother, Max, and Brock, who chose to return to traveling but still doesn't change in personality even with his new roster. Ash explores the new region and Pokémon in his quest to collect the badges to challenge the Hoenn League, and May discovers her love for Pokémon Coordination. Team Rocket is still adamant in catching Pikachu, but have convinced Giovanni they were setting the foundation for the rest of the organization to infiltrate the region. They develop a brief rivalry with two other teams, Team Aqua and Team Magma, who proved to be slightly more competent than the Rocket gang.That's pretty much it. There's not a lot of difference outside of what's on the surface. Likewise with the previous seasons, fillers still abound, but they're not taking up half of the journey like in Johto, and it's still used to give the illusion the Hoenn region is huge—although Ash and company don't cross the ocean as much as the player does in the games, and it's all in a later season anyway.There are improvements from the first season such as better gym battles, and the presence of Teams Aqua and Magma (mostly Magma), and the two teams do occasionally clash.

I'd dare say it was a better reward than the end of the Johto saga. But like they say, the journey continues, and so it does."", 'One of the reasons for the Advanced series to be likable but still not a favorite for the fans, most of it is since the Advanced series comes right after the lousy Johto season, though effected by it creating some boring and excepted ""filler"" episodes the Advance series tries to fix them, in the most parts of it succeded but once the filling episodes that are not connected to the main story appears, the quality of those episodes are going down like the most of Johto episodes.The simple reason for the improvement is Misty - the female character in Ash\'s gang - is replaced by...May, a young beginner trainer who begins her Pokemon travel at the start of the anime, not much later Brock is returned and May\'s little brother joins the gang. the big change in May\'s appearance is not that she is much better than Misty, not any fans will say that and even me, but still her role in the Advance series is much larger than Misty - if Misty was only served as the company of Ash without effecting much the adventure of Ash and the series, May\'s role is much larger since her reason to travel is to be a coordinator and show her Pokemon in contests than gym battles, her choice to do that is filling the series in more important episodes except the usual Capturing and gym battles episodes with contests and grand festival episodes, besides that even the ""filling"" episodes feeling much more connecting to the main story to be an unnecessary episodes (""filler episodes""), and not just this but Ash also have much more mind in his Pokemon battle and raising it\'s Pokemon.But all that not change the fact that the Advance series is such a good series - three full seasons is only on the Hoen league and the Hoen grand festival while the final season of the Battle Frontier somehow has much more important episodes but however have more problems than the first three seasons, to make the comparisons I will divide this review to two:Hoen league ArcOne of the good things about the big arc of the Advanced series is like I said above, it contains a lot of important episodes, from the first gym battles to contests battles and the capturing Pokemon episodes, unlike Misty who caught a Pokemon only in a while, as May is a beginner she has a lot of room in the anime to make her Pokemon team, not only that but Ash also not disappoint and except for some Pokemon he evolved all of his team.Not that alone, the gym leaders have a lot of room in the Arc to be explained and a lot of development even before the gym battles, which makes them a lot more interesting to watch.But all that aside, the Arc still suffering from ""Johto episodes"" that comes to time to time, but what makes the Arc better is that those episodes are much rare than it was in the Johto seasons as I said above, the contests and the grand festival episodes making this Arc much better.Though that to be said, the contests episodes and battles feeling much less tense and thrilling than the Gym battles and the League episodes, though their necessity and preferring them above the filler episode, they don\'t feel like canon episodes of the Advanced series and have a feels of ""come to fix Johto seasons problem"".Battle Frontier ArcIn Battle Frontier Arc Ash and his friends are going back to the Kanto region, or much more accurate, they meet again after a short splitting in the Kanto region, from Pallet Town again for two goals: for Ash to conquer the Battle Frontier and May to win the Kanto grand festival by gathering five ribbons all over again.Before the review I will introduce a little thing about the Battle Frontier, in the games, the Battle Frontier serves as the post-game materials, in the games, all the Batlle Frontier\'s facilities are placed in one big island west to the Hoen region, the point of the Battle Frontier facilities is to challenge the player in Maze quests or different ways of Pokemon battling in challenging way to test the Player knowledge, one example for that is the Battle Factory, which the player not using his Pokemon at all but choose between three different Pokemon, testing the knowledge of the player in abilities and types of Pokemon against NPC random player who using also three-to-choose Pokemon, after a couple of winnings in the facility, the player is battling the Frontier Brain who like the player using random-pokemon-to-choose, once winning him the Player gets the Knowledge Symbol that presents the Facility challenge.Now let\'s get back to the anime, in the anime as I said, Ash and his friends already split only to be rejoined in the next episode to continue traveling again, it makes the same feeling as the Battle Frontier in the games is - only a post-game after the League and nothing more: the story isn\'t that interesting and the battles at the Battle Frontier are much less intense, the rules for each facility are much less rigid than the Gym battles and the ""excitement in the air"" to beat the Battle Frontier isn\'t there as to win the league.But that\'s not my point, my main point is that the Anime ver. to the Battle, Frontier is the worst adaption ever seen not only in the Pokemon anime but in the anime ever. if in the games the battle frontier facilities have much more point on testing the trainers abilities the battle frontier in the anime is as Scott the founder of the battle frontier states - ""like"" gym leaders, while he says ""like"" the facilities is more ""unofficial gym"" than a battle frontier facility that designs to test the trainer, the only fact that they are ""much stronger than gym battle"" is of course since Ash just win the Hoen league gyms and if they weren\'t strong that strong what will make Ash go to them?Though it may be a real bad adaption, it makes sense once you say the reason - the studio didn\'t really mean to create the Battle Frontier season but just to not make more ""fille episodes"" and to stretch more episodes on the Hoen league, so they only created this Arc to wait \'till the diamond and pearl games to release, in their actions of that they actually said - ""if we will make much more accurate adaption of the Battle Frontier for the games, we will make more seasons only for that since it\'s requiring more than one season to do that, and we don\'t want to since we don\'t really need it, and it\'s not that interesting"", though I didn\'t read officially statement it\'s clear from the rush ""feeling"" of the arc.And that rush ""feeling"", though make this arc much more eventful actually make it worse - though every 2-3 episodes there\'s a contest or battle frontier battles this ""rush"" make the things made the Hoen arc good to bad - the Frontier Brains are much less introduced and even those who are much developed not so interesting; not only that, though it\'s Battle Frontier arc, the winning of the battle frontier feels much less necessary and meaningful than win the league, even to win the grand festival feels much more important and meaningful to ""beat the battle frontier"", which makes this season though more eventfull to less interesting.Story - 9Now to the characters.Ash feels much more confidence in the advance series, no more ""friendly gym leader"" or ""not to think"" strategy and touch of luck, Ash really trains his Pokemon not only in theory but dedicate his time to raise them well, this makes Ash much more than ""guy who loves pokemon"" to a strong trainer, although his personality didn\'t change much, it\'s much more interesting to watch him in this series.May, though to be Misty\'s replacement, is more girlish than Misty either in her attitude or her look, but with that being said she still has some ""tomboy"" in her, though not to be likable like Misty, she\'s still much more effecting the story.Max who joins the group, has some mystery effect fading off in the series, in the start his smartness makes him useful and has much more effect on the story, but with time his importance is fading away quickly and feels like ""extra character"" than even supporting character.Brock, though returned for the series is a good point, feels in some way more of ""supporting character"" than main, if in the previous series his ideology and his guidance feels necessary for the story and Ash, feels now only the ""cook guy"" who helps from time to time, his appearance in the series let me feels like he can be with some other groups of trainers and do the same things, his ""sick of love"" feels more important than his supporting the story.Though Ash doesn\'t have the main rival in this series except for his league temporary rivals May has two main rivels except for temporary ones, one is Drew, which in the start can be rude and evil, as the story continues he feels much more like stubborn-friendly rival than evil, in his replace for evil-rival she gets Harly that not just evil but rude and cunning.Team Rocket didn\'t change at all from the Johto seasons, and though being funny from time to time, their stubbornness is still annoying, though for some episodes James can be interesting enough to still the show, Jessy stubborn to take part in the contests don\'t help Team Rocket much.Team Aqua and Team Magma, on the other hand, not only interesting but feels much more canon than Team Rocket, though the adaption of them can be much better.Character - 8The Art, though being ""feels"" better does good only on the character designs, but the backgrounds still feel like child paint, in the Battle Frontier season though it\'s getting better but only slight improvement.Art - 7The sound didn\'t change much than the previous seasons, but still enjoyable.Only one note on the dub, although I have already gotten used to the Pokemon company dub, in its start on the Battle Frontier season it\'s pretty horrible and even Sarah dubbing Ash doesn\'t sound like the Ash I know from the newest season, only in the last few episodes of the series there\'s some improvement, but May\'s and Max\'s voice annoyed me a lot in this dub.But if we talking about the voices, one of the annoying things in the dub is the narrator getting replacement halfway through the first season, but returned in the new dub for the Frontier season, and that was actually one of the good things I admired about the new dub, the new narrator 4Kids got was not only as good as the old (or rather, the known one) but his narrating feels as he didn\'t wanted to get the job but forced there, at some episodes it even feels as  he\'s bored from Pokemon and his narrating is not as exciting and interesting, that is actually one of the good things I enjoyed hearing when watching the Frontier season, and the usual narrator doesn\'t fail.Sound - 7Enjoyment\\Overall 8\\8 - though the Advanced series still has problems, it\'s much more enjoyable than the Johto series with good character development and better animation. May, a young beginner trainer who begins her Pokemon travel at the start of the anime, not much later Brock is returned and May\'s little brother joins the gang. the big change in May\'s appearance is not that she is much better than Misty, not any fans will say that and even me, but still her role in the Advance series is much larger than Misty - if Misty was only served as the company of Ash without effecting much the adventure of Ash and the series, May\'s role is much larger since her reason to travel is to be a coordinator and show her Pokemon in contests than gym battles, her choice to do that is filling the series in more important episodes except the usual Capturing and gym battles episodes with contests and grand festival episodes, besides that even the ""filling"" episodes feeling much more connecting to the main story to be an unnecessary episodes (""filler episodes""), and not just this but Ash also have much more mind in his Pokemon battle and raising it\'s Pokemon.But all that not change the fact that the Advance series is such a good series - three full seasons is only on the Hoen league and the Hoen grand festival while the final season of the Battle Frontier somehow has much more important episodes but however have more problems than the first three seasons, to make the comparisons I will divide this review to two:Hoen league ArcOne of the good things about the big arc of the Advanced series is like I said above, it contains a lot of important episodes, from the first gym battles to contests battles and the capturing Pokemon episodes, unlike Misty who caught a Pokemon only in a while, as May is a beginner she has a lot of room in the anime to make her Pokemon team, not only that but Ash also not disappoint and except for some Pokemon he evolved all of his team.Not that alone, the gym leaders have a lot of room in the Arc to be explained and a lot of development even before the gym battles, which makes them a lot more interesting to watch.But all that aside, the Arc still suffering from ""Johto episodes"" that comes to time to time, but what makes the Arc better is that those episodes are much rare than it was in the Johto seasons as I said above, the contests and the grand festival episodes making this Arc much better.Though that to be said, the contests episodes and battles feeling much less tense and thrilling than the Gym battles and the League episodes, though their necessity and preferring them above the filler episode, they don\'t feel like canon episodes of the Advanced series and have a feels of ""come to fix Johto seasons problem"".Battle Frontier ArcIn Battle Frontier Arc Ash and his friends are going back to the Kanto region, or much more accurate, they meet again after a short splitting in the Kanto region, from Pallet Town again for two goals: for Ash to conquer the Battle Frontier and May to win the Kanto grand festival by gathering five ribbons all over again.Before the review I will introduce a little thing about the Battle Frontier, in the games, the Battle Frontier serves as the post-game materials, in the games, all the Batlle Frontier\'s facilities are placed in one big island west to the Hoen region, the point of the Battle Frontier facilities is to challenge the player in Maze quests or different ways of Pokemon battling in challenging way to test the Player knowledge, one example for that is the Battle Factory, which the player not using his Pokemon at all but choose between three different Pokemon, testing the knowledge of the player in abilities and types of Pokemon against NPC random player who using also three-to-choose Pokemon, after a couple of winnings in the facility, the player is battling the Frontier Brain who like the player using random-pokemon-to-choose, once winning him the Player gets the Knowledge Symbol that presents the Facility challenge.Now let\'s get back to the anime, in the anime as I said, Ash and his friends already split only to be rejoined in the next episode to continue traveling again, it makes the same feeling as the Battle Frontier in the games is - only a post-game after the League and nothing more: the story isn\'t that interesting and the battles at the Battle Frontier are much less intense, the rules for each facility are much less rigid than the Gym battles and the ""excitement in the air"" to beat the Battle Frontier isn\'t there as to win the league.But that\'s not my point, my main point is that the Anime ver. to the Battle, Frontier is the worst adaption ever seen not only in the Pokemon anime but in the anime ever. if in the games the battle frontier facilities have much more point on testing the trainers abilities the battle frontier in the anime is as Scott the founder of the battle frontier states - ""like"" gym leaders, while he says ""like"" the facilities is more ""unofficial gym"" than a battle frontier facility that designs to test the trainer, the only fact that they are ""much stronger than gym battle"" is of course since Ash just win the Hoen league gyms and if they weren\'t strong that strong what will make Ash go to them?Though it may be a real bad adaption, it makes sense once you say the reason - the studio didn\'t really mean to create the Battle Frontier season but just to not make more ""fille episodes"" and to stretch more episodes on the Hoen league, so they only created this Arc to wait \'till the diamond and pearl games to release, in their actions of that they actually said - ""if we will make much more accurate adaption of the Battle Frontier for the games, we will make more seasons only for that since it\'s requiring more than one season to do that, and we don\'t want to since we don\'t really need it, and it\'s not that interesting"", though I didn\'t read officially statement it\'s clear from the rush ""feeling"" of the arc.And that rush ""feeling"", though make this arc much more eventful actually make it worse - though every 2-3 episodes there\'s a contest or battle frontier battles this ""rush"" make the things made the Hoen arc good to bad - the Frontier Brains are much less introduced and even those who are much developed not so interesting; not only that, though it\'s Battle Frontier arc, the winning of the battle frontier feels much less necessary and meaningful than win the league, even to win the grand festival feels much more important and meaningful to ""beat the battle frontier"", which makes this season though more eventfull to less interesting.Story - 9Now to the characters.Ash feels much more confidence in the advance series, no more ""friendly gym leader"" or ""not to think"" strategy and touch of luck, Ash really trains his Pokemon not only in theory but dedicate his time to raise them well, this makes Ash much more than ""guy who loves pokemon"" to a strong trainer, although his personality didn\'t change much, it\'s much more interesting to watch him in this series.May, though to be Misty\'s replacement, is more girlish than Misty either in her attitude or her look, but with that being said she still has some ""tomboy"" in her, though not to be likable like Misty, she\'s still much more effecting the story.Max who joins the group, has some mystery effect fading off in the series, in the start his smartness makes him useful and has much more effect on the story, but with time his importance is fading away quickly and feels like ""extra character"" than even supporting character.Brock, though returned for the series is a good point, feels in some way more of ""supporting character"" than main, if in the previous series his ideology and his guidance feels necessary for the story and Ash, feels now only the ""cook guy"" who helps from time to time, his appearance in the series let me feels like he can be with some other groups of trainers and do the same things, his ""sick of love"" feels more important than his supporting the story.Though Ash doesn\'t have the main rival in this series except for his league temporary rivals May has two main rivels except for temporary ones, one is Drew, which in the start can be rude and evil, as the story continues he feels much more like stubborn-friendly rival than evil, in his replace for evil-rival she gets Harly that not just evil but rude and cunning.Team Rocket didn\'t change at all from the Johto seasons, and though being funny from time to time, their stubbornness is still annoying, though for some episodes James can be interesting enough to still the show, Jessy stubborn to take part in the contests don\'t help Team Rocket much.Team Aqua and Team Magma, on the other hand, not only interesting but feels much more canon than Team Rocket, though the adaption of them can be much better.Character - 8The Art, though being ""feels"" better does good only on the character designs, but the backgrounds still feel like child paint, in the Battle Frontier season though it\'s getting better but only slight improvement.Art - 7The sound didn\'t change much than the previous seasons, but still enjoyable.Only one note on the dub, although I have already gotten used to the Pokemon company dub, in its start on the Battle Frontier season it\'s pretty horrible and even Sarah dubbing Ash doesn\'t sound like the Ash I know from the newest season, only in the last few episodes of the series there\'s some improvement, but May\'s and Max\'s voice annoyed me a lot in this dub.But if we talking about the voices, one of the annoying things in the dub is the narrator getting replacement halfway through the first season, but returned in the new dub for the Frontier season, and that was actually one of the good things I admired about the new dub, the new narrator 4Kids got was not only as good as the old (or rather, the known one) but his narrating feels as he didn\'t wanted to get the job but forced there, at some episodes it even feels as  he\'s bored from Pokemon and his narrating is not as exciting and interesting, that is actually one of the good things I enjoyed hearing when watching the Frontier season, and the usual narrator doesn\'t fail.Sound -

Me and my brother grew both with Pokemon. And to be honest its still a great serie to watch.The story in short, you follow Ash with he's journey to become a Pokemon Master. And together with he's friends he will try to conquer the League and the Battle Frontier. There were funny, drama and sometimes sad moments. But overall its still great to watch. (anno 2019).The artwork in this serie is just decent. Its a old serie and you will see that sometimes. Its easy to watch for kids. Thats all I...want to say.Sound and then I will talk about the Opening and ending first. Its really motivated music. And to be honest, as a child the opening was my favorite. The sound in the serie is not to great but good enough.Not the fun part the characters. First Ash: Great trainer and to exicted for new adventures. He's partner Pikachu really looks like him. Ash has in this serie new clothing more adult. Its a really nice person.Brock: Mr. Playboy? Man he's really funny. Always in love with pretty girls. And besides of that he is a care person. What I mean is that he always take care of he's friends, injured Pokemon and helping he's family.May: One of Ash he's new friends. She is new with Pokemon and kinda clumsy in the beginning. But later she will learn alot of the Pokemon World and besides she want to go to the League. She will join the Cordinator tour. (the serie will explain it.) And for a girl sidekick of Ash. She is not to bad ;)Max: Mr wiseguy and the little brother of May. He is the most anoying child if ever met in in Pokemon series. (For now.) I dont like him and he is always thinking he's the smart guy. Well with May and Ash...Its not to hard to be the smartest.My enjoyment was good. Its was a long time if watched this serie back on the TV. But it was fun to rewatch it. In this serie you will see always a Pokemon you will like in the serie. For me it was Torkoal. Man he is awesome.If you like to watch Pokemon you will need to watch this serie.

Man he is awesome.If you like to watch Pokemon you will need to watch this serie. Great adventures and decent Pokemons after Gen 1 and 2.This was my review"", 'While Advanced Gen starts out looking like a carbon copy of Ash\'s journey\'s in Kanto and Johto, make no mistake - this is the pinnacle of the Pokemon franchise.Half of the main cast remains, as Ash tackles the Hoenn league with a new team (and Pikachu), and his old pal Brock returns to cook the munchies and explain the bs of Ash\'s pokemon battles to us watching. But they are joined by two compadres who bring opposite value to series: May and Max. There isn\'t much good to say about Max. He\'s too young to have any pokemon, so he just causes problems for the...crew and whines a bunch about how his older sister isn\'t a pokemon master immediately. That sister, May, however, is the brightest spot in the entire Pokemon franchise. While she has her struggles at first, her talent as a trainer and coordinator is undeniable. May brings renewed life to the series with her energy and hunger for coordinating. Despite being the trainer with the least experience in the series, she quickly becomes a focal point in helping the team overcome Team Rocket and any other obstacles that the crew faces in each episode. While she (unfortunately) takes a secondary role in some episodes (most notably the gym battles), May is frequently the star of the entire series. Her charm and wit provide the series with moment-to-moment energy to help flesh out each episode, while her food craving and frequent nervousness provide comedic relief as necessary during more intense moments. May grows to love her travel mates and creates multiple rivals in her coordinator contests, giving the show a much needed ""oomph"" and pizzaz that the series was previously lacking. It is impossible to understate May\'s importance to the Advanced Generation. Whether it is bravely battling Team Aqua to rescue her friends, or attempting to conquer a mighty pokemon contest, every single highlight in the series exists because of her incredible actions. She is also at the center of the most heartwarming moments of the series, as she shows her compassion for her brother Max (despite him not deserving it!).The story is the one area of Pokemon Advanced Gen where the series stands on shaky ground. May joins Ash\'s adventure with the intention of winning pokemon contests to compete in the Hoenn Grand Festival. Episodes that focus on May and these contests are easily the best chunk of the series. Seeing her training with her Pokemon is a joy given how much she loves all of her Pokemon, and watching the training pay off in the contests is beyond tense as you find yourself rooting for May\'s victory. Unfortunately, the writers frequently push May aside to focus on Ash\'s attempt to conquer the Hoenn League. Ash lacks the interesting and fun that May possesses, and he\'s already had multiple shots at taking league titles, so why the writers decided to focus so heavily on Ash again is a conundrum I may never understand. That doesn\'t stop May from shining through, however. Her spirit is too strong and she is too wonderful a character for the writers to ignore completely. While she might not get her due every episode, May is still in the limelight frequently.The art style is largely the same as the series before it. It ain\'t the prettiest thing on a whole, but they nail the shots when it counts. Newcomer Max\'s outfit puts the (pig) sty in style. Both Ash and Brock get a new snazzy get up, but May again takes the cake when it comes to character design. Easily the best in the Pokemon series and certainly a contender for the best in all of anime, May\'s standard outfit is beyond genius. The top is sporty red short-sleeved shirt with a navy accent, and a popped collar gives it the true flare that only she could make work. A white skirt and biker shorts make up the bottom half, with color-coordinated shoes, pouch, and gloves to give this ten year old the look of a pro. Her hair and bandana push her look into the ""legendary"" status, as no one else in anime - NO ONE - can look half as good wearing a bandana while combing their hair to resemble motorcycle handlebars. It may sound absurd, but it works so incredibly well that you\'ll be wishing for fewer pokemon battles and more shots of May doing anything.The sound design also largely stays standard in Pokemon with two notable exceptions. Max\'s voice actor tries his heart out, but Max is such a one-note blob that he can\'t save Max despite his efforts. May (voiced by Kathleen McInerney) is on the opposite side of the spectrum, and makes sure May comes across as cool as she looks. Kathleen takes the road less traveled when voicing May, giving it her all for every single sound and helping May look like a star. Whether it is a scream of terror or a simple hum, Kathleen clearly worked hard to give May the performance she has earned.Despite the story focusing too much on the Pokemon League over the Grand Festival, Pokemon Advanced is still far and away the best portion of the Pokemon series and among the best anime ever. Pokemon struck gold with May as she shines even when the story attempts to push her aside. May single-handily pulls the franchise to amazing new heights not just with her solid battling skills and incredible coordinating abilities, but with her bubbly personality, intense passion, and her beautiful smile. May is so unbelievably well written that Pokemon Advanced Generation is an absolute must watch for all anime fans. It will be a long, long time before anime sees someone half as MAYgnificant as her, so be sure to give this portion of the Pokemon franchise a watch. crew and whines a bunch about how his older sister isn\'t a pokemon master immediately.

Another enjoyable pokemon series. Its full of humor, lovable characters, and a AMAZING soundtrack. Advanced really doesnt fail with the enjoyable formula pokemon is so well known for.Storyline9/10-NO SPOILERS. Ten year old Ash Ketchum is now on his quest to go to the Hoenen region. He is joined by May, Max, and Broack. Ash once again is going to collect gym badges and become a pokemon master. Pokemon once again has that really fun and enjoyable storyline. Its cute, adventrous and full of laughs. Its like the first series, just newer.Characters8/10-The charaters are once again, enjoyable, Ash is once again, my favortive,...because hes stupid and funny. Team Rocket still are enjoyable characters, mostly Mewoth. The characters mature qutie a bit in the series. I find Lance(from the first series when ash was in Jothto),To be a good character.(He only appears for a few episodes. May is a character that matures very well, but I think she wasnt as good as Misty. Max is very annoying.(Hes like a replacement for Misty). Broack is still annoying, but the characters are still enjoyable.Soundtrack8/10-One thing the pokemon anime DOESNT fail at is the music. There is nothing wrong it. Its catchy, and fits the mood really well. The battle music is the most enjoyable. There are no flaws, and no problems with it, but its not amazing, so it doesnt get a 10. Just a 8.Art8/10-The new design is good. The character design is very good in my opinon. The art for the pokemon are also well made. Like the soundtrack, theres nothing wrong with the art. But its not perfect, so it gets a 8.Enjoyment10/10-I really enjoyed pokemon advanced. I always enjoy pokemon. The characters,and art, and soundtrack,and storyline,its all enjoyable.

Team Rocket is given more personality, the new characters are all good, and the show dives into some of the lore mentioned in the games. The battles have better choreography than previous seasons.As always the ending is meaningless both Ash and May loses their championship. At least Ash gets to win The Battle Frontier but May even loses her second chance to victory.Battle Frontier is the worst season among the Advanced Generations. It felt forced because the story was already over. Then they make it happen in Kanto instead of Hoenn. In games, the Battle Frontier is filled...with battles. But here they are travelling the entire Kanto region again for some reason (maybe because of the release of remakes of GEN 1 games). Team Rocket becomes annoying again. And there are many unnecessary fillers.One of the thing that made GEN 3 games better is the different personality given to each route and town/city. In the anime, each route and town/city is generic and lacks personality. Fortree City and Sootopolis City are given some personality by showing their unique architecture but they never go deep into it. with battles.

A lot of them were all flash but with none of the intensity that usually makes the gym battle episodes so good.

Though you may have noticed that the overall score doesn't reflect that... And it wasn't for the same reasons I'd expected...As I mentioned in my review for the original series, Hoenn was my generation. I didn't get really into playing the games myself until Sapphire/Ruby. I expected to connect better with Advanced because the towns and gym leaders and some of the special events with teams Aqua and Magma were more familiar to me. But that wasn't really the case. It was kind...of nice to know what was coming next, but for the most part, the gym battles were just... gym battles. It was the way the second season was handled that won me over. The format changed a bit for this second season, and I feel it changed for the better. I think adding in the contest side of the Pokémon world broke up the time between Ash's gym battles very nicely. Ash and May switched off pretty evenly. And I felt it just gave the series a better... flow. Much less felt like it could be skipped without consequence, which I think is a huge plus.And there were a few other places Advanced really shined. I feel like training took a much more prominent place in this season. We saw a lot of Ash actually working with his Pokémon to learn new moves, instead of the miracle, in the nick of time learning that happened a lot in the original. There were still instances of it, for both Ash and May, but it felt like more time went into preparing for each battle or rematch, and it showed Ash growing as trainer. On top of that, the battles got a lot more creative. This was true of the contests where appearance was just as important as effectiveness, but also when it came to Ash's battle strategies. Don't get me wrong, there were still some bullshit plot armor moments. (Because no, Ash, hitting your bird with a bolt of lightning would not give it an electric shield.) But overall, I felt it was a step in the right direction.At least... This can be said for the first two-thirds of Advanced. More than one thing about Battle Frontier didn't sit quite right with me, but I'll start with the formatting.Okay, so I know I'm going to soundl like a total hypocrite saying this, but... Frontier just felt rushed. I know, one of my biggest complaints about the original series was that it was too drawn out, but I didn't get the sense that they were really going anywhere throughout Battle Frontier's run. Which shouldn't have been possible, because Frontier took us back to Kanto, where everything should have been familiar. But stopping in towns where Ash previously won his Indigo League badges just didn't have the sense of connection that I felt they should have. For a comparison, I ask you to look back to his Johto travels. To be honest, I don't remember exactly why, but our heroes had to double back through Ecruteak over the course of their journey. And during those episodes where they returned to Ecruteak, they met back up with Morty-- the gym leader-- and had another little adventure having to do with the ghost tower in town-- a prominent aspect of Ecruteak. And I felt like it was a really nice callback.That's the feeling Frontier should have had. But it didn't. In fact, I don't think I really appreciated the characterization of the gym leaders until that point. It can be kind of subtle, but each gym leader is a really solid reflection of their town. Like Roxanne also running the trainer's school. Rustboro is the first town in Hoenn where you can earn a badge, and the trainer's school being such a big part of it was a really strong reflection of being The Beginning. It gives the towns character and makes them memorable, and I just felt like they really dropped the ball bringing things back to Kanto during Battle Frontier. Of course, there's another thing Frontier can be remembered for...And now... I suppose we have to discuss the voice acting. It's not typically something I bring up in my reviews unless I have something specific to say. I think it goes without saying that I, like most people, watched Pokémon dubbed. (That's just part of it stemming from my childhood.) Yup, from the company notorious for bad dubs. Who would have thought it would actually be something to mourn when 4Kids lost the rights to a show?Let's take a step back for a minute, shall we? Remember those little questionnaires in elementary and middle school that tried to determine which learning style you were best suited for? Like, were you most likely to remember a graph drawn on the board, a lecture, or a hands-on activity? I've always been a very auditory person. When I recall something someone said, it's down to every last inflection of their voice. So, regardless of which language I watch a show in, the characters' voices stick with me and become as much a part of their character as any of their actions throughout the series. So it's hell on my ears when even one voice actor is replaced, never mind the entire cast.Pokémon was one of the few things 4Kids did pretty well. Yes, even with all the censorship and localization they're so well known for. The actors put so much heart into their roles, even when they were saying truly ridiculous things. And I'd had about 400 episodes to get used to them. So maybe I'm a bit biased, but the new dub did just sound worse in general. There was either no emotion behind their words, or everything came out sounding over exaggerated and fake. Some of them (Brock, in particular) grew on me over time, but I want to specifically discuss Ash and May, because I don't think I ever truly appreciated how much Veronica Taylor was carrying this show until she was replaced.May... I know a lot of people hate May, either because she's inexperienced and says some pretty dumb things (even though Ash did that all the time in the original series) or because she replaced Misty, or whatever other reasons. I really like May as a character. (Significantly more than Misty.) She was a much more active character, and I already mentioned that I liked the way her contest storyline split up the filler between Ash's gym battles nicely. But mostly, I just like how much she grows throughout the series. She goes from not even liking Pokémon-- just wanting to travel-- to learning to love them and finding a purpose in this world. Even throughout her contests, May is very shortsighted, so her departure-- where she finally decided on a goal for herself and started thinking towards the future-- was very satisfying to me. It felt like a complete character arc. (As opposed to Misty, who was kind of just there until she wasn't.)But I felt May suffered quite a lot from the recasting. Further proof that WHAT you say doesn't matter half as much as HOW you say it. And everything May says after the recast comes out sounding overly timid or insecure, and that's really not who she was written or animated to be. May's defining characteristic was that she's adventurous. She has her low moments. There were lessons to be learned from both doubt and overconfidence over the course of her journey. But she was always just as brave as any of the other characters, and just as passionate about her contests as any of the others were about their dreams. Her new voice just sounded out-of-character, which is a shame because-- for the rest of the cast-- it was pretty clear they were trying to mimc the old voices.But May was not the one who suffered the most from the recasting. Ash's new voice is the one that really made me wish they'd just gone in an entirely new direction with Ash. Now, I have heard that Sarah Natochenny improves a lot as Pokémon continues and... Good lord, I hope so. May's voice just sounded wrong for her character. Ash's lines frequently came out as bad acting, plain and simple. My biggest complaint is that it sounded, to me, like the real problem was she couldn't both maintain Ash's voice and emote properly. Which I feel should have been a major indication that the job should have gone to someone else, but... We're in it for the long run now.So, I'm about to dive into Diamond and Pearl, and I'm interested to see how this goes. The next few seasons will be truly blind for me. I watched a few episodes of season three when it first came out, but... Eh. My interest in Pokémon kind of dropped off between Sapphire/Ruby and X/Y. Even if I didn't play much of the games, I was really familiar with the original Pokémon through the movies and just spending a lot of time with older cousins who were drawn in by the Pokémon craze. I've got a vague remembrance of some of the Sinnoh Pokémon, but I can't even remember the Unova starters off the top of my head. So it's promising to be quite a journey, truly free from any nostalgia, and I'm interested to see how that colors the experience. of nice to know what was coming next, but for the most part, the gym battles were just... gym battles. It was the way the second season was handled that won me over. The format changed a bit for this second season, and I feel it changed for the better. I think adding in the contest side of the Pokémon world broke up the time between Ash's gym battles very nicely. Ash and May switched off pretty evenly. And I felt it just gave the series a better... flow. Much less felt like it could be skipped without consequence, which I think is a huge plus.And there were a few other places Advanced really shined. I feel like training took a much more prominent place in this season. We saw a lot of Ash actually working with his Pokémon to learn new moves, instead of the miracle, in the nick of time learning that happened a lot in the original.

I will be focusing on the characters and story as a whole, not stuffs like the arts or the music in any kind.Following the uninteresting Johto region, this series taking place in the Hoenn region actually worked pretty well.This series made the difference first by introduction of Haruka, a newbie trainer. Because of this alone, Satoshi had his moments where he looked and was actually mature and had patience in comparison. Speaking of which, this series gave Satoshi as much time he required to grow as a trainer which got us out of the nightmare...from the Satoshi we had before. He started to gain experience and also served as a mentor at the first for Haruka.Another win from this series is the introduction of Pokemon Contest. This gave us a different approach to the Pokemon world. The episodes weren’t uninteresting anymore and didn’t repeat the Johto region since this included a fine story for two trainers than just one. Though the contest battles worked as the secondary story, it really stayed as the sub-story of the main as Satoshi’s adventures often overshadowed the contest battles.The series also shows the battle frontier as an arc so the whole Hoenn adventure was compact. The battle frontier takes place in Kanto and gives us the reminiscence of the things back then.But with the things at the back end, some of them made me feel rushed and plot armored just for the sake of the completion of their dreams and stuffs. There also were some of the unnecessary character development at times.Overall this was uprising of the Pokemon series and was just the better version fixing the bad pacing and lack of the story depth in the previous series. The animation also became better from near end. from the Satoshi we had before.

Puchimas!: Petit iDOLM@STER,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15649/Puchimas__Petit_iDOLMSTER,"['If you are reading this review, you are likely doing it for the purpose of answering the question of ""should I watch this show or not?"" Let\'s answer that question quickly, if you do not enjoy or have not experienced iDOLM@STER, then this spin-off will not appeal to you, go watch something else. If you do enjoy iDOLM@STER, then this may be able to satisfy your craving for more adventures with 765PRO.The premise behind Puchimasu revolves around the existence of creatures called ""puchidols"", small, stylized caricatures of those working at 765. These creatures have traits that are greatly exaggerated fandom interpretations of the characters and...they only communicate through vocal tics that are reminiscent of their respective idol. For example, Afuu, Hoshii Miki\'s Puchidoru, has a love for sleep and onigiri and speaks only using ""Nano"" and ""Hanii"". Some of the Puchidols even have special powers that affect the flow of the episode. While they all possess some degree of human intelligence, they all act very much like pets.One after another, antics revolving around these strange creatures and the idols occur before they are brought back to their new home with their respective 765PRO idol. These antics can happen in simple treks to and from work, to a global scale, in the tropics, jungle, and desert. The situations they get into range from simple everyday work, to the nonsensical, such as a worldwide hide and seek. This flow of events presents a contrast to those of the main series which focused mainly on idol work and live insert song numbers.The strength of this spin-off, much like the main series, lies in the character interactions among the idols and with the puchidols. However, the interactions are all light-hearted comedic and comedic in nature, and the characters do not carry emotional baggage or doubts as they had in the main series. In fact, many of the characters have their ""fandom"" traits emphasized as well, akin to the Puchidols. The biggest change in character is seen in the the Producer, who has been relegated to a much more comedic relief role, becoming more of an unreliable pervert and his head replaced with the ubiquitous yellow producer P. As Producer now has less of a central role, this allows for the idols to interact with each other more independently of him.In the aesthetics department, the style and sounds are simplistic and vibrant, an appropriate match with the light-hearted atmosphere of Puchimas. The animation is also very simple and limited, so there won\'t be any song and dance routines like in the anime adaptation. The end credits do offer a few new songs sung by different members of the iDOLM@STER cast, with similar light-heartedness.With all of these factors considered, it can be concluded that this spin-off places great emphasis on the happy and fun parts of the iDOLM@STER series. If you\'re looking for more fun antics with the 765PRO idols, then this spin-off is recommended for you. This show might not be for every iDOLM@STER fan though. If you would enjoy more of the character development or song and dance aspects of the iDOLM@STER series, then this spin-off might not be the one for you.

An adorable little pile of cuteness"" - Me, in this review.The way I view spin-offs is that they have 2 purposes: to provide more material for the fans of the show to enjoy or to draw in new fans to the main show.  If a spin-off manages to do the former without doing the latter, I still consider it a success.  So, in my mind, the best type of spin-off is one that not only provides existing fans with more content, but also manages to draw new fans in.  And PUCHIM@S has managed to convince me to try...out the iDOLM@STER in the near future.Story - 10/10What story? This doesn\'t need a story.  It\'s just a set of daily events that are really entertaining.  Each Puchidol has their own special trait, that is apparently supposed to reflect something about the Idol they are a counterpart to (I say apparently because, as previously mentioned, I haven\'t seen the main show).Art - 7/10The art is good.  It\'s colorful.  That\'s about all I can say.Sound - 10/10This is a music anime...it\'d be shocking if the sound wasn\'t good.Character - 10/10The Puchidols are easily one of the most amusing things I\'ve ever seen - for a few examples: there\'s Haruka, who multiplies when water is poured on her; Yukipo, who literally digs holes and jumps into them; Miurasan, who can teleport to the location of the person she is thinking of; Chihaya, who bites people (especially girls with bouncy chests); Takanya, who writes down what she\'s thinking; and Afu, who loves rice balls.  Did I mention that they\'re also really cute? Because they are.Enjoyment - 10/10I found this series to be adorable.  It\'s a great time killer, and it\'s also really short.Overall - 10/10The snob in me tells me that I shouldn\'t even think about giving such a high score to a show like this, but I don\'t care.  I absolutely loved this series.Normally, I would end this review with a section where I say that if you liked X series, you should watch this, but honestly...I can\'t think of anything like this.  So...yeah. out the iDOLM@STER in the near future.Story - 10/10What story? This doesn\'t need a story.  It\'s just a set of daily events that are really entertaining.

So...yeah.', 'Puchimas! is an anime revolving around Puchidols, which are basically mini versions of the idols from 756 Pro. As the show goes on more Puchidols join the studio and their antics get crazier and crazier. Each of the Puchidols has a special power of sorts, like the ability to multiply or teleport, these powers create many hilarious situtations for the idols.Story: There isn\'t much to the story, it is a slice of life anime so it just follows the idols and Puchidols, but that being said it is a very funny anime. It\'s quite addictive to, usually having story carry over throughout the 3 minute...episodes.Art: The art is cute, nothing special. There are some cool effects every now and then but mostly it sticks to the ""Cute/Moe"" type of art.Sound: There are 3 different ED\'s throughout the series and whilst there are no songs similar to anything found in the Idolmaster series, the music is still extremely catchy. The voices are all adorable too.Characters: If you like the characters from Idolmaster, you\'ll fall in love with them all over again. The Puchidols are essentially baby versions of the idols so that adds extra fanservice.Overall, this series is great fun, it\'s not very long either so if you\'ve seen Idolmaster this is a fun, short series that you should get some laughs out of 8/10 episodes.Art: The art is cute, nothing special.

In most cases they consist of simple fluff that we really have no reason to overthink or be too serious in critiquing; just watch and enjoy for the moment, but PUCHIM@S, while treading in that same territory was fairly more enjoyable than the majority of the other spin-off shows like it.Rather than just turning the whole cast into cute blobs, they keep the girls in their normal forms and instead find themselves discovering the existences of these doll-like entities resembling every girl affliated with...765 at random times and in random locations then bringing them back to the 765 studio to shelter them all. When I think of babies with relevant roles in anime like something like Precure for instance, I don't expect much except looking cute and a lot of GOO GOO GAA GAA, but the PUCHIM@S are simply sized like babies and are pretty intelligent and sentient entities that come with their own quirks based on the 765 girls they're visually stylized from and I grew to like all of them quickly. The 765 girls are also here with their personalities and traits seen in the show accelerated a bit. Then the producer is here as well but his head is shaped into the letter P and character made whimsical so he's a goof with less presence here but it's played for laughs.This show is essentially fun fanservice. It's fun seeing the girls interact with miniature versions of themselves as well as being generally happy. The interactions between everyone are executed well and with enough time for us to process the humor in their antics. Episodes are only 2 minutes (credits & next episode previews included) but they aren't bouncing jokes at you at a rapid pace or acting senselessly to make half-baked lackluster parody humor, the pacing is normal so when a situation is still ongoing by the end of an episode it's immediately followed up and multiple consecutive episodes flow together like one.Remember, it's a chibi spin-off so don't overanalyze it, enjoy it. 765 at random times and in random locations then bringing them back to the 765 studio to shelter them all.

Episodes are only 2 minutes (credits & next episode previews included) but they aren't bouncing jokes at you at a rapid pace or acting senselessly to make half-baked lackluster parody humor, the pacing is normal so when a situation is still ongoing by the end of an episode it's immediately followed up and multiple consecutive episodes flow together like one.Remember, it's a chibi spin-off so don't overanalyze it, enjoy it.""]"
Otaku no Video,https://myanimelist.net/anime/785/Otaku_no_Video,"['""It\'s not like I\'m ashamed of my past or anything!""- Former OtakuPreface:Otaku no Video is a very insightful and introspective (with a touch of mockery) movie that contains both a slightly parodical animated version of the origins of studio Gainax, and live recorded interviews conducted by Gainax of former (and current) Otaku of the time- 1991.Very nontraditional in many ways, it\'s not completely anime, and not completely live action, but a blend that presents relevant cultural information regarding the Otaku. It\'s broken up into two parts; one, an animated movie about a guy named Ken Kubo and his stereotypical fat, geeky otaku friend...Tanaka, and the second part is a series of the aforementioned interviews in segments called ""Portrait of an Otaku"".The animation first:Kubo and Tanaka were college friends; Kubo the typical Gary Stu kind of guy- tennis team, has a beautiful girlfriend, scholar, and everything seems right in his life, except he\'s rather bored. He meets up with Tanaka by chance in an elevator, and from that fateful reunion on is slowly drawn into the Otaku lifestyle of making fanfiction magazines, garage kits (modified figurines), and eventually full on anime and video games in an attempt to become the OTAKING- King of the Otakus!After rising to the top, Kubo and Tanaka get screwed, and then have to decide what it was that was really important to them- the grubbing, hand to mouth lifestyle of being an artist and original creator, or selling out and making all the money. There\'s only one true path for the Otaking, and that\'s to take it beyond the stars.----The pacing is broken up by the interviews, but the narrative is both engaging and humorous, along with providing a very loose version of how Gainax was started, and their goals of shooting for the stars, both in animation and in business practices. It\'s very interesting to see how Otaku no Video inspired later works, and drew from the doujinshi (amateur produced works) that put Gainax on the map. Real life science fiction conventions Daicon 3 and 4 (1981, 1983) are explored, which Gainax also produced shorts for. Other character stylings and symbols seen in later works also make appearances, like Kamina\'s glasses on a building, robots from Gunbuster, and more.-----Portrait of an Otaku:Through a series of live interviews, the movie also explores the lives and disparate interests of those who call themselves Otaku. Garage Kit Otaku, Military Otaku, Anime and Manga, Fanzines, Cosplay enthusiasts, and Fan Video Otaku, and even an art thief are all shown, and asked series of questions that either mock their interests and lifestyle, or that give some insight into what it is that drives them to their obsession.While it\'s believed that the people interviewed were either Gainax employees themselves (who created their studio to put a name behind their amateur original works, and thereby personifying some of these stereotypes), some of it is plainly staged. Hideaki Anno himself is shown as a Hentai-game addict, even. Typically, the faces and voices are censored, so it\'s still unknown who some of them are. It\'s interesting in that they\'re making fun of Otaku, and at the same time themselves, because that\'s how Gainax started out: geeks making their own originals to hawk at conventions.The portrait section also provides some hilarious statistics on what Otaku are interested in, and how different groups see different themes. A foreigner was also intereviewed, and it was stated that some 50% of those surveyed come to Japan solely out of anime and manga fandom, and the other half either ""like"" or ""are not opposed"" to it. A fanzine convention survey of 100 Otaku revealed that only 15% of them had cosplayed, and an overwhelming 60% had not. Of those 15 that responded yes, the ""Otaku who did cosplay tended to be repeat offenders"".Another survey included those who ""talk to themselves"", of which the overwhelming majority with 70% did.-----There\'s also a deep sociological background to Otaku culture; stemming from how a more collectivist culture like Japan operates vs an intensely individualistic one like the US. ""The nail that sticks out gets hammered"" they say, and to a point, it\'s true. In a collectivist culture, the ideal person fits in with their group, their family, their society, and don\'t express their individualism much when around others. In private, they can be a night and day different person.The Otaku have long been branded as ""no life losers"", and in a sense shunned from their culture as they\'re perceived ""deviant"", no different from the US, really. People with anime and manga obsession, people obsessed with doomsday preparation, zombie fanatics, etc.-all these groups share a common thread in that they\'re on the fringe of \'normative\' society. In that, they find a bond together, and create their own subculture outside of the norms.For anyone who\'s interested in the Otaku culture, this half mockumentary is a great video for insight into what it was like back in the day, even if it\'s somewhat parodical. In all honesty, what they portray satirically here is not far from the truth, neither in 1991 nor in 2015. There are tons of people out there like the ones shown in this movie, that are obsessive enthusiasts of different fandoms, and though their interests may be broad, they\'re all bound by a label that sets them apart- that of the Otaku.

It is simultaneously a humorous, introspective, and thought-provoking look at otaku, and more so than any other similarly themed production, it really covers all bases in its analytical approach to the lifestyle they lead, about the nature of shame, obsession, habitual collecting, and the way in which otaku approach other people, and the world around them. I&rsquo;ll have to be brief in my comments regarding this aspect of the OVA, because there&rsquo;s really enough content to write...a particularly lengthy essay about. It is comforting, and quite obvious, that everything is approached through the perspective of an otaku, so that the way the themes are explored are not heavy-handed in their ridicule or disapproval of Otaku, but rather they dispel stereotypes in exchange for an edge of realism, which gradually demonstrates a residual tone of sadness and loneliness, and cleverly deconstructs the fabricated fantasy worlds in which Otaku so often reside. The surveyed data included in the OVA was certainly very interesting, with some of the results showing some strong indications of the characteristics of an otaku. Ultimately all of the &lsquo;portrait of an otaku&rsquo; segments worked to paint a larger portrait of Otaku, and a reflective definition of the term. The strongest facet to otaku&rsquo;s personalities was their drive and passion to attain their desires, and their common reliance on fantasy and escapism as a way of life.In terms of actual entertainment value, and story, I was quite disappointed. Although an important contribution to the OVA, the &lsquo;portrait of an otaku&rsquo; segments really fractured the progression of the story and fragmented its pace so that it was difficult for thew show to build up momentum or excitement. I felt that the story simply not be told in such a short period of time, particularly of the characters were to be properly fleshed out and developed. As a consequence of the short, and divided time, I never felt attached to the characters, or their plight, or only occasionally did their predicament make me feel. This would have been alright if it was more of a comedy, but the fact is it was rarely very funny, the black humour of the portraits was almost entirely absent from the actual anime. This basically means that the OVA is barely worth watching unless you have a genuine interest or investment in the otaku culture in Japan; you will not find a better psycho-analysis of the otaku character. a particularly lengthy essay about.

(The &quot;portraits&quot; are about anime/manga/military/hentai Otakus).Otaku no Video is a fairly fun video/OVA to watch. Not necessarily for the actual animation, but the Otaku interview bits(called portrait of an Otaku) in between the actual story, where they have interviews with all sorts of Otakus(Manga,Anime,Military,True,Foreign, &quot;Garage Kit&quot;). Of course, this OVA is fairly outdated (~24 years before time of this review). Opinion: Otaku\\'s have changed over time, so the same...(Portrait of an Otaku) can\\'t necessarily be applied to modern ones.As for the Story, it only becomes worthwhile when he emerges into the Japanese anime industry(episode 2).

It explores the realm of otakus and opens the eyes of why do otakus exist. Since there is only 2 episodes I can't really find that much to talk about but there are a few factors. The fact that it gives a side documentary on real life otakus as of 1991 is rather impressive especially for its time. If you ever plan to become a genius about anime or want to see a story of a man who converts himself into the otaku life this is a must watch. It also explores the realms of not just anime otakus...but military,cosplay, pop culture, movie and gun otakus as well. This show was rather educational and pretty funny. There were jokes That I really laughed at a lot. The story is rather interesting and it gives me some inspiration about spreading and making money off of any hobby someone may have. I also love some of the anime references. There were a few from Macross and some of the 1980s Miyazaki films.  Characters consist of mostly different types of otakus and the main character who is a regular boring kid who later gets sucked into the life of an otaku. The sound is a bit dated along with other factors like seeing images of over stacked shelves of VHS tapes. This anime has a rather positive view mixed with a few negative but later turned around views of the otaku life. This series is a must watch and I recommend every major anime fan to watch this.

This went between an incredibly cringey and unrealistic story, to a low quality interview between the interviewers and otaku from the 1980s. I am amazed at the high reviews for this. I will separate this between the anime part and the interview part, in what is hopefully better executed than the movie itself.ANIME:Story: The story is quite nonsensical, and feels like a random conglomerate of events that loosely match up with the interviews. The ending makes very little sense, and almost feels like it is going against what the entire theme of the movie is supposed...to be (basically, don't fall into the trap of becoming an otaku).Art: It's from 1985, what is there to expect?Sound: Once again, it's from 1985. It's fine.Character: The main character, Kubo, somewhat feels like a puppet of the creators rather than a full-fledged character. He falls into the trap of becoming an otaku, but that is where the realism ends. He jumps from one idea to another, and none of the other characters have any depth. Very little is noted about Kubo himself, other than that he has/had a girlfriend, and has incredibly odd dreams after being pushed around like a cue ball.Overall: Nothing stands out very much other than a terrible story.INTERVIEWS:Story: There isn't much of a story, but most of the interviews are somehow related to the anime portions. The interviewer asks multiple questions about the lives of the interviewees, ranging from past experiences to sexual habits. Some of the interviewees are just plain weird, others seem like normal people who are down in the dumps. At one point, the interviewers practically assault somebody who appears to be trying to just go about his normal day.Sound: I think the sound was fairly normal quality for such an old show, but the first interview stands out to me as being particularly horrid. You can hear every time he breathes in, as though the microphone is sensitive in the wrong place, along with a fan running in the background. One of the people interviewed was from the U.S., and although this may be due to where I seen the movie, the subtitles did not match what he was saying at all.Polls: After every interview, the narrator shows the watcher several charts depicting responses to various questions, from whether someone has hear of garage kits, to whether they had sex before marriage. These polls are practically taken as fact by the movie, and are used to create assumptions based upon an incredibly small portion of people (usually 100). The process of choosing people is also not explained, so it furthers how unreliable the results may be.Overall: This is what killed it for me. The idea was certainly interesting, but between weird audio, and unreliable statistics, it didn't feel like it made sense to be included within the movie.CONCLUSION: This is my first review, because I could not believe how high the ratings for this were. Otaku no Video is overall pretty terrible, from a low-quality story to faulty information. I would definitely skip this, and look for something better to occupy your time with. 2/10 to be (basically, don't fall into the trap of becoming an otaku).Art: It's from 1985, what is there to expect?Sound: Once again, it's from 1985.

Main character Kubo is an everyday college student dissatisfied with his life and hobbies, but a chance reunion with his old high school friend Tanaka drags him into his world of the Otaku. Kubo leaves his “normal” life behind and vows to become the “Otaking”. The anime skips forward in time as it follows the two friends from fanboys, to model distributors, to independent anime creators. As well as their various odd...struggles in between, delivered in a comedic tone complete with underdog heroes and typical villains.Dividing these chronological updates are odd live action mockumentary interviews. These are primarily staged interviews about otaku culture between Gainax employees and associates whose faces are typically obscured by mosaic with their voices digitally altered. Being made in a time when “otaku” still referred to general geek culture rather than that of anime, you even see some focus on things such as airsoft gun fanatics. Fake recording dates are given along with timely major national news, seemingly to punctuate these surprisingly self-loathing segments and their mockery of oblivious escapism and empty social lives. These interviews border on mean-spirited, and although it stems from Gainax making fun of themselves, by hiding their identities as they mean to depict broader otaku culture they end up dragging the identities of otaku fans in general through the mud as they’re portrayed as antisocial, perverted losers. For every question that genuinely probes into the minds of various subcultures and their appeals, there’s three that target the interviewee personally such as “Do you ever go outside?” or “Have you ever had sex?”. Clearly the public perspective hasn’t changed much since 1991, but for an OVA ostensibly celebrating the passion behind otaku culture it comes dangerously close to making its condemnation of the scene far more obvious than its appreciation.It can be seen as honesty to present the optimism, solidarity, and excitement of otaku culture in an anime format complete with a comedic, melodramatic storyline and then to acknowledge the negative parts of it at the same time in reality. But not even the anime segments are free from this negativity and industry remorse, and a binary display of showing only the negativity and shame in the most realistic segments makes the bitterness much more impactful than the optimism. It’s a shame that I can’t picture The Otaku Video as being particularly made “for” anyone. Probably not otaku, for the frequent contempt it shows towards its own members’ ways of living, and the fact that the anime segments don’t focus as much on the otaku lifestyle as they do on a very brief story of rising in the industry of otaku – something almost no one watching will find relatable. The eccentric presentation and title will keep non-otaku miles away, and the depiction of the “real” otaku will make any one of them desperate to avoid that path.Even not taking it seriously, The Otaku Video is just too sour for its own comedic purposes. Often too self-loathing, in a way that’s now particularly tired and reductionist, to set a consistent mood for laughter or joy. It’s also too heavily fictionalized to work as a reliable historic take on Gainax’s creation. There are some high-spirited moments scattered throughout as the characters stubbornly defend their interests despite being scorned by society and hope to end the prejudice, but these ideologies end up being buried by the creators’ negativity and own lack of confidence. And yet, the OVA is likable enough. In addition to crisp, colorful Blu-ray animation, this OVA’s very existence and even the contradictions about it are a testament to Gainax’s peak eccentricity and the concept and result is something that could only come from the incredible creative forces behind the studio and beyond it. It’s delightful, not for any possible attempt to capture otaku culture or Gainax’s founding, but its inherent display of the personality that made the studio so unique.

In other words, this isn’t a video for otaku – it’s a video for Gainax dorks. Are you one?', 'This Gainax video was missing in my library. And I’m very glad that I finally got to watch it.The Gainax animation in ’91 was excellent and this OVA was probably the first in it’s kind to thread some experimental paths in animation, a style that it was copied later on on titles like Tylor and became Gainax trademark in Eva and Kare Kano and on.As Gainax universe is concerned you see obvious links and the same style used in Gainax productions, if you put Otaku No Video>Evangelion>Kare Kano one after the other you can clearly see the evolution of the studio in that...particular style. Obviously they are different approaches but each of them ended being a timeless classic with their similarities in animation.The OVA starts off in ’82 telling the story of a average Japanese person slowly getting more and more into the otaku universe throughout the years.Interesting point is that Gainax interview several real life otakus (or persons that had been otaku in their college days), these occasional small interviews add some sad and depressing mood to it, but it doesn’t decrease the quality of the OVA, in the other side it raised the quality.As the story goes by, it surpasses it’s air date year (1991) and goes further into the future, this led the story to leave the depressive parts behind and ends in a rather cheerful, comedic and happy ending.I loved the OVA and would recommend anyone to watch it.Rate; 8.0/10 particular style.

About myself.  Trust me, it\'s relevant.It\'s strange to imagine but I never considered myself as an otaku, more than an enthusiast when I was younger (yes I understand the irony of that statement).  In the 90\'s though when I was still in middle school and high school, being a fan of anime and video games was a double-whammy of nerdism.  I heard about this OAV while I was still in my Kenichi Sonoda kick, but only one of my friends had it.  I finally got to watch it when I got...to college years later (but only the first OAV was available) but it struck a few chords about me when I was younger and more obsessed.For starters, I had only myself to share my anime obsession with.  It was sad.  Since finding BBS\'s and newsgroups that were sparsely populated (that I could find anyhow), I didn\'t have anyone else to talk about anime with except my brother.  Our news came from Protoculture Addicts and we got our art books and merchandise from a Yaohan (now called Mitsuwa).Now going back and watching Otaku No Video, it first confused me with the live-action shots but seeing the lifestyles of some of these people in Japan and how they treat their hobbies actually got me pretty depressed and downtrodden.  It can be an eye-opener for sure.  Yes, it\'s dated (then again, I still enjoy 70\'s-90\'s anime) but honestly, there are people today that treat their obsessions to that same degree.Hearing Kikuko Inoue and knowing she still does great VA work today is at least worth checking out.You can take this series with a grain of salt (like you would with say, Genshiken), or watch it like the sucker I was and feel very depressed after watching it.I won\'t be against finishing the OAV if I can find the second episode, but I probably would have to be drunk or with friends to share the ""experience"" with. to college years later (but only the first OAV was available) but it struck a few chords about me when I was younger and more obsessed.For starters, I had only myself to share my anime obsession with.

But if you watch anime, you\'re weird? Why?!Otaku no Video was a brilliant and educational little two-part OVA that follows this guy who wants to be the ultimate otaku or the ""otaking"". Its mainly inspired by the real story of how Gainax was founded, which we\'re obsessed with anime fans who wanted to make their own stuff. What I loved about this is how passionate and in your face it is.  This show is not only very good in terms of its message of embracing YOUR inner otaku, but it also includes parts...of real-life interviews with otakus who are awkward and clumsy and who don\'t even want to admit to their otaku habits in general. Most of them also lacked social contact and many were still virgins. Part 1 of Otaku no Video was very realistic and down to earth, but in part 2 the OVA becomes more like something that Gainax would have made, like f.ex Evangelion or Gurren Lagann, with a weird and insane ending.Otaku No Video also shows that the word ""otaku"" doesn\'t solely have to be about anime, it can also apply to an obsession with anything else, e.g military, computers and even things that are considered criminal, which they showed a person who stole DVDs and sold them to people.To conclude, Otaku No Video was an obscure yet insightful OVA that gave me new information on the Otaku culture and showed me that in Japan the word ""otaku"" is something which those who are, are ashamed of and how someone who is an Otaku can be applied to every hobby, just as long as that turns into an extreme obsession where it affects the life of that person in question. Otaku is much more embraced in the west and is mostly referred to as anime fans, which is why I call myself Otaku, even though it might mean something different in Japan. of real-life interviews with otakus who are awkward and clumsy and who don\'t even want to admit to their otaku habits in general.

He had a beautiful girlfriend, a passion for a sport he was genuinely talented at, and a satisfying life with little to no problems to worry about.  Everything was going just fine for young Ken, when he ran into an old friend from high school who’s dedicated his life to a surprising hobby.  Tanaka, having put on a generous portion of weight since their last meeting, has fallen into otaku culture, a certified never never land where adults turn their backs on conventional society to pursue every possible facet of an underground counter-pop-culture...revolving around obscure, esoteric subjects such as animation, idol singers, special effects movies and even military paraphernalia.  He initially raises his eyebrow at such juvenile fare, but soon finds himself slowly being sucked in, and before he knows it, he gets in way over his head and begins to change on a drastic level, losing both the respect and affection of his girlfriend along with any hint of his old social life.Having left everything behind, Ken quickly realizes that the only direction he can move is now forward, so that his newfound passion doesn’t have to be a dead end.  Instead, he dedicates his life not only to experiencing otaku culture, but changing it, and becoming one with it, so that he may one day become one of the greatest otaku the world has ever known.  With the help Tanaka and the rest of his nerdy, passionate friends, Ken Kubo begins to climb the ladder of success as a content creator, overseeing the production of model kits in both Japan and China, all of which is a part of his grand plan to unite all of the otaku of the world in harmony under his rule as the Otaking, leading up to his grand ambition, a future theme park called Otakuland!  But when his best friend turns his back on him and sells him out to hand the company over to the least expected person imaginable, will Ken be able to land on his feet, and will the otaku of the world ever live to see the day where they’ll be respected by society?One of the first things you’ll want to know about Otaku no video is that, unlike most anime, it’s not entirely animated.  A good chunk of it’s running time consists of live action interviews conducted in mockumentary style with different kinds of otakus, and these segments are spliced throughout the ova.  I’ll talk more about those later, but more importantly, with only two 40 minute episodes and large portions of film that didn’t need to be animated, you might think it would be really simple to set aside a decent budget for the animation portions.  And come on, this is Gainax, even a lot of their earlier works are more or less impressive in the visual department.  this is unfortunately not the case, as the animation in this OVA is bare bones at best.  It can be unbelievably distracting when there are tons of motionless people in the background, which is sadly all too common, and the best looking scenes are the ones where the only things happening are conversations.  The opening video was decently animated, but the rest of the product just looks cheap.Well, I say it looks cheap, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it looks bad.  There really isn’t much going on in the animated sections in terms of action, so there really isn’t any content that can feel short-changed over their shortage of change.  Yeah, the backgrounds full of frozen people can be distracting, but most of the content is serviceable enough, with no excess funds needed.  It doesn’t really look like Gainax style animation, but at the very least, it does look like Gainax style artwork.  The characters have an aesthetic that’s very much of it’s time, but is still pretty easy on the eyes.  People are more or less realistically proportioned, at least from the neck down, with your typical anime facial constructs being really the only thing keeping them from looking real.  Characters also cosplay in several scenes, with the costumes they’re wearing being of incredibly detailed quality, more than accurate enough to satisfy any purists sitting at the table.  It’s not a great looking anime, but it looks fine.So, we’re all otaku, right?  I know I am, and obviously you wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t have some level of interest in the anime medium.  We all love watching animation from a certain bow-shaped archipelago, and as long as we all have that in common, we can more or less live in harmony together.  There may be some truth to this, but where people tend to differ is where it comes to their otaku origin stories.  We all discovered and embraced anime differently, from people who watched kids anime from a young age to people who just so happened to have their imaginations sparked by that one anime film they saw at a friends’ house.  In Otaku no video, the main character was a normal, average person, and he was drawn into otaku culture from his old life because...  Well, they’re not clear about what exactly started it, but it was either his friends’ level of passion, the fact that he could watch and out of print TV show on taped cassettes, or seeing that one girl in a fur bikini cosplay.  Whatever it was, he came into the fandom as an adult, and was drawn in from the outside world.  I don’t know about you, but this couldn’t be more different from my story.Unlike Ken Kubo, I was born to be an otaku.  If you follow the original Japanese definition of the word, someone who’s obsessed with something to the point of over-indulgence, that’s pretty much always described me.  As a child I was an otaku for Power Rangers and Xmen, then I moved onto Star Wars, and later on in life I’d have similar experiences with RWBY, MLP Friendship is Magic, and the WWE.  I would focus on these things so tightly that I would scare my friends and family away from the same properties.  to this day, my brother still feels an aversion towards anything I get into.  Seriously, after I got my PS4, his drive to buy one himself instantly died out, and he never touched mine in the year that I’ve had it.  I have a tendency to approach things cautiously and skeptically, but then to dive in head first as soon as my toe’s in the water.  I’ve had numerous otaku-like obsessions throughout my life, but looking back, none of them hit me as hard as pokemon did.  That franchise landed me like a prize bass, and it ultimately worked as my gateway anime as a result, just like it has for a lot of people.I went HARD into pokemon.  It dominated my life to the point that I could see myself being one of the people interviewed in Otaku no video, were it made today.  I don’t feel comfortable going into relevant experiences without a mosaic covering my face, but trust me, it wasn’t healthy.  Thankfully, it’s proximity to Cardcaptors on Kids WB set me on the beginning of a much better path.  Cardcaptors(No, not Cardcaptor Sakura, and I’m not proud of this) soon took over for it in my heart, and managed to get me into fanfic writing, which got me into writing in general.  I would eventually move onto other TV anime, such as Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon, before titles like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga and Chobits took me deeper into the medium, seeking out titles that weren’t immediately available at the time.  Getting a full-time job also really helped, as it’s allowed me to pour money into the medium, often to my own detriment, and I eventually wound up giving back to the community through a blog that I’ve been running for four years strong.  My obsessive tendencies haven’t gone away, as I still feel the need to buy merchandise and become a part of everything I get into, but I doubt I’ll ever grow out of that.Now, why did I go out of my way to tell you all about my journey as an otaku?  Well, first of all, because Otaku no Video doesn’t really offer a lot of discussion points of it’s own.  That may sound harsh of me, but second of all, I can’t really relate to any of it, as my story is so obviously different from theirs.  I don’t doubt that there’s a lot of people out there who can watch this anime, point to the screen at various moments and proclaim “Yeah, that’s how it was for me,” but I really can’t.  Maybe I’m not the target audience, because I didn’t come up the way they did, I’m not well versed in classic anime(I mean come on, most old shows are at least one hundred episodes long), and I don’t feel so attached to the sanctity of otaku lifestyle that I need to see it given a blowjob just to feel more contented with my own life choices.  I didn’t catch most of the references, I don’t feel compelled to look them up, and while I’ve been able to acknowledge the existence of passion as a positive life lesson before, it doesn’t feel as important here.Part of it has to do with the fact that this anime wasn’t really intended to have a great story attached to it.  One of the over-all themes I picked up on was one of nostalgia, and sure enough, I’ve been told by a few sources that Otaku no video is a semi-autobiographical tale about the founding of Gainax, through the love, passion, tragedy and triumph that got it where it is today...  As well as 18 years in the still-distant future, because hey why not be optimistic?  I don’t know how much of “Giant X’s” history accurately represents Gainax’s own tale, but it does offer a strong argument for no compelling story or plot being needed.  After all, if you’re telling someone’s real life story, there’s no call to embellish the facts for the sake of entertainment.  Well, you can say that, but when you’re telling your life story in 1991, and you’re patting yourself on the back for events that take place in 1999 and 2035, maybe throwing in a little spice to keep the viewer entertained isn’t the worst thing you can possibly do.  I’m just saying.Because as it is, I certainly didn’t hate this anime, but I also found it really difficult to get invested in it.  Rather than an actual story, it felt like footnotes, only giving us about one brief scene from each year of the fictitious company’s history, and who the hell knows what happened inbetween?  For all we know, the guy with the weird sleeping habits had a drinking problem.  For all we know, Ken and Tanaka were almost turned against each other by a love triangle with the cute cosplaying lady.  For all we know, somebody’s parents died, affecting their attitude and convictions.  All we ever get is “This happened, then this happened, then this happened...”  And while all of it is relevant in some way to the over-all plot, I felt so little attachment to the stakes and characters that I found myself dozing off multiple times during the much more fast-paced second episode.  Then again, maybe that’s a good thing, because from what I hear, one of the things I missed was seeing a porn enthusiast who’s trying to find a way to circumvent Japan’s decency laws jerk off on camera.  I’m kind of glad I didn’t get to see that.And speaking of the live action segments, they are pretty interesting.  They act as a counterbalance to the anime’s shameless trumpeting of otaku pride by showing off the other side of the coin, how these types of obsessions can dominate and potentially ruin a person’s life.  It’s not entirely negative, of course, and offers a fair and honest look at the real human faces behind otaku culture.  It introduces us to people who are obviously deviating from social norms, but to them, what they’re doing is completely normal, even if it results in perpetual virginity.  Everybody they show us is fascinating in their own way, from a military geek who’d fit in quite well with America’s paintball culture, a gashapon enthusiast who likes to disassemble merchandise he gets and construct his own parts for them if they’re not to his liking, somebody who records rare video(I’d like to imagine he, or a close relative, is now making a killing off of youtube), and even a few criminals who buy and sell animation cells from anime production companies.  This alone would make up for a lot of the anime’s failings, if it wasn’t for the overwhelming evidence that all of these interviews were staged, and starred Gainax employees under false names.Otaku no Video is available from Animeigo in both video cassette and DVD, which despite being out of print for respectively twenty-four and fourteen years, is still pretty easy to find online at an affordable price.  There’s no english dub, but honestly, I don’t really find that surprising.If you can’t tell by the length of this review, I had a very difficult time writing a piece on this particular OVA.  It almost defies review, because by it’s very nature, the story it’s telling doesn’t need to be fleshed out or well written.  It had a very specific goal, to cater to a very specific group of fans, which just happen to be the same kinds of fans that Gainax is made of.  Even 26 years later, modern day otaku who grew up on the anime of the seventies and eighties can still find a fulfilling experience in it.  I guess that’s why, at the end of the day, the word that I think best describes Otaku no Video would be esoteric, and that’s ultimately why it’s so hard to place a rating on it.  I haven’t watched a lot of older anime, and with my time now being eaten up by a full time job and a blog that I need to constantly be writing reviews for, I probably never will, once again considering just how long a lot of those shows ran.  I feel bad giving it a negative score when I’m so very explicitly not part of it’s target audience, especially seeing how beloved it is to people from it’s intended crowd, so I guess in the end there’s nothing I can do but take it on faith and shoot for the middle ground.  I give Otaku no video a 6/10. revolving around obscure, esoteric subjects such as animation, idol singers, special effects movies and even military paraphernalia.

I guess that’s why, at the end of the day, the word that I think best describes Otaku no Video would be esoteric, and that’s ultimately why it’s so hard to place a rating on it.  I haven’t watched a lot of older anime, and with my time now being eaten up by a full time job and a blog that I need to constantly be writing reviews for, I probably never will, once again considering just how long a lot of those shows ran.  I feel bad giving it a negative score when I’m so very explicitly not part of it’s target audience, especially seeing how beloved it is to people from it’s intended crowd, so I guess in the end there’s nothing I can do but take it on faith and shoot for the middle ground.  I give Otaku no video a 6/10.', 'Otaku no Video is part documentary into of the depths of old otaku culture, and part grand anime retelling of Gainax Co-Founder Toshio Okada\'s legacy. This short but thoughtful OVA succeeds in archiving and showcasing the past of a subculture that no longer exists in the same fashion, and the various sects within it. Offsetting the glorious anime powered story of the otaking and the romanticized version of the SF Clubs of the 1970s, there are live action interview segments called ""オタクの肖像 - Otaku Portrait"" that paint into your view the lives of people that encapsulate every branch of otakudom. This...isn\'t always pretty and often shows people that have gone too far in their fandom to the point of detriment. At one point they even have a gooner segment where a guy had made ancient forbidden gooner tech to de-mosaic the censors on porn a little bit. Segments like these are a bit rough to watch as you see them get decimated by questions such as ""Have you ever appreciated the blue sky?"" Otakudom is sort of juxtaposed by these segments as both an enriching lifestyle and a thing that can destroy you, because its not always about the bad like gooner man.The first episode of the OVA is much more ground to earth in the animated segments and shows you someone finding a community that has absolute devotion to their pastime and more than enough room for him to join in, and he takes that energy right in and is consumed by their enthusiasm and friendliness. This energy extends to a couple of the portraits, who have found their own community and happiness doing what they love with others. The show does a fantastic job of syncing these harrowing tales of otakudom gone wrong with the lowest points of the animation, along with more jovial interviews accompanying the triumphs. I think Otaku no Video is one of the most earnest and genuine pieces of media I\'ve ever seen, it showcases tons about otakudom in the 1970-80s and lays it all down to bare. The show advocates for a style of otaku that I wouldn\'t mind at all, in it for the art, companionship, and devotion to their craft.After watching something like that I can\'t help but go, ""Who the hell worked on that"" and instantly pull up MAL to the staff page and did some reading on Okada as I\'d mentioned before. From the brief look I\'ve had so far its undeniable that this show was about him and his relationship to the otaku world. Seems he went on to write many books, including such bangers as ""失われた未来 - Lost Future"" and ""オタクはすでに死んでいる - You Otaku are Already Dead"". Okada also went on to lecture at Tokyo University about otakudom severeal times, a prestigious honor to an already decadent career. After seeing this it all kind of wrapped up perfectly in my head and squeezed the meaning out of it. These portraits were chosen for a good reason, Otaku no Video is a gallery handpicked by Okada to paint into your mind the vision of a better otaku. That knowing what is wrong when you see it and learning from it can help keep/develop a healthier relationship with one\'s hobbies and passions.And like Gainax gave this some kickass animation, yeah that too. isn\'t always pretty and often shows people that have gone too far in their fandom to the point of detriment.

They’re the guys that made Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, FLCL, Panty and Stocking among many others. What is most interesting about them however is their connection to Otaku and one particular project of their’s: the original video animation (OVA) Otaku No Video.Gainax and Otaku:Before we get into Otaku No Video, let’s go over some context.Now what is an Otaku? For most people in the western world, it just means ‘anime fan’ however in Japan is has more negative connotations. It’s supposed to refer to someone who’s not only a fan but has seemingly devoted their entire lifestyle...to a certain obsession or hobby, usually pop culture.Gainax was founded by Otaku. These guys in university with their sketchy grades and little to no experience in animation decided to lock themselves in a small Osaka apartment and attempt to make anime (among other things). With makeshift tools and animation cels they, got their start making animated shorts for the convention Daikon III.It was one the first times a Studio came about from a sort of indie grassroots origins and it’s something Gainax seemed to have kept with them through their life. Shows like Evangelion, Gurren Lagann and even their spiritual successor Studio Trigger’s shows like Kill la Kill and SSSS.Gridman show the classic joys of otaku fandom like giant tokusatsu mechs, over the top explosions and lots of fanservice.They’ve even tackled more cynical aspects of the lifestyle. Particularly with Gainax co-founder Hideki Anno and his later works like End of Evangelion and MEMEME which featured direct criticisms of the otaku lifestyle inspired by Anno’s disillusionment with Otaku and how he had fell into depression during the making of Evangelion as a result.I bring this up because Otaku No Video directed by Takeshi Mori is one of their earliest projects and is explicitly about the studio’s otaku roots. It’s a spoof all about being an otaku and the culture that created Gainax.The Otaku’s Journey:Otaku No Video is split into two sections more or less. The animated section revolves around Kubo, your average university student, on the tennis club, has a cute girlfriend but also kind of board, until one day he discovers the otaku circle of the University. Cosplaying in the fairs, selling doujinshi, recording all and all shows on VHS, he is slowly enveloped into their ranks.Keep in mind this was made in the late 80s to early 90s where there was no internet, big franchises like Naruto, One Piece and Pokémon didn’t exist and shows about specifically catering to and staring the otaku demographic weren’t common. The otaku fandom was even smaller and more underground than it is today when nerd culture (especially in the west) is far more accepted in the mainstream. This creates a feel of these guys being a niche group that really only have each other.The otaku Group at least at first does almost feel like a goofy cult with how they induct Kubo into their ranks but at the same time, they’re shown to be very warm and welcoming, and their comradery feels real. That’s what nice about this OVA, it truly feels like it presents both the best and the worst of otaku. We see Kubo’s life take quite a downturn since becoming an otaku. He gains weight, he’s not grooming himself very well and eventually his girlfriend dumps him, but he finds more excitement in the world of anime and tokusatsu than he did before and it’s hard not to feel a but happy with just how passionate these nerds are about their hobbies. As someone who has led an anime society at Uni and found some life-long friends through it, it’s hard not to feel a little warm and nostalgic watching these weebs.I also like the plot point where Kubo is even able to find success making model figures only for a larger corporation to swoop in and take over his company and demote him from power, basically gutting his business from the inside, a sadly common practice in a lot of media industries. Thankfully he’s able to start again but it makes a solid point. On one hand otaku are weirdos stuck in their own little world that in can be easy to take advantage of but they’re also mostly good people looking for likeminded individuals to share their hobby with and having success and despair along the way.The Otaku’s Portrait:The other section is called ‘Portrait of an Otaku’ which has live action interviews with real Otaku and some facts about them. What interesting about this section is a westerner it can be surprising to learn just how much nuance there is to otaku lifestyles.The video does show a few of a more typical idea of an otaku; NEETs with no friends who spend all day watching anime but also less typical like a tape collector that spends his time recording anything he finds cool on TV and trading them with others. There’s also a military Otaku who likes to collect air-soft guns and role play in the forest but upon being asked if he would ever want to shoot someone with a real gun looked dumbfounded, saying he never considered it and just thinks they look cool. There’s even a weaboo. A westerner that speaks little Japanese yet decided to sell all his things, move to Japan and devote his life to collecting Japanese pop culture memorabilia (oh how some things haven’t changed).The one I found the strangest though was an otaku who made a living infiltrating anime studio and stealing animation cels to sell on a kind of otaku black market. Apparently, the security at these studios was so low, the turnover rate so high that you could just walk in, pretend to be an employee and go off with them. Hopefully, security has improved in the 30 years since this was made.Final Thesis about Otaku No Video:Otaku no Video is an odd little thesis. I never realised just how many ways there were to being an otaku. It’s easy to see geek culture as just sad men in their mother’s basements both what I think both the animated and live action sections show otaku in a darkly humorous but respectful manner. It shows otaku for who they are; weird and some of them have pretty obvious mental health problems, but others are happy with their lives and just enjoying their hobbies, regardless of what the mainstream think of them. It’s a fascinating insight into the old school Otaku lifestyle from the eyes of people that were part of it.I’d say it’s worth a watch for all anime weebs at least once. Think of it as learning more about your origins, the good and the bad of it. to a certain obsession or hobby, usually pop culture.Gainax was founded by Otaku.

I usually do not like older anime as much, but this one changed my mind. I really liked how it made fun of otaku stereotypes, and it explained parts of otaku culture that I did not even know existed (soldier otakus). The audio was all right, but I was watching it for a free con, so you kinda get what you expect. I enjoyed the story, even though it sometimes went a little too quickly. The art gave me a huge nostalgic feeling which I just adored. I actually really got into the...character's lives pretty quickly, even though they were not in the anime too much. Overall, if you want to watch an anime that makes fun of anime and otaku culture, this is the one for you. I think many shows try to pull off what Otaku no Video did, but it is really difficult to make a comparison. character's lives pretty quickly, even though they were not in the anime too much.

The animation tells a rather uninteresting story of 2 otaku who build up this giant otaku empire.. or something. I honestly didn't care much for the animation bit. It was constantly interrupted by the live action segment (which was much more interesting)- consequently messing up the pacing and making it hard to connect to either the plot or characters. The fictitious story emits strong themes regarding otaku and their personalities but ultimately seems to serve little purpose. I would have rated the OVA higher if it did not include...the animation bits.The interesting part of this OVA are the live action interview segments. Otaku come in many forms: some obsessed with guns, some obsessed with anime. The live action segment interviews a variety of the different otaku that exist and very obviously pushes a message given the type of questions asked. Some of the questions are personal and dive into the (lack of) romantic life of the otaku- but regardless it was interesting to see the perspective of otaku first hand. While I have seen similar interviews online- the people presented in these live action clips seem depressingly more genuine than the otaku I've seen interviewed prior, and I would have rather just watched a series of interviews in this format than watched through this OVA.It's difficult for me to say I dislike the OVA. I would not recommend it as I feel a lot of the OVA is unnecessarily boring and repetitive. It was interesting to watch and learn about Otaku culture- but due to lack of entertainment I give this show an average rating of a 5/10. the animation bits.The interesting part of this OVA are the live action interview segments.

I grew up during the 2000s, so this wasn't the experience I had with anime, but anime only started coming to the US in the 80s, and not in one piece if you know what I mean. Nowadays, we take anime and what it can offer us for granted, but back when you couldn't access it as easily as we could now, anime used to...be this mysterious, awesome, amazing thing that anyone who didn't actively seek it out couldn't access. Liking anime and manga was a hobby most people didn't understand or appreciate back in those days, and even now, there's still a big of a stigma against anime fans. But if you love something and aren't hurting anyone with it, then what's the big deal? Such is the subject of today's review, a little two episode OVA called Otaku no Video.Beginning in the year 1982, Ken Kubo, the main character of this OVA, is a college student who has a nice life. He's participating in his college's tennis team and has a nice girlfriend. One day, he runs into an old friend of his from school, Tanaka, who frequently hangs out with anime fans and enthusiastic hobbyists. Kubo decides to reconnect with Tanaka and get to know his circle of friends better. Soon, he finds himself more and more drawn into anime as a hobby, to the point where he quits tennis and starts to let himself go a bit, which causes his girlfriend to break up with him. Eventually, Ken decides to fully immerse himself in the world of anime, and starts to see why Tanaka likes it so much. And thus begins Ken's journey to become the ultimate otaku, or as he calls it, the Otaking.Now, for modern fans, Otaku no Video might come off as a product of its time, because many of its pop culture references are solely on stuff that came out during the 80s, like Urusei Yatsura, the original Gundam, Captain Harlock, Macross, Nausicaa, Minky Momo, and so on. People who grew up during that time period will recognize those references immediately, but modern fans nowadays won't be able to figure them out unless they've seen those shows or have some passing knowledge of them. That knowledge isn't necessarily needed to understand what's going on, but it's a fun little bonus for those who do. But whether you grew up during the eighties or not, the OVA still manages to really capture what it means to be a fan of something and the absolute joy one gets from being able to share those hobbies with like-minded friends. Of course, the anime isn't afraid to show the downsides of it as well, showing the stigma anime fans receive due to untrue stereotypes and how some fans take their passions too far. There are live-action segments spliced into the anime called Portrait of an Otaku, which are said to be interviews with actual otaku and showing how being one affects them, both good and bad...though those segments are actually staged, parody mockumentaries with Gainax employees playing made-up characters as a way to make fun of both the stereotyped portrayals of otaku and themselves, with Hideaki Anno in particular playing the part of an otaku who loves Noriko from GunBuster. Considering Gainax was originally started up by a group of anime fans, that says a lot.On the technical side of things, the animation is pretty good for something that came out in the early 90s. The character designs are distinct, the actual animation and movement is fairly good, the backgrounds are well drawn, and the animators really did their best not only to pack in as many references to actual anime as possible, but even replicate them down to their finest details. Although I did notice some characters' body parts were a bit off model at times. On the other hand, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing on all fronts. The opening song in particular is catchy, fun, and has no right to be as awesome as it is for an anime like this, and the soundtrack itself...I can only think of one word for it: energetic. From the eighties synthesizers to the saxophones, flutes, trumpets, and full orchestras, the soundtrack is just brimming with life, and every single piece of background music slaps so hard it's not even funny.The show is only two episodes long, both about 45 minutes long, less if you decide to skip the Portrait of an Otaku segments. Because of this, the characters don't have a lot of time to really develop or be fleshed out, or do more than they're shown here. That being said, I found the characters to be fine. Nothing groundbreaking, but they serve their roles pretty well, Ken in particular is a cool dude, and we do see the main characters change and grow as a result of the decisions they make throughout the OVA. Otaku no Video really goes out of its way to show how being an otaku can effect people, both for better and for worse by showing how Ken deals with both the happiness he gets from connecting with these new friends and the discrimination he faces from people who only see otaku as overgrown manchildren who live in their parents' basements. I do kind of wish some characters got more screen time and development, such as the new girlfriend Ken gets in the second episode.All of this now begs the question: What makes Otaku no Video special to begin with? It sounds like just a goofy slice-of-life anime. For one, Gainax, the company that animated this, was also made up of anime fans, so you could argue that Otaku no Video is the story of Gainax themselves and how they managed to succeed in fulfilling their dreams...that is until it all went to shit in the future, but that's neither here nor there. Another part of it could be its parodic, light-hearted satire of otaku culture in general that wasn't afraid to poke fun at itself every now and again. But I think the reason it continues to be revered as a great starting anime in general is because of its accepting attitude towards people who love their hobbies. Otaku no Video shows that being an otaku is not easy, but that there's nothing inherently wrong with being interested in things most others aren't, and if other people have a problem with it, screw them, they're likely not worth listening to anyway. Granted, nerd culture is becoming more and more accepted in the 2010s and 2020s, though it still has a long way to go, so Otaku no Video's message might be considered a cliche at this point, but since it's still very well liked even to this day, I think it's safe to say that it's influence isn't going to diminish any time soon. It helps that it's pretty easy to own on DVD and Blu-Ray now, though you'll have better luck ordering it on AnimEigo's website. It's also available to stream on the website RetroCrush if you don't want to pay for it.While it may be considered dated nowadays, Otaku no Video is a must-watch anime for people who want to embrace nerd culture and appreciate it for what it has to offer. be this mysterious, awesome, amazing thing that anyone who didn't actively seek it out couldn't access.

It helps that it's pretty easy to own on DVD and Blu-Ray now, though you'll have better luck ordering it on AnimEigo's website. It's also available to stream on the website RetroCrush if you don't want to pay for it.While it may be considered dated nowadays, Otaku no Video is a must-watch anime for people who want to embrace nerd culture and appreciate it for what it has to offer."", ""Otaku No Video glorifies and celebrates (even as it lovingly skewers) the lives of people into anime, manga, model kits, replica guns, and science fiction. Supposedly an over-the-top, exaggerated biography of Gainax (the ultimate otaku's studio) themselves, this OVA is loaded with references to Macross, Gundam, Lupin, Yamato, Gainax's own works, and more.To compare to other movies and shows, it's a little bit Project A-Ko, a little bit NHK No Youkoso (though not so dark at all), and dare I say its modern counterpart might be Lucky Star? It caters shamelessly to fans and asks nothing from outsiders, and it's a ton of fun...for anyone who wants to witness the roots of Gainax, or see just how obsessive some people can be. for anyone who wants to witness the roots of Gainax, or see just how obsessive some people can be."", 'Part introduction to the world of otaku and part self-fulfilment otaku wet dream power fantasy, Otaku no Video is charming on both fronts.Having documentary-style video clips interspered amongst the entirety of the film really added to that charm, as did the relatively-lightning fast pacing of the second half for the main plot.But of course, as charming as many of the aspects are, all infused with the signature passion and self-aware voice of Gainax (lots and lots of Trigger tropes that took the weeb world by storm in the 10s are very present here), it does feel middling at times due to the fact that it\'s...trying to appeal to two extremely different audiences, necessarily, two opposite ends of a spectrum: anime noobies and anime vets.But despite that stretched out feeling of duality, Otaku no Video still succeeds (and at times, utterly triumphs) solely due to that aforementioned Gainax passion.It\'s a love letter to anime and to its boom during the 80s golden age.

And for that reason, you might expect that Otaku no Video, an anime by Gainax about the founding of an anime studio, whose name conveniently abbreviates to GX, who go on to reach an unparalleled level of financial success, to be nothing more than an exercise in self-indulgence and navel-gazing. Instead, what you get is a highly insightful look on otaku culture, identity, and the perception of otaku by both themselves and others. Through its metanalysis, it treats the subject of otaku with far more sophistication than any NHK documentary on the...subject could hope to.Otaku no Video is composed of two stories which it switches between fairly regularly, somewhat analogous to a typical A and B-plot, but with far less in the way of concrete storytelling for the B-plot. Another point to note is that, with each transition, there is a brief intertitle giving the date along with the news of the day, which gives it a sense of place in history and time, helping further Otaku no Video’s position as a true product of the 80s and early 90s, something furthered by its visual design.The main story focuses on Kubo, a successful college student and tennis player, who while passionate about the sport, doesn’t feel like his enthusiasm is matched by the rest of his clubmates, and after encountering a group of otaku, finds himself engrossed in their culture, eventually vowing to make his own model kit and anime studio, so he can become the ‘Otaking’. Ambition is critical, Dylan Thomas said so, but Kubo’s ambitions are really something to behold, which certainly helps keep the story constantly moving, allowing the viewer to see GX go from two guys in an apartment to getting the tallest skyscraper in Tokyo. It is grandiose, but never unbelievable, in part because of their sense of pacing, never focusing too much on one specific aspect of the company, as it is continually growing, a sense that is furthered by the effective use of montage throughout. If there’s one thing that this part of Otaku no Video absolutely nails, it is authenticity, helped in part because of the iconography from actual contemporary anime. and Otaku no Video certainly has plenty of atmosphere, which it creates through iconography and historical aesthetics.The second part of the story consists of a series of live-action news style interviews called ‘Portraits of Otaku’. Herein, various types of otaku (e.g. anime, computer programming, military), discuss their hobbies, with their faces and voices censored for extra shame, as an unseen and unheard narrator asks them loaded questions that get progressively more blatant with their contempt. Gainax must have thought they were really clever by breaking the fourth wall by flashing the question “do you have any friends?” onscreen, for some caricature of an anime fan to answer on my behalf. As an example of a pseudo-documentary, it is certainly well made, providing a depiction not just of how easily the media can mislead the public, but otaku themselves – there is historical precedent to suggest that there was actually very little in the way of a uniform otaku identity until other people started calling them by that word. Perhaps most critically, the last of these live-action sequences shows a group of interviewers chasing an otaku late at night, with the narrator informing the viewer that they had been watching this person for weeks. The entire scene is certainly evocative of celebrity stalkers, and it also begs the question – are news organisations running story after story on otaku culture (as they did in the aftermath of the Otaku Murderer’s arrest) that different from otaku themselves with their obsessive interest in a specific subject?However, the most critical part of these interviews to acknowledge is that these are not actually news segments, the people watching these interviews are not, to indulge in stereotype, the older generation who look down on otaku. This is an anime after all, so it’s otaku themselves who will be watching, and seeing how other people see them. In all its aspects, Otaku no Video is a work of fantasy, the anime segment wherein Kubo becomes the Otaking and conquers the world is a clear-cut fantasy, and the interviews act as a mirror and a two-way fantasy. It is a fantasy for people outside otaku culture, to reaffirm their beliefs that otaku are weird, and a fantasy for otaku themselves to be part of a counterculture that is being attacked by society at large, and as with any fantasy, both these narrow-minded beliefs are entirely fictitious.Otaku no Video is intelligently written, it understands otaku, and it also understands their contemporary perception. It is an exemplary piece of metacommentary, it understands the implications and significance of a construction of an otaku identity, and it challenges the viewer to observe otaku, and likely themselves, in a critical manner. Slavoj Zizek might have said that one of the issues in constructing fantasy is that the viewer will see the object of fantasy or desire, but cannot see themselves in the act of seeing.

Put simply, it is an insightful love letter to otaku culture in general, especially as it was in the 80s and 90s, complete with lengthy live action segments amounting to scripted interviews meant to convey the essence of what it means to be an otaku. There really is nothing else like it, and it is something that could have only been made by Gainax. Beginning with the story, which is the strongest aspect of this anime for its unique story structure alone, presents us with two simultaneous...tracks. First, the story of how a regular guy, unfulfilled by his tennis hobby, gets into otaku culture, despite being intimidated by its seemingly impenetrable oddities. Second, a series of documentary-style live action interviews with otaku of varying types and degrees, presented in a style which is meant to be realistic and believable, all the while being fictional in nature- they're completely scripted scenes featuring Gainax employees and friends of the studio in the place of the otaku interviewees. Nonetheless, these little snippets convey a lighthearted and intriguing look into the culture at the time, and moreso its perception of itself and the stereotypes which surround and often define it. Both these halves of the story get a lot crazier in the second episode. Also, while the first storyline is fun, it is the live-action interviews which, when paired with the anime itself, make the whole thing something unique and special. Even the silliest moments reveal something interesting about what it was like to be a hardcore anime fan back then, and that is valuable on the face of it, beyond its initial value as an entertaining curiosity. The art is good, showcasing that classic Gainax style, but there isn't anything in this department which really sets it apart from their other work. The sound design is particularly strong, with a fun, energetic ost and characteristic, highly emotional voice work. The characters are another pillar of the show, as they feel like they're the primary drivers of the story, exhibiting depth and agency, which is impressive considering they're so crowded out by the live interview sections. Of the anime cast, my favorites are by far the protagonist Kubo and his close friend, Tanaka. Kubo is idealistic, hardheaded, and determined to follow his passions regardless of the social cost, which is an admirable quality, and Tanaka is a genuine enthusiast, serving as a pillar around which his friends congregate as those who share in a common passion. Of the live interviewees, Shon Hernandez is by far my favorite, both for the topics he chooses to focus on and the hilarious contrast between what he's actually saying in English and what the Japanese narration and subs say. Overall, Otaku no Video is a fascinating and engaging piece, and I believe it is an essential cornerstone of one's otaku education. tracks.

As was intended by Gainax founders, Anno and many others. Otaku no Video is a documentary. The story is non-existent, unless you were to ignore the real-life interview segments and only focus on the animated parts, then you\'d have a simple story of young man loses focus in life and goes on to become the OTAKING! However, that\'s not the point of Otaku no Video. The focus is on the negative connotations of being an Otaku. Only showing, the...bad and the worst. From one degenerate behavior to another. It should be known that Otaku by definition just means being an enthusiast for a particular thing/interest. Hence you have anime otaku, game otaku, gun otaku, and so on.

Animated fictional account of a fan\'s ascent/descent into otakudom mixed with live action segments in a documentary style.  The only thing that drags it down is those live segments.

They’re *still* playing Cruel Angel’s Thesis at half the Pachinko parlors in Ikebukuro).This OVA was aimed squarely at people like me and my wife. It is no understatement to say that it changed our lives when we first watched it in 1999, brand new Otaku, to whom all...of the references went over our head. We were Kubo.The show inspired us not only to become “Otaku no naka no Otaku”, amassing a collection that makes the folks in the interviews look like pikers, but to create our own circle of friends much like the ones in the show.

Now, one of our bigger series is being shopped around Hollywood by an agent, and a screenwriter has expressed interest in adapting. Who know?

Re: Cutie Honey,https://myanimelist.net/anime/151/Re__Cutie_Honey,"['As a heterosexual female, I have no interest in fanservice geared towards males; they can enjoy it as much as they want but I&rsquo;d certainly prefer not to see bouncing breasts at every turn when I watch anime. I find it even more irritating when fanboys insist that the latest fanservice-laden series is really deep and meaningful when you look past the D-cups. So when I downloaded a little OVA known as Re: Cutie (or Cutey) Honey, I wondered what I was thinking. Sure, the original 1973 anime series more or less created the modern-day magical girl, but this OVA is a much more recent...&ndash; not to mention shortened -- retelling of the original. Could such a remake really be anywhere near as enjoyable as the original must have been to have so much influence? The answer, as I quickly discovered, was yes, yes, yes! Re: Cutie Honey is everything I&rsquo;ve come to expect from one of my favorite genres, but with its own unique twist.That said, though, the uniqueness isn&rsquo;t apparent in the basic story. While Honey herself brings a few neat elements to the table (more on that later), the storyline itself is pretty standard magical girl fare. Honey can transform into a scantily-clad warrior who fights for love and justice, and she does so to battle the mysterious forces of evil that have come to her city, eventually making it to the leader, who of course has some connection to her. The worst part of the plot is that this story has been used in every magical girl series ever. That said, it&rsquo;s still told well, and since the series totals to a little over two hours, it&rsquo;s also told more quickly than usual; those who shy away from magical girls because of the filler that&rsquo;s usually to be found, fear not! Another nice bonus to this typical plot is that it keeps the series from turning into completely over-the-top comedy-slash-fanservice fest. It&rsquo;s also important to note that Re: Cutie Honey is completely self-contained and requires neither prior knowledge of the franchise nor watching another series to understand. Neat!It&rsquo;s fair to say that characters are vital in setting a clich&eacute; story apart from the crowd, and Re: Cutey Honey knows exactally how to do that. Honey, despite being the idol of rabid fanboys everywhere, is one of the coolest magical girls you&rsquo;ll ever see. She&rsquo;s smart, she&rsquo;s strong, she&rsquo;s cool, she can take care of herself, and she&rsquo;s not afraid to be sexy. Because of the latter aspect of her personality, then, the fanservice elements of the series are significantly less intrusive than those of other series; Honey would rather kick butt while half-naked than panic and scream when her clothes get ripped off. As for other characters, the only truly significant one is Aki, a police officer that will stop at nothing to capture Honey at first but eventually becomes her closest friend. It&rsquo;s a pretty predictable way for her to develop, but she&rsquo;s still a lot of fun to watch bounce off (literally and not) of Honey; honestly, it&rsquo;s one of the best parts of the series.Meanwhile, Re: Cutie Honey&rsquo;s music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The opening theme song, used in some variety for every Cutie Honey series to date, is a peppy J-pop tune that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. This is not an exaggeration, by the way. The ending song, meanwhile, is cute but more forgettable. The background music, however, is top-notch; while it has been accurately compared to that of His and Her Circumstances, that&rsquo;s in the best possible way. The happy scenes in particularly have BGM that&rsquo;s both appropriate for the scene and well-composed on its own merit. Overall, the music, while not perfect, is in general a blast to listen to. The same can be said for the art, perhaps to an even greater degree. No matter what you look for in a good character design &ndash; cute, sexy, or just unique and stylish &ndash; Re: Cutie Honey has it in its characters. The most impressive element of the art, however, is the animation: loose, fun, and with perfect flow; it&rsquo;s perfect for such a fun OVA.And in the end, that&rsquo;s what Re: Cutie Honey is: a lot of fun. Despite having a serious overlaying plot and good character development, almost every minute of every episode is packed with action and energy, and it rarely gets dull. It&rsquo;s hard to find a series with more relentless energy. It might not be what you might expect from a short magical girl OVA, but this one&rsquo;s special in that it&rsquo;s more focused on making you laugh and just have a good time than anything else, and that&rsquo;s what really makes it special. Even the large amounts of fanservice don&rsquo;t distract from this: if you&rsquo;re not interested in topless girls, it&rsquo;s easy to look at the silly excuses for fanservice as just that: silly. I for, one was not bothered by it at all &ndash; I just looked at it as another of the series&rsquo; unique elements. If you&rsquo;re looking for a quick, easy to watch anime series that won&rsquo;t ask anything of you but to enjoy it, look no further than Re: Cutie Honey. &ndash; not to mention shortened -- retelling of the original.

It&rsquo;s also important to note that Re: Cutie Honey is completely self-contained and requires neither prior knowledge of the franchise nor watching another series to understand. Neat!It&rsquo;s fair to say that characters are vital in setting a clich&eacute; story apart from the crowd, and Re: Cutey Honey knows exactally how to do that. Honey, despite being the idol of rabid fanboys everywhere, is one of the coolest magical girls you&rsquo;ll ever see. She&rsquo;s smart, she&rsquo;s strong, she&rsquo;s cool, she can take care of herself, and she&rsquo;s not afraid to be sexy. Because of the latter aspect of her personality, then, the fanservice elements of the series are significantly less intrusive than those of other series; Honey would rather kick butt while half-naked than panic and scream when her clothes get ripped off. As for other characters, the only truly significant one is Aki, a police officer that will stop at nothing to capture Honey at first but eventually becomes her closest friend. It&rsquo;s a pretty predictable way for her to develop, but she&rsquo;s still a lot of fun to watch bounce off (literally and not) of Honey; honestly, it&rsquo;s one of the best parts of the series.Meanwhile, Re: Cutie Honey&rsquo;s music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The opening theme song, used in some variety for every Cutie Honey series to date, is a peppy J-pop tune that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. This is not an exaggeration, by the way. The ending song, meanwhile, is cute but more forgettable. The background music, however, is top-notch; while it has been accurately compared to that of His and Her Circumstances, that&rsquo;s in the best possible way. The happy scenes in particularly have BGM that&rsquo;s both appropriate for the scene and well-composed on its own merit. Overall, the music, while not perfect, is in general a blast to listen to. The same can be said for the art, perhaps to an even greater degree. No matter what you look for in a good character design &ndash; cute, sexy, or just unique and stylish &ndash; Re: Cutie Honey has it in its characters. The most impressive element of the art, however, is the animation: loose, fun, and with perfect flow; it&rsquo;s perfect for such a fun OVA.And in the end, that&rsquo;s what Re: Cutie Honey is: a lot of fun. Despite having a serious overlaying plot and good character development, almost every minute of every episode is packed with action and energy, and it rarely gets dull. It&rsquo;s hard to find a series with more relentless energy. It might not be what you might expect from a short magical girl OVA, but this one&rsquo;s special in that it&rsquo;s more focused on making you laugh and just have a good time than anything else, and that&rsquo;s what really makes it special. Even the large amounts of fanservice don&rsquo;t distract from this: if you&rsquo;re not interested in topless girls, it&rsquo;s easy to look at the silly excuses for fanservice as just that: silly. I for, one was not bothered by it at all &ndash; I just looked at it as another of the series&rsquo; unique elements. If you&rsquo;re looking for a quick, easy to watch anime series that won&rsquo;t ask anything of you but to enjoy it, look no further than Re: Cutie Honey.', 'Re: Cutie Honey was good. That\'s all you need to know. Go watch it. What, that\'s not enough for you? You need to know things about it? Alright, time to get a review going.Story (8/10)The most impressive thing about this show\'s story is that all three episodes manage to be wildly different while still telling the same story.The first episode is a regular Imaishi action comedy romp. The blueprints for Kill la Kill are very apparent, and while this series doesn\'t develop the great visual sense and character dynamics that later series did, it still hits a lot of the same excitement.The second episode,...on the other hand, is a regular superhero drama. It\'s the typical story of the hero who tries to do her best, but gets blamed for the trouble villains cause. While it\'s a really common story these days, it had a lot of hold considering the more carefree episode before it. Another huge thread in this episode was society\'s treatment of women. As funny as that sounds to talk about in an ecchi anime, the second episode did a lot to capture how Honey and her peers weren\'t being appreciated.The third episode is the one that was directed by Hideaki Anno. The apocalyptic imagery and themes of isolation you\'d expect are very much present. I thought the script was kind of iffy though, and would have liked it to have followed up on the themes in episode 2.But what really strikes me about the story is that while I can go on about how the three episodes\' scenarios are different, the characters have one united story. Natsuki and Honey\'s dynamic is always sharp and adorable, Seiji is always an amusing witty sidekick, and Kyoko always brings a smile to your face. And that\'s what the story was for me. These four people coming together to fight this enemy, and not the convoluted specifics of where this enemy came from.Art (7/10)It\'s Gainax, so of course it\'s gonna look good. The first episode in particular is a standout display of colors, as expected from Imaishi. The next two aren\'t as visually stunning, sadly, but the series stays good looking enough you won\'t especially miss it.Sound (6/10)The OP is excellent, and the slowed down instrumental version that plays throughout the show is especially my jam. I felt there were some places the soundtrack felt bland or repetitive, but it was a fair track.Character (7/10)Are the characters deep? No. Are the characters fun and relatable? Yes. Honey is a ray of sunshine, and the day to day troubles she faces make her quite sympathetic. Natsuki is an excellent foil for her: strict, independent, and confident. Seiji, as I said before, is great if you enjoy the ""smug smartass"" character type (see Ryoji Kaji, Aikuro Mikisugi). There\'s nothing profound or original about these characters\' depths, but if you like them they easily make the show worthwhile on their own.Enjoyment (9/10)This was exactly the pick-me-up I needed. Short show with only three episodes. Great action, great music, great design, some interesting themes, and like I\'ve made clear, adorable characters.Not sure how to be ""objective"" about enjoyment, but if you\'re here to have fun and you love subtle yuri (we\'re talking a couple inches above the Euphonium level), give this show a try.Overall (8/10)This isn\'t the score I have on my list. That\'s because there\'s a lot of shows I think are ""Outstanding"" (10), but I don\'t think all ""Outstanding"" shows are equal. I don\'t think all ""Great""(9) shows are equal either.But even if it\'s not in my favorites, I do think Re:Cutie Honey is a really good show.

The 1973 series and the 1994 follow-up, Shin Cutey Honey, are are wonderful. (I have yet to see Cutey Honey F as it\'s not subbed fully) If you have no seen them I suggest watching them before watching this. The Gainax interpretation of the character isn\'t terrible, but it\'s the worst one I\'ve seen sadly.The animation is zany and loose. Ranging from very clean with fantastic backgrounds to Honey looking like a noodle flopping around. It\'s honestly annoying how ugly is looks sometimes. I understand this was a style choice, but it wasn\'t the right direction for Honey.The action...is a step down too. While the cast of characters Honey faces has more build than any before, battles themselves are still uninteresting. They also lack blood. Couple this with the strange animation and lazy ""clothes rip off"" cliche and battles are very disappointing. To be clear I don\'t mind the clothes ripping off stuff, but it just seemed lazy here.So yes, there is nudity everywhere. More so than ever before. So if you like that than you\'re good. Of course there is a ton of fan service with some lesbian overtones.Unlike most people I find the first episode the worst and than things get better as it goes along. However, it never really becomes great. The entire show seems like a parody of Cutey Honey. I do not dislike this show. In fact it\'s quite good. I just prefer the other interpretations of the Cutey Honey character. I recommend those first.Also to note, this anime is based on a live action Cutey Honey movie. I have not seen it.

Not the worst I have seen, but nothing too memorable either.AnimationThe animation is well done, with a rather unique ""western comic book"" style. Action sequences and special effects look very good, and naked chicks are never wrong either.SoundThe intro song fits well with the ""western"" theme (it doesn\'t sound as japanese as most of the intro songs out there) and was very (edit: VERY) likable by my standards.Background music and sound effects are also nice and fitting. Voice acting is ok, nothing outstanding and nothing horrible....StoryBad story. The plot is obviously just an excuse for animating naked chicks fighting with super-powers. The plot twists are very cliché, but I suppose the whole OAV is supposed to be a parody of all the epic stuff out there, so it\'s not entirelly bad.CharacterThere are not a lot of characters in this short series, and none of them is very interesting. The hardened female cop and the childish Honey complement each other nicely, though.The bad guys (or girls) are funny sometimes, but the main reason for them being there is tearing the clothes off Honey. A task in which they succeed very well, I might add.ValueI watched this for the sole reason of it being so short, and it was... well, cute. Nothing I\'ll watch again though.

If you recognize his animation and directing style from FLCL's fifth episode, Gurren Lagann, Dead Leaves, Panty & Stocking and Kill la Kill, you already know what you're in for. His characters don't animate the _most_, but they animate in creative, exaggerated and really funny ways. Combined with the peppy soundtrack, the abstract backgrounds and the comedic tone, they make up a 1-hour romp of Cutie Honey beating up on villains while losing all her clothes.The remaining two episodes aren't nearly as good. The second one is animated like a regular cheap TV show, while the...third one abandons the light tone in favor of a more serious conclusion. After the first episode, you will want to see the conclusion to the story because episode 1 was so good. But it's a bit of a waste of time.I can still heartily recommend the first episode, which I've rewatched many times. It's fun, it's funny, and it feels like it goes by in the blink of an eye. I appreciate it even more after Kill la Kill - Imaishi's stuff is usually best when it's short and sweet, a big burst of enjoyable energy.

That is all you really needed to know. As a reboot, this works fine, but as an adaptation? Not really, some of the changes really bother if you read the original manga, only a few transformations from the og for Cutie appear and Natsuko changed way too much, but it is still enjoyable.Anyway, watch it. the feeling you’re watching an entire different anime, they’re not that bad, but it plays like a low-budget mahou shoujo and the third episode might be Hideaki Anno’s weakest direction, because the anime could have a really good last episode to redeem episode 2 (it dragged on too much), however, it only was a huge Evangelion reference.As for the ecchi, theres a lot , I kinda dislike it, but its a Go Nagai work after all, don’t let the ecchi stop you from watching this, there’s also Yuri, that I also disapprove, but only in a few scenes, the way it was implemented felt forced, it was a bad choice in the end.

Sexy over the top action that is similar to Kill La Kill and Panty and Stocking and influence those shows. Is an anime made by Gainax and it shows.Story: The story is mainly  Honey fighting the Black Panther with the female detective trying to capture Honey as they form a ""friendy"" relationship.

My main interest in this OVA stems from it being a Gainax production with the involvement of Hiroyuki Imaishi and Hideaki Anno. I also will be lightly spoiling aspects of the live action tie in film, which was also directed by Anno.Re: Cutie Honey is based on a 1970s manga series by Go Nagai and this OVA is very emblematic of that retro aesthetic. I will not fill this review with...needless anime history trivia, but the works of Go Nagai are highly influential to modern anime, although his works are usually seen as trashy and/or edgy. Cutie Honey is one of the first magical girls in the vein of Sailor Moon, although many aspects of her character would be considered dated by today\'s standards.This OVA has the animation quality on the level of Gainax\'s Diebuster, but the character design and attitude of retro 70s anime. It\'s gratuitous in its use of BDSM themes and nudity and it\'s obvious to see the influence this OVA had on Imaishi\'s later works such as Kill La Kill and Panty and Stocking. However, given the OVA format, this anime can get away with the main character being fully naked for a majority of the runtime. This anime is not for puritans for sure, but it doesn\'t reach the levels of offensiveness like the aforementioned Panty and Stocking. My only complaint about this episode relates to the live action version of Cutie Honey, which is basically a retelling of this first episode beat for beat, even though the ending fight is resolved in the exact same way as the climax of the live action version. I believe it\'s best to discuss this OVA episode by episode given how each part of this anime is stylistically based upon it\'s respective episode director.Imaishi directed the first episode, and it\'s the best episode in this 3 part OVA by far. It\'s the relentless action and chaotic horny slapstick in the ""poorly animated but also really well animated"" aesthetic that you would come to expect from Imaishi\'s other works, closely resembling his previous OVA, Dead Leaves. This first episode never lets up for a moment, it\'s easily the most engaging segment of the OVA. If you only watch one episode of this series, watch this one, especially if you like Imaishi\'s other anime series.The second episode was by a Gainax director I was not very familiar with, Itou Naoyuki. Apparently, he\'s involved with the Overlord anime series, which appears to be a generic anime TV production, and the same can be said for this episode. This episode loses all the dynamic early 2000s Gainax energy and focuses on character drama, involving Cutie\'s destructive nature while fighting agents of Panther Claw. I\'m sure if someone wrote a review of this anime while Man of Steel was relevant, they\'d claim that Cutie Honey addressed the issue of ""superheroes destroying an entire city to kill the villain"" better than that movie did, but I digress. It\'s an okay episode overall, but definitely the weakest of the 3. The highlight of the episode by far was the yuri fanservice scene at the end.Hideaki Anno, who needs no introduction, directed the last episode in the series. Most of the perverted slapstick humor featured in the first two episodes is less prevalent, as the OVA shifts into full Neon Genesis Evangelion territory. To best describe this episode, it basically recreates End of Evangelion within the context of Cutie Honey. It\'s the best directed out of all the episodes even though it\'s basically a 45 minute long Neon Genesis Evangelion reference, but it\'s entertaining none the less. It is difficult to take the psychological themes of NGE within the context of an ecchi magical girl/tokusatsu hero anime that features a naked heroine with bouncing fat tits, but it\'s what I would expect from the master, Hideaki Anno. If anything, this episode made me want to revisit NGE again.Overall, I would recommend Re: Cutie Honey. It\'s not the best output by Gainax but it\'s easily one of their most underrated productions. If you are interested in seeing the lineage of iconic early 2010s Gainax and Trigger anime, this is a must watch, alongside Diebuster. needless anime history trivia, but the works of Go Nagai are highly influential to modern anime, although his works are usually seen as trashy and/or edgy.

Episode 1 was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, most known for his directorial work with Studio Trigger, for example Gurren Lagaan, Kill La Kill and most recently Cyberpunk Edgerunners. Episode 2 was directed by Naoyuki Ito, who went on to direct Overlord and other Madhouse anime. But most importantly, episode 3 was directed by Hideaki Anno, the director...of the Evangelion franchise. With three of the industry’s big names involved in the visual presentation aspect of this anime, you can tell that these OVAs are going to be a feast for the eyes.The plot however is less noteworthy, consisting mostly of the cartoony evil bad guys terrorizing a town that our superhero Cutie Honey has to save. The first two episodes are mostly filled with ecchi jokes and cool battles, although entertaining, lack much substance. That’s until the third episode which since directed by Hideaki Anno, explores themes of isolation and identity which may come off as pretentious considering the tone of the previous two episodes.The characters are colorful and lively and do undergo character development throughout the OVAs. Most of all, they’re a lot of fun, as they’re charismatic and have some human elements which increase their relatability. Overall, the characters aren’t amazing but they’re much better than you’d expect from a fanservice action OVA series.That brings me to the next point: the fanservice. These OVAs are filled with it, from skimpy character designs to characters losing clothes in battle, and there’s even some yuri scenes in there for the yuri fans. However, unlike most anime, this show handles fanservice very well. The pace of the storyline and action is never hindered by it and isn’t used to dehumanize the female characters; rather, it empowers them. Of course, those who don’t like ecchi will still not enjoy it. Nevertheless, people like me, who don’t mind when fanservice is used artistically, will appreciate how it’s never overdone and how it never interferes with the pacing or clashes with the tone.To sum it all up, Re: Cutie Honey stands out as a highly memorable OVA series, thanks to its accomplished directorial team and its high-octane, stylized action paired with tasteful fanservice. With only three episodes, it’s not much of a time investment. So, if what I described above appeals to you, I fully recommend giving this anime a try.Final Scorings:Animation: 10/10 (Artistic)Sound: 8/10 (Great soundtrack and VA work)Story: 6/10 (Episodic rule of cool mostly with some theme exploration in episode 3)Character: 9/10 (Sexy and Well-built)Value: 9/10 (Classic, inspired Kill La Kill)Enjoyment: 9/10 (Short and fun)Overall: 8.5/10 of the Evangelion franchise.

These OVAs are filled with it, from skimpy character designs to characters losing clothes in battle, and there’s even some yuri scenes in there for the yuri fans. However, unlike most anime, this show handles fanservice very well. The pace of the storyline and action is never hindered by it and isn’t used to dehumanize the female characters; rather, it empowers them. Of course, those who don’t like ecchi will still not enjoy it. Nevertheless, people like me, who don’t mind when fanservice is used artistically, will appreciate how it’s never overdone and how it never interferes with the pacing or clashes with the tone.To sum it all up, Re: Cutie Honey stands out as a highly memorable OVA series, thanks to its accomplished directorial team and its high-octane, stylized action paired with tasteful fanservice. With only three episodes, it’s not much of a time investment. So, if what I described above appeals to you, I fully recommend giving this anime a try.Final Scorings:Animation: 10/10 (Artistic)Sound: 8/10 (Great soundtrack and VA work)Story: 6/10 (Episodic rule of cool mostly with some theme exploration in episode 3)Character: 9/10 (Sexy and Well-built)Value: 9/10 (Classic, inspired Kill La Kill)Enjoyment: 9/10 (Short and fun)Overall: 8.5/10']"
Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Shin Kyoto-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11441/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Shin_Kyoto-hen,"[""Rurouni Kenshin has always been one of my favorite shonen anime.  When I heard that there was a new anime project coming up, I was excited because I thought that perhaps we would get the Jinchuu arc from the manga animated, since it has never gotten a proper adaptation. More news came by in the coming months and it transpired that the project was simply a movie retelling of the Kyoto arc; this by itself already represented a wasted opportunity, since that part of the story has already been adapted faithfully in the first anime, so there really should not be any reason for...this to exist in the first place. But that didn't mean it had to be awful. Having now watched the first part of it however, I can say that that the worst has come true.The original story of Rurouken was very good (especially by shounen standards). However, it was obvious that due to the small runtime of the two ova's, much of the story would have to be condensed and as such the it might stand to lose some emotional impact due to not having enough time to give the proper scenes their due. Unfortunately this issue has struck this movie very hard. The pacing of the OVA is very fast, and it doesn't cover the story very well at all because of it. Everything feels incredibly rushed, almost like I'm watching a recap of something that already happened. There were also some changes to the plot besides simply condensing it, most of which are harmless, but there is one particularly egregious example which is the battle between Kenshin and Chou. I won't spoil it, but the way this OVA  plays out ruins the entire point of the fight and what happens afterwards.The animation is incredibly bland. Nothing really stands out and it just feels serviceable at best. It seems as if DEEN didn't pour a lot of money into this or the animators just didn't care that much. The character designs are alright, but they could be a lot better. This wouldn't be as much of a problem, except that you can't help but compare it to the old series, which had a far superior budget and/or just people who cared more, so it just comes off as worse.The one aspect of the OVA that is possibly good is the music...but this doesn't really mean much, because the melodies are just different renditions of music from the old series. While the compositions themselves are good, the arrangements in the movie are inferior to the original renditions, because they're simplified and lose a lot of their energy and substance.Overall, I'm not sure what exactly the point of this OVA being made was, and who it's supposed to cater to. As someone who is already familiar with Rurouken and has watched the old series, this did nothing for me whatsoever. I don't care to watch a bland, condensed, glorified recap episode of the Kyoto arc when I can just watch the original tv series, which was infinitely superior. This OVA will do nothing for people unfamiliar with the series, because it doesn't do a good job of introducing the characters and the events prior to the Kyoto arc, so anyone new won't have any emotional investment in what's going on, they'll just be confused.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this even to diehard fans of the series. It just doesn't give you anything and feels like a waste of time and effort on part of the studio, which didn't even make the effort to do something good with the source material. This is a blatant cash-in as far as blatant cash-ins go. this to exist in the first place. But that didn't mean it had to be awful.

What else would you expect from a two hour retelling that attempted to cover 27 episodes of the original series?  That\'s not to say, however, that the OVAs are entirely without merit.ARTThe environments are strikingly beautiful. The characters are modernized: cleaner and redesigned to better suit the current aesthetic, but unfortunately look washed out and unfinished when set against the detail of the backgrounds.  Cinematography is done very well; the usage of color and light, particularly contrasting Kenshin\'s meetings with Misao and Shishio, is a nice touch.Animation was hit...and miss. Where the TV show would use light and sound to indicate a superhuman move being performed, Cage of Flames impresses with full animations; noteworthy in Kenshin’s confrontation with Misao and battle with Chou. The fights in Song of the Light, however, lack the impact of those in the series. (Saitou’s evaluation fight with Kenshin comes to mind.) An argument can be made for the finesse of Kenshin vs Soujiro’s shukuchi duel, but the gatotsu and the futae no kiwami just don’t have the same raw explosiveness.MUSICThe soundtrack is still excellent. While the renditions lack their predecessor’s quaint appeal, they are more intricate in timbre and more “cinematic.” Familiar themes are used accordingly and don’t fail to accentuate the mood of a scene or remind us that this is indeed Rurouni Kenshin. Just don’t expect something as amazing as Tsuiokuhen’s OST.STORY *SPOILERS*Much of the gag humor and lightheartedness of the series was omitted in favor of a serious tone that accurately reflects the gravity of the arc. Studio Deen was aware of the age of the RuroKen fanbase, and thus had no qualms about showing the brutal reality of the fights and Shishio’s world; things that were implied and understood but not displayed by the series. This is where Cage of Flames truly shows its potential, setting all the scenes for conflict, building tension, and acknowledging all the right events from the original anime.As if discouraged by the nostalgia-biased criticism of OVA1, the staff seemed to give up in Song of the Light. Sloppy animation aside, every character seems deflated. Both writing and delivery are unnatural given how little the development of their camaraderie is depicted. (I did like the more mature Misao, though; more convincing for the role of Okashira.) Aoshi and Shishio, obviously keeping their desire to strike in check in the first OVA, never demonstrate that catharsis, wasting all the anticipation.As for how everything plays out... The absence of so many things (and members of the Juppongatana) completely overshadows the version of the story they attempt to tell.Kenshin and Sanosuke never meet up; Sano is instead exclusively partnered with Saitou.Sano’s parallelism with Anji is not explained.Hiko’s arrival at the Aoiya is far less grand, because Yahiko never proves himself against Henya or demonstrates his impressive spirit.Soujiro’s internal struggle to reconcile Kenshin’s and Shishio’s philosophies is barely there.Saitou does not show his loyalty to Aku Soku Zan & police fighting Usui.In fact all the duels that are glossed over don’t take place in Mt. Hiei, even though it was shown in Cage of Flames.  I can go on, but the greatest wtf of the OVA and absolutely unforgivable omission is that Kenshin never uses his ougi…every major fight is won handily and anticlimactically. The conclusion of Watsuki’s Kyoto Arc is fundamentally altered and weakened.*One thing did pique my interest: Saitou didn’t disappear in the blaze; he escapes with Soujirou. What might happen should the prodigy be taken under the wolf’s wing?And so our heroes return (heroes being Kenshin and Aoshi, wtf happened to Sanosuke?) While Studio Deen apparently forgot how to make shounen/seinen fights epic, they do reunions passably well. (Kaoru finding Kenshin in OVA1, Misao welcoming Aoshi back.)TL;DR Longtime fans of RK, Cage of Flames is worth checking out. Song of the Light is a waste of the va’s reprising their roles. Newcomers, don’t bother, watch the series, but feel free to stop before the Christian Knights and FengShui >_> and miss.

Lousy!?These fights are not re-mastered, they are lazy - highly uneventful, though nothing can really happen to be honest as they\'re trying to stick to what is cannon, there is pretty much no re-master scenes, it\'s almost fairl to say their is no fight scene; it\'s a redux in animation with the actual \'action\' being cut out of fast tracked - it\'s as if we\'re getting a 4Kids cencored version of what we saw previously.The lack of lack of deatil in the movement and character design in general screems \'low budget\' - which takes me to the art.Art...Rurouni Kenshin is classed as an \'older\' anime, the art style back then appeared to focused heavily on as many regions of fine detail possible.After watching this OVA, I appreciate the old art style even more now!The art style in this OVA is what you see in many anime\'s today - very 2D looking basic sketches with little enthesis on; body proportions, facial features and shading; highly unfluid in movement; at times, just a still face-and-body forward figure with a moving mouth - like a cardboard cut-out.Everyone pretty much looks the same - as if three nude character designs where illustrated and the entire cast was created simply by \'re-colouring\' them. The characters have lost their individuality - all the girls are \'pretty\', with virtually the same undetailed, almost vaccant, dazed face that lacks a hint of character - for example, we have Shishio\'s girlfriend Yumi - originally, she\'s pretty enough but has a bit of a \'harsh\' look to her, now, she has a softer look and even appears to have a smaller (more feminien).Basically, they have conformed to modern anime art - some detail in the eyes, but nothing else, which is fine with modern anime and would be fine if this is how things looked in the first place, but compare the before and after - this is a downgrade and a half!Sound...The backing music is nothing special, either is the ending track - they just fit, so make of that what you will. ;)The characters voices sound fine.Characters...Like a poor fanfic - the personality is absent with the cast in this OVA.Remember back to how they all behaved at the time in the anime:KenshinWas - quite positive and approachable yet was on a serious journey, basically, a non nonscence character who wasn\'t cold.Now - vaccant, not \'mean\' vaccant, but just \'dazed straight faced\' vaccant.MisaoWas - high energy, naive, mouthy teen girl with a goal.Now - fairly sensible and quite.KaoruWas - a tsundere who was pretty stroppy, somewhat grown up but selfishly idealistic.Now - sensible sweet girl in love who takes what\'s going on in her stride.YahikoWas - an energetic pre-teen who could do with keeping is gob shut at times.now - fairly sensible, only a little mouthy.Basically, everyone has taken a \'chill pill\'; they have been all sculpted into \'insert\' characters and the Mary Sue versions of themselves - someone who has never seen the anime tuning into this wouldn\'t know anything about their personalities; something the anime manages to put forward in virtually any and every appearance a character makes; no matter how small.Enjoyment...All I have listed above tells me that production are simply heavily reliant on suporters of the series getting excited at some new* material coming out whilst ignoring the content which little to no effort has been applied to.This OVA is just like a poor fanfic that occurs during cannon times, inwhich the author has copied and pasted the some of the ep\' description and synced it into their work to cut corners, whilst they have no intention of bringing anything original to the table.Almost enjoyment really. :(Overall...Waste of time, no matter what your expectations and preferances are - this is pretty much a very mellowed out re-cap. erasing the tear, yet making the book look worst?""The latter option applies to this OVA!Story...This relies on filling in cracks which wheren\'t really there, just to prove something has been done - a lot like throwing an additional, unnessessary 200 adjectives into your well written story just so you can say ""the story is longer then before"" and give off the illusion of finer detail, when accutally, the oly thing your doing is dragging the thing out.The OVA occurs during a very popular and importiant part of the story us viewers all know well, but we don\'t particullarly follow our main, this time, we \'alledgedly\' see the story threw the eye\'s of temporary sidekick at the time Misao - really, we don\'t - Misao is simply a window for the first time viewer who\'s just watching to see what happens next, there isn\'t too much narrative from her and she\'s almost completely out of character.Throw the above into the mix with this - there is no particular main character!The story consists of the characters we know doing what we know they were doing/capiable of at the time, we see pretty much just as much of Misao\'s viewpoint as we do of:- Kaoru and Yahiko on a fairly insignificant leg of their journey in pursuit of Kenshin (such as riding on a boat, which they\'d obviously do, walking threw the woods taliking about nothing particularly importiant and doing chores whilst freeloading with Hiko - all of their events are uneventful and receive roughtly less then a minute in screentime)- Shishio getting challenged by nobodies (who within the series liked the guy? we knew he was strong, so what chances are these saps going to stand, and don\'t expect a fight scene)- Kenshin in re-cycled scenes (fight scenes that have been edited into a significantly less violent, short burst of energy)On that final point^, I\'ll move onto the scenes... ???

Second thing, I noticed that people were disgusted with the OVAS because of difference between the original and this one\'s, but I don\'t see it like that since this are, again, OVAS, not the remake of the arc or anything else but a great scale ensemble of the Kyoto arc events within another more dramatical point of view and story, that personally love it.Ok, here I go:STORY: 8/10I rate the story as very good because,...though it isn\'t the same as the original story and have some discrepancies, I perceive it as a more dramatic close up than the real story was, and certainly was something I enjoy.

The background music in this OVAS was simple but in the part when you find a fight, that music guide you through those scenes amazingly.CHARACTER: 6/10Ok, they were ok, I mean, the whole thing was extra dramatic and showed us a deeper image of the characters as they wouldn\'t manifest in the main series and I like it but due to the time, we also lose part of the personalities from all. AND *spoiler alert*, there was something I really really disliked, at the last part Kenshin may leave the Rengoku without even caring about the others, ie Yumi, Soujiro or Saitou nor the tripulants, this also applies to that last blow to Shishio, leaving all the ""not to kill, save all the lifes you can"" philosophy go down the drain... really not like Himura.ENJOYMENT: 9/10Watching OVAS of a show you thought was lost and remembering all the funny and incredible adventures with that sense of ""grown up"" made me feel happy.

One thing I’d advise before ever picking this title up is be sure you watched the original Rurouni Kenshin series prior. If you don’t you might be completely undone before you get to some of the juicier bits of this two part series. For everyone whose unaware of the story surrounding the New Kyoto Arc in Kenshin these films(?) are hard to follow and don’t convey enough of what made the original run of the arc so satisfying.Now I’m not going to waste time arguing...what was done better in the original versus this adaptation, I’ll just get straight to it, it’s fast. The beginning of this series plunges you into the action of the story (with exposition, oh boy) and doesn’t really take its time to explain why the characters are all jumbled around, why Kenshin abandoned his friends, whose dead, whose not and that’s because it had to sum up the 30+ episodes that made up Rurouni Kenshin’s major arc in (give or take) 90 minutes. The soundtrack captures our wandering spirit (with a tinge of that sweet violin) just like the good ol’ Kenshin and Studio Deen’s fight choreography is great when Shishio and Kenshin finally get to have it out in [undisclosed location to avoid spoilers this time], so watch it for that even if it’s brief (the other fights are good too). Like any good fight scene though, context is necessary to drive emotions home and these films(?) don’t have time to provide context. Or at least not enough to make everything that’s happening feel justified.Who am I recommending this to? People who watched (and/or loved) Rurouni Kenshin, because they’re the only ones who’ll get the whole picture.

What I meant by both unnecessary and unwanted I mean by how they went about with this adaptation and where they decided to start it at. The best and cheapest way to get something off the ground again is to do a movie right? Only if the series had great fandom for it at it\'s time, Rurouni Kenshin is still to this day very well loved by many if not all of the anime fandom, and the decision to start it off as a movie just disappoints when it\'s obvious a much bigger and grander way of doing it would be a better way to go, I mean a new tv series (Dragonball Kai, Hunter X Hunter and even FMA Brotherhood were all successful in some way or another).And where they decided to start it off is just confusing, I mean of all of the story arcs in Rurouni Kenshin, the Kyoto arc is practicably time less, a flawless shonen epic that even the original anime adaptation is superb and doesn\'t need to be retold by messing with the story.The new rebirth is simply that, a un-need retelling of the arc that everyone was completely fine with. I know I\'m going on a bit with the whole ""LEAVE IT ALONE!"" bit, but be honest, wouldn\'t you have felt this way if let\'s say Berserk was getting a movie rebirth that was ultimately a long summary... Ha... Bad example.But yeah, this movie feels like you\'re watching a rather short summary of the Kyoto arc, shortening down about half of the entire arc into 45 minutes. And shortening down is probably the lenient way to put it. Especially with the fight scenes, they\'re all, yes every one of them, are unsatisfying (For example, the fight between Kenshin and Soujiro fight is literally done in seconds) coupled with extremely brief plot points (Like Kenshin looking for a swordsmith to repair his sword, it goes by so damn fast it\'ll be nothing more than an after thought).But not to worry, the one thing this movie also sets out to do is to put the focus on Misao, the spunky ninja girl who I believe inspired Final Fantasy characters like Yuffie and Rikku. Of all of the characters to switch focus on, why not someone with a little more importance than Misao? Why not Saito or even Yahiko? But despite the claim to have Misao\'s point of view expressed, Kenshin still gets front and center attention, heck Saito even gets to waste about 5 minutes interrogating Chou (Which funny thing to mention, Chou gets more sceen time than Sanosuke, heck his training scenes are all skipped right over). What Misao ends up doing is talking to a bird or stalking/following Kenshin around, with I\'m actually happy for this decision at least as it to is shorten down to a few minutes.And of course I need to mention Shishio, do really doesn\'t do too much except apparently killing Usui, the blind guy who is supposed to fight Saito later on in the Kyoto arc, when Shishio was getting some tail. Okay, I mean Shishio is a dog, but getting some like that is a bit much, especially since this movie is based on a manga that ran in weekly shonen jump.Now I\'m not trying to say this is a bad anything, but what I\'m trying to say is that the attempts the change things up don\'t work, especially with you\'re trying to character to be placed in a leading position when her old position was originally intended to a support character, yet the movie doesn\'t even meet it\'s claims of what it was at first said to be doing. The movie is a summary, not a bad summary or not a completely bad one at least, but a summary to a story that the intended audience already knows and love.ANIMATION: It\'s all fine and detailed and great overall. However, like with the ovas before this, this adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin decides to go the more realistic direction, and I say: Why? Rurouni always looked best when it is done in Nobuhiro Watsuki\'s original style, and this movie decides to ditch it. And for me, it really messes with the fight scenes greatly as Kenshin himself looks serious all the time in this movie, and his expression doesn\'t change like how it does in the anime and manga, and personally, seeing Kenshin in all bloodlust mode from his usual goofy persona make him more of an engaging character to me.SOUND: While the voice acting is good (Though I can never get used to Kenshin Japanese voice), the music reminds me of the background music from the tv series, which is cool. The ending theme song however is quite possibly the best thing this movie has to offer.OVERALL:The Good:+ The ending theme song is great.The Mixed:+/- The animation is great. / The animation continues the strange trend of having Rurouni Kenshin look more unnecessarily realistic when the original style is the way to go.The Bad:- The movie is more of a summary or a recap than it is a new story, or in it\'s case, a remake.- Fight scenes are way too brief for a shonen series adaptation.- Fails at forcing a spot light role to a character who is really more suited for a supportive role.- An ultimately unnecessary and unwanted adaptation of an arc that no one felt it was necessary to remake.The first part ends right before Kenshin goes off to train with his master, and if this remake plans to include Misao in places she isn\'t needed in, then prepare for her to witness Kenshin vs Shishio, the speed run version!

However, it is much more than that. Yes, the interactions between the characters are hilarious and they will get you to laugh every time. However, the true genius behind this show is its strong ""parody"" element.The plot of this anime involves many different girls invading ""Apartment 106"" (the Rokujouma), a place in which our main character, Koutarou, lives. For one reason or another, everyone seems to have great affection for this particular building (Koutarou because it is extremely cheap to rent). Thus, the characters are...locked in a never-ending conflict against each other, always duking it out to see who can lay claim to the apartment. Truth be told however, their resolve isn\'t that great; all of the girls end up befriending Koutarou and each other, and by the end of the anime, they all live together in harmony. So if we have a plot that doesn\'t exactly pan out how it was supposed to, what is there left in Rokujouma no Shinryakusha? The characters, the characters, the characters.Every last one of the girls were created to mock the various stereotypical anime character archetypes. Two of the biggest parody characters are the cosplaying Mahou Shoujo and the tsundere mage.  Does the tsundere mage (Theia) not totally scream Louise from Zero no Tsukaima? Her entire character seemed like a shoutout to pettankos everywhere, and how seemingly ridiculous their tsundere personalties are. Then there\'s Yurika (cosplayer), who just cannot seem to convince those around her that she\'s an actual Mahou Shoujo. Instead, everyone writes her off as just another girl in ""that"" phase, never really taking her seriously. In a similar vein to Theia, Yurika\'s character was used as an absolute jab against Mahou Shoujo anime of all sorts.Then we have the ubiquitous Senpai, damsel in distress, and ""daughter of a magnate"" characters. The main character, Koutarou, is in love with his senpai Sakuraba, who happens to love him as well. However, the two of them are never able to profess their feelings to each other (gee, where else have we seen THIS situation before...) Another girl who is in love with him (ghost girl Sanae), seems to not be able to do anything without Koutarou. In fact, she can\'t even eat without him; he needs to allow her to ""possess"" him in order for her to intake food. Then there\'s Kiriha, who is probably the most mellow of all the girls. However, it is later discovered in the anime that she is the daughter of an incredibly powerful man, and he is the reason why she has to invade the Rokujouma. Instead of listening to her father, the princess runs away and leaves her past, opting to live with her friends instead. (Rich girl refusing to listen to her pre-ordained fate, anyone?)As can be seen, I could talk about the characters for days. They are simply that lovable, and that\'s what sets Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!? apart from most other harem anime.

It’s really sad to see it overshadowed by cliche, nonsensical, and fan service reliant harem shows. You want a good harem show? It’s right in front of you.Rokujoma (how I’ll refer to show) follows Koutarou Satomi and his life with 7 girls, 5 of them want his apartment. You’re probably thinking, “Okay, what’s so special about the show?”Well, unlike most harems, it doesn’t use fan-service for cheap laughs. It literally had almost no fan-service. A harem that doesn’t have an ecchi tag is as rare as a protagonist who isn’t oblivious. There was a beach...episode, but even that wasn’t filler. It actually contributed to the plot. Anyways, the comedy is consistent. The gags never get old and the new jokes are refreshing and funny. This shows holds a special place in my heart for not resorting to anime falls and boob grabs.The overall plot is arguably the weakest part of the anime. I've read the light novel, so I didn't have any problems understanding anything, but for someone who is only an anime-viewer, it feels like everything is all over the place. One moment, a villain is introduced, who has some sort of connection with one of the main characters, and then the next moment another villain appears for another main character, so it's pretty easy to be left in a daze. However, at the very least, the plot isn't just used as an excuse to show shameless fan-service or how OP the protagonist is. The plot, for the most part, is reasonable and logical. It just wasn't organized/formatted in the best way. In short, the story is definitely engaging and entertaining, but is a bit hard to follow and understand.How the romance is approached is one of the show’s greatest qualities. All the girls don’t just suddenly fall in love with the protagonist 3 episodes in. In fact, in the end, out of the 7 girls, really only one of them has fully acknowledged that they like the main protagonist. The romance doesn’t go at some abnormal pace. Their feelings for the protagonist actually feel authentic. They see his good qualities, but they’re not crazy for him. They simply understand he’s a good guy and one of the best friends you can ever have. When the romance progresses into something more, then it was worth the wait, because you got to see legitimate reasons as to why the girls fell in love with Koutarou.The show also has a nice slice of life feel to it. You get to see their school life and what they’re like at home. It’s certainly delightful to have a calm and serene atmosphere in the stead of exaggerated and melodramatic drama.I don’t have much to say about the art and sound. I highly doubt you’ll have a problem with the art. The heroines are cute and the scenery is nice.As for the sound, the op and ed are upbeat and catchy. They both have a friendly feel to it. I don’t think I’ve ever skipped the opening. The voice actors are amazing; the voices of the characters are perfect.The characters are all lovable. They’re not the most unique and realistic characters, but none of them reek generic or one-dimensional. The heroines have back-stories to add depth to their character and they don’t completely abuse any tropes. Koutarou is a great main protagonist. He’s not the standard spineless super nice male lead. He’s kind, but has his own interests too. Not to mention, he has a back bone. He doesn't let himself get stepped all over. He's got pride , something a lot of protagonists lack.The cast is nothing short of adorable. The way they act and their relationships with one another are hilarious, but endearing.Rokujouma is what a harem show should be; Good comedy that doesn't utilize fan service, romance that feels genuine, relaxing slice of life moments, and one of the most likable casts you will ever see. Give it a shot and you'll see why I'm so disappointed that it's barely talked about. episode, but even that wasn’t filler. It actually contributed to the plot. Anyways, the comedy is consistent. The gags never get old and the new jokes are refreshing and funny. This shows holds a special place in my heart for not resorting to anime falls and boob grabs.The overall plot is arguably the weakest part of the anime. I've read the light novel, so I didn't have any problems understanding anything, but for someone who is only an anime-viewer, it feels like everything is all over the place. One moment, a villain is introduced, who has some sort of connection with one of the main characters, and then the next moment another villain appears for another main character, so it's pretty easy to be left in a daze. However, at the very least, the plot isn't just used as an excuse to show shameless fan-service or how OP the protagonist is. The plot, for the most part, is reasonable and logical.

So why not instead of girls going after a male harem lead, we make the entire cast go after something else instead?Oh I don\'t know, maybe a cheap apartment unit filled with PLOT DEVICES?New Meta.No one has ever done that before in the history of harem animes.Why make an anime to pander to a certain audience when you can pander to every single harem fan? The anime is a culmination of genres from all across the harem spectrum....It has magic, supernatural, science fiction, all fit into one convenient dorm room at the price of 5000 yen a month.However, while at first glance ""Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?"" may seem like an innocent entry to our beloved genre but as I dig deeper it seems the anime depicts important aspects that resonates within our modern societies.The series begins with Kotaro Satomi, another independent spirit high schooler whom went out of his way to live on his own. He found a really cheap room in a dorm where he could call a home and made haste to secure his newly found independence. But little did he know with his new independence lies foreign interests, with an invasion in mind for their personal gain. Right of the bat we could see that the road to a secure and peaceful life is not an easy one. Despite already acquiring the dorm unit legally, Kotaro Satomi is challenged by foreign invaders whom claim their right to the room and do not acknowledge this process simply because they had personal interest at stake. These girls have a common motivation.They all wanted the D. The Dorm room to be exact.So let\'s take a look at all these interests at stake here.We begin with Sanae Higashihongan, a ghost girl. She depicts claims that historical rights precedes any other form of contract. Being the longest ""unliving"" tenant, her claim to the dorm room was because ""she was there first."" A simple claim many would be familiar with in our modern society when discussing land settlements. Nevertheless, she has proven that she could integrate with her new host, both benefiting from a mutually beneficial partnership.Yurika Nijino is a magical girl. Often confused for a cosplayer, she represent the unfavourable view some hobbies are observed by certain part of society. Despite being made the comic relief and joke amongst the cast, she is undoubtedly one of the strongest, being able to avert crisis many times in the series. With this power she sees the responsibility of securing the dorm room which is a good source of PLOT DEVICE. Being a clutz, Yurika projects an image that even a powerful entity is not immune from ridicule and mistakes.Kiriha Kurano is a descendant of the Earth People. Her story depicts a civilization that at one point was blessed with great accomplishment but was forced to move underground for unknown reasons. Her people wanting to once again regain their glory days was split between two camps. Kiriha was a moderate aiming for a peaceful integration of their societies whereas the other significant following was leaning more towards terrorism. Nothing less than a violent invasion would satisfy them even at the cost of innocent lives.Theiamillis Gre Fortorthe is an intergalactic alien princess. She depicts a spoiled generation blessed with the technological advances her predecessors passed down. She has little regard to moderation and often risk blowing thing out of proportion. The lack of an adult figure present in her life could be a contributing factor as she was left in the care of her babysitter, Ruth, who is her voice of reason. Theia symbolises adult negligence and her moral code was shaped by media she observed for example the Blue Knight fairytale that she is engrossed with. Her need to conquer the dorm room was established by her predecessor as a test and her relentlessness was a symbol of a generation that needs to constantly proof themselves.Ruthkhania Nye Pardomshiha is Theia\'s certified babysitter. She depicts my irrational fear of beetles. Yeap that\'s pretty much it.Then there\'s also other characters whom have no interest in the dorm room.Harumi Sakuraba is a senior and president of the knitting club whom Kotaro Satomi is a part of. She depicts the sweeping craze that is plaguing our young minds in this era known as ""Senpai Please Notice Me"" Kotaro Satomi is constantly trying to win her affection but unwitting created a distance between them as her acts very reserved around her, comparatively with the other girls.Shizuka Kasagi, the landlady whom is the driving force behind the establishment of the Corona Convention. The convention of course is merely for show as such with many treaties in history. Despite being a strong figure established for peaceful resolutions, her indecisiveness to actually solve who owns the dorm room had subsequently caused many other proxy wars to take place, much to the despair of her own self. (Much like a certain world organization)While initially leading me to believe that this anime was going to be about the tenants fighting it out in games and political manoeuvring to gain ownership of the dorm as shown in the second episode. Eventually it just became a slice of not your usual life where the girls try to curry favour with Kotaro because they all knew he was the rightful owner of the room and because screw metas, we\'re going back to male harem lead.I take no issue with the art style as I did enjoy the variety of special effects each associated with the specific theme. Animation was done up to the current industry standards so I have no problem with that as well. Music wise to be fair, I know how the anime industry love recycling their soundtracks but I was expecting with the different themes involved, each female character would actually get some kind of distinctive character soundtrack. The opening song is somewhat catchy but not one that would stick in your head for a while.While I did enjoy the series, I was expecting more from a title that was ambitious enough to combined a huge diversity of themes as their female cast. Each girl was given about two episodes for their arc which of course fell short to actually provide a real insight into their personality, probably just a tease for viewers to actually pick up the light novel. But then again, I might be expecting too much out of the harem genre. Overall, the diversity is a nice change in pace. The lack of harem cast overbearingness is a step in the right direction. The little twist at the end was a gentle slap to my face for forgetting something happened in the first episode which I cast aside due to the escalation of female invaders. So give it a try, draw your own conclusions on what this anime is about or take it at face value for what it is. It has magic, supernatural, science fiction, all fit into one convenient dorm room at the price of 5000 yen a month.However, while at first glance ""Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?"" may seem like an innocent entry to our beloved genre but as I dig deeper it seems the anime depicts important aspects that resonates within our modern societies.The series begins with Kotaro Satomi, another independent spirit high schooler whom went out of his way to live on his own.

After watching, I guess my intuition was right.Story: 8/10An anime which has a magic girl, a shrine maid, a ghost and a noble girl for its main characters, I have never seen something like this before. The story is based mostly around the 4 parties and them trying to 'invade' the apartment room, which is for some reason, special to them. The story is also divided into stories about each main character.Now,...if you think you're going to expect a lot of action scenes because of that, well you're wrong. The anime is mostly towards a funny, romance-y route. A bonus to that is the it's a harem. The harem and ecchi isn't overdone, unlike other anime which only use fan-service to make the anime much more popular. The comedy side was nicely done and thank god there are no falling and grabbing boobs and getting slapped. The action part of the anime is actually quite ok. Most of the action is around Koutarou, and his mind-blowing 'skills'.Art: 9/10I don't know why, but whenever I look at the art of the anime, I instantly think that it will be a comedy+romance or maybe an action+romance. It's probably just me. The art is very nice, the colors weren't dull. The animation is also very nice, such as Korama and Kurama when they move.Sound: 8/10The OST fits each scene, whether the scene is funny or serious. It isn't overplayed or unnecessary. The OP is very catchy and fits the happy theme of the anime. The ED is very calm but it doesn't quite fit the anime. It's more for a drama genre, though it doesn't bother me that much.Character: 10/10Wow, a 10/10 for character? No bitchy, annoying characters in this anime? Surprisingly, for a harem anime, yes.Satomi Koutarou, the main protagonist of a harem anime. He's very caring and always tries to make everyone happy, if he has done something wrong to them. Though, for a harem anime he is just a bit dense on the people around him.Higashihongan Sanae, the cute girl ghost that lives in the apartment room. She is very cheerful around Koutarou, though she is a ghost and can't taste food without her possessing Koutarou.Fortorthe Theiamillia Gre (who has a name like this?!?!), the noble girl who is very smart in script-writing. She works really hard to try to make things successful. She sometimes gets angry with Koutarou, but not in a mean way (if that made sense).Kurano Kiriha, the shrine maiden who is very elegant and good at cooking. She is very helpful to Koutarou, like helping him in tough situations. She tries to do things very peacefully, even if the things she do have to be harmful to others.And lastly, probably my favorite female character in the anime,Nijino Yurika, the clumsy magical girl who really likes to eat food and can be outstanding, in her on way. She is very mindful of others, though people won't believe on the crazy things she say. The facial expressions and her sometimes just chomping on food in the background is probably the funniest thing in the anime.Enjoyment: 10/10This anime was funny and also had a good story. This anime was so interesting that I watched through it in one sitting.Overall: 9/10If you're looking for a unique story with unique and funny characters, then this anime is for you. Would I re-watch it? YAS c: if you think you're going to expect a lot of action scenes because of that, well you're wrong. The anime is mostly towards a funny, romance-y route.

Would I re-watch it? YAS c:"", 'Ok, lets just cut to the chase, what do we have in here? Well, is nothing more than your usual harem type anime, where everything and anything in it was all about the harem, nothing more and nothing less, so I\'m just gonna present my ratings the way it is:Story, enjoyment and overall: Mediocre 5.The title of the anime is ""Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?"" I can\'t help by notice Takehaya san\'s misused of the punctuation like the question mark and exclamation point , well I guess them Japs have a lot to learn about its proper usage, but enough of that, there isn\'t any story at...all and its plot was simply too shallow to say the least, which something that one would commonly find in any anime with a harem genre, I gave it a 5 co\'z there is no denying that it just another anime with such genre where guy has a lot of girls and doesn\'t know what to do with them, so should I explain more? I don\'t think so since it was pretty obvious. My enjoyment for this anime only stems from the moe that every guys likes about them girls as to who would the guy should be with, so overall there is really nothing to elaborate on something that was the usual, plain and simple.Art and character: Good 7.I can never understand as to why every character should have a cow lick- that is, if that\'s what those strands of hair hanging out on the sides of every female character we see, now I don\'t if that\'s illustrator  Tomosane Ariike\'s style or something he just put for the heck of it, but it was really cute, so a 7 it is for this anime\'s art. Now, for the character, I\'m giving it a 7 co\'z I like the female character\'s in this anime, most especially, Yurika Nijino who is the quintessential bimbo, Sanae, the usual clingy girl (I know she is a ghost), Kiriha Kurano the usual buxom girl,  Harumi Sakuraba the potential wife material and Ruthkhania Nye Pardomshiha who is the usual on the side girl, but not so with  Theiamillis Gre Fortorthe whom despite being the quintessential  tsundere is someone I like to hate, now I kinda feel bad for Shizuka Kasagi as a support character, she basically has the potential to be part of the harem however writer  Takehaya san , doesn\'t think so, so, even though I like them female characters, they were the usual I can only limit it to a 7.Sound: Decent 4.Since I don\'t have much to say about it, but I can\'t help but notice that  Kiriha Kurano\'s seiyuu,  Masumi Tazawa, seemly has a mature voice that doesn\'t fit a typical character who is suppose to be a teenager. all and its plot was simply too shallow to say the least, which something that one would commonly find in any anime with a harem genre, I gave it a 5 co\'z there is no denying that it just another anime with such genre where guy has a lot of girls and doesn\'t know what to do with them, so should I explain more?

There are five girls who NEED this one room for their own personal reasons and it's just a harem of bullshit. At best it was a cute anime. There were battle scenes that took place just by coincidence and everyone's friendship came together to help the person in trouble every time.  At one point, an antagonist went to talk to a high-council type group to exact revenge on room 106 (or whatever it was) and we never heard from them again.  The story was rushed to get through all girls' storylines and it was just generally too much. "", 'Rokujouma no Shinryakusha is a classic example of ""Don\'t judge a book with its cover"" and in the anime with its first episode. Rokujouma no Shinryakusha stands as an odd one in the world of harem anime in a really fab way.If you\'re looking for something different from hackneyed harem this one is for you!The central character of this anime is actually not a character, it\'s a Rokujouma (a small apartment) around which the whole story revolves. The protagonist is your usual high-school guy looking for a cheap stay in the city. His life takes a complimentary turn when the apartment he rents...turns out to be haunted, targeted by aliens, a shrine of earth god and a place for evil-cute magical girls to gather their powers. Yup, all that at once; sounds pretty bad right ? Indeed I had zero hope from this anime, the first episode wasn\'t only perplexing but also a bit equivocal to where the anime would head. Yet I gave this one a second try and I am glad I did, the twists in the story oh lord from the beginning to the very end the story keeps building stronger and stronger. From the encounter of Ghost hunters to the battle \'Earth People\' this anime has it all though cheesy a lot of time, this story is definitely worth a listen.Tl;dr : Fun plot twists, great story, worth a listen.Other than your usual useless protagonist, Satomi Kotarou, who actually turns out to be not so useless. This anime has all of those characters you encounter in a harem: the tsundere, the clingy one (literally clingy this time), the airhead one, the one who adds -sama behind your name and the one with big boobs. Oh did I mention, they are also alien, ghost, sailor moon and um some other aliens. Rokujouma no Shinryakusha has gathered all those elements of the harem and has done it right. Especially the fan-favorite Mahou Shojo Rainbow Yurika who is no doubt the cutest anime character of Summer 2014.Also there is that one character who turns Super Saiyan every time she is aroused (not in a weird way).Tl;dr : Awesome characters; ghost, aliens, earth people, mahou shojo and the character I don\'t want to spoil about the sweet loving very normal knitting club member.Pros :+ Harem done right+ Wide variety of characters+ Surprisingly good action+ This anime just feels too goodCons :- Bad first impression- The feel good part gets a bit cheesy sometimes..- Leaves with a lot of unanswered questions turns out to be haunted, targeted by aliens, a shrine of earth god and a place for evil-cute magical girls to gather their powers.

This show literally feels like a cross between ""Kore wa Zombie desu ka?"" and ""Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin"".Warning though: For those that are not a big fan of Harem-like shows...this may not be for you.Story (7 of 10): Surprisingly,...the story seems rather straightforward and blunt. A boy named Koutarou moves into an apartment that he later discovers is haunted by a girl named Sanae. Within the next night various characters make their appearance either by flying through a window and ramming headfirst into a wall or using other various methods of entry. As more and more girls appear, what was a peaceful life for Koutarou turns into a free-for-all over Kou\'s living space. I\'m not saying this is a great story as there are a few dull points. However this beats some of the harem-like shows in terms of story.Art (8 of 10): From an animator perspective, I haven\'t seen any issues with any lazy animation or still images. Despite that, the art style seems like the standard anime art style as there seems to be no unique part to it (unique in a way that is like the incredible use of color in No Game, No Life or the unique chibi-like style that Nichijou has). I will mention that I do love some of the splash images (favorite being during the opening).Sound (8 of 10): Personally, I don\'t much take for openings and endings. However, let me share you my thoughts on both as we reach the topic of sound. Opening: Combined with its fast-paced rhythm and the animation, the opening kept me entertained and I would find myself watching the opening each time or repeatedly. Speaking of which...I\'m listening to the opening right now. Ending: To be perfectly honest, this ending makes me want Milk Tea. The song itself fits with the show and does not feel out-of-place. In terms of that, they chose well with that. With the VA work, each character\'s voice actor seems well matched for the character personality as well. Personally enjoyed listening to Ruthkhania Pardomshiha\'s seiyu Saori Hayami (who voices Miyuki Shiba in Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei - another show I am currently watching) as well as some of the other starting VAs and other veteran VAs.Character (8 of 10): The variety of characters make for an interesting mix of interactions and comedic moments. From your usual uppity Tsundere to the shy and easily embarrassed girl, this anime seems to have its share of both usual characters types as well as some different character types. With this being slightly a harem-like anime, the main male protagonist is dense as usual. However, I will give the show props for having a few characters reach out to him past his density. Unlike most harem shows I\'ve seen, Rokujouma spends a even amount of time in its series going through the basic backgrounds of each girl in terms of arcs. (Think of it like a shounen-like arc structure). The time spent in each arc gives us more than enough to understand where each girl came from.Enjoyment (9 of 10): Not sure if I\'ve said much of this yet, but allow me to share on this one. This show has given me several laughs as well as some tense times. I\'ve throughly enjoyed this series and continue to (which surprises me as it is seems to be becoming more harem-like). I\'d share some of my favorite parts, but that would mean spoiling...so I\'d rather avoiding having any baby seals getting clubbed for me spoiling something.Overall (9 of 10): As this series itself progressed, I found myself enjoying most of the moments. The simple humor as well as some of the light action sequences made for great show. I generally am not a huge fan of harems or harem-like shows, but, like Highschool DxD, Rokujouma is one of those exceptions.Recommend Watching?: Yes...unless you really hate anything to do with Harems or harem-like shows. the story seems rather straightforward and blunt.

Prepare for something that while done before is still alright, but leaves something to be desired.Story: 6The harem genre in general seems to be hitting a stagnant point where there is just nothing new being made that breaks the mold set by other shows before it. That's where Rokujouma no Shinryakusha seems to at least be a bit different. There's not much fan-service and the story itself is at least above average when compared to others in the genre. However due to its limited run time of 12 episodes in the end you'll...be left wanting more, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. While it does change it up slightly it still reminded me of another harem Sora no Otoshimono, with the lead being surrounded by girls that can/have to fight. This is why its awkward because unless there is a second season its hard to judge the story. In itself it does a good job of setting up likeable characters and giving some development for each, but in the end no remarkable distance is achieved story wise. This would be fine however if the characters themselves weren't already well known tropes.Art: 7The art looks rather nice. It's a style I personally enjoy and all the characters are clean looking with fluid motions. Backgrounds are nothing spectacular, but action sequences look pretty good. It won't blow you away. It will however get the job done nicely and look good doing it. Character designs themselves are all pretty standard and what you would expect from any modern day harem.Sound: 7Background music here is nothing amazing. I liked it, but can't remember any specific piece. I did however like both the OP and ED for my own reasons, never skipped either, and I was especially fond of the ED. Sound effects are decent enough. You'll  get what you expect. A few funny/cute noises to go with the actions of the characters that suit the situation as well as decent enough environmental noises. The voice acting was my favorite part, not entirely sure why though. The characters all have their roles voiced well however and not many/any annoying voices to be heard. So all is good here.Character: 5(This section might be a bit spoilery, but not really passed the first episode, just fair warning.)The characters are what you would expect from any other harem, but each has a small magical/super-natural twist. We have a girl from another universe/future with her servant who are there to take over the room for her family's honor. A girl from an underground society who is there to invade the earth. A magical girl who's mission is to watch and wait to protect the magic in the room from being used for evil. Then we have the local tenant, the ghost of a girl whose parent's were killed. With the main character being  the pretty usual average guy that doesn't really realize he's in a harem (Even then he's still pretty likeable as a character).Each falls into a trope that you are probably used to. There are no relationship developments that you probably won't see coming. Which is what saddened me because they did a generally good job developing the characters into their roles, as opposed to you knowing instantly how who is going to react to what from the start. This left me feeling the characters we're just kind of OK, but not annoying like most shows where the tropes define almost everything a character does.Enjoyment/Overview: 8/6The story while done to death still manages to bring something relatively new to the table, and has a good way of presenting itself. There is a large amount of every kind of scene to give everyone something to look forward to, but at the same time you'll be left hanging. I'm  assuming that there is a planned second season because this show desperately needs it to succeed as something unique. As it stands now it ends in an awkward place. It hints at a romance blooming between the MC and one of the girls in his harem, and there is still no decided champion of the room, whilst evil is still lurking around the corner.For what it is I enjoyed it more than I expected and that was mainly due to them slightly switching up the formula, and having somewhat interesting characters that are all fro the most part likeable. If you like harem anime this is definitely something you should watch, but be aware that it doesn't end with a winner for the MC's affection. Even if you don't generally like harems this might still have something for you in the way of comedy, and in the case of a second season maybe even romance.

But the current animes ive watched so far especially this one has made me wanna write a 'hopefully no spoiler otherwise i have to take it down' anime review. So... abt this anime, this anime is well like some of u guys said, its a gem, a giant diamond hidden in the dust and gravel of mainstream animes and other 'harems with ecchi' animes. This really was a find indeed. so if...anyone were to be reading this comment or the comments arnd this anime or anything abt this anime, what are u waiting for? Just do it! watch it! the reason why its gd to me u may ask? Firstly,well, its a harem without ecchi, which is something hard to find these days i suppose. Secondly, the story is quite interesting (and amusing at some point too) cant really say which specific part is cause that would be spoilers. Thirdly,Its freaking entertaining! The awkward situations, the beach episode, the fun times they all had together despite their origins and 'interesting backgrounds' to the way Sanae possesses Koutaro to the part that Tulip gets worked up to the part Ruth gets worked up to the part... oops ive said too much. Well its a nice anime that is not too hard to watch for me. And Plus Koutaro is not too dense like Kirito or Ichika or other verrry dense characters! So thats what makes this anime even more great. However, to everything there are gd and bad points.the first bad point, in this anime, a harem is like an open door, where its too easy! true its anime, but for single forever alone teens like me i get soooooo jealous (maybe thats just to me idk lol)Second, i think the creators were trying to get Sanae closer to Koutaro by the way she posseses him? its a little on the 'trying too hard side' tbh.Thirdly,not allThe characters get to go on a date with koutaro! Now thats just sad! Anyways thats all for my review. Thx for reading (if u are reading till the end)Overall rating 8.5/10Btw am i the only one who ships Ruth with Koutaro?? Join me in shipping them together! hahahahahahah! Mustive got too amused with the episode where they almost... XD anyways guys have a great day and tell me if my review was gd kay? cause i wanna see if im rusty in typing non spoiler reviews! :)p.s this anime is TOO underrated i swear! This is gd stuff why is everyone is watching all the mainstream society stuff?? hahahahap.p.s another disadvantage would be that this anime has too little episodes and its a one shot with no OVA or second season! This anime was so gd i finished within 2 days but not im starting to regret it cause theres not enough episodessssss arghhhhh!

The idea of becoming independent and your own person in a place to call your own can make anyone feel good and more mature than before.  But what would happen if your nice and quiet, independent life becomes invaded by strange figures of supernatural lore?  Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?, or Invaders of the Rokujouma.Story (6.99/10):  The story of Rokujouma follows the story of Satomi Koutarou over the course of his life in high school.  In order to not trouble his father as he travels overseas, Koutarou decided to stay...behind in Japan and search for an apartment for himself to live in so that he may continue going to school in Japan.  As a result, he was able to find an apartment with a monthly rent of 5000 yen (which is about 46 American) and began living his high school life.  However, all is not well as he  is soon met by four strange girls who all want to have his apartment for themselves.  And, as the tenant of the apartment, he becomes reluctant to leave.  And thus, the comedy ensues.The plot of this show is very simple and likable.  A plus for the series is the fact that the story follows a very easy to follow arc after arc setup, each arc spanning about two or so episodes each.  However, because the story follows this very strict formula, the anime feels very rigid and cut into block after block of story material without any sort of proper flow in between them.  In addition, because the story follows such a rigid setup for plot, each arc felt a bit rushed due to the amount of story that they had to get through in a span of about 40 or so minutes.  This resulted in some unfavorable pacing for the show that, while unpleasant, wasn\'t enough to make the show completely dissatisfactory in any way.Now, for the arcs for the show.  What I think was a decent plus for the show was the focus that they had, which was, while rushed, focus on the four ""invaders"" of the apartment.  As a result of this, we were able to get a good amount of character development in each of them, making them a bit more three dimensional than just generic ""harem"" girls, which turns out to be false, as essentially, none of these girls wants the guy\'s D.  However, because of the aforementioned rigid arc setup of this show, the girls didn\'t get a lot of character development, at least as not as much as I would\'ve liked, and as characters as a whole, felt a bit incomplete.And finally, I have to talk about the ending for this show.  I don\'t like it.  There are upsides and downsides as to how the series ended, but for me, this series ended in a way that felt a bit like a ""read the manga"" ending.  The show in addition to giving some focus as to who the main 4 female characters of this show are and why they want the apartment for themselves, hinted throughout the entirety of the show some sort of mystical or transcendence deity or idea, which was not only unexplained to all hell, but was sort of slapped on at the end in one scene that confused me so much.  Not to mention there\'s not really a complete resolution to the show as a whole, which, unless this gets a second season, leaves me to have to deduct points because of just how, as a fan, unsatisfactory it left me because it really is open-ended and frustrating because of what they are teasing at as to how much they have left to reveal in the plot.Overview:+ Dedicated arcs for development+/-  Rigid arc setup (Gives easy to follow plot, but rushed pacing)-  ""Read the manga ending""  (It seems like there are a lot of these kinds of endings lately.)Characters (7.20/10): The cast for Rokujouma is fairly diverse, giving us characters of various points of importance that make for both some memorable characters, and characters that we just don\'t really care for.The first up is our main protagonist/harem master/tenant, Satomi Koutarou.  As a high schooler displaying his independence, Koutarou can be explained as a defiant character who wishes to help out anyone in need, true to his own ideals, basic Harem protagonist stuff.  There are however some nice parts to him that make themselves very apparent and slightly different from the other harem protagonists in existence.  For one thing, he knits.  From the start of the series, (rather, at the start of the series as the idea is basically shelved away), Koutarou is shown to have a strong desire to learn to knit as he must complete a task that he set for himself for reasons that they don\'t really make clear.  The other is the fact that he has some sort of magical whatever that makes him OP as all hell.  While these things do make him a lot more interesting as a character, the ideas get shelved very early on, or get ex-machina\'d and show up whenever the plot demands, making them seem a little pointless because of just how convenient the magical bullshit shows up.And then we have the real stars of the show, the four invaders.  Sanae, Theia, Kiriha, and Yurika.  These four are the main reason focus for this anime, and thus the whole reason for its existence.  With their roles as a ghost, alien, underground person (basically like a mole person, but human), and a magical girl, let\'s just say that they are rather...interesting characters.  Each of them has a very distinct personality with various quicks, as well as a reason for wanting the apartment in the first place, leading to them having to fight over the apartment for complete control over it.  As the series goes on, you start to learn more about who these girls are an there is development, as mentioned before, that makes the series a bit different when you watch a different show of a similar caliber.  While I didn\'t see as much development as there could potentially be for these girls, I\'m happy that Silver Link put in the effort to try and exemplify the importance of these girls and not make them complete 2-D cutouts.  (Sanae best girl.)Apart from the five main characters, we have additional side characters to the series, which are split into three main categories.  The first one belongs to and only to the character known as Sakurabo.  (She doesn\'t really feel like a main character.)  Sakurabo is the Senpai for Koutarou, as well as may or may not have feelings for him, but that\'s up for debate.  Sakurabo is a character that makes me feel conflicted, as she is shown to have a good deal of plot significance (more towards the end), but is shown to be more of a side character that shows up from time to time, or makes trouble for our main protagonist.  Personally, I like her character, but the way that she was handled didn\'t give me a satisfactory result as to the potential that she could\'ve had.The other two side character groups consist of the constant character, characters that are present throughout the series like Makkenji, the landlady, the dolls Karama and Koroma, and Ruth, and the arc specific characters.  As for the constant characters, while lacking in some screen time and development, these characters were more prominent in the series and more or less helped with moving the plot along.  For the most part, these characters were actually fairly decent and some were rather underused, which I felt is a flaw in the series, as some of the characters weren\'t used to the full potential that they could\'ve been.  As for the arc specific characters, they don\'t really serve much purpose beyond moving the plot along.  They\'re not bad, as they give the main four girls incentive and help establish what their reason for wanting the apartment in the first place, but after that specific girl\'s arc is over, the arc specific characters disappear completely.Overall, i felt as though the cast for the show was decent and memorable enough to leave a positive impression for the cast.  While a good chunk of them were very underused and certain character aspects were left open-ended, the cast overall was fairly good and fitted well with the overall feel of the show.Overview:+  The Harem girls.  (Sanae still best girl.)+/-  Somewhat generic Harem protagonist-  Underused potential with most of the castArt and Sound (7.81/10 and 7.87/10):  As for overall appearance, the show was produced by Silver Link, and actually looks rather nice.  (Silver Link does some good work)  The overall look of the show is slightly moe with the appearance of the girls, but the detail of the characters looks very nice and nothing stood out as very jarring looking.  In addition, the show also sports some comedic scenes where they change the look of the character to exemplify certain emotions (normal comedy anime stuff) giving a nice bit of tone change for a brief moment.  (This is usually used with Yurika due to just how pathetic of a character she is.)  The artwork isn\'t bad by any means, but it does look pretty standard with what production studies are making these days.There was one thing in the series in terms of artwork that seemed a bit odd to me, and that is the side ahoges.  Regardless of who the girl is, every girl in this series has a stupid bit of hair sticking up from the side of their head.  It just looks odd as it\'s just so blatantly there and for a long time, I was confused as to why that was even in the character design in the first place.As for the soundtrack, Rokujouma sports what I would call one of the more enjoyable OP\'s this season for a good amount of reasons.  #1, it\'s catchy.  The song, while slightly generic, is very catchy.  It\'s a nice upbeat song that can boosts spirits rather easily.  What really stood out in terms of significance for the song, is the fact that the four voice actresses who do the voices for the four girls sing the song.  Basically, you have the harem girls sing the song which for me showed me just how devoted this show was to idolizing the main female protagonists, which is a nice plus.  The ending for this show sports a more mysterious and mystical feel for its tune.  While I do feel like it deserves a listen and attention to, (as I do feel it is a good song as well), to me, it doesn\'t stack in comparison to its opening counterpart.  (funny how they sing about milk tea though.)And finally, because I have been praising this show so much for how much emphasis they put on their harem girls, I have to praise the performance of Oomori Nichika as the voice of Yurika specifically.  The reason being is because she nails the character EXTREMELY well due to just how pathetic she is able to make Yurika sound in any given conversation.  (This just stood out to me because of just how Yurika sounds when talking.)Overview:+  Good art (albeit weird with the multitude of side ahoges)+  Catchy songsPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  When it comes to anime, fluff is the best way to describe this show.  The kind of ""filler"" show that gives you a way to waste your time while also giving you something that is rather interesting and enjoyable.  When I first heard about this show, I was quite intrigued by just how seemingly random the story idea and the characters were.  (Not to mention I watch harems as much as I breathe air, so this was an instant to-watch.)  As I watched the series, I did feel that sense of nonsensical and somewhat random plot development that fluff shows normally had, which in some sense, did work well for this show.  I did enjoy this show a lot, I will admit.  What I didn\'t like however was how it ended because honestly, ending a show in a manner where you don\'t completely finish a story is complete and utter bull.  Let\'s get to the three questions, shall we?Did I like this show?Yes, I did.  There were a lot of good aspects to it from an entertainment standpoint which holds well for what this show was really supposed to be, entertainment.  The plot was mostly focused on the four main girls of the series, which I find to be different and exciting due to how little other harem shows focus on the girls in their series regardless of how core they are to the show in general.What didn\'t I like about this show?Aside from the bullshit ending and rigid plot structure, I also didn\'t like how Sanae (the ghost girl) was handled in the series.  For one thing, she\'s a ghost, therefore she should not be seen or even remotely materialized in any way shape or form.  And another thing is in the first episode where the landlady character just completely accepts the fact that these four girls with seemingly made-up titles are just completely accepted.  Like ""You\'re an alien?  Oh, that\'s cool.""  Like, there\'s not even any sense of wavering over the idea.  I can understand that it\'s an anime, but even in anime, there has to be at least some degree of disbelief.  (Maybe I\'m over-thinking itAnd finally, would I recommend this show?If you want to watch something that doesn\'t require you to think hard, then this would be a good pick for you.  Rokujouma is a very peculiar harem show as the girls for the most part don\'t actually fall in love with the guy, and contrary to possibly 90% of the other harems out there, doesn\'t really have fanservice.  (Well, aside from Kiriha\'s perks) Rokujouma is really one of those turn off your brain shows and can actually be a rather fun watch as the show never really takes itself too seriously and the characters are rather likable.  (Plus the beetle gag is pretty funny.)Overall Score: (7.30/10) behind in Japan and search for an apartment for himself to live in so that he may continue going to school in Japan.  As a result, he was able to find an apartment with a monthly rent of 5000 yen (which is about 46 American) and began living his high school life.  However, all is not well as he  is soon met by four strange girls who all want to have his apartment for themselves.  And, as the tenant of the apartment, he becomes reluctant to leave.  And thus, the comedy ensues.The plot of this show is very simple and likable.  A plus for the series is the fact that the story follows a very easy to follow arc after arc setup, each arc spanning about two or so episodes each.  However, because the story follows this very strict formula, the anime feels very rigid and cut into block after block of story material without any sort of proper flow in between them.  In addition, because the story follows such a rigid setup for plot, each arc felt a bit rushed due to the amount of story that they had to get through in a span of about 40 or so minutes.  This resulted in some unfavorable pacing for the show that, while unpleasant, wasn\'t enough to make the show completely dissatisfactory in any way.Now, for the arcs for the show.  What I think was a decent plus for the show was the focus that they had, which was, while rushed, focus on the four ""invaders"" of the apartment.  As a result of this, we were able to get a good amount of character development in each of them, making them a bit more three dimensional than just generic ""harem"" girls, which turns out to be false, as essentially, none of these girls wants the guy\'s D.  However, because of the aforementioned rigid arc setup of this show, the girls didn\'t get a lot of character development, at least as not as much as I would\'ve liked, and as characters as a whole, felt a bit incomplete.And finally, I have to talk about the ending for this show.  I don\'t like it.  There are upsides and downsides as to how the series ended, but for me, this series ended in a way that felt a bit like a ""read the manga"" ending.  The show in addition to giving some focus as to who the main 4 female characters of this show are and why they want the apartment for themselves, hinted throughout the entirety of the show some sort of mystical or transcendence deity or idea, which was not only unexplained to all hell, but was sort of slapped on at the end in one scene that confused me so much.  Not to mention there\'s not really a complete resolution to the show as a whole, which, unless this gets a second season, leaves me to have to deduct points because of just how, as a fan, unsatisfactory it left me because it really is open-ended and frustrating because of what they are teasing at as to how much they have left to reveal in the plot.Overview:+ Dedicated arcs for development+/-  Rigid arc setup (Gives easy to follow plot, but rushed pacing)-  ""Read the manga ending""  (It seems like there are a lot of these kinds of endings lately.)Characters (7.20/10): The cast for Rokujouma is fairly diverse, giving us characters of various points of importance that make for both some memorable characters, and characters that we just don\'t really care for.The first up is our main protagonist/harem master/tenant, Satomi Koutarou.  As a high schooler displaying his independence, Koutarou can be explained as a defiant character who wishes to help out anyone in need, true to his own ideals, basic Harem protagonist stuff.  There are however some nice parts to him that make themselves very apparent and slightly different from the other harem protagonists in existence.  For one thing, he knits.  From the start of the series, (rather, at the start of the series as the idea is basically shelved away), Koutarou is shown to have a strong desire to learn to knit as he must complete a task that he set for himself for reasons that they don\'t really make clear.  The other is the fact that he has some sort of magical whatever that makes him OP as all hell.  While these things do make him a lot more interesting as a character, the ideas get shelved very early on, or get ex-machina\'d and show up whenever the plot demands, making them seem a little pointless because of just how convenient the magical bullshit shows up.And then we have the real stars of the show, the four invaders.  Sanae, Theia, Kiriha, and Yurika.  These four are the main reason focus for this anime, and thus the whole reason for its existence.  With their roles as a ghost, alien, underground person (basically like a mole person, but human), and a magical girl, let\'s just say that they are rather...interesting characters.  Each of them has a very distinct personality with various quicks, as well as a reason for wanting the apartment in the first place, leading to them having to fight over the apartment for complete control over it.  As the series goes on, you start to learn more about who these girls are an there is development, as mentioned before, that makes the series a bit different when you watch a different show of a similar caliber.  While I didn\'t see as much development as there could potentially be for these girls, I\'m happy that Silver Link put in the effort to try and exemplify the importance of these girls and not make them complete 2-D cutouts.  (Sanae best girl.)Apart from the five main characters, we have additional side characters to the series, which are split into three main categories.  The first one belongs to and only to the character known as Sakurabo.  (She doesn\'t really feel like a main character.)  Sakurabo is the Senpai for Koutarou, as well as may or may not have feelings for him, but that\'s up for debate.  Sakurabo is a character that makes me feel conflicted, as she is shown to have a good deal of plot significance (more towards the end), but is shown to be more of a side character that shows up from time to time, or makes trouble for our main protagonist.  Personally, I like her character, but the way that she was handled didn\'t give me a satisfactory result as to the potential that she could\'ve had.The other two side character groups consist of the constant character, characters that are present throughout the series like Makkenji, the landlady, the dolls Karama and Koroma, and Ruth, and the arc specific characters.  As for the constant characters, while lacking in some screen time and development, these characters were more prominent in the series and more or less helped with moving the plot along.  For the most part, these characters were actually fairly decent and some were rather underused, which I felt is a flaw in the series, as some of the characters weren\'t used to the full potential that they could\'ve been.  As for the arc specific characters, they don\'t really serve much purpose beyond moving the plot along.  They\'re not bad, as they give the main four girls incentive and help establish what their reason for wanting the apartment in the first place, but after that specific girl\'s arc is over, the arc specific characters disappear completely.Overall, i felt as though the cast for the show was decent and memorable enough to leave a positive impression for the cast.  While a good chunk of them were very underused and certain character aspects were left open-ended, the cast overall was fairly good and fitted well with the overall feel of the show.Overview:+  The Harem girls.  (Sanae still best girl.)+/-  Somewhat generic Harem protagonist-  Underused potential with most of the castArt and Sound (7.81/10 and 7.87/10):  As for overall appearance, the show was produced by Silver Link, and actually looks rather nice.  (Silver Link does some good work)  The overall look of the show is slightly moe with the appearance of the girls, but the detail of the characters looks very nice and nothing stood out as very jarring looking.  In addition, the show also sports some comedic scenes where they change the look of the character to exemplify certain emotions (normal comedy anime stuff) giving a nice bit of tone change for a brief moment.  (This is usually used with Yurika due to just how pathetic of a character she is.)  The artwork isn\'t bad by any means, but it does look pretty standard with what production studies are making these days.There was one thing in the series in terms of artwork that seemed a bit odd to me, and that is the side ahoges.  Regardless of who the girl is, every girl in this series has a stupid bit of hair sticking up from the side of their head.  It just looks odd as it\'s just so blatantly there and for a long time, I was confused as to why that was even in the character design in the first place.As for the soundtrack, Rokujouma sports what I would call one of the more enjoyable OP\'s this season for a good amount of reasons.  #1, it\'s catchy.  The song, while slightly generic, is very catchy.  It\'s a nice upbeat song that can boosts spirits rather easily.  What really stood out in terms of significance for the song, is the fact that the four voice actresses who do the voices for the four girls sing the song.  Basically, you have the harem girls sing the song which for me showed me just how devoted this show was to idolizing the main female protagonists, which is a nice plus.  The ending for this show sports a more mysterious and mystical feel for its tune.  While I do feel like it deserves a listen and attention to, (as I do feel it is a good song as well), to me, it doesn\'t stack in comparison to its opening counterpart.  (funny how they sing about milk tea though.)And finally, because I have been praising this show so much for how much emphasis they put on their harem girls, I have to praise the performance of Oomori Nichika as the voice of Yurika specifically.  The reason being is because she nails the character EXTREMELY well due to just how pathetic she is able to make Yurika sound in any given conversation.  (This just stood out to me because of just how Yurika sounds when talking.)Overview:+  Good art (albeit weird with the multitude of side ahoges)+  Catchy songsPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  When it comes to anime, fluff is the best way to describe this show.  The kind of ""filler"" show that gives you a way to waste your time while also giving you something that is rather interesting and enjoyable.  When I first heard about this show, I was quite intrigued by just how seemingly random the story idea and the characters were.  (Not to mention I watch harems as much as I breathe air, so this was an instant to-watch.)  As I watched the series, I did feel that sense of nonsensical and somewhat random plot development that fluff shows normally had, which in some sense, did work well for this show.  I did enjoy this show a lot, I will admit.  What I didn\'t like however was how it ended because honestly, ending a show in a manner where you don\'t completely finish a story is complete and utter bull.  Let\'s get to the three questions, shall we?Did I like this show?Yes, I did.  There were a lot of good aspects to it from an entertainment standpoint which holds well for what this show was really supposed to be, entertainment.  The plot was mostly focused on the four main girls of the series, which I find to be different and exciting due to how little other harem shows focus on the girls in their series regardless of how core they are to the show in general.What didn\'t I like about this show?Aside from the bullshit ending and rigid plot structure, I also didn\'t like how Sanae (the ghost girl) was handled in the series.  For one thing, she\'s a ghost, therefore she should not be seen or even remotely materialized in any way shape or form.  And another thing is in the first episode where the landlady character just completely accepts the fact that these four girls with seemingly made-up titles are just completely accepted.  Like ""You\'re an alien?  Oh, that\'s cool.""  Like, there\'s not even any sense of wavering over the idea.  I can understand that it\'s an anime, but even in anime, there has to be at least some degree of disbelief.  (Maybe I\'m over-thinking itAnd finally, would I recommend this show?If you want to watch something that doesn\'t require you to think hard, then this would be a good pick for you.

It's lighthearted, it's fun, the girls are cute, and the guy doesn't suck. Great. If it could have stayed like that for twelve episodes, I'd have an eight on my hands. Maybe I'm being generous, but you get it.However, as I watched, I go the feeling that 'Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?' either didn't take itself seriously enough, or took itself way too seriously, but only sometimes.I had trouble figuring out what the show wanted to be besides a harem (which it wasn't even doing that well, to be honest. Felt more like the people around him happened...to be girls, rather than his harem).Did it want to be a drama? If so, there wasn't enough of it, and the presentation was crap. One of these women came from space to invade a bedroom and is literally light years from all of her friends and family save her servant/secretary/pilot/(?). Why did that not come up once?

Can't even say to give this show the three episode test as the first three are the better episodes. This anime is quite enjoyable, considering what I've said about it, I'm just annoyed by inconsistent quality.

However, I just can\'t see it myself. I\'m always reluctant to disagree with the masses, since it makes me question whether or not my opinion is valid (like, have I missed something?), but if I had to sum up this anime in one word, it would be: ""Average"".Story: 7Rokujouma no Shinryakusha is a twelve episode, comedy, romance, harem. Although, it doesn\'t feel that way. Those tags are quite misleading in the sense that there isn\'t all that much romance in this anime. There are some crushes and a bit of...flirting every other episode, but there really isn\'t any substantial romance. Instead, the anime focuses on episodic short stories revolving around the array of vibrant characters. One of its strongest aspects is the comedy. Whilst it\'s not exactly side-splitting, you get a couple of giggles here and there. The episodic stories are surprisingly fun. I quite often found myself drawn in by the one-episode plot twists. However, it almost feels *too* episodic. Very little relates most episodes to one another, so it feels very segmented, meaning you\'re not really drawn into the next episode. In addition, if you focus on the actual content of the stories themselves, none of it really seems to make much sense or follow any rules.Art: 6The art and animation is decent. The character designs are unique from one another, though there aren\'t any that stand out when being compared to other anime. The overall art style isn\'t unique either and is sometimes inconsistent. The characters and spells are extremely vivid and bright, whereas most backgrounds seemed dull and bland. This created an odd contrast which didn\'t really work out. In terms of how it\'s drawn, it\'s very typical. However, there\'s a reason typical things are typical and that\'s because they work. There isn\'t really anything to dislike about the art but, at the same time, there\'s nothing that stands out.Sound: 6Similar to the art in Rokujouma no Shinryakusha, the sound is decent. The opening is pretty catchy and so is the ending. However, they don\'t sound unique at all and can be somewhat annoying sometimes with how babyish the singer\'s voice sounds. The background music isn\'t exactly film-score quality, either. It just sounds like typical slice-of-life jingles.Characters: 7Initially, I saw the vast number of characters as a negative aspect. In the first episode, the anime introduces far too many characters that are so drastically different. I found myself saying ""oh c\'mon, you can\'t be serious"" when they introduced a ghost girl, a magical girl, an underground girl and an alien girl within the space of about five minutes. Seems ridiculous, right? Anyway, I sucked it up and tried to look beyond the such blatant disregard for realism. Thankfully, over the course of the anime, you\'ll find yourself growing more and more fond of the likable characters and their cute mannerisms. Although it does bother me that there\'s one male character and about eight girl ones. I just can\'t relate to it because of how unrepresentative and unrealistic that degree of harem is. Overall, solid characters and, whilst not particularly unique, they are the show\'s strength.Enjoyment: 6I didn\'t enjoy this anime as greatly as I have others, but it\'s decent if you\'re looking for something chill to pass the time.Overall: 6Chaotic, random story-lines just don\'t really shout ""quality"" and, to me, it\'s almost lazy writing. Although, Rokujouma no Shinryakusha has it\'s strong points. I\'d recommend it if you\'re really into slice-of-lifes or harems. But be warned: there are anime that are much better within these genres.

Well, that's what this anime is about as not only does it show us the situation, it also presents its aftermath.Most people would think that this is a harem manga right off the bat because of the cover. That's what I thought too until I started watching it. Harem anime is usually intertwined with ecchi, claiming that all harem anime is ecchi. Well, this show refuted that idea. Just because it's a harem, it doesn't mean there should be fanservice. If it weren't for...this show, I would've forgotten that fact.The characters were memorable, and I don't say that to all anime. Perhaps what made them memorable was the fact that they had their own tag. Unlike most harem characters, however, their tag is not defined by their personalities. Rather, it's defined by their identity. One can simply forget a tsundere girl or an ojou-sama heroine, but I bet you won't forget a loli ghost or a magical girl or a flat-chested alien or a big-breasted underground lady.

There is nothing wrong with this, but there is no where that describes if the protagonist puts himself in danger in doing that, or if the female character is in danger.

I was happy with the first couple of episodes because it seemed to be living up to what i expected but not at its maximum height. Obviously with most anime the build up and development just makes the overall story better but this show honestly just dropped and dropped the further it went on.Let me explain. The super simplified version of the show and what it was supposed to be was a hand full of...characters fighting over a certain pieces of property for their own personal gain. The protagonist gets stuck in the middle of the ordeal and creates and point system that will help determine who gets to have the land. Going in under that assessment you think it will be hitting you with and laugh and maybe slight character improvements later on. Nope. The first couple of episodes pull it off but then suddenly the show decides to give every girl their own two episode back story that ultimately has zero purpose at all and then skips on to the next girl. All in all the property they fight for is slightly mentioned in some way and reiterates as to why they need it, though at that point when they lose the plot you simply just won\'t care.I write this honest review to you because most of the reviews this show receives is based off of a fans die heart opinion and seems to just give the wrong message to those who go in blind. Sure the characters were creative and the show had promise but in the end its a completely different show and you\'ll be wondering why you started watching it to begin with.My score may be higher then what my review gives the impression of what it really should be but I did like the art style and i cared for one or two characters. I had a hard time finishing it in the end but i still did watch. its almost a 3. characters fighting over a certain pieces of property for their own personal gain.

To think how many anime showed promise in its first few episodes only to break down completely in the middle.Unfortunately, Rokujouma is one of them.Initially, this is just your normal haremish anime which just uses the grand old concept of girls moving suddenly into your room, with a good comic setting. Nothing wrong with that. And they play games in order to decide the room allotments. Nothing wrong with that. But when they suddenly change the narrative from playing games to something else, like I don't know, supernatural interference, then you suddenly contort the characters in such a...way that you don't know them anymore. That's when it goes to shit.To start with, the initial few episodes were laudable and funny in their own way. Everything looked like we will experience a slice of life with nothing to worry about. Then suddenly one of the girls starts to develop a problem with the hero during a beach episode. Then another girl develops a problem, then another. The cycle continues. And it all ends in the same way: The so called normal hero suddenly being able to absorb infinite energies that he shouldn't have been able to, along with the all the other girls just teaming up and destroying the enemy. EVERY TIME. What is this? The gender-swapped Avengers?????At  one point, this grows really annoying, so much that at a time when one of the girls has to face her enemy fair and square, when the suspense is built up fairly, and when the interesting element comes within, the hero just rushes in to save her and determines by some writ law, that they will all gang up on the enemy and destroy her, even when the enemy was actually the one who arranged a magically isolated location so that no one else would get hurt and she would get to test her skills well. And said hero doesn't even trust the girl's claims at all, just because of a selfish desire to preserve his inferiority complex.I am getting ahead of myself in this part, but long story short, don't watch this anime if you think that you liked the first few episodes.

I know they kind of foreshadowed Koutarou\'s secret whatever power at the beggining, but is still felt like it came out of nowhere.I liked all of the characters, even if some of them have a personality as deep as a puddle.MC is still kind of your typical Harem MC but less of an astronomical idiot.Kiriha\'s backstory was a bit unpolished, but I like her calm and colected attitude.Theia would be one of may favorite characters if she was just slightly less annoying. Miss princess is nice but should really get off her white horse in her marble palace.Ruth is a character that really ticks me off. I liked her until they started the whole bettle thing. Like, really. There are a trillion better ways to add more to a character than that.Yurika is way to much of a cliché character for me to really like her, but she has her moments.Sanae feels like the typical childhood friend character without being one.

If you want to make her into the calm and collected until she gets pissed off and goes super sayan character, you need to do it better. She lacked hte impact that those characters tend to make. It felt half-assed Also, I know her super human strengh is supposed to be a gag, but if you are going to have her participate in a fight, give a proper explanation for it. One thing is having her be super strong for the sake of a gag. Another is having that gag strengh be part of a fight. It just doesn\'t work.Makkenji is a place holder character that annoys me a lot.

They didn\'t develop him and, honestly, I\'m not sure I even wanted them to, since, instead of the cool and hilarious friend they hinted at him being, they would probably turn him into ""that pervert friend of the MC"", which is even worse.Finally, best girl, also known as Harumi.

So here's my opinion of the anime and I'm gonna make it short.*spoiler FREEFirstly for the story. It was going well right up until they introduce the other characters, like Kiriha and Fortorthe. All the other character introductions were so forced and lazy and they couldn't care less to give them a more elaborate backstory. All the scenes to create tension are so half assed that when a resolution scene or forgiving scene comes, it feels disingenuous and without merit.Characters are again, lazily developed...and so on, with some exceptions. The development of the characters are so off that whenever they do something different from usual it feels like they've done a 180 in mere minutes.Thanks for reading my rant.

For hundreds of years, people have been trying to prove the existence of ghosts, as if they exist in this world or not. Among those theories, rumors, and legends related to ghosts often pertains to the supernatural also involving how and why they exist. This is something that ghost hunters enjoy their time doing with their nerdy equipment and whatnot. But here in this show, we have treasure hunters, with a similar passion but rather than seeking out ghosts, they try to find the lost treasures of a murdered girl.Enter Nanana Ryūgaj, the ghost and main heroine of this...series. As a ghost, she is bounded to a special room ever since she was assassinated 10 years ago. And being a ghost, she is usually lonely inside and confined to a little room with nothing but video games and pudding. That is until she meets Juugo Yama, a young man who is an adventurer, working man, and pervert (with a fetish for maids) all the same time. It really can’t be helped since Jugo has nowhere else to go after being kicked out by his own father. A human and a ghost living together? Bring on the irrationality.Or rather, maybe a bit lightweight because Nanana may not be the type of girl some may picture her as. Rather than a malevolent ghost seeking for vengeance at any chance, Nanana behaves like an odd girl with NEET tendencies. She doesn’t look like an angry spirit either throughout the duration of the show despite the desperation to find the killer that bestowed this fate upon her. In essence, we have a rather peculiar relationship between Nanana and Jugo packaged into a little adventure. At first, the two does not seem to get along. Nanana finds Jugo to be a nuisance and waste of space. Jugo on the other hand has a keen interest in Nanana although he never seems to impress her. But as the series goes along, we do see a more development between the duo that mutates from acquaintances, to friendship, and possibly even on the edge of romance.Based off the light novel of the same name written by Kazuma Ōtorino, there’s some fascination related to the premise of the series. There’s elements of adventure, mystery, drama, romance, and even supernatural all mixed together in a little package. The first episode quickly blasts off with some scenes with Indiana Jones conception and later shifts its focus to Nanae Island. It is here where the series takes place and judging by its technology, there are endless possibilities. Shiki Maboro, the landlady and Nanana’s best friend, provides possibilities for Juugo including a chance for him to provide Nanana some company. Yet behind her façade, there’s a bitter insight of sadness as she wishes to also solve the mystery of Nanana. The series however focuses more on just that as Juugo goes on his own adventures to find Nanana’s buried treasures, specifically the Nanana Collection.11 episodes and that’s apparently what’s needed to hammer down an adventure chronicling Juugo’s time as an adventurer. Not only that but the way it wraps up the show is controversial, at least in resolution sense. But really, a show with such potential can be cut back to just that can be compromising. To say the least, the adventure Juugo goes through feels fast paced and lacks that feeling of the classics. Sure, Nanae Island is a high level city to live in but the best way to bring out its potential is to also go out and explore with a real thrill of wanderlust. However, the show confines itself to the island as well as the apartment that Juugo stays in limiting such possibilities. The way the show depicts its adventures instead seems to focus with the other characters that Juugo meets. After joining the school’s Adventure Club, the audience is quickly introduced to more enthusiastic detectives such as Tensai Ikkyu. And as a girl with apparently genius level intellect, she becomes both a helping hand and nuisance during Juugo’s quest. Other characters Juugo becomes acquainted with as a member of the Adventure Club offers diversity. But unfortunately, some of them come with a formulaic throwback and in general, clichés. Examples include the stereotypical Isshin Yuiga, the president of the club with an obsession on treasures. He comes with the complete package with his devious personality, menacing glasses, and a taste to obtain power. The show doesn’t stop with further stereotypes such as providing him a sidekick, a girl named Yu Ibara who worships the ground that Isshin walks on. Others include a master of disguises, a trap that comes with the classy maid gimmick, and hackneyed antagonist with self-motivated interest to do everything to get what he wants. To say the least, it’s a substantial cast of characters layered with clichés and unimpressive gags.One interesting aspect to take from this show is the relationships that Juugo develops with others. While most of the main characters are crass with generic attributes, Juugo brings out the best of them on some cases. In one such case, his relationship with a family member become heartwarming. Although it seems frivolous at first, there’s an innate focus on Juugo’s own characteristics as a person who can keep a promise. His inspiring dedication enables him to show what other characters are capable of and when they show a different side of their frontal selves. This even expands to minor supporting characters where they only show up briefly yet Juugo is able to converse with them on an open level. Juugo’s charisma is something I find contagious in a mixed way where he can be someone honest with himself and others. At the same time, his loyalty transpires respect and commands his presence.Despite the seriousness of the premise itself involving a murder prior to the start, the series showcases its more fundamental aspects involving the treasures. Each treasure the series reveals has some a different power with a different function. It offers diversity and potential to expand their usage. Unfortunately, the show only touches on their general aspects and ways to get them. It does display their usage though with various results to show how magnificent Nanana’s treasures really are. On the other hand, the comedy is a hit or miss for the audience. Juugo’s perverse actions surfaces from the very beginning and pretty much whenever else when he gets involved with attractive members of the opposite sex. It’s generic as Juugo becomes a punching bag by them on the opposite end. And for some reason, despite being a ghost and even incorporeal, Nanana is able to attack Juugo at her own will. Other parts of intentional humor includes but not limited to tsundere like behavior of Tensai, Juugo’s maid fetish (made awkward since the character he feels those desire towards is a trap), and running gags. In retrospect, the show can feel like it’s trying too hard for its own good.Artwork is stylish to say the least but some of the character designs looks a bit generic. Nanana’s design contrasts the menacing features of a ghost with her more girly and curvy figure. Similarly, most female characters in the show has an attractive figure that often makes Juugo’s inner desires surface. Juugo himself is designed like a normal boy with nothing noticeable despite his charisma. But despite this, the show’s setting has great detail provided with its cutting edge technology. Nanae Island is designed with lavish architectures, beautiful landscapes, and garnishes a brand of attentiveness to people looking for inventive ideas. A-1 Pictures adapts the setting and pulls it off when it comes to the overall backgrounds although lacking a bit of effort into the character designs. There is also some fan service with the onsen episode inspiring fan service to pop up and of course, curious camera angles.Soundtrack is less distinctive but does hold itself together when the push comes to shove. We get comical OST during humorous moments, soft pacing during emotional scenarios, and more action oriented stereo during climatic scenes. The OP and ED song has a delicious taste to it more than just pudding. It has its catchy tone with colorful palate of the main characters, in particular our ghostly superstar Nanana. And finally while most of the voice acting is standard, I give praise to Kana Hanazawa for her ability to play a character of the opposite gender. You’ll be surprised at what you’ll see.Taking this show at face value, it could be a hit or miss. It’s one of those shows that can either appeal you or be a waste of time. But for all of its attributes, it is something I consider as throwback. The story has a sound promising premise with a diverse cast of characters. But the execution wasn't all bright and shiny. That and the absurd comedy could sway some attention from the audience when it seems forceful.

Not one bit."", '“I spend every day eating pudding, watching TV, and playing online games.” – Ryuugajou, NananaI thought of Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin another colorful spring 2014 anime. With the characters’ having vibrant colored eyes, I thought this was something that stood out the most in a character’s appearance for me.This anime tells of a story about Nanana Ryuugajou, who was murdered 10 years before the actual setting of the story. She’s a ghost, living as a NEET, bounded to the room Juugo Yama was given to by Shiki Maporo (the landlady of Happy House – the apartment complex).Juugo moves into the room Nanana is...bounded to and learns about Nanana’s Collection, also known as Ryuugajou Nanana’s Buried Treasure (hence the title). They are – “treasures of origins unknown”. The ones with unique powers are known as Nanana’s Collection itself. Juugo soon joins the Adventure Club, where the members are solely looking for the treasures.  This is where the plot starts to set in. Juugo and his group of friends will try and find Nanana’s Collection.  With the treasures being set in different locations, along with different setups, they would need a little bit of thinking along the way. But that’s what makes the series interesting, as you try to figure out the setup with the characters. At least, that’s what I tried doing anyway. Haha.As I said at the beginning of this review, I thought the character’s eyes are what stood out the most to me when looking at their appearance. The art in Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is what made finding Nanana’s buried treasure and other situations have a cool, beautiful, detailed setting to it. The backgrounds in the show are casual; some you would see in almost any school/daily life of a 16-year-old type set anime. But when you get to the setup of Nanana’s treasure, it’s awe-inspiring. All of the character designs are kind of like the newer, maybe 2013-2014 art – to me they were also beautifully made; with different colors also made to match their outfits: which add in the anime, being well set in color variety. The series also includes some fan service.With how this anime is centered with finding treasure and solving how each setup of the treasure goes, I’d have to say that the OP had that little detective feel into it, for me.  The ED, for me, had that gentle feeling of how Nanana is enjoying her ghostly life, despite any situation. Of course, this is while watching the 1 minute and 30 second ending. The background music/sounds were good in terms of setting the mood/scene in each episode.The characters in the anime are likeable. They are what make this show pretty enjoyable. With Nanana, being the teenage ghost bounded to the room Juugo rented out; Juugo being the one to learn and find out more about Nanana’s Collection, leading to more discoveries to the treasures; Tensai being the master detective and Daruku alongside her; and having other characters just add up to the series as Juugo and them continue to find more treasures. They all added to the story very well, in my opinion. It’s just that there were some problems, in the beginning, in my mind deciding whether or not this character or that character were on the good, bad, or neutral side of the story. Other than that, I thought the characters were pretty well developed.Overall, even though I was behind on episodes while this show was airing, I enjoyed Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin – with its treasure hunting, solving the treasures setups, helping each other in times of need, the bits of comedy between characters, and the friendship/bonds between the characters. Though the show was only 11 episodes long, I did wish it would have been longer. It did give a feel as if it was just a bit rushed, but even so, it’s still pretty good to watch. bounded to and learns about Nanana’s Collection, also known as Ryuugajou Nanana’s Buried Treasure (hence the title).

It did give a feel as if it was just a bit rushed, but even so, it’s still pretty good to watch.', 'Master Detective, NEET Ghost, Superpowers from items like what happens in Doraemon...and a main male character WITH BRAINS. Oh not to mention the very interesting plot.Ryuugajou Nana no Maizoukin is the first of its kind. I\'ve never seen anything like this. This is just so unique that I am literally amazed. WAIT WHY IS THE SALES SO BAD FOR THIS WHATS WRONG WITH THE JAPANESE ANIMERIANS GIVING IT SUCH A COLD TREATMENT?!Enough fanboying. Lets move on...Story - 9/10The story was detailed, considering they pushed a whole lot of plot into a 11-episode series. Not to mention why the fxck is it only 11 episodes when...it should be longer. Story was unique, executed nicely and very interesting. However it is supposed to be a comedy, but the comedy part eventually tears off and this anime kind of became a mystery genre anime instead, with the comedy part heavily toned down to make way for the plot. If you are planning to look into comedy in the first place, you might be disappointed after a few episodes even though the first few episodes\' comedy was great. However, if you enjoyed things such as Hyouka then you kind of got a treasure by deciding to watch Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin.Another problem is that while the anime is listed as a Romance genre, it doesn\'t really contain anything romantic whatsover other than a few blushing scenes and so on. If you are looking into full romance, walk away.Art - 10/10The movement of the animation was really fluid and the character art design was great, everyone looked good, from the main characters to even the small casts such as the class monitor. What I am amazed about is firstly, everytime the cast encounters a ""ruin"", the animation quality changes from Ryuugajou level to Guilty Crown level. It definitely gives off a vibe that is like ""Things are going to get serious now"" and makes me wonder how much money did they used for each ruin scene. Another thing worth noting is that the male mc, namely Yama Juugo\'s design is not exaggerated to be like some badass or some handsome idolic character, he looks just what he needed to look like - normal.Sound - 6/10The sound was the weakest part of the anime, not that I can expect anything from 11 episodes anyway. But still, I\'ve never even bothered to listen to the ED song and while the OP sounds catchy, it is probably easily forgotten in a few while. However Nanana\'s seiyu is awesome because she is only 17 years old yet she had the sound like Jibril from No Game No Life, probably even better. Be sure to look out for her work as she sounds real talented, at least to me.Character - 11/10 Director\'s cutWhere\'d the world would u find a male mc with a brain, badass but not overly badass to not be beaten at all (like Izayoi from Mondaiji) and actually has motives in his own mind instead of the boring old ""I want to help because I am kind"" male mc? Here you have Yama Jugou, someone who was disowned by his father and came to the island where everything happens in the anime. You see him as a comic relief character and typical at first with looks that is easily forgettable, but once you start watching it you will realize that he has a working mind unlike most mc nowadays yet is not as OP as the ones i\'ve listed above. This is also the first time the male MC is not ""all good"" and instead has ulterior motives, although most of the part of the motive isn\'t bad either, he is really the first mc to be calculative, sneaky and can be wicked when he needs to be so. He may be badass when he needs to be, but he has a lot of weaknesses exploitable so that none of us will see him as OP (overpowered).Next up master detective Tensai-sama is our main brain power besides Juugo. She has the minds of a Sherlock Holmes (and the hat too, LOL) yet she\'s also calculative and sneaky that unlike most female characters that would ""lose their cool and sacrifice everything to save the male mc in trouble"", she kept her cool and negotiated with the enemy to drive the enemy off using mindgames and to save the male mc at the same time, yet in the end you realize she is just bluffing without any way to win the enemy up front whatsover. That would be the point where you will be amazed by her intelligence and cool. Oh and she is really cute when she blushes (LOL)Nanana had really good design and is very cute, but due to her low character development she is probably easily forgettable, sadly. She is the neutral and the ""hint machine"" in this treasure hunting contest, yet she stays neutral however good she and Juugo\'s relationship may be.In short to conclude the characters: I\'ve never seen these kind of perfectly-balanced characters in my whole anime life.Enjoyment - 9/10I\'ve really enjoyed the ride on Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin, but theres a few things that i\'ve looked for and are expecting but did not get them such as the romance between Juugo and Nanana/Tensai. Any of them is fine but I guess I need to use my imagination for this. Again if you are looking for romance, look away as you won\'t find a lot of it in this anime. However for character uniqueness and development, puzzle-solving. plot-twists and new strong anthologists that are not invincible yet strong to make you fear for the protagonists, look no further.Overall - 9/10Just copy paste the last paragraph here. it should be longer.

However for character uniqueness and development, puzzle-solving. plot-twists and new strong anthologists that are not invincible yet strong to make you fear for the protagonists, look no further.Overall - 9/10Just copy paste the last paragraph here.', 'First of all, as I was looking through all the series for the Spring 14 season, this series wasn\'t on my radar at first. It became sort of a throw in ""just because."" But boy am I glad I decided to watch it!A teen, Nanana, who was killed, is chained to a single room in an apartment complex for a school. She was part of a group that hunted down treasures that each had a special power and weakness. Only ""Adventure Club"" (whose sole purpose is to continue hunting down the treasures) members are allowed to live there with her. Juugo, who has many...personal problems of his own, is enrolled at the school and is assigned that particular room. At first, their relationship was rather shaky, and really was only help together by the fact that she was a cute roommate. But, as the series progresses, you see their relationship expand, and Juugo puts his ego aside to help Nanana. Throw some villains, a master detective, and a few secret organizations (as well as other characters) into the fray, it makes for a very entertaining series.Not to spoil the series, the story is very good and pretty unique. It\'s sometimes hard to incorporate a ""ghost"" character into a series, but I feel as if this series did it very well. There is a ton of action, some romance, puzzles, a good amount of comedy, and even a tad bit of fanservice in there for you fanservice junkies.The art and sound are very solid. No real flaws. The soundtrack used is very enjoyable and fits the series very well. The animation style is slightly unique, and all the characters are crisply animated.The characters are very well developed for the most part. You don\'t get a ton of inter-character relationships until the later episodes. And at some points, you are left wondering what the connection is. But rest assured, you will get some answers. I like that romance wasn\'t a theme that was being forced down my throat, and the fanservice was not a major focal point of the series.The negatives- I was slightly confused at times with the relationships between some of the characters, given not much back story or flashbacks. Also, the length of the series. 11 episodes makes it slightly shorter, and may have caused the series to be rushed a tad bit.Overall, the series is extremely enjoyable and entertaining. It has very few negatives, and if you are looking for a series that has action, comedic moments, and not a typical run of the mill plot, you should definitely give this series a watch! personal problems of his own, is enrolled at the school and is assigned that particular room. At first, their relationship was rather shaky, and really was only help together by the fact that she was a cute roommate. But, as the series progresses, you see their relationship expand, and Juugo puts his ego aside to help Nanana. Throw some villains, a master detective, and a few secret organizations (as well as other characters) into the fray, it makes for a very entertaining series.Not to spoil the series, the story is very good and pretty unique. It\'s sometimes hard to incorporate a ""ghost"" character into a series, but I feel as if this series did it very well. There is a ton of action, some romance, puzzles, a good amount of comedy, and even a tad bit of fanservice in there for you fanservice junkies.The art and sound are very solid. No real flaws. The soundtrack used is very enjoyable and fits the series very well. The animation style is slightly unique, and all the characters are crisply animated.The characters are very well developed for the most part. You don\'t get a ton of inter-character relationships until the later episodes. And at some points, you are left wondering what the connection is. But rest assured, you will get some answers.

Enough of that, so another 2014 spring anime has ended and frankly I couldn\'t care less if it\'s only 11 episodes, so no more fucking around as I present my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Fair 6.Story- Ok, it is good but not good enough, since the plot itself was full of potholes that as larger as moon craters, now I can\'t imagine that a teeny bopper like Nanana would be able able to accumulate such riches through treasure hunting. Ok, so she has some help from her band called the ""Great 7,""  so,...I\'m guessing this is another one of them Japanese teens who have to grow up fast, but not that fast, If it were me I would made it that  Nanana got her treasure by through inheritance from her grand father who is a renowned adventurer , where 20% of the cache are magical artifacts and the rest where she was able to use to make more money and make her ""Nanana Island Project"" a reality, and here is the mystery.... she was murdered by someone in her family who wants those magic artifacts. So lets go to some of those potholes:Nanana\'s Collection- theoretically if she, together with her ""Great 7"" brat mates where able to gather them then by that time they would have been old farts already, or some of them would have died in search of those treasures.The murder of Nanana Ryūgajō- if the killer were to find out that Nanana was a ghost who can be seen by everyone then wouldn\'t that murderer try to go back and find out how a ghost like her was able to exist as if she is still alive? I\'m guessing that that round sphere around her neck is one of those so called collections, so if a killer was able to find that out, then he or she would either use some of the collections to counter it or blow up the entire apartment.Ruins- To put up ruins around the island would meant that there are maps or city plan designed that any would be treasure hunters would be able to find, the idea for such place to be in an island that has a modern metropolis is just very stupid, beside wouldn\'t the city administrator forbid such place to exist in the first place. It it were me, I wouldn\'t put those so called ruins in a modern metropolis, instead I would place it in one part of the island where it has a lot of old abandon buildings, warehouses and haunted houses.And there were a lot to mentioned that my fingers alone would get tired just by typing it, so with such potholes, there is really no doubt in my mind that this category should be ""Fair"" enough.Good 7.Art- I like the art form where there isn\'t much fanservice for them pirreos to howl for, I also like the CGI that were done for the ruin effect.Sound- I like the opening theme, the closing, the VAs who did Nanana, Tensai and Daruku\'s voice.Enjoyment- It is enjoyable enough and just like the other who were watching this anime I too fell more on the entertainment side of the anime, where I ignore the potholes that it has.Poor 3.First of all, nearly all of the characters here where somewhat have 2 conflicting side, ok,let\'s go with Juugo on one side he was suppose to be this student who was disowned by his father, ok so if that\'s the case why the fuck does he have to go to such faraway island where most of its population were compose of geniuses? There were also some plot twist where at first he didn\'t recognize Yukihime and Shu as his subordinate, remember the scene where Juugo was capture by the two latters in police uniforms. Another conflicting mystery about him was his interest with the so called ""Nanana Collection"" wher at one point we see him competing with his fellow ""Adventure Club"" mates, competing with his own subordinates and competing with his father, even if he did want to find who killed Nanana, there is still the feeling where he himself might have some selfish desire for the said collection. Nanana, about her, I\'d say that she is one big pothole of a character whether it is in anime or manga, now if she is the author\'s idea of a typical Japanese teen who should grow up fast, then that author really sucks, now I just have no idea what\'s going on inside Kazuma Ōtorino\'s mind as to why he made such character to be a big pothole, let\'s face it, unless she has a genie in the lamp as part of her collection, how can a young girl find so many treasure in a span of let\'s say a few months a be a billionaire immediately and be able to obtain artifacts with magical properties that quickly. Frankly, author  Kazuma Ōtorino wasn\'t really thinking about the potholes but rather he focuses more on the entertainment side of the character which is the reason why I gave this category a three. Tensai, ok her character I can forgive, but her sidekick Daruku....no way, wtf was going in the mind of the author for making him a trap? like EEEEEEEWWWWW!!!!! Now then let\'s go to the adventure\'s club, nearly what they are, what about them and what they stand for wasn\'t very clear, co\'z at one point they seem to be a bunch of greedy treasure hunters and on the other, they seem to be a bunch of adventurers.Decent 4.Overall- It was ok to such point, but I just can\'t ignore the potholes and the plot twistes that this anime presents, but given that it was still entertain enough without much of the fanservice, I believe that such ""Decent"" score would be enough for this anime.Season 2????????????I\'d probably give a benefit of a doubt. I\'m guessing this is another one of them Japanese teens who have to grow up fast, but not that fast, If it were me I would made it that  Nanana got her treasure by through inheritance from her grand father who is a renowned adventurer , where 20% of the cache are magical artifacts and the rest where she was able to use to make more money and make her ""Nanana Island Project"" a reality, and here is the mystery.... she was murdered by someone in her family who wants those magic artifacts.

Set some years in the future Nanana is now dead, murdered by an unknown assailant and unable to move on to whatever lies beyond. She now “haunts” the room she was killed in, and offers the occasional hint to would be treasure hunters who want to find her “treasures”, rare items from around the world Nanana collected while alive to help fund the creation of the island, which she later hid in elaborate artificial dungeons apparently just for fun....Now a new generation of students on the island are after Nanana's treasures. Each has their own motivations, back stories, and bring their own set of talents to the hunt. They end up clashing with each other in interesting ways, and with veterans of the hunt they run into along the way. The focus is on our young hero who is quickly sucked into helping the ghost of Nanana find her killer after being tricked into renting the apartment she is still haunting.About the only criticism I have of the story is it felt a little rushed at 11 episodes. It is great that there is character development, it feels like most of the characters change in some significant way from their starting state, but with only 11 episodes to do it in some of the changes feel abrupt. Seems like there will be more however, so I can see myself rating any further editions higher if they bring the plot to a reasonable close and keep this pace of character development.I really feel like this series did a good job of mixing the ordinary, extraordinary, and fantastical. Yes, the characters are bad asses, particularly for high school students, but not so much you can't relate to them. Nanana is a ghost and her artifacts are magical, but they still have limits and weaknesses. All in all, I marathoned this in two sessions and would recommend the series to others. You'll find the art and music up to the usual standards, although nothing spectacular. It's really the story and characters that stand out here.

Well, they're all part of Yama Juugo's new life on Nanae Island.Overall: 8Nanana's Buried Treasure is an anime that deserves more praise than it gets. Colorful art and a fresh story bring a fantastic tale to the table. The characters personalities contrast beautifully with each other. The big issue is that the short, 11 episode series doesn't feel like a complete series in itself. We needed a longer time to be able to explore more ruins. The lore that's presented during the shows run, and the fantastic powers...within the treasure needed more time. All in all, Nanana's Buried Treasure is a must watch, if you like lighthearted fun, with a bit of drama and adventure.Story: 8Yama Juugo is moving to an island made for students. He moves into an apartment, only to find a ghostly NEET girl with a love for pudding already there. With no money left to be able to move, Juugo decides to bare with it. He eventually learns that the ghost with unsettled business, Ryuugajou Nanana, is one of the island's founders, as well as an esteemed adventurer with her magical treasures hidden around the island.Sounds kinda weird, huh? With such a creative and new concept, this Spring 2014 anime brought an amazing adventure to the season. The story is interesting and complex. Different twists pop up throughout the series, keeping you locked into the anime.Only problem is, the series end doesn't bring any closure. It feels like an arc, lacking a bigger story.Art: 8Nanana's Buried Treasure's island setting  gives it the perfect spot for gorgeous artwork. Sadly, the story doesn't allow for much of that, as it mostly takes place in the city. Backgrounds still look nice, and character designs are lovely. Especially the eyes.

Oh Juugo.Yama Juugo is the main protagonist of the anime. Juugo is a fairly complicated individual, from a shady background. Not only is he in top physical condition, but for once, we have a smart main character. Decently smart at least. Juugo is a great example for other anime protagonists.

The story and plot are really interesting but they are not completely described in these 11 episodes. Though I would\'ve loved if this anime got a sequel. It\'s an enjoyable anime, kinda like a ""just watch and go with it"" without worrying much about character developments, plot holes and event stories.Let\'s get with the review;Story 8/10:An island for students has several treasure items having special powers. They are called Nanana\'s Treasures since she was the one to find them. But Nanana is now dead and her ghost occupies the room of Yama Jugo, our...protagonist. Jugo aims to find Nanana\'s killer to help her pass on. Alongwith that, he and some friends and enemies are in the race to find all of Nanan\'s Hidden Treasures. Comedy goes hand in hand in each episode.Art 10/10:Not KyoAni but still pretty amazing. Almost all the characters were amazingly designed, even the side characters. Animation is one part of this anime that you will definitely enjoy.Sound 7/10:Not a fan of the opening or ending song.Character 8/10:Hmmmm, I really liked this anime but the characters leave a lot to be desired. First of all, this anime doesn\'t go into the past of the main characters. You don\'t get to know more about the characters in the anime i.e. their past, their relations and their motives. Neither are we told much about the island\'s past, the Great 7, The Three Skulls and many other important characters that are key to the story. This part may leave many disappointed but like I said before, these 11 episodes are similar to a short arc taken from a big story. If they were to explain each character in detail, it would make it a much bigger anime and a more interesting one. Though, it is good nonetheless but in the end, it leaves the watchers longing for more character info which kinda bums me out.As for the characters themselves, they are pretty cool. Some might be hated at the start but once their motives are cleared, you change your views about them. As for the protagonist, he has quite a hidden side which remains hidden from us as well but is shown in the anime from time to time. Side characters are also pretty decent e.g. the class rep. As for Nanana herself, she is pretty kawaii and quite an interesting and funny character.Enjoyment 8/10:It\'s my second time watching this anime and I must say, I was not bored. It\'s got nice comedy, quite a few eye candy and some nice characters that seem pretty cool. Let me make one thing clear, this is a supernatural comedy type anime. It is stated that is a romance anime but there isn\'t much romance aside from the occasional blushing scenes. So, don\'t expect much of a romance from this anime.Overall, an enjoyable and interesting series to watch and leaves me demanding for a sequel which would be quite a joy.

But it really wasn't a bad idea to watch it. So let's get on with my review, shall we?Story : 8The story starts with three high school girls running into a cave chuck full of traps. Okay... That was the first scene. Anyway, the story's about Rugajou Nanana playing Phantasy Star Online 2. Jk. Jokes aside, we have Yama Juugo as our MC, a sixteen-year old kid who stumbled into Nanae Island, a man-made island somewhere in the Pacific. Apparently, he was exiled from his household and ends up...in a weird situation(as if shounen MC's don't run into 'em oftenly). He founds a cheap apartment, but someone's already living in it, well, not an alive human being, though. Ryuugajou Nanana, a girl who was killed and now trapped in Juugo's room. She can't pass on unless someone finds the one responsible for her death. Juugo decides to find who the culprit is to help Nanana pass on. And he discovers that Nanana was one of the seven high-school students(then) who made Nanae island, and the fact that Nanana had hidden lots of treasure within the island. The treasures are a lot valuable; most of them possess mysterious powers. So obviously, a lot of who-knows-who would try to collect them. Juugo needs to collect the treasures in order to find clues about Nanana's killer. So Juugo decides to join the Adventure club on his school, a club entirely focused on collecting Nanana's treasures.Art : 8Decent art, no flaws or whatsoever. Detailed backgrounds. It's 2014, having stupid art decreases your viewers by an average of 50%. Jk. Nothing much to tell here.Characters : 7Characters here are good. Although, where they came from or how they can do something like this or that weren't confirmed. Since there's thousands of series made already, it's almost impossible to have an original character now(in terms of look). In Yuugo's case, he doesn't differ that much from the other shounen MC's out there. What confuses me is about his past. In the past he said he wanted to help all the people in the world. But presently in the story, he always say he doesn't want to help people. It's confusing. I wish they'd confirm how really Juugo feels like(if they make a sequel). Of course, how can I forget about our Loli detective Tensai-chwan?! She resembles a lot like Taiga, but she's blonde. She figures the most complicated things in just a snap of a finger, nothing less from our Loli detective. We've got a trap too, guess who he is when you watch the show.Music : 6Didn't like it that much. Nothing else.Enjoyment : 7I'm not a fan of mystery solving shows. In Ryuugajou's case, it involves a bit of highly difficult puzzles only the characters in-show can solve. Quite the logic, no? And being with only 11 episodes, the puzzles are solved within 5 minutes by our resident loli-master detective Tensai-chwaaaaan. The first few episodes were confusing as heck, it's kinda hard getting your grip into Ryuugajou's boo-- I meant plot. But you'll definitely enjoy the last few episodes. Not the anti-climatic finish to it, though. =|Overall : 8Ryuugajou might look like it's your ordinary harem rom-com series, but trust me, it ain't one. It seems comical at times, though. And it contains a little bit of romance in it. But the plot's not originally about a guy being flocked by girls. It's much more than that. Although the series was short, it didn't waste my time. In fact, I was amused how the story progressed. Some scenes will make you scratch your head, though. The lack of background stories among characters kinda put me off, too. They'd just throw you a thing and won't say a thing on how to use it. Genius, eh? I can't blame them, though. With just 11 episodes, it's really hard cramping all of 'em side stories on it. Heck, even 20+ series are having a hard time doing it. To be exact, Ryuugajou has potential being great if it continues to follow the action path. If they decide to put another season into it and focus on the things they've missed this season, they might make it big. And maybe because of the anti-climatic ending, some even hated the series. I myself became pissed momentarily. But I think it's all for the good of the series. Overall, Ryuugajou's boo-- I mean plot is good, following it with a much more serious sequel will be great. Therefore, I conclude, my review is finished. in a weird situation(as if shounen MC's don't run into 'em oftenly).

Heck, even 20+ series are having a hard time doing it. To be exact, Ryuugajou has potential being great if it continues to follow the action path. If they decide to put another season into it and focus on the things they've missed this season, they might make it big. And maybe because of the anti-climatic ending, some even hated the series. I myself became pissed momentarily. But I think it's all for the good of the series. Overall, Ryuugajou's boo-- I mean plot is good, following it with a much more serious sequel will be great. Therefore, I conclude, my review is finished."", 'Nanana\'a Buried Treasure is a short series that takes the audience on a peculiar roller-coaster ride. It begins with the central protagonist, Juugo Yama, moving into an apartment occupied by a lingering ghost Nanana Ryuugajou. She enjoys playing video games, eating pudding, and being very enigmatic to her true interests. After wrestling with Nanana and finding out she was murdered, Juugo vows to find her murderer so she can find peace.The plot center\'s on Juugo\'s accumulation of ""friends"" and the solving of different puzzles for items that possess considerable (if not conditional) powers. Juugo hopes to use Nanana\'s treasure to piece together the clues...to her untimely death.Due to its brevity, the series suffers from trying to do too much per episode. It lacks an interesting plot, and possesses minimal character development. Episodes typically involve introducing supporting characters and a new puzzle, while sprinkling in a few jokes. This is not to say the series is not enjoyable.Despite its noticeable flaws, Nanana\'s Buried Treasure is capable of capturing the audience\'s sense of adventure and curiosity enough to finish the series without regret.The characters are the biggest problem with the show.The antagonists are not necessarily clear, often too quickly (easily) switching sides. The fan-pandering, while not in your face, is similar to an alarm clock going off every 10 or 15 minutes. It is not incredibly irksome, but every so often it manifests and dilutes the quality of the episode. For example, Tensai Ikkyuu the aspirational detective, possess an assistant that is both useless and incompetent. Her assistant is a boy who dresses up as a maid (for reasons unknown) and unlike Dr. Watson, does not compliment Tensai\'s inductive reasoning skills at all. He(She) clearly exist only to satisfy some target market\'s fetish.The rest of the supporting case equally lacks much purpose aside from Yukihime. She acts not only as a concerned elder sister-figure, but clearly has a deeper level of romantic feeling with Juugo. Even though later it is revealed that many of the characters have additional motives, they lack much complexity or elaboration to stir additional intrigue for the audience. While Juugo possesses a bit of a selfishness streak, he never really breaks the mold of the cookie cutter ""just a good guy doing stuff because it\'s right"" archetype. The female lead Nanana, while a charming character, does not get enough screen time. Her interactions with Juugo were always unpredictable and stirred some interest in the plot. As the series gets past the halfway mark, even the lead antagonist never evolves beyond the prototypical bad guy that only who seeks power.While the supporting cast is lackluster, the art and character design of the series is superb. This might be largely due to the series being short and having a higher than typical allocated budget per episode. Regardless, the art and animation is stellar, with no noticeable drop-off in the later episodes. Visually, the show is one of the better anime series this Spring season.The sound and voice acting is also good, with the character\'s design matching the overall actor\'s voice. Line delivery is energetic, despite average writing. The music is slight quirky, but it matches the show\'s overall tone and is relatively pleasant.Overall, Nanana\'s Buried Treasure is a decent show, with only one or two episodes that could have had better execution. The show never becomes unpleasant to watch, despite the obvious fetish pandering. The show manages to remain fun throughout and is worth a viewing, despite low re-watch value. to her untimely death.Due to its brevity, the series suffers from trying to do too much per episode.

However, she is a ghost who is searching for her killer. She has hidden the treasure she has gathered in her life time around the city and Juugo is tracking them down to help her achieve her goal. However, fairly early on there is a major twist in the anime that does take time to get used to, but ultimately raises the stakes.However, the story...does not go very far in the 11 episodes the show has. The ending does not even fall on a spot where there is some closure and the pacing is off balanced due to the number of reveals the show commits to. The anime is very fast paced overall and a lot of the transitions seem a bit jarring. Even so, it does remain interesting throughout.The characters are somewhat of a mixed bag. Juugo, for a male protagonist, is actually pretty well rounded. He clearly likes girls, but is actually focused on his goals. Also, while he is quick to protect people, he is not against venting his annoyances. He's pretty realistic personality wise as far as anime goes. But he also has no real major strengths either besides being somewhat refreshing.Nanana, the title character, has some interesting past but none of it is explored during the show. She gets no development and it's even questionable to call her a main character as her involvement overall is fairly limited. She is likable enough, but again, not very special. However, then we get to Tensai, the true hero of the anime. She claims to be a master detective and while this seems like a bogus claim at first, she actually makes good on her claim. She's most likely among the smartest and most cunning of the cast and it contrasts pretty well with the rest of the cast.There are of course a lot of side characters. A couple of them get some backstory and development, but nothing very major at all. A lot of the characters really seem to be moving from point A to B to get to a treasure using various means.One of the most exciting parts of the anime are the treasure rooms. They are huge puzzles the characters must solve to get to the treasure, and they all can be deadly. It's very much akin to Phi-Brain, but the animation and characters make it more enjoyable. When they get to one it's almost like the anime telling you this is going to be pretty awesomeFrom an animation standard it has it's own flare to say the least. However, a lot of the characters just seem to blend into each other after a while. The only ones with really distinctive styles are Nanana and Tensai, and the latter is more due to her outfit than anything else. However, that is not to say the animation is bad... it's actually quite solid. The sound is kind of weird for the anime overall, I mean the OP and ED are both solid and imo fit the show a lot better than some of the IN tracks.Nanana might have hidden a true ending away somewhere but it's not to be found in eleven episodes. I know this is a broken record but this anime honestly did the best it could with such limited time.

Well, it was cheap for a reason, it seems there's a ghost girl that comes with it as a bonus. The ghost's name is Nanana Ryuugajou, who was murdered and It seems her treasures are somehow related to the culprit. Now, it's Juugos job to find who did that to her by finding the treasures! Sounds fun? Well, it is.This show is unique for it's timeslot, Noitamina.,who is known for having unique series such as Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile and...AnoHana. Their target demographic ranges from young adults to adults. So this is new for them since the genre of this series is shonen( young boys) and a light novel to add on that. Don't mistake me, I'm all for experimentations. It seems Noitamina is losing to it's competitor, Animeism. So how did they do? Not really that good.The plot is unique, as well as the setting but what really took the cake was the ruins. It was really planned out. Though the anime, didn't really do justice on that. (Some ruins are based of concepts but due to time restraints they didnt bother explaining how they solved that.)The animation is your typical A1 production, Crisp and smooth. The series is notable for its fight scenes (although pretty short!) and there are some hiccups some (they look constipated). There are some uncanny CGs but nothing really to write about.The BG's are well conceptualized(specially the ruins and the buildings in the island). All through out, a pretty well- budgeted show.Music was okay. The upbeat opening and the ending was suitable for a wacky treasure hunting series like this. The BGM did fine setting the mood of some scenes(ruins part) but some are just plain ridiculous (do your job properly, sound director!)The characters in this show is…. stereotypical aside from the Juugo( you'll see what I mean) and Tensai(not being bias here). You'll notice it when you see them their character is based from what they look like but weirdly it somehow works. But what really ticked me off was unfortunately the title girl herself, Nanana. She's really unlikeable. And her liking pudding and video games to give her personality is not really working. In the first episode, she asks Juugo to a fight so they can decide who can be the king of the room (which is supposed to be Juugo in the first place since he's the one paying the rent and necessities). Sure, that seems fair, oh wait. She's a ghost. Instaloss right there bud. Heck, without that I can't imagine how Juugo manages to stay a day with her. Despite those(her), the show makes up for it's unique stories and twists.The hard thing for Noitamina shows are they're always 11 episodes, which can be a double -edged sword.

She is currently bound to the room she was murdered in, which is where Yama Juugo comes in - he is assigned to this room, which sets us up for his adventures to find the Nanana's collection treasures.A decently original idea, told pretty well - the show had plenty of running gags,...some got old quickly and some remained pretty funny (at least for me), sometimes it was unnecessary but most of the time, when it needed to be, there was a more serious feel.So the story basically revolves around Juugo's quest to find Nanana's collection and the adventures he has during that search and the people he consequently meets.Art - 8/10.Although the character design was nothing hugely original, and the style quite common of contemporary anime, it was animated well nonetheless. The scenes were set pretty well, especially those in the ruins (which is where Nanana had hidden the treasures from her collection). Each ruins was different and had a unique style to it which was interesting to behold.Sound - 7/10.To be honest, as with most anime I watch, unless it's outstandingly atmospheric the music in the background is mostly just more of a scene-setter, so I don't notice it unless it stands out - I don't remember thinking any of the sounds were out of place or anything but nothing outstanding. The scene was set by sounds well when it came to the ruins though, I thought.The voice acting was pretty on-par, nothing really stood out to me though. Emotions were portrayed pretty accurately and it didn't make me feel like it was being forced, which is always a plus.The OP set us up for a nice relatively light-hearted episode of adventure and fun which was fitting.Character - 7/10.Nothing hugely original in the character department. You have your main male and female leads and the Adventure Club (mostly).Juugo is a pretty standard perverted male protagonist, though his development especially in his relationship with Nanana is portrayed well - at first they merely tolerate one another but their relationship develops quite well throughout the series. Nanana is a little unusual of a character - she's a ghost, but she's not the standard vengeful type - instead, she has NEET tendencies and loves pudding. As previously stated her relationship with Juugo develops quite nicely throughout the series as they come to harmonise more with one another.Tensai is a character I couldn't really stomach. Although she was admittedly clever and helpful, she was pretty far up her own ass, so it was hard to appreciate what she was doing as more than a way to confirm her own opinion of herself. She had a couple of tender moments but for the most part I didn't really enjoy her tsundere-ish tendencies.Daruku was a token trap, and the source of the majority of the running gags in the show (along with Juugo's pervertedness). Doesn't really play much of a role in the show other than to provide aforementioned gags, so I didn't find he/she added much to the story.Other than that, the antagonist is worth a mention though he only appears in the latter few episodes, he spices things up a little.Enjoyment - 8/10.Though this series was short, it was decent overall and I did enjoy watching it every week to see what our characters would get up to. The ending left quite a lot to be desired, though, and no loose ends were really tired - this gives rise to the question of another season. some got old quickly and some remained pretty funny (at least for me), sometimes it was unnecessary but most of the time, when it needed to be, there was a more serious feel.So the story basically revolves around Juugo's quest to find Nanana's collection and the adventures he has during that search and the people he consequently meets.Art - 8/10.Although the character design was nothing hugely original, and the style quite common of contemporary anime, it was animated well nonetheless.

Also the animation when they find a treasure when the room changes is very nice and looks extremely well done.Sound: 10The OST is well done and each...track fits well into each scene that it is placed in without it feeling out place, the opening song is a really good fit for the show as it has an upbeat feeling which fits the theme of the show as well as not spoiling anything in the opening and is fun to watch. Equally the ending has a nice feel to it but does not quite match up to the op but is equally as good in song choice.Characters: 8The characters to follow some of the basic types like Tensai=Tsundere and Yugihime=Yandere, but I felt the rest of the characters were a bit more unique as well as some un expecting traps in it, such as Juugo has the appearance of a support character which is un expecting as it feels odd but is refreshing from the spiky haired or depressed characters in most anime.Enjoyment: 9I enjoyed it as it was fun, interesting and funny, I loved the trials they had to take to get the treasure as well as how the characters interacted with each other.Actual Score: 8.8 track fits well into each scene that it is placed in without it feeling out place, the opening song is a really good fit for the show as it has an upbeat feeling which fits the theme of the show as well as not spoiling anything in the opening and is fun to watch.

It didnt seem consistent to me at all, it would keep jumping from story to story without ever really finishing anything up ( maybe they are saving to tell everything in a second season??) but the story was actually decent the pacing...was nice, but still kind of jumped around it seemed like.The characters in this anime were for the most part likeable and fun. Yama juugo was my favorite character, had a nice sense of humour, never wanted his ego to get the better of him, always tries his best to help out someone in need, and was not your typical ""over powerful, over whatever"" kind of guy, was just an average jock looking for an apartment and got one with a ghost inside, nanana i thought needed more screen time personally, i thought she was an interesting character but didnt get much development, tensai was also a very cool and interesting character (maybe jugos love interest??) but she was very smart in figuring everything out and wasent annoying like most other heorines (i think i spelled that right), and there are many more good characters in the show you just have to watch it.I was in love with the openings and endings, the songs were a perfect fit for the show and didnt spoil anything like every shounen anime does, and the sound in the anime was nice too.Animations were also very well done, very fluid, good art on the characters. Overall it had the shiny look and appeal on the characters.Overall i really enjoyed this series, had quite a few laughs, even some intense feels, some romance here and there, evil schemes, superpowers, just a great show. I was very sad to see it end at the last episode (which is a very good ending episode IMO)I highly recommend this!

You will have to watch it to know more!', 'You Can Always Check Out My Youtube Channel For the Video ReviewBut Here is the written ReviewStory - 7/10The story begins as our protagonist Juugo Yama is exiled by his family’s business. And he is forced to transfer to the ‘Special Student Zone’, which is an artificial island, created by Nanana. And Juugo loved being sent here. The Special Student Zone is an island, housing students, providing a ludicrous amount of courses by a huge amount of schools as well. Student’s make up most of its population, hence it’s a educational facility, sort of like a university of some sort. I kind of did wish...they elaborate and explored more into detail on the setting of the show.After getting tricked to live in low end apartment, Juugo must live with a ghost who occupies the apartment and cannot leave the apartment as well, as she, Nanana, was killed in it. And since Jugo doesn’t have the money to move out, he accepts this fact and just goes with it.The plot is the adventure, Juugo has to go through in order to find out who Nanana’s killer is. He believes, the more of her treasure he finds, the more information he’ll get out of Nanana. So the main premise of the show is a bunch of teenagers, hunting treasure, known as Nanana’s collection. Which are items that contain supernatural powers, which the user can use for their own benefits.Here is where people will either have a problem or not a problem with the story. That is the amount of plot twists. The show keeps you on your toes and constantly gives plot twists everywhere. So with the amounts of plot twists, it can get confusing to some people. And with being only 11 episodes long, it felt kind of rushed, with the amount of plot they were trying to fit in. However, in those 11 episodes, I’ve never thought, I would love almost every character in the show. The characters usually are the focal point of the plot twists, and this is what makes the show interesting and keeps you on your feet.Characters - 9/10I wouldn’t say Juugo Yama is your typical protagonist, he does have a rather interesting backstory which I won’t spoil. Because every character has interesting plot twists. Juugo joins the adventure club in order, to please Nanana, and collect her treasures to find out more about her past, but that’s not all there is. No one ever doubts Juugo’s athleticism, but he does usually get overpowered, because he is the most normal out of everyone in the group. He has great sense of moral, he seems to be the one helping people in need, while being openly perverted, and has a keen eye for things.The adventure club president is, Isshin Yuiga. As the president of the adventure club he watches over the other club members, while also supplying them with information on where the treasure/ruin is hidden. Now although, he seems like a highly respectable senior, he has the ultimate and yet absurd goal of something you’re probably not going to expect as a student, and he’ll do anything to achieve it. Not going to spoil too much. He’s also apparently popular with the girls, as the club-vice president, Yuu Ibara, has the biggest crush on him, yet he ignores her.  Another person who works with the adventure club is Kagetora Tsurezure, who serves as Isshin’s perverted henchmen, and is kind of there for comic relief, despite his serious looking appearance.Here is our star of and my personal favourite in the series. Tensai Ikkyu. She serves as the brains of the group, often the one who is solving puzzles for the group. She claims to be the world number one master detective, and she deserves that title despite everyone doubting her. She serves as the Sherlock for everyone, as she is usually the first to find out about everyone’s true motives and goes onto explain how the mystery is being solve, and it’s so satisfying when she does it. And every Sherlock needs their Watson, and Daruku Hoshino, the fan service character, with this plot twist. She’s not a boy, but a trap.And let’s not forget who the show is named after, Nanana Ryuugajo. Nanana is actually a ghost who was murdered 10 years prior to the main plot, by an unknown assailant. Because of this unfinished business of not knowing her killer, she cannot rest in peace. All she does all day is eat pudding and play video games, and being ghost, it really helps with that. She used to love adventuring when she was alive and hence built the island, to help young people adventure as well. She gives the adventures hints on where the locations are, and when they’ve found the treasure she tells them how they work. Now Nanana could easily tell the others where all her treasure locations are, but she simply doesn’t want to spoil the fun for anyone. She lives as NEET being bound to her room, she is rather lonely, that is until Juugo moved in.There is a lot different characters in this anime. And all of them have an interesting satisfying motivation on wanting to collect treasure, and it’s that motivation that leads to plot twists and interesting unsuspecting conclusions. However, I do wish some characters got explored more on. Because every character has their own motivations, it can kind of be hard to keep track on them. Also no gender preference on characters, it’s a good split between boys and girls and traps.Animation - 7/10Another A-1 Pictures animation, you’re going to expect bright colours and high quality animation. You’re going to get that in Nanana’s Buried Treasure. I can say the art style especially for the characters is a bit different to the usual anime art style. The characters eyes are very bright, and don’t cover up their whole faces. Also the action scenes where well animated and choreographed as well, it was basic hand to hand combat, but do wish some it lasted longer, especially how most of them ended, anti-climatically. Also the animation for the setups on the puzzle/ruins in show is interesting to watch, on how the challenge gets made. Despite that, watching a mixture of the puzzle switching to gears in between can repetitive, since it’s the same gear tools, which sometimes doesn’t make sense.Sometimes the animation can drop a bit, but for the most part its fine and good to look at. Some of the 3D rendering can look out of place, but not enough to make it blantly distracting and obvious. It’s a fine clean, bright animated series to look at. I may be biased, but the opening song is catchy, however the animation for it, is kind of plain. While the song for the ending is forgettable, but the animation for it seems a bit better, not much though.Enjoyment - 8/10For me I really enjoyed watching the show for the characters. Each main character were interesting and fun to watch, it was really satisfying finding out each of their motives. That being said, the story can be a bit confusing because of all the plot twists. They’ve tried to fit so much into just 11 episodes, so it wouldn’t surprise me if some of it was hard to follow or made no sense. And I believe if you’re not the person who likes going into too much detail, you’re probably not going to enjoy this anime. The humour in the show is not overly funny, but it is quick humour, it happens quickly just to break some small tension here and there, which gives you a quick giggle. I enjoyed watching setups for the puzzles, although it can get repetitive with the gears. Also enjoyed watching the action sequences, but I wished some of them ended better, while also wishing for a more satisfying ending. Because a recurring theme to this anime is ‘anti-climatic.’Verdict - 7.5I think this show is well animated, especially the action scenes and setup scenes for the gears, and the characters have a slightly different art that other anime, which is refreshing. The story is hit or miss. At times it can be confusing and will not appeal to some people, but at the same time its interesting because it keeps you on your toes and if you like that complicated stuff, you’re going to like it. But most of all, the characters are all really interesting, well developed characters. They all have a different motive onto finding the treasures and when they’re truly revealed, it’s satisfying, because most of the time Tensai does it.And with that, I give Nanana’s Buried Treasure a 7.5/10. Because you get it? Nana means 7 in Japanese and a na on it’s own it’s kind of a half, therefore Nanana. It’s an enjoyable series if you’re into complicated plots and interesting mystery characters, but because of it’s difficult to follow storyline, a lot people may get turned off. they elaborate and explored more into detail on the setting of the show.After getting tricked to live in low end apartment, Juugo must live with a ghost who occupies the apartment and cannot leave the apartment as well, as she, Nanana, was killed in it.

It is about a teenage girl, which has the desire of building an utopic city for young people, in the which you can achieve your very own (non-sexual)  dreams and projects, no matter what they are.Bear in mind that i have not read the novel or manga or whatever it is adapted from.Story: 6Although the setup was fantastic for my taste, the way it develops could have been much better and mature. Yes, I seriously felt like I was watching an anime...for kids, or at least people younger than myself, being awkward at times. However, when i came to think of it, these were the elements that help you inmerse yourself into the adventure. I still found them a little cheesy, tho.There are also elements that appear just out of nowhere, or at least they are not explained in a correct way. The way the ""mysteries"" are solved could have been more interactive at times. I seriously felt \'this\' character as it was meant to outsmart the viewer, by not letting anyone see the key clues or observations made to solve the mysteries.The plot progress also lacks direction/focus, and sometimes felt it as it has an identity crisis. It does not know what it wants to achieve.Art: 9The backgrounds are fantastic, and everything, included the characters and even buildings are just full of life, at least from outside. The lack of life indoors gives you that feel of wanting to go outside and go for them adventures :D At least, that\'s the way I saw it.When it comes to the characters design, I found some mixed feelings. The females, as you may expect, are all meant to be seen as hot, or at least really cute and eye-candy. Face expressions are also well detailed. The men, however, are pretty much plain and dull. Due to this, I unconciously saw them as less important than the female cast. Of course, our male lead is the only excepction.Sound: 6Everything was fine. Nothing special.I usually skip Openings and Endings, because I do not care about them.Character: 6Most of the characters were entertaining and likable. Of course there are exceptions.Somehow, I could not quite take any of the characters seriously. They are way too exaggerated for my taste, and their abilities were waaaaaay over the top. I know that you are not meant to relate to them in any way, but the whole cast of this anime was one of the elements that make you go ""No way"" every 5 seconds, but not in a positive shocking way, but more of a ""There\'s no way this is remotely possible"". You will take your inner physics snob out.Enjoyment: 7Although I enjoyed this quite a lot, I often felt like I didn\'t know what I was watching. Specially at the ""plot twist"" at the last few episodes. It\'s like a nerd going to a club. Everything just feels out of place.Overall: 6I am terribly sorry that I kinda have to give this score to this anime, because I liked it.As I mentioned, the setup is so amazing, but it could have been handled better.

There was just no impact.', ""Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is an ongoing light novel and manga series by Otorino Kazuma. Both manga and light novel series began publication in early 2012. In 2014 our old friends at A-1 pictures worked on an eleven episode anime version. I haven't read the novels or manga, so I won't be able to tell you how well the anime series follows either of them. I will, however, tell you how well it stands as its own entity. With that in mind, let's delve into it.Story:Our protagonist, young Yama Juugo, moves to the man-made Nanae Island after being disowned by his father. Once there...he finds a low rent apartment, but there turns out to be a catch. It's haunted. The ghost is Nanana, that isn't a lead up to saying 'Batman' it's actually her name, one of the island's founders. Ten years ago she was murdered in her room and she's been bound to it since. Juugo is approached by his High School's Adventure Club. A group dedicated to finding Nanana's collection, a group of artefacts with magic powers. He joins them, hoping to find something to help him solve Nanana's murder.Let's open with the issues I had with the narrative. The first is that it's a bit inconsistent. To name a big example, Nanana mentions that she was killed from behind and didn't see her attacker, but she somehow knows they had a dragon tattoo on their neck. How exactly did she manage to see their neck and nothing else? You'd think she could at least also give a hair colour, description of their back and be able to tell roughly how tall they were. The tone also shifts a bit. Most of it is more light-hearted and kind of goofy, but they also try to throw in some more serious moments and they don't transition well betwixt the two, resulting in a lack of investment in the serious scenes. I took it more seriously when Q threw the elements of harmony into chaos and that was a program for small children. My final issue was with the ending. I understand that it's difficult to end a single series when there's more to the story. You want some closure, but you also want to keep things open enough to get the audience interested in the continuation. In this case, they try to do it with a climactic battle against an antagonist they've built up and with Nanana's murder still unsolved. However, the execution is pretty weak and the battle ends with a total anti-climax.On the positive side, the premise is an interesting one. The comedic elements are handled decently enough. I also do like that they play Nanana up as a neutral party and not as a being who's only helpful to the main group. As a consequence, you can't say that they only clear ruins ahead of other treasure hunters due to supernatural assistance.Characters:The characters in this aren't badly done, but they also aren't incredibly complex, compelling or funny. All in all, they're pretty standard. That being said, I did rather like Tensai. She can be quite fun. What I didn't like are the relationship dynamics. They're incredibly stilted. There's a moment where certain characters betray others, there's a fight and then everyone goes back to being the bestest of friends. Because that seems like what would happen in that situation.Art:The art is okay. It's mostly pretty standard with some nice effects and designs for the ruins. A bit of fan-service, mostly involving an effeminate male character. So, that's different.Sound:The acting in this is fine. It's not anything special but it's competent enough. The music is done by Hoashi Keigo, who also did work on Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu. The music here isn't as good, but it's all right.Ho-yay:There's a little bit. Some of the other boys demonstrate attraction to our fan-servicey effeminate boy. So, there's that.Final Thoughts:And that's Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin. There are some aspects that are decent, some that are kind of weak but, by and large, it's just an average series. If you really like the sound of the premise, you may like it and it's only eleven episodes, so it wouldn't be a huge time investment to try it. As for me, my rating is going to be a 5/10.

I watched every episode back to back, and I really want to see another season of this, and I feel like this is the type anime that I could rewatch a few times.Well, I hope that this review was helpful."", 'So having just completed the season a few minutes ago I feel like I might as well throw this out there. This\'ll be a spoiler free review.So I started into Nanana about two thirds of the way through the season, just after episode 7 had aired. I had put it on my to-watch earlier but only recently got around to watching it, and damn it was worth it. This is one of those shows that isn\'t particularly amazing at any one aspect, but all of the component parts are well-enough executed that it results in an overall enjoyable experience. This is not as over the...top as Gurren Lagann, or emotionally powerful as AnoHana, or a masterpiece of storytelling like FMA Brotherhood. What it is is a damn fun series that manages to tell a pretty good story with some action and emotional moments thrown in for good measure.Story - 7/10 - The story you\'re going to find here is nothing incredibly new, although there are elements that make it a little bit more fresh feeling than other shows. Nanana is bound to her room after being killed there ten years ago, and now serves as a sort of guide to the people hunting ruins around the island. On a basic level this serves a lot like the video games Nanana loves so much - the characters are sent on a series of fetch quest-style missions to find the ruins and recover the artifacts. Initially it\'s pretty straightforward, but over the course of the story several points of conflict are encountered, which I want to point out is really nice. This is not s straightforward story. There are several parties in play, all with their own motivations, and they\'re represented to a point where you begin to see the MC Juugo as a protagonist - not a good guy, a protagonist. There is not really a clear ""bad guy"" until later in the story. Having these shifting points of conflict allows the show to shift focus without feeling too scattered, although I did drop my score some because it is confusing for the first few episodes until things start to tie together. There\'s good resolution in the story thanks for the most part to the main character, but I\'ll address that in a bit.Art - 8/10 - The style of Nanana really appeals to me. It\'s colorful, nothing feels too bland, and what limited use of CG there is is perfectly acceptable. I particularly like the style of the eyes that the characters have, which initially seems like kind of an odd thing to focus on, but it gives the show its own sort of uniqueness. They\'re not as unique as, say, Katanagatari, but each character has their own thing going on in the ocular department, which is nice. The character designs are solid and feel fitting enough, and there\'s some decent variation thrown in there. Juugo Yama isn\'t much more than a standard brown-haired protag, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing.Sound - 7/10 - There\'s nothing really new being done here in terms of sound, but it\'s certainly not bad. If anything, I was at least able to focus on the other aspects of the show instead of getting thrown off by the sound. The voice acting is all pretty good, and we have a HanaKana trap thrown in there for good measure, so that\'s cool. Tensai in particular is great and demonstrates some good emotional range.Character - 8/10 - The characters are what really make this show for me. They\'re not shining examples of depth, but they\'re not shallow and dismissable either. There\'s some fun and really likable characters here, particularly Tensai, Juugo, Nanana, and Kagetora (who gets robbed of screentime in my opinion, but what\'s there is good). I didn\'t come out of this show hating any one of the characters, which is great. Yama Juugo in particular is nice. There\'s been an influx of characters lately who aren\'t as dense as a fucking neutron star and actually talk about problems that arise, and it\'s a Godsend, I tell ya. Juugo does not beat around the bush. He does not spend three episodes brooding over a misunderstanding. He attacks problems head-on, discusses things with the people he has issues with, and it serves as a great source of resolution throughout the story. Tensai as well is pretty much the most likable character this season, short of Kaori Fujimiya from Isshuukan Friends, but that\'s another matter (ain\'t nobody can touch Kaori when it comes to likability). Every damn time she shows up you know shit is going to get good. She\'s analytical and intelligent without being cold - she\'s not a Sherlock Holmes, cursed with intelligence - she\'s just good, and still has some emotional depth instead of being an ""aloof genius"" type.Enjoyment - 10/10 - I really like this show. I REALLY like this show. It has its flaws, don\'t get me wrong, but damn if I don\'t love it. Enjoyment is the first thing I take into account when watching a show, and while I love literary masterpieces just as much as the next guy, sometimes you just need some fun, and Nanana provides that in spades. Remember playing an RPG where you always started out with fetch quests, and how much you hated them? But as the game progressed, and you got into story and exposition-heavy missions that you pretty much just skipped through, and found yourself wishing more and more for just a good ol\' fetch quest? Ryougajou Nanana no Maizoukin is that blessed fetch quest that pops up and lets your enjoy the simple pleasure of smacking a few rats with your gigantic club once again. top as Gurren Lagann, or emotionally powerful as AnoHana, or a masterpiece of storytelling like FMA Brotherhood.

Thats because it changed enough for my view on it to shift quite a bit, but after everythings been said and done, I can tell you why I like where it stands now, though it could have done some things better.  Nanana\'s buried treasure, as we all know, is basically about a group of adventurers looking for amazing magical artifacts hidden by Nanana, who now is a ghost residing in an apartment room where main character Yama...Juugo (referred to as the title ""Juugo"", or better yet, Mr ""Totally honest and not plotting anything"") resides, bound to a rent contract with an otherwise chill landlord who only wants to drink beer and hang out.  Yes, she is basically an alcoholic TCC-chan.So, what makes this anime something special for this season?  Well, for one, I seriously could not get it out of my head that this was basically an anime version of Indiana Jones X Legend of Zelda (what with the ancient chambers and the action-filled collection of artifacts in treasure chests hidden behind complex traps).  With that out of the way, let me say that as an anime, it held a certain quality to its story that made me unable to really feel like I could totally predict it all, let alone write a review before it was completely over.  I started off thinking that Juugo was just a kid who fell into a sticky situation, and just wanted to check out artifacts and do some general good.  But really, this kid has motives and it\'s not just to find Nanana\'s killer and evict her from his room.  Thats NOT to say he is evil, though, and that right there is the second curve for just one character\'s standing in the show.  Dont worry, its not too complex.  Its still mostly about the search for treasures.I did like the characters a lot.  Weve already talked about Juugo, but I dont consider him to have met all the main protagonist criteria.  Stories are somewhat based around him, and moreso around Nanana-chan.  Those stories involve the group, though.  The girl I call the protagonist other than Nanana would be Master Detective Tensai.  She is literally the deus ex machina of the group\'s conquests.  Her high resolution foresight knows no boundaries, and knowing this, if you pay attention she knows about Juugo before any lines in the show hint that he\'s plotting something.  She IS the real Indiana Jones, in my head.  Then we have Club President Isshin, who is the first runner up to be the antagonist, but really he is just like anyone else- a person whose selfish dreams are considered evil, though theyre honest.  His downfall is that theyre certainly not modest.  He comes around to help the group in the face of a real antagonist, Hiiyo Ikusaba, an ex club member who is anachronistic in his ways.  Whats scary is that his philosophies make a bit of sense, too, and that is why for some reason I was expecting him to come forward as a possible protagonist to the show, but I dont know how they could have done that.  It would have been nice, though, to see more characters who were multifaceted in their role as the story went forward.  There is always one character who we can be sure will not change, though, and that is Nanana.  All throughout the show she is pretty much a cute hikikomori ghost who likes pudding.  I dont get it, whats with it in this anime year?  All the neets like pudding.The art and sound weren\'t 100% on the mark, or that diverse, but it still fit pretty well.  This is especially for the adventuring tunes.  Music is there to add background and the art is there to support the setting, and in the most important places, like the dungeons, it was perfect.  In less important scenes, it wasn\'t awful.  Im certainly glad they werent playing dubstep during a sad moment like one anime this season.So, with that said, I had much enjoyment in this anime.  I wrote this review because i recommend you watch it if you like Indiana Jones X Legend of Zelda anime crossovers, Multi-dimensional characters, cute NEET ghosts, treasure, and side characters who, one second get the shit kicked out of them, the next they are in a full body cast just talking to the group while the group doesnt even ask a question.  Dont pry too hard into that if you dont think its funny because its not important.

It's not insane if it's in an anime though.Story: 8/10The story is very interesting, mainly because it has some mystery to it. Scavenger hunt-type anime are very interesting and that's why I like this anime. Sometimes, there would be scenes where there would be just people talking for about half an episode, which dragged the anime out even though it was 11 episodes. It wasn't that funny to me, but that doesn't matter mainly because the mystery in the anime overpowers the comedy. There's...also romance in the anime but it was very slight. Though there is action, it's quite boring but adds to the mystery side of how each of the 'Nanana's Collection' works.Art: 10/10The art is magnificent and I have never seen any illustrator draw eyes that colorful. The animation is really smooth, for example the gears in the ruins or the chest animation. I would even say that this anime has one of the best art in all of the anime I have watched.Sound: 8/10The OST fit each scene nicely and the sounds of the gears or magic weapons being used is quite nice. To me, even though the OP and ED was nice and catchy, it didn't quite fit the theme of this anime. The OP and ED had more of a slice-of-life vibe to it, rather than a supernatural/mystery vibe, though it doesn't affect the anime that much.Character: 9/10When I first heard Yama Juugo's voice, I instantly recognized it as the voice actor of Kuroko no Basket's Kagami Taiga. I saw the list of characters and their voice actors and boom, I was right.Yama Juugo, the protagonist of the story. I would think that he is a very overpowered character with that 'cool' vibe, but he's somewhat weak and is a pervert, but he can control himself most of the times. He's very kind and always thinks of others before himself.Ryuugajou Nanana, a ghost NEET who has been living on pudding for a decade (or maybe even more). She's a very famous figure in Nanae Island, as one of the Great 7s who planned the island, though Nanana is bound to room 202 and is forever stuck in there, until she can move on. She's a very cheerful girl and would help Juugo whenever he is depressed.Ikkyuu Tensai, the master detective and probably one of the smartest people in all of the anime I have watched. Once she finds clues, she will figure the problem out instantly. She cares for Juugo and is good friends with Nanana.Enjoyment: 9/10I really would like to see more anime that have a story like this. I really like mystery, because that would make me watch the anime more and wouldn't bore me.Overall: 8/10Even though this anime ended on a cliffhanger and it was 11 episodes short, I still give it an 8 mainly because it was an original story and it intrigued me.The anime can be violent, so this isn't for the light-hearted.

I have high hopes for this anime, but sadly it did not live to my expectations. I have high expectations of A-1 Pictures considering their track record of producing quality anime, which make it so hard for me to tell you that this is only a decent anime and only watch it if you don't mind this anime leaving you with a lot of questions.TL;DR: It has a rather confusing plot from the start and the creators did not do a very good job to try and...make it less confusing from the start, but it does get better. However, it has many cliffhangers so many questions unanswered, you should only watch it if you don't mind them. Overall: 7/10 ~Not great in terms of my scoring system. Mediocre.~Spoiler Alert~Story: 5/10It really does seem to me that the creators did not try very hard to form a cohesive beginning to a story that has many characters which does confuse the audience. I can see that the creators then make an effort to improve in the stringing of story plot which make the viewing experience better. However, after all said and done, the eleven episodes really was too short and the creators are probably trying for a second season, which may not happen. It make the audience end with too many questions about what happens to multiple characters in the anime as the creators try to cliff-hang the audience, it leaves a general bad taste for many people, in my opinion, which you may or may not agree with. Nonetheless, it was a decent effort but the creators had too many ideas for a very short anime which is definitely not a good thing.Art: 9/10The animation of the characters and the animations in the anime during the ruins were really magnificent, the gears animation was impeccable. I really have to say that the animators really did spent a large portion of their budget on the animation. Thus, I believe affecting the quality of the actual story plot. I really have to say kudos to the staffs at A-1 Pictures of such a high quality animation.Sound: 7/10The opening and ending are catchy. However, I realize that the sounds in the anime is a bit lacking. The sounds did not support the animation as much and was slightly disappointing.Character: 9/10 ~ Good, Higher band of 9 ~The characters were memorable and the bad guys was really indelible. There is also a trap, Daruku, which is funny how fetish interjections into the anime really make the anime, overall much more interesting and easy to continue watching. Tensai, Nanana, Juugo is an interesting triangle, the creators deliberately make it so that any hint of romance is almost none, which I think that if they had a chance this eleven episode anime could be a big hint with a love triangle or even a final confession of some sort. :) Wait there is still Yukihime which could also be a contender?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Enjoyment: 8/10I really had a nice and easy time watching this. The animation paired with the funny characters , contrasting characteristics and hidden-self was what really got me going.Overall: 7/10I wanted to give 8/10, however I think that it is really under performing from its true potential. If the creators could create what this anime was first thought out to be, I believe that this would be one of the best anime ever.

The premise is rather weak and offers nothing really innovative: faux-real world with something that strikes things out of the ordinary from time to time. The strength of this show is certainly not here, though the story is enough to give space for the characters to give their best. If I tried to recommend Ryūgajō Nanana no Maizōkin on his story alone I'd probably fail to attract anybody.I'm not going to spoil anything, but the really disappointing part was the ending: there's nothing worse than a show that doesn't...know what to do with itself, or doesn't have the courage to drive itself to a definite goal.Art: Nothing to say here, it hasn't left me open-mouthed, but it's certainly high quality. The CGI is scarce and well used, with no attempt to render the characters with it, which is a good thing in my opinion. The characters stand out from each other very well and the sceneries are ok; I didn't notice any particular fall in quality or in the amount of details.Sound: Most of this will fall under personal preference, but I personally disliked the opening and ending: I found them extremely generic and not particularly pleasant to listen; I never once was compelled to let them run from start to end after having heard them once.As for the soundtrack as a whole, while still not particularly remarkable, it had its moments and it was noticeable during the action scenes, with its main flaw possibly being variety: there weren't many different tracks and the fact that some of them were reused in very similar situations time and again made the similarities in those scenes easier to notice, which draws away from the enjoyment.Characters: In my opinion, the real strength of the show. Though the bane of modern anime, archetypes, are still present, the characters themselves are evidently not slaves to them and at least some of them showed a very good characterisation that was definitely remarkable to me, and surprised me at times during twists in the plot. The protagonist is definitely not one-dimensional and that is a really, really important pillar for any show to have. The major flaw I could find in this area of the show must be that, probably because of production and running time, some characters were skimmed upon very superficially and others didn't have the screen time to show their potential. I think the show would have benefit from a slightly longer format, perhaps around 15 episodes instead of 11.Enjoyment: Action sequences were definitely good, the moves and styles of every character were noticeably diverse and not monotonous; again nothing that made me stop in awe compared to other shows I've seen, but that's really the only flaw.Comedy is present to some extent and I must say it made me giggle from time to time, which, as a person with a twisted sense of humour and about the same tendency to laugh of a cold rock underwater, I found it amusing enough to consider it good.Character relations aren't stereotyped, with very few exceptions, and that was certainly good to see. know what to do with itself, or doesn't have the courage to drive itself to a definite goal.Art: Nothing to say here, it hasn't left me open-mouthed, but it's certainly high quality. The CGI is scarce and well used, with no attempt to render the characters with it, which is a good thing in my opinion. The characters stand out from each other very well and the sceneries are ok; I didn't notice any particular fall in quality or in the amount of details.Sound: Most of this will fall under personal preference, but I personally disliked the opening and ending: I found them extremely generic and not particularly pleasant to listen; I never once was compelled to let them run from start to end after having heard them once.As for the soundtrack as a whole, while still not particularly remarkable, it had its moments and it was noticeable during the action scenes, with its main flaw possibly being variety: there weren't many different tracks and the fact that some of them were reused in very similar situations time and again made the similarities in those scenes easier to notice, which draws away from the enjoyment.Characters: In my opinion, the real strength of the show. Though the bane of modern anime, archetypes, are still present, the characters themselves are evidently not slaves to them and at least some of them showed a very good characterisation that was definitely remarkable to me, and surprised me at times during twists in the plot.

The traps they have to get past are actually deadly so you feel a real sense of danger when their getting through them. The puzzles, too, are very challenging and it\'s satisfying and fulfilling when they solve them.The only complaint I have is that because they\'re is so few episodes you only get to see the characters beat two or three different Ruins in total.Characters 7/10The show has a lot of good characters and they all want the treasure for their own reasons, and they aren\'t afraid to step over each other to get it.Juugo: I like Juugo because he has this determined, never-give-up, heroic kind of attitude that makes you want to cheer him on during the action scenes. Also, you learn more about his past later in the story like what the real reason he came to Nanae Island is.Nanana: Nanana is your typical goofy, happy-go-lucky anime girl, but that\'s what I like about her; she brings a lot of humor to each episode and is a real joy to be around. However, Nanana only makes very brief appearance and is usually only in an episode for like three or four minutes before moving on.Tensai: Tensai is my favorite character; Tensai\'s dream is to become a master detective and for her finding the Nanana\'s treasures is more about the challenge and proving her mystery-solving skills. I love how she doesn\'t care what other people think and acts like she lives in her own little world. Also. it amazes me how smart she is and how she always solves the puzzle before anyone else. Plus, there\'s this running joke where Tensai thinks of Juugo as her rival and Juugo just ignores her that\'s just hilarious to me.Yukihime & Shuu: Yukihime & Shuu are a pair of thieves also after the treasure and I really like both of them, Shuu more than Yukihime, but the problem is they\'re only in three or four episodes which is really disappointing  because they\'re such cool characters.Ikusaba: Ikusaba only appears the last three episodes, but he\'s such a great villain I just had to comment on him. Ikusaba will do anything to get the treasure and will crush anyone that gets in his way. He sometimes has other people get the treasure for him, but he\'ll throw them away as soon as he no longer needs them. Also, he\'s sadistic and will laugh as he crushes your bones. I really wish he was in more episodes.Others: The show has a few more characters like Isshin and Yuu, but their really isn\'t enough focus on them for me to say anything about them other than they also want the treasure.Overall: Nanana\'s Buried Treasure is a good anime and was fun to watch, but really would\'ve been better with a few more episodes. The characters could\'ve developed more and it\'d be fun to watch them have more adventures.WARNING: I do have a few unanswered questions :Why did all the treasure chests have ""777"" on them?Who is Leprechaun (the person who hid the treasures)?How come Yun lost her memory?And what was with those after credit scenes in the last episode?

Were they building up to Season 2?', ""Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin – Full ReviewI think that I would have to say that Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin (Nanana’s Buried Treasure) was one of the more underrated shows this season. Not as many people were talking about it over others such as No Game No Life and Black Bullet. However, just as the name suggests, if you managed to find this hidden anime, you’d have found yourself a real gem.Story (8.5/10)I think Nanana’s Buried Treasure provides a really well rounded approach. There’s almost something for everyone – Ranging from well choreographed and epic fighting scenes to adorable moments to gaming references to extremely interesting...puzzle solving.Where this anime truly shines is how the directors cleverly add plenty of foreshadowing elements in the episodes, and allow you to slowly piece together each of them to try and figure out what is going on. When they do reveal and connect all these elements, that is when the “wow-factor” kicks in. You’ll either be amazed at how well these linked together, or the fact that you managed to connect the dots before the reveal.Additionally, there are modern day ruins in this anime, where our heroes try to solve them in order to obtain the treasures held within. What’s great is that every clue on how to solve the ruins are laid out nicely, so that you’d also have a shot at trying to solve it, while our main characters crack their brains. Of course, due to time constraints, the time to solve the ruins would be rather short, but feel free to pause and think about it.What slightly docks points from the story is that some of the character interactions don’t really flow that realistically. For instance, one minute they could be fighting to the death, the next they just could talk to each other nicely. Fortunately, this doesn't happen that often.That being said, there were also some incredible lines beings said by our main characters that are so relatable, you could just stand up and clap for them.Characters (9/10)I don’t really think that there’s a single character in this anime you would dislike. While not all of them are developed as well, our main characters, Juugo and Tensai, are given quite good character developments throughout the story.Juugo isn’t your typical main character. First of all, he isn't a dense male protagonist, he actually has his own ideals and beliefs, rather than the usual “I’ll fight you because you’re evil” mentality. In the first few episodes, he already had quite a mysterious aura surrounding him. After all, his reactions to what people say and do are quite different from the norm. Of course, it gets even better after his backgrounds were revealed. I doubt it would be something you’d expect.Tensai is probably my favourite character in this series. Why you might ask? Her lines are always so cleverly worded and when aimed at Juugo, usually sarcastic. She gets super adorable when shy. But most importantly, is her superior intellect that really shows that she deserves the title of “Master Detective”. She is basically the one who solves all the puzzles the ruins present to our main characters, and links up all the loose plot holes together to wow the viewers. This sometimes makes her seem a little arrogant, but never to the point where you'd find her irritating. They were all presented in the right doses, which just make you love her character even more.Other characters include Nanana-chan, our NEET ghost. Her character is also extremely likable, and she has her own set of ideals and beliefs that just provides more depth to her character, rather than just like someone in the “Amazing Race” who just hands out question cards to the next objective.Art (9/10)The art for Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is extremely similar to other A-1 Pictures’ productions, such as Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. If you liked the art from that anime, I can bet a 100% you’d love the art here. The characters are drawn beautifully, especially their eyes.Where the art gets kicked up a notch would be when the anime portrays the larger buildings in the city, but more amazingly, when the puzzles appear in the ruins. You can just tell that this anime had quite a high budget.Additionally, since the production studio is also the one that did Sword Art Online, you can expect the fighting scenes to look well choreographed and smooth.Sound (8.5/10)Personally, I felt that the openings and endings of the anime are quite catchy and it matches my type of music. Do note that this is my personal taste, as there are people who do not really like them.Another aspect would be the voice acting. This anime offers really top notch voice acting, with the voice actors fulfilling their roles really well. High pitched and comedic Nanana-chan, snark and clever Tensai… Just watch the anime and you’d know what I’m talking about.Enjoyment (9/10)On the whole, I really enjoyed this anime. The characters were a joy to watch, the story is especially interesting when you try to connect the dots before the anime does it.Overall (8.5/10)Would I recommend Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin? Definitely. From action to comedy to adventure and enjoyable characters, this anime offers plenty for everyone to enjoy.

Give this a watch yo.', 'Nanana\'s Buried treasure.  One of those anime that gets an odd length of 11 episodes that I thought had quite a bit of potential for it for story and character development.  And in a sense, I was kinda right?Story (7.01/10):  The story of Nanana\'s Buried treasure starts with our main protagonist, Yama Juugo.  Exiled to this special island in the middle of the ocean called Nanae island, a place for students to come and live on whilst learning from various colleges and schools on the island.  It is here where our main protagonist finds himself ""haunted"" by the ghost of...the island\'s creator, Nanana, and where he begins the search for Nanana\'s Buried Treasure in order to find out who Nanana\'s killer is.For starters, I have to give credit to the original creator of this series because honestly, this is one of the more original and quite frankly interesting plots in anime I\'ve seen in a while.  From day 1 of watching this series, I\'ve always liked this premise and hoped that it would turn itself into something that blew my expectations away.  Unfortunately though, that didn\'t really happen.The story of this anime stays true to its title by making the show essentially a chase for these magical items that make up Nanana\'s collection.  It was a nice idea for a good chunk of the show, as it showed the show\'s main focus and what its core focus was, but as time went on though, this simple idea became muddled.What I think really hurt the series was really, lack of explanation and various gaping plot holes.  In various episodes, things get introduced into the series that I felt confused me a lot due to the lack of explanation for them.  (Ex.  The organization Matsuri.  Mind putting that in greater detail?)  It didn\'t help that the show\'s pacing was actually quite rushed and uneven by making some plot points go by faster than others.  Combined with the fact that the series switched its focus a lot (by changing who was the current antagonist more or less) compared to a straightforward idea that the entire series follows behind on, the execution of the story idea was well, less then proficient.Now, the biggest gripe I have with the show, its ending.  Whenever a show is obviously incomplete, I do get a bit furious with, due to the fact that well, you\'re leaving an entire plot hanging on its edge that without any second season or continuation, will be left as just that.  (Essentially, it\'s a read the manga/light novel ending.)  For me, nothing in the show was actually resolved and nothing really changed from beginning to end as there wasn\'t any significant character changes that I felt would really count as character development nor any drastic change in plot that would make the entire show different than what it really was.  (Plus, there\'s like a 20 second thing at the end of the 11th episode that makes absolutely zero sense.)Overview:+  Fantastic base story idea-   Excruciating large plot holes-   Uneven pacing-   Cliffhanger ending.  (Unless you have second season confirmed, this is a bad thing, anime.)Characters (6.89/10):  The cast of this show I find is a pleasant sort of bunch as to be completely honest, it\'s hard to know who to root for as everyone is ambiguous in their motives and ideals for searching for Nanana\'s collection, showing that no one is truly a ""good guy"" and no one is a ""bad guy"", in which I sort of like.Yama Juugo is our main protagonist of the series.  Exiled by his father to Nanae island, Juugo begins his life as he tries to find Nanana\'s killer through the use of Nanana\'s collection.  While I despise his character design (for personal reasons), this sort of protagonist seemed like a rather interesting protagonist later on as you can see later on that he has his own motives for doing what he\'s doing.  He was a protagonist that always kept me guessing and second guessing myself because he does things in a sense that make him seem like an antagonist rather than a protagonist.  As Tensai puts it, he\'s evil!And then we have the girl who\'s name is in the title, Nanana.  Nanana is portrayed in the series as to be a ghost NEET, (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), who, for the majority of her appearances, does really nothing but eat pudding and play online/video games.  That\'s essentially all you\'ll get for character development/traits due to the fact that Nanana plays the supporting role of being the ""helper fairy"" by giving hints as to where certain parts of her collection is located.  To be completely honest, I felt as though the series set her up for failure.  Because she is a ghost and eternally bound to the apartment that she died in, she cannot step foot outside and therefore, cannot participate in any other scenes except the ones pertaining to the apartment.  As the main female of the series of who\'s name is in the title, I expected a bit more from her, but because of the way the series put her in, she was constrained to this role that I felt was really just hindering the potential it could have.  (I sort of expected her to be like Menma from Anohana in a sense, but instead, everyone can see her and talk to her, which completely undermines the whole idea of a ghost more or less.)For the rest of the cast, we have quite a few interesting characters such as the ambitious weakling Yuiga and his personal fangirl, Yuu, the clear-cut antagonist that shows up late for the party, Ikusaba, and my personal favorite, the master detective Tensai with her cross-dressing maid Daruku.  As I have mentioned before, this is quite an ambiguous cast, as pretty much all of them have traits about them that don\'t make them completely a ""protagonist"", and at the same time, not completely an ""antagonist.""  It really made me second guess myself on who to root for, but at the same time, the series didn\'t put enough detail on them to make them really at each others throats until they bring in this obvious antagonist dude that is just way too obviously ""the bad guy"" which for me just brought a sour taste to my mouth as it changed the other characters and bunched them up on the same side due to a common enemy.All in all, the cast had a lot of lost potential within them and for me, made the whole series a little bit of a weird experience with its sudden change of heart with some characters and its use of some people it had in the show.Overview:+  Ambiguous that made me second guess myself (a lot)-   Lost potential with main female lead-   Lack of explanation for certain character traits and motivesArt and Sound (8.24/10 and 6.34/10):  Nanana\'s buried treasure was made by A-1 pictures, a studio that for the past few years, have been producing some pretty nice stuff; this series is no different.The art style for the series is quite a colorful one where all the characters are made in this specific color gradient that shines quite brightly and colorfully.  (With odd color transitions depending on hair length.) Each person is made quite well with a great amount of detail to the character\'s eyes above all else.  The backgrounds for the series itself have quite a good amount of detail themselves and overall, add to the pleasantness that is the look of the series.In addition to it, one thing that needs to be talked about are the ""ruins"" of the series, the areas in which Nanana\'s collection are buried.  Created in a substantial amount of effort behind it, the ruins of this series look absolutely stunning and look like a feat in and of itself.  Honestly though, i think the artwork for this series is the highest point for the show, period.As for music, well, the show has an opening and ending track that both sound rather good, but to be completely honest, they don\'t hold a candle as being ""memorable"" pieces of music.  They\'re not bad per say, but they\'re not the kind of songs that you would search on YouTube and listen to over an over again.Overview:+  Stunning background artwork+  Great character design+/-  Forgettable music.Personal Enjoyment (6.88/10):  Honestly though, I had my hopes up for this series.  Not very high hopes mind you, but enough to say that this show would be a good show just in general.  While it did have a good start, the show fell behind a lot on the fact that it left a lot of things behind as it was trying to move the plot along.While I did like the story idea and a good chunk of the characters, the show didn\'t deliver on many of its story ideas and in the end, became a big mess with explaining anything.  As the story moved along, the things that remained unexplained remained stuck in my mind, like why Juugo left his father\'s organization, why is Ikusaba such a prick about everything, what about the rest of the original few members of Nanana\'s gang?  What happened to them?   Overall though, I wouldn\'t say the series is terrible, as it has a few things going for it, but honestly though, there are quite a lot of very noticeable flaws that can take away from the experience.  Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go find some pudding to eat.Overall Score: (6.81/10) the island\'s creator, Nanana, and where he begins the search for Nanana\'s Buried Treasure in order to find out who Nanana\'s killer is.For starters, I have to give credit to the original creator of this series because honestly, this is one of the more original and quite frankly interesting plots in anime I\'ve seen in a while.

For me, nothing in the show was actually resolved and nothing really changed from beginning to end as there wasn\'t any significant character changes that I felt would really count as character development nor any drastic change in plot that would make the entire show different than what it really was.  (Plus, there\'s like a 20 second thing at the end of the 11th episode that makes absolutely zero sense.)Overview:+  Fantastic base story idea-   Excruciating large plot holes-   Uneven pacing-   Cliffhanger ending.  (Unless you have second season confirmed, this is a bad thing, anime.)Characters (6.89/10):  The cast of this show I find is a pleasant sort of bunch as to be completely honest, it\'s hard to know who to root for as everyone is ambiguous in their motives and ideals for searching for Nanana\'s collection, showing that no one is truly a ""good guy"" and no one is a ""bad guy"", in which I sort of like.Yama Juugo is our main protagonist of the series.  Exiled by his father to Nanae island, Juugo begins his life as he tries to find Nanana\'s killer through the use of Nanana\'s collection.  While I despise his character design (for personal reasons), this sort of protagonist seemed like a rather interesting protagonist later on as you can see later on that he has his own motives for doing what he\'s doing.  He was a protagonist that always kept me guessing and second guessing myself because he does things in a sense that make him seem like an antagonist rather than a protagonist.  As Tensai puts it, he\'s evil!And then we have the girl who\'s name is in the title, Nanana.  Nanana is portrayed in the series as to be a ghost NEET, (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), who, for the majority of her appearances, does really nothing but eat pudding and play online/video games.  That\'s essentially all you\'ll get for character development/traits due to the fact that Nanana plays the supporting role of being the ""helper fairy"" by giving hints as to where certain parts of her collection is located.  To be completely honest, I felt as though the series set her up for failure.  Because she is a ghost and eternally bound to the apartment that she died in, she cannot step foot outside and therefore, cannot participate in any other scenes except the ones pertaining to the apartment.  As the main female of the series of who\'s name is in the title, I expected a bit more from her, but because of the way the series put her in, she was constrained to this role that I felt was really just hindering the potential it could have.  (I sort of expected her to be like Menma from Anohana in a sense, but instead, everyone can see her and talk to her, which completely undermines the whole idea of a ghost more or less.)For the rest of the cast, we have quite a few interesting characters such as the ambitious weakling Yuiga and his personal fangirl, Yuu, the clear-cut antagonist that shows up late for the party, Ikusaba, and my personal favorite, the master detective Tensai with her cross-dressing maid Daruku.  As I have mentioned before, this is quite an ambiguous cast, as pretty much all of them have traits about them that don\'t make them completely a ""protagonist"", and at the same time, not completely an ""antagonist.""  It really made me second guess myself on who to root for, but at the same time, the series didn\'t put enough detail on them to make them really at each others throats until they bring in this obvious antagonist dude that is just way too obviously ""the bad guy"" which for me just brought a sour taste to my mouth as it changed the other characters and bunched them up on the same side due to a common enemy.All in all, the cast had a lot of lost potential within them and for me, made the whole series a little bit of a weird experience with its sudden change of heart with some characters and its use of some people it had in the show.Overview:+  Ambiguous that made me second guess myself (a lot)-   Lost potential with main female lead-   Lack of explanation for certain character traits and motivesArt and Sound (8.24/10 and 6.34/10):  Nanana\'s buried treasure was made by A-1 pictures, a studio that for the past few years, have been producing some pretty nice stuff; this series is no different.The art style for the series is quite a colorful one where all the characters are made in this specific color gradient that shines quite brightly and colorfully.  (With odd color transitions depending on hair length.) Each person is made quite well with a great amount of detail to the character\'s eyes above all else.  The backgrounds for the series itself have quite a good amount of detail themselves and overall, add to the pleasantness that is the look of the series.In addition to it, one thing that needs to be talked about are the ""ruins"" of the series, the areas in which Nanana\'s collection are buried.  Created in a substantial amount of effort behind it, the ruins of this series look absolutely stunning and look like a feat in and of itself.  Honestly though, i think the artwork for this series is the highest point for the show, period.As for music, well, the show has an opening and ending track that both sound rather good, but to be completely honest, they don\'t hold a candle as being ""memorable"" pieces of music.  They\'re not bad per say, but they\'re not the kind of songs that you would search on YouTube and listen to over an over again.Overview:+  Stunning background artwork+  Great character design+/-  Forgettable music.Personal Enjoyment (6.88/10):  Honestly though, I had my hopes up for this series.  Not very high hopes mind you, but enough to say that this show would be a good show just in general.  While it did have a good start, the show fell behind a lot on the fact that it left a lot of things behind as it was trying to move the plot along.While I did like the story idea and a good chunk of the characters, the show didn\'t deliver on many of its story ideas and in the end, became a big mess with explaining anything.  As the story moved along, the things that remained unexplained remained stuck in my mind, like why Juugo left his father\'s organization, why is Ikusaba such a prick about everything, what about the rest of the original few members of Nanana\'s gang?  What happened to them?   Overall though, I wouldn\'t say the series is terrible, as it has a few things going for it, but honestly though, there are quite a lot of very noticeable flaws that can take away from the experience.  Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go find some pudding to eat.Overall Score: (6.81/10)', ""An adventure series that's not set in a fantasy world: This is basically Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin in a nutshell. It's pretty common for adventure series to have fight scenes and treasure hunting, but this was perhaps the only series I knew that executed it in a semi-utopian setting.The story didn't really peek my interest during the first episodes, but the ones that came after surely did. And I swear, this could probably the series that inspired Re:Zero. But it's not just the plot which they resembled. There was also the cast. The Yama literally resembled Subaru in more ways than one. Even the other...characters in Re:Zero looked like they were other versions of RyuNana. Dunno if this is really the case, but that's how I see it, at least.Overall, I really enjoyed it. I'm glad this show presented a new perspective in the adventure genre. And I totally recommend it to those looking for a little mystery and action in their list.

I find this animes plot so much more unique.', 'Going back through seasonal Anime to click on shows I\'ve never heard of and giving them an episode or two, I discovered Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin - a series by A-1 Pictures that lives up to the reputation of the better A-1 projects out there.Nanana is a mashup of several genres that manages to keep a creative, original energy pumping for it\'s entire 11 episode run. A surprisingly watchable blend, Nanana\'s story is pushed along by our MC running away from his birthright and joining the Adventure Club at some high school he enrolled in on some island where there just so happens to...be an insane collection of powerful artifacts and a ghost he must cohabit with in his bachelor suite, room 202 of ""Happy House"".The ghost bound to room 202 of Happy House just so happens to be the very individual, Nanana, who collected these powerful artifacts known as Nanana\'s collection. Before she was tragically murdered, you see. The MC, Juugo - Robin Hood\'s wayward son - comes to Happy House after rejecting his father\'s wish that he succeed him as leader of ""Matsuri"" (basically his band of Merry Men), a group of noble thieves who are also after Nanana\'s collection of powerful artifacts - but who isn\'t after the collection? A short blonde master detective, fanservice trap maid character, and several other side characters plus characters from the past of the side characters eventually enter the picture as friends and/or rivals and/or teammates and/or love interests depending on the needs of the story at the given time. But rather than feeling tacky, tired, and overdone this formula of constant reveals and fresh blood is actually the meat in the Nanawa adventure club sandwich.Most aspects of the show have this unassuming charm and depth to them despite the whacky premise and familiar tropes on display. The pacing of the show is pretty quick, yet time is made for surprisingly mature dialogue that helps bootstrap the characters and their relations to each other, even as they double-cross each other and zoom in and out of the plot without much notice. Nanana is a weird intersectional Anime that could have stumbled over literally any of what it threw into the stew and immediately sucked as a result. If the writing wasn\'t good, if the dialogue was predictable, if the animation was wooden, if the character designs were mundane, if the maid fanservice character wasn\'t a trap, if the MC\'s father didn\'t have a relatable world view, if the main villain didn\'t have a toned down level of psychopathy that explains his previous affiliation with the Adventure Club... if the slapstick comedy wasn\'t funny, if Nanana wasn\'t an adorable gamer ghost waifu who loves pudding, or if we were spoonfed the intentions of every character - Nanana would suck! In any of those scenarios, I would expect it to be an awful Anime - the balance is just that tight on what they chose to do.But it isn\'t an awful Anime, exactly the opposite. It\'s pretty great, utterly bingeable, and leaves you feeling sad that there isn\'t more of it out there somewhere. A-1 pictures pulled of an impressive tight-rope walk and carved something that really shouldn\'t be that interesting into a hidden gem. The only downside to watching Nanana is the too-short 11 episode run. As you might guess 11 episodes was far from enough screentime to satisfy our curiosity as entire groups of interesting characters are teased with cameo appearences by their affialiated members who have great designs and usually something interesting to say or do in the brief moments in which they appear. It feels a lot like watching A-1 Pictures accept and complete the challenge ""make an Anime that sounds boring on paper, using every trope you can think of, but then make us like it"" - and make us like it they did, at least for me. Unfortunately, it ends in the middle, and there isn\'t anything else out there to consume except the Light Novel - but Nanana was good enough that I could see myself going for the LN.Despite finding itself in the LN adaptation graveyard with no followup in sight, all the elements of a good watch are here - good character designs, solid dialogue, surprisingly fluid animation and fight scenes. Goofy fanservice that has a sense of humor and feels much more relatable than the standard. A main character that you can understand. A likeable group of side characters. Multiple competing factions and side-switching that actually makes a degree of sense. Consistency in the worldviews and development of its characters and thus meaningful interactions, growth, and conflict in relationships between characters. Stupid gaffes that are funny and well animated, but don\'t drone on or repeat themselves to the point of annoying us. The story follows a consistent rythym, there is always something happening and no episode falls flat, no scene is truly trivial. Nanana is kind of awesome, and definitely worth your time. be an insane collection of powerful artifacts and a ghost he must cohabit with in his bachelor suite, room 202 of ""Happy House"".The ghost bound to room 202 of Happy House just so happens to be the very individual, Nanana, who collected these powerful artifacts known as Nanana\'s collection.

My initial thoughts going into Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin were, ""Well it cannot be as bad as School Days right?"" I was correct; it was infinitely times better.Story: 7/10I at first thought the main plot was a little weird but after the first two episodes it started to grow on me. The basic concept of the show is: on an island that boasts a new university for students, the treasure hunting club thing goes on puzzle solving...adventures for ""Nanana\'s"" treasures. Nanana being the creator of the island (well the idea of the island I guess) is kind of the center of the entire show but she mostly plays a sideline role. What each episode boils down to is essentially the club finding a new treasure location or progressing certain character arcs. The show never felt slow and due to the great character interactions (more in the \'character\' section), made it fun to watch. There are however annoying plot holes left after the season ends...Animation: 9.4/10Very good and crisp. The characters always looked so composed and beautiful/handsome. The colors were bright and vibrant, backdrops looked great, action scenes flowed nicely, and the eyes were awesome. Overall a beautiful anime to watch.Sound: 8/10The voice actors did an amazing job portraying their virtual counterparts in this anime. The voices seemed to match up very nicely with the personalities of their characters. Music wise I really liked the opening theme and most of the music used in the anime. It set the tone pretty well in almost all moments.Characters: 7.8/10This is one of those situations where a few bad apples really ruin the whole batch. Juugo, Nanana, Daruku, and Tensai are the real stars of the show as all of their interactions are a blast to watch. They however cannot make up for the bland Yuu, un-likeable Isshin, and the overpowered and underdeveloped Hiiyo. These three characters unfortunately really brought down the excitement level for me whenever they were present.Don\'t get me wrong though most of the scenes are a blast to watch. You think you know a character\'s true intentions but then something happens that completely blindsides you. It is pretty enjoyable to watch.Overall: 8.1/10This was a true treat to watch. The hidden agendas, character interactions, beautiful animation, and tone setting voice performances really made this treasure hunting anime a joy to watch.Enjoyment: 7.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

Short1 was used to develop Favaros relationship with his mother and give you more perspective on Favaros emotions in the aftermath of S1.Short2 is used to delve more into Jeanne's (The Saint, white knight woman) character.Both of which were greatly appreciated and helped set up the characters ambitions for S2.The art was nice (maybe even better than from S1)...I thoroughly enjoyed these ONAs, If you love dialogue heavy character growth but skipped over these ONA heading into the new season, I 100% recommend watching them.

Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica Crimson S,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5504/Shinkyoku_Soukai_Polyphonica_Crimson_S,"['It\'s highly ironic that my most recent review was for Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran. At first it may seem that the two shows have very little in common aside from involving the supernatural and artistic performances. This isn\'t where the similarity ends though, as both Gouka Kenran and Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica Crimson S suffer from almost exactly the same problems, and for almost identical reasons.The first series followed the lives of the employees of the Tsuge Divine Music Players Office, in particular, Tatara Phoron and his contracted spirit Corticarte Apa Lagranges (Corti). Crimson S, on the other hand, sets out to show how Phoron and...Corti became partners, with much hi-jinx and shenanigans from evil musicians and school bullies along the way.At first glance it appears as though this is nothing more than a prequel to the first series and, for the most part, this would be a fair assessment. Unfotunately, there are some deviations that occur in Crimson S that openly contradict some of the events from the first anime, one of which is Phoron and Corti\'s first meeting with the Yugiri twins (Perserte and Prinesca). The first series very clearly shows their first encounter to be at Tsuge\'s offices, however Crimson S has them being school friends.This isn\'t the only time Crimson S plays fast and loose with the story, and the reason for these deviations is beause this series is meant to enhance and develop the characters. One of the main issues with the first season was that the characters were transparent for the most part, with no basis for their thoughts, actions or ideals. Crimson S is an attempt to rectify this, and make the first series more accessable and understandable to viewers.If this is the desired outcome, then why on earth did Ocelot make the same mistake that Red Entertainment and Sega made with Gouka Kenran? Why, when Ging-ya did a decent job with the first season and have experience with the characters, animation and sound, did they change production companies?In all honesty, I have nothing against Diomedea, Lantis or Magic Capsule, as they have done some great work in their respective fields. However it is well known that for a sequel or prequel to be both acceptable and well made there needs to be consistency between the series. The original Polyphonica anime suffered from a lack of cohesiveness on it\'s own, but Crimson S only compounds those flaws by attempting to give it\'s own spin on events. Ultimately, the fault lies with the screenplay writers and the director, Suzuki Toshimasa, as the inconsistencies between the two series only serve to spoil both, and the plot for the series suffers from various flaws, including an overuse of deus ex machinaAs far as the animation and design goes, there\'s a jarring lack of detail at times, together with an oversimplified, almost childlike, depiction of certain areas of the city (very much like Gouka Kenran). The change of studios has affected the design of the characters to a degree as well, and in all honesty I prefer the facial expressions used in the first series as Crimson S seems to try a little too hard on that front.Other than those, and a few other niggly little points, there\'s really little to complain about. This is a solidly made series that isn\'t overly creative, even though it may seem that way at first.In terms of sound, there\'s also little to complain about. The music and effects are decent, but a little on the plain side. I have to admit that I found the first season to be a tad more atmospheric aurally, and the music had a little more flair to it than Crimson S. One of the problems with the music throughout both series though, is the tendency for repetition, and with both being musically based shows, this becomes irritating at times.On the plus side though, and like Gouka Kenran, Crimson S has retained the services of the seiyuu from the first series and, for the most part, the voice acting is reasonably good. Unfortunately (you knew that word was coming, didn\'t you), the fact that this is supposed to be a prequel seems to have caused some of the actors a degree of confusion from time to time.The characters are, for want of a better word, odd. Within the context of the series they work reasonably well, but those of us who have watched the first series will note that there are some inconsistencies in their actions, thoughts and ideals. Now, one could easily explain these away by claiming that ""other things happened"" between the two series, but without knowing what they were, the viewer is left with characters who will sometimes do or say something ""odd"".However, it\'s to the credit of the series that it has attempted to develop the characters in a consistent manner (something that was lacking in series one), but even this only really applies to Phoron and Corti as the minor characters are all but shunted to one side. There are some nods at developing the Yugiri twins et al, but this feels out of place with the flow of the story.One other point to be mentioned is that Phoron, as a character, is actually better in the first series. In Crimson S he is far too nice for his own good and, while that may not be a bad thing for a character, it\'s taken to the extent that he becomes unbelievable.Of the two series, I have to admit that while Crimson S had it\'s good points, I prefer series one. The problem with Crimson S is that the change of studios altered the feel and flow of the story and, like Gouka Kenran, the new director has tried to stamp his mark on the show. It\'s more than a litte disappointing as Crimson S had the potential to lift the series, but in truth it turned out to be a rather lacklustre affair.Don\'t get me wrong. The series as a whole isn\'t bad. It just lacks the flair and creativity of the original, which is unfortunate as Crimson S really needed that shot in the arm.It\'s a decent effort but, like Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran, it doesn\'t quite live up to expectations. Corti became partners, with much hi-jinx and shenanigans from evil musicians and school bullies along the way.At first glance it appears as though this is nothing more than a prequel to the first series and, for the most part, this would be a fair assessment. Unfotunately, there are some deviations that occur in Crimson S that openly contradict some of the events from the first anime, one of which is Phoron and Corti\'s first meeting with the Yugiri twins (Perserte and Prinesca). The first series very clearly shows their first encounter to be at Tsuge\'s offices, however Crimson S has them being school friends.This isn\'t the only time Crimson S plays fast and loose with the story, and the reason for these deviations is beause this series is meant to enhance and develop the characters.

Shikioriori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37396/Shikioriori,"['The tripartite anthology ""Shikioriori"", is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and recent Chinese history, in particular that of China\'s rapid economic development during the 1990s, so it pains me to read so many reviews that seem to exhibit no awareness and no understanding of the cultural context and demographic to which this film targets.1) Sunny BreakfastFor non-Chinese people, or those who have not grown up in Chinese-influenced societies like much of South East Asia, you may not know that food is widely recognised as the most important part of Chinese culture. That Chinese people often greet each other with ""Have you eaten"" and that Chinese...parents will express their love for their children not with ""I love you"" but ""Have you eaten/there is food"" is merely one of the many culturally ingrained aspects of Chinese culture where food is often the basis for family bonding and socialising.In ""Sunny Breakfast"", Xiaomin contemplates the ephemerality of people and things in life, with his most cherished experiences relating back to his favourite noodles. The whole vignette takes the form of Xiaomin\'s inner thoughts and soliloquising as we follow his life\'s journeys as we observe snippets of the memories he looks back to, as he feels his life is nothing more than a tasteless existence, that no longer has the ""flavour of his youth"" about which he reminisces and from which he begins to learn.The extended metaphor and the experiences he goes through are very much those that most ordinary Chinese people that live in cities post the late 1980s when Deng Xiaoping begun the process of transformation Shanghai to the megacity it is today. For a short story, ""Sunny Breakfast"" does well in encapsulating the experiences many young Chinese adults will have gone through and the thought processes they felt. In the whirlwind of time, it is easy to forget the impermanence of that which one grows up with and just that alone is sufficient material for a short story like the first of Shikioriori\'s to explore.2) A Little Fashion ShowThis is the most straightforward and least attached to Chinese culture of the three and may be more accessible emotionally and storywise to MAL\'s Western base. It is a short story about cherishing those close to you and how family, as well as recognising the bilateral nature of such relationships. Perhaps the weakest of the three, its simplicity nonetheless means that its narrative is clear even if the experience of viewing it feels a bit rushed as the plot proceeds from one to the next, with little time for the nuanced introspection and characterisation we had of Xiaomin in the previous film.I consider this to have been the weakest entry as its appeal to pathos is not  particularly convincing and could have benefitted from more introspection of the sisters rather creating an antagonist, whose purpose had little value beyond advancing the plot whose message could have been achieved without so I felt it to be more shallow than the others. Luckily, being in the middle saves ""Shikioriori"" from giving a bad first impression or a disappointing finale.3) Shanghai LoveEven though it\'s a homage to Byousoku 5 Centimeter, I think it\'s more of an indictment of MAL\'s demographic that this film is being likened to all of Shinkai\'s other works when really it shares very little with any of his works. That a mere story of 2 adolescents in love that faces struggle is enough for people to liken ""Shanghai Love"" with Byousoku 5 Centimeter is more of a testament to the lack of repertoire MAL\'s demographic has surrouding romance as a genre where people view romance as dating and ""who ends up with whom"" rather than romance as being a medium via which to explore human relationships, emotions, and growth etc. Regardless, that doesn\'t change the fact that it does not come close to reaching the sheer emotional profundity and character authenticity and complexity Byousoku 5 Centimeter achieved, nor the surgical precision with which Shinkai\'s film explored its themes.""Shanghai Love"" is more about Shanghai and Chinese culture than it is really about love. The story surrounds 3 friends who through various circumstances end up on different life paths that lead to our protagonist to ponder on his present and future, sparked by a reminder of the past. What I found impressive in this story was the way Chinese familial structure, relationships, and familial expectations are all accurately woven in the context of 1990s Shanghai which faced rapid modernisation, gentrification as well as technological development - themes that were all deftly used as metaphors in this romantic tale.It is the longest of the three but aptly works as a conclusion to this anthology. Whereas the first focused heavily on one\'s past, the second on the present, this final film goes one step further using its additonal time to encompass the future and the film\'s ending culminates into an emotionally rewarding experience that feels like chicken soup for the soul.--Final Thoughts--Shikioriori is a Chinese production made for Chinese, or at the very least, Eastern audiences. Its audiovisuals are strong owing to its production committee and brevity but nothing exceptional. But crucially, it takes advantage of the time it has to provide a reflective and heartfelt piece about the transience of life, youth and on grasping the future, in a context that is often very ingrained within modern Chinese society. However, these themes are universal and I think audiences from all over the world can relate to the problems and feelings our protagonists hold, in a succinct package that can be digested separately in 3 parts, if you feel you don\'t want to commit to something long.I think for a lot of mainland Chinese millenials in their twenties, there is something even greater to pontificate upon and extract from Shikioriori, a film that I personally thoroughly enjoyed, and captured me in its reminiscent and phantasmagorical atmosphere. parents will express their love for their children not with ""I love you"" but ""Have you eaten/there is food"" is merely one of the many culturally ingrained aspects of Chinese culture where food is often the basis for family bonding and socialising.In ""Sunny Breakfast"", Xiaomin contemplates the ephemerality of people and things in life, with his most cherished experiences relating back to his favourite noodles.

(LIGHT SPOILERS)Story: 7This movie is an anthology that is composed of 3 stories. I\'ll briefly comment about it one by one.""A Sunny Breakfast"" 6/10it comes off as an introduction story of an adult lingering the remnants of youth. The story doesn\'t really progress instead it comes off poetic and nostalgic. But that\'s just it.""A Little fashion show"". 8/10A story about two sisters with different careers that separates them from living a kind of lifestyle yet they share the same roof. It\'s pretty decent to look at it as a whole but somehow it lacked...something. It\'s still predictable as it is but what brought significance to the 2nd story is that they managed to breakthrough and intermingle their different passionate careers, showing the good side of sisterhood while approaching adulthood""Love In Shanghai"" 9/10To be honest, the last part made me cry. It\'s well invested with emotional flares with full of mishaps that breaks the bond between two supposed-to-be lovers. It\' starts slow then gradually gives an aching slow burning experience. Cliche as it may sound. The whole execution of the events caught my attention and I felt like that I wanted it to be separate from the anthology because it deserves a movie itself. It can be as good as Garden of Words or nearly good as Your Name.Overall. It\'s very decent. The stories are well narrated. The score is deserving enough since it really followed the movie\'s theme.—the different viewpoints of adults looking back at their tracks from their youth—ranging from familial love, love for career and the love from someone.Art: 10As expected, it was from the studio Haoliners and ComixWaves (The one that animated Your name, Garden of Words, 5 centimeters per second etc). I\'m never disappointed by their past works so does now. From the city landscapes to the delicate food animation, the color schemes and the tame character designs. The art just gave the movie the realistic vibes. That way, I felt  more resonated and connected while watching it.Sound: 9The sound is very varying from each stories. It was all distinct yet somehow forgettable. But the best part is that the orchestration is so good, it managed to weave out my emotions while the protags narrates their story. And also, for me, the sound always worked with the art/animation in tango. They are always intertwined. And in this movie, they gave us a full-scale combo for a beautiful, radiant and emotional anthology.Characters: 7The protagonists in every story did their roles properly in every story. Their personalities made them appear more natural and realistic. But somehow, they still lacked a little bit of substance. But I can\'t really blame the short amount of time. It\'s hard to read a character when they appear just 30mins or less and nothing more.Enjoyment: 8Even though some parts felt boring, the narrative is very good altogether with sound and animation that it kept me relaxed and watch patiently until it ends.Overall: 9It\'s a must watch!! Don\'t watch with full of expectations so you could enjoy and appreciate it fully. It\'s not very twisty like Your Name. Watch it alone in a calm environment with a nice cup of tea. This is a grounded movie anthology with full of bittersweet yet radiant stories of nostalgic youth! something.

This is a grounded movie anthology with full of bittersweet yet radiant stories of nostalgic youth!', 'There are two things you should know about ""Flavors of Youth"":1. It\'s a great anime.2. You probably won\'t think it\'s a great anime.""Flavors of Youth"" strikes me as an inaccessible anime - particularly to western audiences - and not just because of its meandering, introspective nature that would put a lot of people to sleep. I would describe it as a cultural piece that, to fully appreciate, you not only need to know about Chinese culture, you must have been submerged in it at some point in your life. On top of that, the anime homes in on a very specific Chinese generation: the generation\xa0who...grew up there around the 90s, the generation who witnessed China\'s rise to one of the world\'s largest economies. My generation.Perhaps that\'s why I struggle to recall the last anime with which I felt such a deep personal connection. ""Flavors of Youth"" captures the nostalgic feelings of my childhood spent in 90s China with such authenticity that I was utterly unsurprised to find the chief director is a Chinese close to me in age. If you\'re not someone targeted by the anime\'s laser-like focus, if you haven\'t the life experience of a certain time and a certain place, then ""Flavors of Youth"" likely feels like a poor man\'s Shinkai anime. This view is no doubt enforced by its nature as a work co-produced by CoMix Wave Films, a studio with strong associations with Shinkai. But despite the obvious influences, this anime also stands on its own three feet (because it\'s an anthology comprising three stories). With subtle social commentary and Chinese culture permeating through every pore, ""Flavors of Youth"" is far more than a cheap Chinese knock-off; it possesses its own identity and its own goals, with even the main locations for the stories - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, the three largest cities in China - carefully chosen as the faces of China\'s economic boom.The central thread that runs through the stories is ""youth"". More accurately though, it\'s about ""seishun"", or ""qingchun"" in Chinese (they use the same kanji). While those terms seem directly translatable and therefore interchangeable, that\'s true only in a literal sense. Words in different languages can have the same literal meaning but vastly different connotations; ""seishun"", made up of the kanjis for ""green"" and ""spring"", possesses a certain poetry and an association with a culturally romanticised view of the morning of one\'s life, and the word ""youth"" simply can\'t capture the strength of the meanings and feelings invoked by it.The anthology opens with ""The Rice Noodles"", which isn\'t so much a story as it is an expression of feelings, subtly blended like the seasonings of a delicious bowl of the titular noodles. The bare premise is about a guy named Xiao Ming (which is, incidentally, probably the most common name for fictional protagonists used in the Chinese education system, frequently seen in example sentences and essays) yearning for the taste of the noodles of his childhood which he ate with his grandmother. The noodles do so much of the heavy lifting in this story that it\'s practically the main character - it has strong associations with the memories of Xiao Ming\'s grandmother and with the nostalgic days of his seishun, in addition to being a metaphor for the values eroded by China\'s rapid economic expansion.While having practically zero plot, ""The Rice Noodles"" is thematically rich. To understand the commentary, you need a bit of background. China, like a lot of Asian countries, has a strong food culture - not in the French-esq, fine dining style, but of the local street food variety. The streets and avenues are often dotted with street food stalls and cosy, family-run restaurants serving startlingly good food within tight-knit communities. As the country embarked on a decades-long growth spurt, the local restaurants got gradually replaced by more commercial restaurants and chains, particularly in large cities. On the surface level, Xiao Ming laments that the noodles from the commercial restaurants just aren\'t as tasty as the ones he ate as a youth, as they have less of the wholesome ingredients such as wood ear mushrooms. On a deeper level, the anime laments the loss of old values as people chase after money in an increasingly materialistic society.This isn\'t just a case of looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses: China\'s economic rise has very much been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty, and people\'s living conditions massively improved; on the other hand, since adopting aspects of a capitalist system, Chinese society has become a caricature of western consumerism, with people worshiping at the altar of money and material items, and scheming to become rich by whatever means, even at the cost of community, family and moral values. This is why the country\'s become plagued by scams and scandals in recent years. Where once people didn\'t even bother locking their doors, now they draw their curtains when counting their cash. But let\'s pull back from these dark reflections; ""The Rice Noodles"" does end on a positive note: even as the protagonist acknowledges that he can never recapture his seishun, the fate of the noodle shop brings hope of triumph through adversity, and of the return of non-materialistic values. Sometimes it takes a rough patch in our lives to makes us realise what is truly important.The visuals play an important part in ""The Rice Noodles"", and it\'s a precursor of what\'s to come, both in terms of strengths and weaknesses in the animation and artwork. ""Flavors of Youth"" generally looks pretty, in a substandard-Shinkai kind of way, but falls short in the character animation department. This is particularly obvious in ""The Rice Noodles"", where the character animation lacks smoothness in some places, and looks overly smooth and mechanical in others. I remember in particular the scenes of people perfectly poised on bicycles, peddling in perfectly cyclical motions and moving forward in perfectly straight lines. But the weaknesses are more than compensated by the details of the background scenery, where the animators managed to capture the streets and buildings of rural and urban China with remarkable fidelity. Even in the visuals, the noodles steal the show: ""The Rice Noodles"" may not exhibit the scenery porn pervading Shinkai\'s works, but it can boast of food porn. I found myself salivating to the beautifully rendered noodles on screen, and could almost smell the aroma wafting from it. The strength of the visuals whisked me away to distant times and places and immersed me in its scenery and atmosphere ... but the magic only works because those times and places exist in my memory.The second segment, ""A Little Fashion Show"", has more of a plot than the first, telling the story of Yi Lin, a fashion model worrying about becoming too old for her job, and her relationship with her little sister. While not bad, it\'s probably the weakest of the three anthologies. I found the story a tad over-dramatic, and it resonated with me less than the others, though the reason might be because I\'m a guy experiencing a story dealing primarily with problems for women.""A Little Fashion Show"" tackles the loss of seishun in a more head-on fashion than the other stories, in particular its implication for Chinese women. Age-ism is a problem for women worldwide, especially when it comes to an appearance-based careers like modelling, but Chinese women feel it more acutely than most. While it may seem absurd to say that Yi Lin is raging against the dying light of her career, it\'s also fair to say that strong stigmas still exist in Chinese society for women like her, who have reached a certain age without getting married and settling down with kids. And as one of a vast number of career-focused, unmarried women in her generation, Yi Lin is certainly not going gently into that good night. Her story is one of defiance: defiance against an industry\'s bias for youth, and defiance against a traditional society\'s expectations for women.But it\'s also a story of defiance against something else.The other topic ""A Little Fashion Show"" deals with is of family and parenting. And if the first topic I mentioned didn\'t resonate with me personally, this one certainly does. Yi Lin lives with her younger sister as their parents had passed away. Tradition dictates that Yi Lin, as the eldest one, should play parent to her younger sibling and take good care of her. And Yi Lin tries to do exactly that. To a fault. During a heated argument between the two sisters, Yi Lin busts out the what is possibly the most memorable line in the whole anthology: ""Who do you think I\'m doing this for?"" This line, along with its classic variant ""I\'m doing this for your own good"" are immortal conversation enders weaponised by Chinese parents against their disobedient children, so I\'m sure it triggered a familiar, visceral reaction in many others as it did in me.Family and Confucian values underpin Chinese society, and children are always expected to be obedient to the parents who pour their souls into raising them, because parents always know best. Of course, that\'s not always true, and even when it is, sometimes children need to be allowed to make their own mistakes. The tragedy is that while many of us grew up knowing that, when we become parents ourselves, we often end up acting just like our own parents. In acting as a parent towards her sister, Yi Lin ends up making the same mistake as a typical Chinese parent: she does not realise her sister has grown up, and does not respect her rights to forge her own path in the world.Ultimately though, ""A Little Fashion Show"" doesn\'t explore the theme of rebellion against suffocating parents too deeply. However, this rebellious spirit roars into life in the third and final story, ""Love in Shanghai"".Better directed, better animated and better written, ""Love in Shanghai"" is in a different league to the other two stories. Like the headline act of a gig, it finally steps up after the supporting acts have warmed up the crowd. While Shinkai\'s influences are rooted in all three stories, they go especially deeply in ""Love in Shanghai"", all way down to the communication gimmick used as the central lynch-pin of the story. ""Love in Shanghai"" features the budding romance between the protagonist Li Mo and his classmate Xiao Yu, and its development across multiple snapshots in their lives.The craftsmanship of the story is impressive, managing to spin an intriguing little mystery around everyday settings. Deliberately paced and carefully plotted, ""Love in Shanghai"" also delivers at its zenith a perfectly weighted emotional punch. For those reasons, a lot of viewers should find this enjoyable, and certainly more accessible in comparison to the other stories. Nevertheless, I expect those who grew up in China to feel a deeper connection. One reason is the familiarity of seeing overly demanding parents putting academic achievement ahead of everything else. Several scenes depict the literal heavy-handedness of Chinese parenting, and the lack of fuss over them - while may seem shocking or unbelievable to some - is exactly what makes the depiction feel genuine: it really isn\'t too far outside the norm.Straining against the kind of parenting symptomatic of a culture that emphasises strict social order is the burning teenage spirit of rebellion, and it spearheads this last love letter to seishun. ""Love in Shanghai"" celebrates seishun in all its glory: its inherent ephemeral beauty as well as the emotional baggage; it embraces the flaws of that time in our lives: our hotheadedness, our prideful stubbornness, our naivety, but also acknowledges the purity, the idealistic dreams and fiery determination not yet dampened by the cynicism of experience; and it accepts all of that as part of growing up.Like the other stories, a lot goes on beneath the surface of ""Love in Shanghai"". The spliced timelines exhibit the pace of change in Shanghai over a decade: some shots of the same scenery highlighting the rapid erection of high rises in the city, others of old town areas underlining the rate at which the old buildings gave way to the new. While I did not grow up in Shanghai, the scruffy outward and interior appearances of the buildings felt exceedingly familiar as the same scenes and changes played out in other cities across the country. Despite all the progress, run-down areas still exist in the latest timeline (and even now at the time of writing), their presence exposing the shabby underbelly of a developing nation hiding beneath the veneer of a glittering, modern cityscape. The regeneration of housing is a contentious topic, and one the anime also touches upon, with the sprinkles of dialogue hinting at the tension between the government\'s desire to modernise and the needs of people - particularly the older generation - to hold on to something achingly familiar. A brief scene of a TV showing the 2002 football World Cup gives a nod to the first - and so far only - appearance of Chinese men\'s team in the finals. Despite being only a couple of seconds long and lacking any related dialogue, the inconspicuous shot subtly marks the landmark event as a source of pride. The amount of information and feelings that ""Love in Shanghai"" manages to convey through minute details in animation, dialogue and story is simply astonishing.After watching ""Flavors of Youth"", I was tempted to make a quip about how, despite being an anime heavily inspired by Shinkai, it affected me more deeply than any of Shinkai\'s works. But that\'s not really a fair comparison: Shinkai\'s anime aren\'t tailored to someone with my experiences, whereas this anime is. For example, while I may have understood on an intellectual level how ""Your Name."" connects with a people constantly battling natural disasters like the Japanese, as an outsider I can\'t really *feel* it. So it\'s worth noting the important meta-lesson that ""Flavors of Youth"" serves up: that our reaction to a piece of art isn\'t just down to the art itself, but its intersection with our identity and the lives that we have lived.So for me at least, ""Flavours of Youth"" is a great anime.Personal rating: +2.0 (great) grew up there around the 90s, the generation who witnessed China\'s rise to one of the world\'s largest economies. My generation.Perhaps that\'s why I struggle to recall the last anime with which I felt such a deep personal connection. ""Flavors of Youth"" captures the nostalgic feelings of my childhood spent in 90s China with such authenticity that I was utterly unsurprised to find the chief director is a Chinese close to me in age. If you\'re not someone targeted by the anime\'s laser-like focus, if you haven\'t the life experience of a certain time and a certain place, then ""Flavors of Youth"" likely feels like a poor man\'s Shinkai anime. This view is no doubt enforced by its nature as a work co-produced by CoMix Wave Films, a studio with strong associations with Shinkai. But despite the obvious influences, this anime also stands on its own three feet (because it\'s an anthology comprising three stories). With subtle social commentary and Chinese culture permeating through every pore, ""Flavors of Youth"" is far more than a cheap Chinese knock-off; it possesses its own identity and its own goals, with even the main locations for the stories - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, the three largest cities in China - carefully chosen as the faces of China\'s economic boom.The central thread that runs through the stories is ""youth"". More accurately though, it\'s about ""seishun"", or ""qingchun"" in Chinese (they use the same kanji). While those terms seem directly translatable and therefore interchangeable, that\'s true only in a literal sense. Words in different languages can have the same literal meaning but vastly different connotations; ""seishun"", made up of the kanjis for ""green"" and ""spring"", possesses a certain poetry and an association with a culturally romanticised view of the morning of one\'s life, and the word ""youth"" simply can\'t capture the strength of the meanings and feelings invoked by it.The anthology opens with ""The Rice Noodles"", which isn\'t so much a story as it is an expression of feelings, subtly blended like the seasonings of a delicious bowl of the titular noodles. The bare premise is about a guy named Xiao Ming (which is, incidentally, probably the most common name for fictional protagonists used in the Chinese education system, frequently seen in example sentences and essays) yearning for the taste of the noodles of his childhood which he ate with his grandmother. The noodles do so much of the heavy lifting in this story that it\'s practically the main character - it has strong associations with the memories of Xiao Ming\'s grandmother and with the nostalgic days of his seishun, in addition to being a metaphor for the values eroded by China\'s rapid economic expansion.While having practically zero plot, ""The Rice Noodles"" is thematically rich. To understand the commentary, you need a bit of background. China, like a lot of Asian countries, has a strong food culture - not in the French-esq, fine dining style, but of the local street food variety. The streets and avenues are often dotted with street food stalls and cosy, family-run restaurants serving startlingly good food within tight-knit communities. As the country embarked on a decades-long growth spurt, the local restaurants got gradually replaced by more commercial restaurants and chains, particularly in large cities. On the surface level, Xiao Ming laments that the noodles from the commercial restaurants just aren\'t as tasty as the ones he ate as a youth, as they have less of the wholesome ingredients such as wood ear mushrooms. On a deeper level, the anime laments the loss of old values as people chase after money in an increasingly materialistic society.This isn\'t just a case of looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses: China\'s economic rise has very much been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty, and people\'s living conditions massively improved; on the other hand, since adopting aspects of a capitalist system, Chinese society has become a caricature of western consumerism, with people worshiping at the altar of money and material items, and scheming to become rich by whatever means, even at the cost of community, family and moral values. This is why the country\'s become plagued by scams and scandals in recent years. Where once people didn\'t even bother locking their doors, now they draw their curtains when counting their cash.

That would obviously be this movie. Obviously.Throughout watching the first part of the movie there was a lot of thoughts swirling in my mind. Why is there only narration? Why does this sink look better then the entire movie? Why aren't there more noodles? To many questions were going through my mind. One minute the dude is eating noodles and looking at this pretty girl next second were at his grandma's death bed and I'm like...tf is going on, but it was fine, cause next thing I knew there were noodles on the screen again so it was all good.Next we have the worst part of the movie. The Not Noodles but Fashion Show part of the movie. If there could be a more predictable story then this I wouldn't believe you.  Now having things be predictable is fine to an extent. As long as the pacing is good, it's enjoyable, and there noodles for all to share. News flash it didn't have any of it. Twas just a bunch of forced and random drama that really didn't even need to happen and would of been better without it. If only she wore a noodle dress would she have not lost her shady boyfriend. At least I think that's what he was, i don't know they never really explained what he was.The third one actually not that bad to an extent, it was actually really interesting and if done right, was the only part of the movie, and had more noodles this movie would of been an easy 8 or higher. Honestly just watch the third part and the first part.PS: My enjoyment is a 9 cause I watched this on rabb.it with friends so it was more bearable that way. tf is going on, but it was fine, cause next thing I knew there were noodles on the screen again so it was all good.Next we have the worst part of the movie.

Similar on what Shinkai did on 5 Centimeters per Second. The movie is placed in China and even the main character’s name is all in Chinese. But the studio and voice actors are Japanese. Here’s my quick review of the film:Story:As the film begins, you're greeted with an aesthetically beautiful art and animation followed by a few words and the first chapter’s title. The MC of the first chapter then is introduced. As the first chapter ends, the second chapter...begins. The transition is the same as the first one. As the story flows, the movie gives a very heartwarming slice of life, with a slight touch of love, heartbreak, and a mediocre drama. The story travels from the perspective of a young man experiencing youth, first love, and being unknowledgeable about adults. Being able to wonder why do people leave? The story then jumps from a young man to a 20-ish women. The movie shows how life has plenty of trials to overcome, and how people be able to overcome those difficult trials. In this chapter, the movie also questions you, ”The job you choose, are you really enjoying it?” ”Have you really live life to the fullest?”. Then from 20-ish women to a young boy, in this chapter, you are able to realize how communication is really important at any times. This chapter is so far the best among them. A really strong friendship of a group of best friends followed by a trial they should, with the emotion of love, anxiety, and fear at their backs. This chapter shows how this group of friends reacts to their current situation and how time could never be rewind even you wish to. Overall, the plot is filled with tons of great slice of life, paced on a slow start and an explosive ending. There are no big expectations, to begin with. The story might be boring to some non slice of anime fans. 7/10Art: As the Studio who created Your Name, 5 Centimeter Per Seconds and Garden of Words, it was amazing. Tho there are times where you can able to see some lousy animation, but overall its good. The budget might not be too big as compared to Shinkai’s work, but CoMix Wave really give a shot especially to those beautiful backgrounds! The CGI of the cars are actually good too. Nevertheless, the animation is amazing, tho they have flaws, but the positives overpowered all the negatives. 8/10Sound: Sound effects are great. The food preparation during the first few minutes of the film is amazing. The chopping of ingredients, up to the sound of rain. It's actually pretty decent. The credits song is actually good too. 8/10Character: The character designs are mediocre for me. I mean, CoMix Wave actually has pretty decent animation and art skills. But their character design is just .... meh. Its nothing to be amazing and shock about. VAs are good. They did choose a very warm tone for the VAs of the MCs. There is really no character development that can be seen in the movie. But on how the MCs end their chapter is really a big thumbs up for me. It also relays a message to the viewers and few life lessons. Overall, 7/10Enjoyment: I’m a fan of slice of life anime, so I’m pretty used to a slow-paced plot. A slow pace movie also gives the audience time to enjoy the great art drawn by the studio. Afterall, it is a great animation that leads the viewers to finish the movie at the end. I somewhat enjoy the movie. There are no explosives and huge plot twist like Your Name, nor a heavy drama and heart pounding ending like 5 centimeters. Just pure slice of life with a glimpse of love and a tiny drama. Overall, 8/10Conclusion: As I said a moment ago, this movie is pace differently to other famous one. So you should not compare it to them as they are way different from each other. I would definitely recommend this anime to SOME, as non slice of life and drama fan might get really bored to this film. Overall, a great film if you are looking for something to cry one.

Food""Hidamari no Choushoku"" (Sunny Breakfast)It took us through the need for food. The magical taste of San Xian noodles. How the loss/change of the taste would make us feel, the people with whom we eat and the atmosphere of where we eat....2. Clothing""Chiisana Fashion Show"" (A Small Fashion Show)It shows how fashion has changed the Clothing industry in a good/bad way (depends how you see it). And the people/models who work in this industry are working so hard to be at the top. Finally, it shows that just a normal type of clothing of your favourite colour made by your sister would make you feel better than a super-costly dress.3. Shelter""Shanghai Koi"" (Shanghai Love)It shows that the main character is interested in Architecture. Also, the area where he grew up will soon be demolished and renovated as it is kind of old currently and is in the middle of a great city. It also covers other important needs of life like Love, Education, and you know Life itself.Post credits scene:Its kind of a happy scene where we see all these characters of individual stories at the same place very near to each other. And it shows how small and simple the world is but we just don\'t notice it.It\'s really great to create an anime of such quality with such basic needs in life. I\'m glad to notice this without reading the description of the Anime.I\'ve seen people comparing Shikioriori with Kimi no na wa and review Shikioriori as a bad anime that just copied the style. That\'s completely absurd. Both the anime are unique in their own style. And yes, the art looks like Kimi no na wa and its good. Because anyone would love to see an art with such great detail and quality. And that\'s one big factor we all watch anime. 2.

And it shows how small and simple the world is but we just don\'t notice it.It\'s really great to create an anime of such quality with such basic needs in life. I\'m glad to notice this without reading the description of the Anime.I\'ve seen people comparing Shikioriori with Kimi no na wa and review Shikioriori as a bad anime that just copied the style. That\'s completely absurd. Both the anime are unique in their own style. And yes, the art looks like Kimi no na wa and its good. Because anyone would love to see an art with such great detail and quality. And that\'s one big factor we all watch anime.', ""Netflix refuses to stop with their nu-animu. This time we have the privilege of experiencing the walk of our lifetime, offered by the Chinese because why should anime be Japan exclusive.This movie is split in 3 section that all are about walking,1) The first one is really poetic. Walk and talk because why would person just want to simply enjoy scenery and relax. No, being treated like some plebeian tourist is much more rewarding. I personally recommend turning off the sound to avoid this thing from ruining the visuals as well. This in case you, for some weird reason, still decide to watch this anime2)...The second one is a fashion show walk the catwalk which was pretty philosophical because apparently old people can also walk, but future generations walk faster. This is pretty interesting as I didn't know anyone would ever in the history of never make a story about such nonsense.3) The third one is some sorta 5 centimeters per second alternative which is the best of the 3, but still feels way more pointless than any of the above because the original 5cmps anime (and especially the manga) still exist + it isn't filled with some Chinese words no one cares about.There are also characters in this anime, but I am not sure why anyone would care about them or what they do. In all honesty, I would have found this thing more interesting if the characters had been invisible because at leas then, I could have called it deep for visually representing their personalities.The art is kind of interesting, but what art isn't in this day and age really. As a conclusion: only watch this if you have 2 monitors and are rewatching Hunter x Hunter 2011 at the same time from another. Or at least that's what I did and it was still a waste of time.

The animation when they were whipping it up in the kitchen was kinda heat ngl. I personally found this pretty average. The animation was nice and all but the story wasn't that interesting, it's just about a guy that likes grubbing on some noodles. 6/10The second story was about 2 sisters, one of them worked as a model and the other worked as a designer for her model sister. This story was like eh bruh like I lowkey could've just skipped it and...wouldn't care at all. This story might hit the spot for some viewers but it wasn't for me. The story wasn't bad just wasn't interesting enough for me. 4/10Now the third story, bruh that was like mad heat ong no cap. The third story revolves around 3 childhood friends that were really close together. 2 males and 1 female. One of them had glasses and the other was irrelevant. So the girl and the guy with glasses liked each other and that was pretty poggers. But then, my boy started trolling and throwing away his chances with this girl. We then see him living his life in the future while we slowly learn about the past and the events that had lead to where he is now. At the end it doesn't really explain how he got there and how the girl magically found him again after all those years but it was lit. I wish I was able to see more development between those 2 but it's aight. 8/10So now we moving onto the music. They were BANGERS no other way to describe it. Every time an emotional scene happened, the music came creeping in and before you realized it you were BOPPIN to the song. Anyways I highly suggest listening to the ost on your own free time. 9/10The visuals were aight as well. They put a lot of their effort into the noodles and cooking but after that it felt a little off and kinda weird. (just my personal opinion) but it wasn't bad by any means just felt like it went downwards after they went ham on the noodle animations. 6.8/10 wouldn't care at all. This story might hit the spot for some viewers but it wasn't for me. The story wasn't bad just wasn't interesting enough for me. 4/10Now the third story, bruh that was like mad heat ong no cap.

End of review.Okay.This review took a yearlong because I struggled to finish the film when it first came out, here I am a year later, finished it, felt compelled to write a review because it was bad bad.First of all, the Netflix version and the Bilibili version is not the same, not only the voice actors are different, the music is different. The Netflix Chinese dub was absolutely awful, the writing was extremely inarticulate, almost seems like it was written and read by...a 7-year-old. Even the English dub sounded way better, heck the Brazilian Portuguese was good too and I don’t even understand it. Netflix didn’t even bother dubbing the second story in Cantonese or the dialects in the third story.Second, after switching to the ‘original’ version, it’s still shit! What the fuck!! Like the voice acting is slightly better, but it’s still terrible! The second story was set in Guangzhou, so the characters spoke Cantonese, but it wasn’t done very well not because the Cantonese was inaccurate, but the voice actors just read lines with no emotions put in. The dialogues across the whole film sounds like as if I wrote it (and I have Chinese writing skills of a 5-year-old).I have very fond connections and memories with the three cities in the film and was excited to see a film around them. The name of the film could also be translated as ""four types of youth”, the three types are the ones in the film and the final type is supposed to be your story, you’re meant to self-insert your youth to make up for the fourth type. Poetic sounding right? Except, the other three types of youth story are a bit lame, even my pathetic youth have better dialogues. The first story may as well be “noodle noodle, noodle noodle noodle noodle, noodle.” Second story is shallow and unlikable. Third story is rich pretentious dude reminisce missed youth except he didn’t miss it because he’s rich.This type of short story telling really challenges the writer to be concise and deliver an impactful story in significantly less time. In a traditional film you may get an hour or two to build up characters and plot whereas here there’s only 20 minutes to tell one story. If I was the writer, I would really contemplate the purpose and message that you want to deliver to the audience. Quite frankly, I failed to see a good meaning (I didn’t say deep because not everything needs a deep meaning, but it needs at least a good meaning) in the three stories. The first two was just boring and the characters serve no purpose, the third one is slightly better but then I got frustrated because the guy indirectly got the girl lying on the hospital bed, then at the end he got rich because his old house got knock down and the girl came back, what kind of pretentious Mary Sue is that, it would have been more emotional if she never came back, it could have delivered a ‘sometimes we pass by things that were important to us’ kind of message. For once, a sad ending might have made it a better story. After the credits, it forcefully put the characters in the three stories together, what was the point of that??However, there is one good thing about the film and that is the still background scenes, it’s got that Shinkai look to it, that’s it, nothing more because the character designs were bad.TLDR: bad story, bad characters, don’t bother watching. It might actually be worse than Uchiage, is that even possible. a 7-year-old. Even the English dub sounded way better, heck the Brazilian Portuguese was good too and I don’t even understand it.

It might actually be worse than Uchiage, is that even possible.', 'To begin, this anime was premiered at AnimeExpo 2018 if this is in fact what I think it is, so despite the fact that I haven’t been able to add it to my watched list, this is a review for a show that was shown long before MAL said it first aired (and I’m still slightly upset that MAL wouldn’t let me say I completed it, but that’s not your problem)While I normally review in the same boring style based on the categories of story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, and overall as per MAL recommendation, Shikioriori/flavors of youth (FoY; sorry but I will be abbreviating...it to this for simplicity) follows 3 different stories, each about as long as a normal 25 minute episode. It will be tough, but try to follow my thoughts because I will be trying to review all 3 stories at the same time to make it easier to discuss each part.Story:Split into 3 parts, each has a different message about different parts of life. While it’s not a big issue, it didn’t seem as though there was any sort of connection between any of the 3 stories other than that they all were dealing with their own problems and drama.The 1st story (6/10)is about a kid who has very strong ties to his grandmother and to eating some kind of noodles or beef udon or something if I remember correctly. Either way, it had to deal with eating food and how he establishes connections and meaning in his life through eating this food throughout life as he grows up. By no means is this story bad, but it is incredibly boring. It seems kind of like it was going for a Sweetness and Lightning or Isekai Shokudou, attempting the homey vibe of food, but it didn’t have the same emotional buildup that resonated with me during those shows (particularly the former). It also felt iyashikei style, but as a full movie and only 1 part, it doesn’t work particularly well the way I can imagine Non Non biyori’s movie working, supplemented by cute and already acquainted characters and good comedy. Overall, it’s not bad for completion if you plan to watch it through, but not particularly amazing or interesting.The Second Story (4/10)Is about 2 sisters who I guess used to be pretty close, but have drifted apart over time by the look of the show. The older sister is a model and supports the younger one after some kind of family circumstances occur, while the younger sister falls into the cliche “I just want to support my sister” role. The model is getting older and outshined by younger stars, causing the dramatic internal struggle. What made this part so hard to watch was that the drama wasn’t all that great or emotionally investing and the characters weren’t likable enough to care about their drama. The whole story felt contrived. Somehow, the worst part about it is that it’s hard to skip because it’s right in the middle, but honestly it’s not worth watching.The Third Story (9/10)If you stayed this long through the boring and hard to watch stories, CoMix Wave treats you to a brilliant story that makes you wonder if they could all be this good if Shinkai took over all of them. As it stands, this studio is batting a .333 right now, failing with the first 2 but stunning with this one. Of course, people who endlessly complain about too much school anime won’t ever understand, but this part is about a man who is moving into a new apartment. When he is unpacking, certain things remind him of the past and we are shown flashbacks. It follows a group of 3 kids, he and his 2 best friends, when they were little. One friend is a rambunctious boy while the other is a clearly “embodiment of perfection” girl. With the gimmick of he and the girl exchanging cassette tapes, this is pretty straight as a teen school romance, but it is really well directed by contrast to the other 2 parts. For the first time, there is actual character growth, but more than that is that i managed to feel deeply emotionally connected to the characters and cared about their relationship. I know I didn’t explain it very well, but I highly recommend this specific part.Art: 9/10A universal strong point is always the art. Animated by Studio CoMix Wave (Normally the Shinkai studio) the art is consistently great, even based on my hazy memory and with poor seating at Anime Expo. Expect every part to have beautiful backgrounds with strong visuals. In particular:The first story had extremely detailed food. Which is an important aspect of a story about food. It didn’t mean that the story was any deeper, but they made it look tastier but just as realistic as my instant noodles.The second story still had strong visuals; it meant nothing but outfits and characters looked good I guess.The third story somehow made me wonder who on their staff still owned a cassette tape to model, but somehow it was very realistic. This part had particularly good backgrounds which contributed greatly to immersion into the story’s town and giving me an idea of the kind of people of the town.Sound: (8/10)It was fine. Nothing seemed wrong, and if it was I probably blamed the poor sound quality of Anime Expo and the downside of not having speakers for all people in the room. I know I can’t say anything bad about it at least.Character: (6/10)It should not be surprising that my assessment of the characters line up with my assessment of the story. As a very straight dramatic film, the characters are far and away the most important aspect to creating the atmosphere of the story. All my sentiments line up exactly the same, with the first story’s MC being boring, the second story’s being almost unbearable to watch, and the third’s being super strong and making me care about their struggles, and end up rooting for them.Enjoyment: (7/10)I found myself well entertained and if watching the first 2 parts ranged from bad to boring, i still wouldn’t be upset watching them if it meant getting to something as good as the 3rd part.Overall: (7/10)All 3 had the universally important art and sound done well, and I felt as if the good part was multiple times better than the bad parts sucked, but not enough to overlook the fact that 2/3 of the anime was either boring or bad.Take the time to develop your own opinions about these characters; I just wrote to release pent up frustration with MAL for not allowing me to mark as watched for a full month. it to this for simplicity) follows 3 different stories, each about as long as a normal 25 minute episode.

I plead with you to do it every time.This movie's storytelling is different from the usual. 3 individuals with their own monogatari (story).Each has made a mistake by not trying their best in their own respective way.1/ Not trying to confront his own feelings and always choosing to watch from sideways2/ Misplacing her priority between work and family. A major setback e is part of life, stay strong.3/ Acting based...on anger or bitter feelings is the worst self-punishment. You can lose things forever; please give your best: time, effort, and whatever shame you may think you need to go through.This movie didn't leave a bad taste for me. I can say that giving or striving for my best will make me satisfied, it's a wrong notion that the world has been preaching: you try harder, and you fall harder when you lose (It's a falsehood) Only when you try harder does the door open wider.

Rice Noodles follows Xiao Ming who grew up with rice noodles all his life. His tale is mostly consisting of his many flavours of noodles he had in his lifetime and how the changing of noodles from handmade to manufactured and processed is different and ""doesn\'t taste the same"". The change of rice noodles over his youth is telling of the Chinese before and after with how the noodles change with the times but still that Xiao Ming as an adult will always find his homemade rice noodles if he looks close enough.A Little Fashion Show - ""Sibling Love and Overworking"". A Little Fashion show follows Li Yin a rising fashion model and an older sister to Lu Lu and her wanting to strive to have both of having a good job and making her younger sister happy. This tale is VERY obvious what the message is as LA said the first statements of this section and that is of Chinese\'s overworking ethnics (and by extension Asian work ethnics)  and how doing too much will achieve nothing and this is easily manifested to Li Yin and her struggles of juggling of being a family member and older sister and her staying at the top.Shanghai Love - ""Your Name.....Lite"".  A love story spanning years. This tale follows Li Mo finding an old cassette of his childhood friend Xiao Yu which begins his reminisce of his youth and finding Xiao Yu. LA will get straight to the point with this one, it\'s the best of the three stories if not taking cues from Your Name, the similarities are there, friends through a link, now as adults they try to find each other, heck their character designs even look similar to Mitsuha and Taki. Anyways there is another layer to this love story and the more obvious one is of Xiao Yu\'s strict family and this links and affects to their love story, yes it\'s extremely cliche by this point of the ""strict family"" but it\'s predictable what happens as well, even if the message of Shanghai Love is showing the differing family values affects your life to compare Xiao Yu\'s strict family and the mess it causes with Xiao Yu wanting freedom with how Li Mo having that freedom becomes restricted from his friends and as an adult becomes jaded and disillusioned to get his goal that he\'s forgotten over the years.Shikioriori\'s animation was done by CoMix Wave Films and if this studio sounds familiar they also did Your Name, Garden of Words and 5cm per Second (another words, alot of Makoto Shinkai works) and Shikioriori is no different with having the hallmarks of Your Name and Garden of Words for animation from the character designs, beautiful backgrounding and huge attention to detail, though Makoto Shinkai doesn\'t have his foot in this movie, Takayo Nishimura a key animator in Your Name and Animation Director of 5cm per Second makes sense to the animation quality. Nonetheless if there is a high point to Shikioriori then it\'s the animation.Shikioriori for LA falls under the pretentiousness when it\'s trying to convey it\'s messages (maybe the exception to Shanghai Love but nonetheless). LA ""gets"" this is targeted towards a Chinese and Asian audience with all the struggles they go through on a daily basis but there are still many ways of at least making it seem genuine and LA just didn\'t see it especially from Rice Noodles. Shikioriori for the most part does it part of showing it\'s stories and the struggles of it\'s characters but making it\'s messages one blatant, two long winded and forced and finally three cliched in it\'s mundanity then you lose LA and with the exception of Shanghai Love, Rice Noodles and A Little Fashion Show shows these in spades one way or another.With all that being said, Shikioriori is not a terrible interpretation of Chinese youths as it\'s messages of ""changing times, sibling love and family values and freedom"" was done to some good degree and LA isn\'t ignoring that as even blatant the messages comes out, the messages follow through each story nicely and solidifying it\'s themes. However it needed to do better in it\'s execution and maybe it\'s premise at times to make Shikioriori a bit more genuine in it\'s delivery, instead of the cliched plots and characters in giving us what we typically expected. sometime"". Rice Noodles follows Xiao Ming who grew up with rice noodles all his life. His tale is mostly consisting of his many flavours of noodles he had in his lifetime and how the changing of noodles from handmade to manufactured and processed is different and ""doesn\'t taste the same"".

Anyways there is another layer to this love story and the more obvious one is of Xiao Yu\'s strict family and this links and affects to their love story, yes it\'s extremely cliche by this point of the ""strict family"" but it\'s predictable what happens as well, even if the message of Shanghai Love is showing the differing family values affects your life to compare Xiao Yu\'s strict family and the mess it causes with Xiao Yu wanting freedom with how Li Mo having that freedom becomes restricted from his friends and as an adult becomes jaded and disillusioned to get his goal that he\'s forgotten over the years.Shikioriori\'s animation was done by CoMix Wave Films and if this studio sounds familiar they also did Your Name, Garden of Words and 5cm per Second (another words, alot of Makoto Shinkai works) and Shikioriori is no different with having the hallmarks of Your Name and Garden of Words for animation from the character designs, beautiful backgrounding and huge attention to detail, though Makoto Shinkai doesn\'t have his foot in this movie, Takayo Nishimura a key animator in Your Name and Animation Director of 5cm per Second makes sense to the animation quality. Nonetheless if there is a high point to Shikioriori then it\'s the animation.Shikioriori for LA falls under the pretentiousness when it\'s trying to convey it\'s messages (maybe the exception to Shanghai Love but nonetheless). LA ""gets"" this is targeted towards a Chinese and Asian audience with all the struggles they go through on a daily basis but there are still many ways of at least making it seem genuine and LA just didn\'t see it especially from Rice Noodles. Shikioriori for the most part does it part of showing it\'s stories and the struggles of it\'s characters but making it\'s messages one blatant, two long winded and forced and finally three cliched in it\'s mundanity then you lose LA and with the exception of Shanghai Love, Rice Noodles and A Little Fashion Show shows these in spades one way or another.With all that being said, Shikioriori is not a terrible interpretation of Chinese youths as it\'s messages of ""changing times, sibling love and family values and freedom"" was done to some good degree and LA isn\'t ignoring that as even blatant the messages comes out, the messages follow through each story nicely and solidifying it\'s themes. However it needed to do better in it\'s execution and maybe it\'s premise at times to make Shikioriori a bit more genuine in it\'s delivery, instead of the cliched plots and characters in giving us what we typically expected.', 'Beautiful animation, though not quite on the same levels as they have produced in other films. The problem comes with the stories, firstly because of the short run time and the choice of making 3 short films rather than 1 long or 2 semi-short. This makes it so that there never really is that much time to delve deeper into the characters in each one, so they feel kind of distant and not as relatable as they could be.There is also an issue with how the films build up their climax and end game, because there is no build up. They introduce the characters,...drop a bomb and then leave the empty characters to try to clean up the mess. Not an ideal scenario if you want to make touching stories.The last story was by far the best, but even then the progression was as clear as a guess 1 sec into the future, especially if you have seen Makoto\'s films before this.Take Your name., which the marketing was based upon, as an example:* Remove 90% of the film by condensing the beginning of the film to 5 min, take 10 from the middle and squash it together and then take the last 10 min and cut it into 5 min.* Cut it together so it sort of makes sense.* Wholá, a finished short film!

I've seen single anime episodes longer.This movie is very very similar to 5 Centimeters per Second in many ways. Both movies are shorter, and are split up into episodes. The episodes here are different subjects tho while 5 cm per second is all connected.I liked 5 cm per second, like a lot.but like neither of them are Your Name level (My favorite movie of ALL time)5 Centimeter per second would be a normally mid movie, but that ending.... that ending was one of the best endings for a movie.This movie?1st episode was very very cute. Quite sad towards the end but a very cute episode and made me hungry lol.2nd episode quite frankly was bad. No message, nothing.3rd episode was amazing...The 3rd episode was actually really good. 3rd Episode is the type of stuff Makoto would make.So its super weird to rate it. To be fair this would be a 5/5, but that 2nd episode brought it down to a 4.I liked this better than Suzume and Weathering with You though. THey didn't have as much emotional baggage as this does.Animation: Some of the best animation for an anime.

The animation and story really lured me into this anime. I did see the international film on Netflix which had it all together I suppose. I didn't really like the narration. It really got boring; I thought it was going to be like a film not just someone speaking about their life story. It really got boring for 8 minutes, so I dropped it. I felt really disappointed on how it led up. I was going to see it with my friends, but it just got boring for them too....If I could rate the animation from 1 to 10, it would automatically be a 10 plus with a great narrative story that fits the art style as well. Don't get me wrong if you're into a narrative storytelling, GO RIGHT AHEAD BECAUSE THIS IS THE STUFF TO SEE YA KNOW?! but if you don't then I wouldn't recommend it.

To give some background, I’m a 17 year old who lived in ShangHai for 11 years of my life, and trust me, I have a few things to say about this film.Setting:I did not know the stories were located in China before I started watching it, since it was suggested by a friend, but I did enjoy the fact that it is something new and different. Without losing the forces on the story the film is trying to tell, it does a great job of setting the right location with the right context. Everything felt right, but not...just that, they felt real. Although I can’t say much for the locations of the first two episodes other than their accurate, I do have a lot to say about the last one. The details that were used to create the atmosphere was not only correct, but surprisingly fitting. Countless times during the film I would pause, close my eyes, and let the nostalgic feelings hit me. People leaving their tab on low to cheat the water bills, the cassette tapes that can’t be found anymore, and even the old toys in the box remind me of the exact same brand toys I had when I was young, all of which originated off of a Chinese cartoon. This is a Netflix anime, and for it to be this accurate, down to the very details of the early 2000s era of China made me surprised.Story:The stories are fairly generic, but done well with the touch of music, animation and great voice acting. This isn’t going to be the first time you watch a story about a guy reminiscing about his childhood experiences. Or a story about someone successful being replaced by someone new. And if you have seen Kimi no na wa, you would think that the third episode has a lot of common points with Kimi no na wa. Some part of the film is a little boring to sit thought, but overall, I was able to keep watching everything it had to offer. The endings seemed a little forcefully cut short, which I did not like.Characters:Characters seemed really generic to the story. This film mostly focus on story telling, rather than character development. Which means the characters really aren’t going to be too rememberable.Music:The background music fits the story well, it set the mood for some of the scenes and it never felt repetitive or out of place. Nothing really stood out to me, but nothing was out of place.Animation:The art and animation is 10/10, I mean, there are not many animes out there that can make noodles look this fucking good… FUCKING NOODLES.Overall:This show is a 8.5/10 for me. Might not be for everyone, but definitely doesn't deserve the embarrassing low ratings of 1/10 or 3/10 that I've been seeing. just that, they felt real.

So here's a VERY summed up review of the anthology movie mostly so I can go back here if I ever forget why I liked the movieShort 1: Had good animation but looked very weird sometimes. The story was very plain and so was the main character who didn't get any development either. The music was okayShort 2: Had much better animation, characters, and story, but the music was still just okayShort 3: Had a great story, good animation, and okay...characters and music.All together: they all had a consistent theme but used it in different ways making it interesting characters and music.All together: they all had a consistent theme but used it in different ways making it interesting"", 'Flavor of Youth, A box full of happiness wrapped in 1 hour with 3 different segmentsThis Spoiler Contains No spoilers,Shikishiori/si shi qi chun / Flavor of Youth is like a bowl of ""chicken soup"" contains a lot of spices which makes it spicy and full of surprises. Shikishiori is a movie with 3 short stories in it, we do hope the short stories connect each other but sadly comix had a different plan for this one. In order to explain it in details, i\'ve breaked down the story into 3 paragraphs.The first story tells us about a story of a young man with all his...life eating a Chinese Ramen for breakfast. What I love about this story is how you can tell someone life with a  single ramen, how he eats the ramen every morning with his grandma during his childhood, how he found his first love through the ramen and how ramen at that time very much different from when he was a kid. The exposition director approached in this section is absolutely beautiful and of course, it brought me down to tears. The background music was much much much much awesome and struck me to the bone because of it synchronizes well with the animation.The second story tells us a story about a successful model with her dilemmas which is from a newcomer competitor which she\'s aware and her \'strained\' relationship with her sister. the story is composed well enough because how you build up that ""dilemmas"" and how it reached the peak, but sadly it lacks on the conclusion part of the story and a bit bland if I might say so. The BGM absolutely beautiful with strings and piano that can build the scene very well in this story.The last part of this movie and my favorite part is a story about 2 childhood friends, sharing cassette as a method of conversation (considering at that time they don\'t have LINE chat it actually a good method communicating to each other), then things got complicated realizing they both in love. The last part of this movie totally has that ""5 cm per Seconds"" vibe, because it\'s about how you develop feelings for your friend and how it went bad and all sudden you realized that you actually messed up and it\'s too late to fix it because you all grown up.  I am very much adored this story, how it reached the climax and how it concludes. The only bad part of this segment is how you fit a 1-hour movie into 30 mins and I think that a lot of details were skipped and the story feels like ""jumped"", other than that all goodThe Music is the best part of this movie because it takes you to every scene very well. With a combination of Strings and piano, it surely has that ""Garden of Words"" vibe. unfortunately, the sound director made poor mistakes by some part of conversations feels bland and not suited or should be retaken. also, Vickeblanka really up to that standard set by Radwimps, Motohira Hata, and Yamazaki Masayoshi by delivering the same vibe for ending song. Its a bit play safe, but I think still acceptable and very much enjoyable.Overall, its very much warm your soul by watching this movie. already a bit bland in the mid, but still a good movie you can get in 2018.  8/10 life eating a Chinese Ramen for breakfast.

Firstly, I\'m all for short films, but I felt like the second and third stories deserved their own full films. They were emotionally compelling, and I just wasn\'t given enough time to become emotionally invested. Especially with the third film, it progressed so quickly that everything became quite predictable. And, I found it really hard to sympathize with Li because, at the end of the day, there is no fucking way he deserves to be with Xiao Yu. At least not according to how he is portrayed in the movie.Rewinding a bit, the first...film just left me cold. The bits that could have been a bit emotional were just so melodramatic, like when he arrives just in time to see his grandmother before she passes. I credit this simply to the speedy pace of the story. Ultimately, I was left trying to figure out what at all the story was and what I was supposed to feel. It felt more like the first 20 minutes of a movie that was never completed. And, it could have been a great movie from what I did see. The short film on its own, however, just really did not impact me. I\'m struggling to remember bits of it writing this review even though I saw it less than an hour ago.The second film had a much more compelling story. My major qualm with it however is that it doesn\'t really stay true at all to the theme of the three films -- youth. It is entirely centered around the present-day lives of the two sisters; I\'d honestly be surprised if more than three or four minutes were dedicated to discussing or mentioning their childhood. And, of course, the biggest disappointment is that it couldn\'t be a feature-length film. I would have loved to have seen more development of the younger sister especially. It\'s honestly tremendously sad because it\'s a great story.As for the third film, most of what I have to say I said earlier. It was certainly the most emotionally compelling of the three, but, unfortunately, the emotion I felt throughout was honestly a bit angry. There are plenty of movies out there where the clueless guy ends up hurting the girl who loves him. And indeed, in many, they do end up together at the end of the film. But this is only after the guy\'s quest for redemption and his million apologies. Ultimately, the film would simply have to be longer to have a true emotional impact on me (and I\'m sure it would if it was).Truthfully, I have been absolutely spoiled recently, having watched A Silent Voice, Your Name, and Your Lie in April these past few weeks. I LOVED all of them, and I absolutely cried my eyes out at the end of Your Lie in April. Perhaps I set my expectations a bit high for Flavors of Youth, but then again, the film was marketed as ""by the studio that produced Your Name"". At the end of the day, it is no Your Name. It feels like some director thought, ""Wouldn\'t it be cool if we have three stories and then they all meet in this airport at the end and the guy who eats noodles ties it all together with some cheesy line?""The tragedy is, they are indeed three wonderful stories (the first; the beginning to one), and truly deserve their own full-length films. I don\'t think anyone could have combined the three any better, so I applaud the directors for their efforts. At the end of the day, there are some beautiful animations, and a few moments that may inspire emotion in a person who is more prone to that kind of thing. But then again, I am that kind of person and yet I was not. I do recommend you see it because fuck what I think, but I wouldn\'t rush to. film just left me cold.

Something about his stories really strike a chord in me, even if he seemingly retells the same story over and over again. He could tell it probably a dozen more times and I\'d still love them all. This is probably the biggest reason why I didn\'t dislike Flavors of Youth, despite it being a little bit lacking in the emotional investment department.Half of every great anime, but especially anime movies, comes from the visuals and soundtrack. It\'s an...extremely rare occurrence when an anime movie can falter in one or both of these categories and still be considered decent. In the case of Flavors of Youth, it doesn\'t disappoint in either. The visuals are top notch, as expected from CoMix Wave, from which we got Your Name and Garden of Words, two of the most beautiful anime of all time. Also, big shout out to the San Xian noodles in the first story, Sunny Breakfast. Even now, I\'m thinking back on those bad boys and getting hungry. The soundtrack for Flavors of Youth is really good, if not a little reserved. You\'ll not find anything quite as evocative as ""Sparkle"" from Your Name or as powerfully emotional as ""A Rainy Morning"" from the Garden of Words, but it\'s extremely hard to measure up to those masterful works anyway. The ending song, WALK by Vickeblanka is probably my favorite song on the soundtrack, but that\'s probably because it\'s the most memorable song.Now I can talk about the stories, which is where the main issues lie. I\'ve already alluded to the first story, Sunny Breakfast, a little bit. Character-wise, it\'s probably the weakest of the three, but that\'s to be expected. After all, its a story about one guy narrating his youth and how many of his most cherished memories were spent eating San Xian noodles with his loved ones. It\'s actually kind of beautiful in its own simplistic way. I\'ve heard a lot that this is most people\'s least favorite story in Flavors of Youth, but it may just be my favorite. At least, favorite based on the story.The second story, A Little Fashion Show, is probably the weakest in all aspects. I couldn\'t bring myself to like the characters very much and the story was really predictable. I\'m not one to complain about simple stories, as is evidenced by my appreciation of the first story, but I\'m a little less forgiving of the completely mundane story of A Little Fashion Show. It was just a mess of cliches with the message of....I\'m really not sure actually. I guess you can say it was a coming of age story, but that just makes it sound even more generic and cliched.The third story, Shanghai Love, is the story that is most Shinkai-esque. In fact, it kind of mirrors 5 Centimeters per Second perfectly until the ending. Personally, I really liked the story and characters outside of the main boy, Limo. I mean, that boy was basically a walking mistake, he deserved neither his best friend or best girl with his attitude. But that\'s a personal gripe, I suppose.I feel like it\'s somewhat pointless to do a favorite character for this since there\'s only one character who got enough characterization to deserve the title, but oh well, I\'ll do it anyway.Favorite Character: Mistuh- I mean Shao YuYeah...Not much to add here, she was the best character by default, since she got the most development and actually has a personality. Also, she\'s Chinese Mitsuha, so bonus points.Despite me not loving Flavors of Youth, I\'d still recommend it to anyone. It\'s so short and such a pure story that, even if you have gripes with it, you can still appreciate it for being what it is, a contemplation of short stories that each lean heavily on a different theme. The first on the cherished memories of eating with loved ones, the second on coming to realize that beauty is not forever, and the third on communicating your feelings. Each of these themes are tackled really well, even if the surrounding story and characters aren\'t amazing. But if you have any appreciation for Mokoto Shinkai\'s work, then you\'ll probably enjoy the Flavors of Youth. extremely rare occurrence when an anime movie can falter in one or both of these categories and still be considered decent.

I couldn't figure out what it was about until a quarter way through the story, but i honestly think it was very moving by the end, it was short and sweet. Now the second one I didn't so much, I think the story was rushed as well as the character development but I thought it was cute in the end and I enjoyed it a little. The third one was very moving (probably cause I'm a sucker...for cheesy romance) It had a lot of components to it that i felt the other two somewhat lacked, Its main focus was self discovery (witch was basically the same point of the other storys) but it also dived into romance as well as peer pressure.

I\'ve always been a big fan of china and its rich juicy history, and have even considered moving there if it was not for its urban pollution problems and messed politics.Its obviously directed towards the Chinese...audience and each short story manages to sneakingly capture some underlying problems in Chinese society while giving the average viewer a treat for their heart.As someone who has managed to fuck up a relationship with the person i cherish the most i can only tell the younger viewers reading this should to try and enjoy the simple pleasures of life rather then rush ahead like i did, wasting a huge part of my youth.Each and every story was filled with heartwarming pleasures that warm the soul and something ill probably come and re-watch again and again until I\'ve milked it as much as i can.The art was pretty great and definitely deserves a 9 but due to the fact i love bright anime styles it gets a +1 point from me.The sound was great and each and every detail had a sound that made everything feel real and comforting.The Characters are one of the best aspects of these shorts and seeing them reminisce and fix their mistakes or aspire to get what they wanted was a great experience.I Personally Did not like ""Your name"" at all and i came into this expecting nothing special but man was i wrong. This is a great piece of anime art and something i recommend to most who have the time on their hands.As by my review tradition, The best thing you can have while watching this is a cup of instant noodles while you sit in a soft sofa/chair.Overall (9)[Story:8 // Art:10 // Sound:7 // Characters:9 // Enjoyment:10] audience and each short story manages to sneakingly capture some underlying problems in Chinese society while giving the average viewer a treat for their heart.As someone who has managed to fuck up a relationship with the person i cherish the most i can only tell the younger viewers reading this should to try and enjoy the simple pleasures of life rather then rush ahead like i did, wasting a huge part of my youth.Each and every story was filled with heartwarming pleasures that warm the soul and something ill probably come and re-watch again and again until I\'ve milked it as much as i can.The art was pretty great and definitely deserves a 9 but due to the fact i love bright anime styles it gets a +1 point from me.The sound was great and each and every detail had a sound that made everything feel real and comforting.The Characters are one of the best aspects of these shorts and seeing them reminisce and fix their mistakes or aspire to get what they wanted was a great experience.I Personally Did not like ""Your name"" at all and i came into this expecting nothing special but man was i wrong.

All three parts are generic to watch, though it does get better as it goes on. I particularly like that the first part is dedicated to past, the second to present and the third to the future. It is a nice touch. Though the story-telling was not executed very well.Story: 5/101) 'A Sunny Breakfast'You may as well just skip this part. There is nothing to it at all. The entire thing is a guy narrating about noodles. I honestly thought it would end up being a really long noodle...advert. The pacing was awful, one moment he is a child who loves noodles and then he is a teenager who loves noodles. The only character traits of this guy is that he likes noodles and he likes a random girl he sees for about 5 seconds everyday.No way is he interesting enough to be called a protagonist. He just talks about how the world is changing and how noodles are getting less and less care put into them. Nothing is actually developed on so there is no way I can be emotionally attached even in the slightest. Some people also die as a quick attempt to get some emotion as if it expects us to care about a random person we do not know. It fails to teach the audience anything about China's culture, and this is the most Chinese-related part of the whole film. At least this part is actually related to China though in some sense.2) 'A Small Fashion Show'This part was a lot better, more of an interesting story with more interesting characters with actual personalities, albeit not very good ones. I didn't hate it but it also wasn't something amazing. It also sends out a very bad message to people. It is about this model who is trying to come to terms with the fact that she is getting old, and proceeds to overexert herself through exercise and bulimia in order to try and stay pretty. What a great message to send to the audience. She completely contradicts herself throughout. Who thought this would be a good plot?There is very forced drama between her and her sister for reasons I do not understand. When it was happening I really could not figure out why or what was happening. This entire part has absolutely zilch to do with China, and could have taken place literally anywhere in the world. Felt more like an American-based plot in fact.3) 'Love in Shanghai'I actually really enjoyed this part, definitely the strongest of them all, and has raised my score a lot. If this had been the only part, then I would give this show an 7/10. Nothing felt forced, and though it was a predictable plot, I still really liked it as it was done right. This guy is in love with this girl, to which they get separated due to his stubborness. Basically it is the plot of Byousoku 5 Centimeter, but arguably better. Though the ending of it made the entire plot kind of pointless, it is still worth watching and the best part of the entire movie.Again, doesn't really have that much to do with Chinese culture, apart from the fact that is has a very Chinese structured family when it comes to school etc. However, like the second part, this could be placed anywhere in the world and still work the same.Art: 6/10Very nice. The background art was very pretty and I cannot fault it too much. The detailing on the backgrounds and the dreaded noodles were very very amazing and aesthetic. Actual character designs were pretty awful and bland, the best of them all would be the second part. The animation itself was choppy and poorly done.Sound: 6/10Not a lot to say about this. The music was pretty nice, the seiyuus performed their role nicely. There was no OP but the ED song was also quite good. Nothing was really outstanding enough to make this any higher.Character: 4/10There is nothing great about the characters. The first part had the most unrelatable and monotone protagonist I could ever dream of. Second part had a girl that is extremely unlikable and predictable. Third part had characters that looked as if they were literally stolen from Makoto Shinkai's works, but they were a lot more likable than the others. I liked the personalities, despite them being very unoriginal.Overall: 4/10I would not recommend this to people, and I will not be watching it again.

Last time I felt like that while I was watching Kimi no na wa (Your name). The best is art in this movie. You can feel the sound. This movie consists 3 stories together. All are very cute and heart warming story. 3 stories have 3 different flavours, flavours of youth. My personal most favourite is the 1st one but others are great too. This movie gives you satisfaction. And happiness.In every story the protagonist presents their life stories in childhood and now with some nostalgia and...every story has a little twist at the end. every story has a little twist at the end.', 'Flavours of Youth is a story not dedicated to literal food. Rather, a collection of three stories from a time of the early tastes of life. The taste of nostalgia if you like.I can\'t say I relate to this movie, my life isn\'t very exciting or eventful compared to others. What I will say however is that it is a good representation of the many different stories people carry along with them and continue to write days, months, years into the future, until the halting of one\'s life comes. Picture yourself in a busy metropolitan area, with every person that passes you, a story, eventful,...uneventful, exciting, unexciting, happy, unhappy, orthodox, unorthodox, interesting, uninteresting. A magnitude of adjectives can be used to describe an individual\'s sole story, and it is mind-boggling really. It probably isn\'t something you think about on a daily basis, but we forget that every person you pass by has this story that may or may not be worth your time, but an interesting timeline of events to share nonetheless. Flavours of Youth is just that reminder about this concept which makes it more interesting to watch, as I have said. You may get not out of the anime, or you might get one of the best anime you have seen in a while. But the fact reminds that it gives this idea of invisible crossroads with pretty much every human that you have seen in your life. It is a lovely representation of the connectivity of all of us.When I watched this, I personally enjoyed the parts in the order of (highest to lowest): 1, 3, 2. The 1st story - The Rice Noodles, just shows the nostalgia of the literal taste that comes with nostalgia, and what was being experienced at the time. It had pretty good narration which would make sense with flashbacking, personally why I enjoyed it a lot. The 2nd story - A Little Fashion Show, probably the most different of all three, revolve around fashion. The clever thing about the 2nd part was not the flashbacking to the past but rather, the little sister acting as a memoir for the past. The 3rd story - Love in Shanghai, is basically every drama romance you have seen, in saying that though, it is a good thing that it exists to show the ""regular"" lives that go on in this world. Basically, all three stories do pretty well in showing the norm and not the norm, connecting them at the very end to give an image of the connections we all have. It is done simplistically but it is to be expected from people who aren\'t exactly flying through the air at will, or have been isekai\'d for the 36th time already. But don\'t be disheartened, the simple is sometimes the most beautiful, and Flavours of Youth is no exception.The audiovisuals aren\'t exactly the best that CoMix Wave can give if I am honest, probably the worst I have seen from the studio, but that doesn\'t mean it is bad, it is just that you will find better. I would still say it is visually appealing and the ost is alright if you need some words that would best fit.Overall - 7.2 (7)TLDR Review:Story - 7: Three-in-one, all stories have a good connection and theme of the past.Art - 8: Not the best from CoMix Wave, by no means bad, however.Sound - 7: Decent ostCharacter - 7: Fine characters you would expect to see in stories of its kindEnjoyment - 7: Worth the time. Can get a thing or two from the story to think on as well.Overall - 7.2 (7)This isn\'t the longest review I have made, I wanted to keep it more summarized, as well as the story didn\'t have a lot to offer than I could comment on. But what I really liked about this anime is that it goes to show that the people around you may be much more interesting than you think on the surface of things. You never know what story may keep you intrigued, and the people next to you are probably your best bet of finding such a thing. Online or in real life.

I was attracted to the idea that this was an anime created by the creators of your name, a movie that is visually stunning and has an amazing story. When I saw the romance tag to this movie, I had a similar expectation. That expectation was entirely wrong. This is not a romance, it is 3 separate stories that mesh in inconsequential ways at the end of the film. The combination of the three stories as a...single movie feels like a crime as the only similar trait between them is all of the characters are finding their \'meaning\' in life and reflecting on their journeys. This is realign just in line with some of the other Netflix originals, throwing money at a shit idea and dressing it up to look nice.Character:As individual stories most of the characters felt very generic and dry. The only meaningful story in my eyes was the story of the two sisters a model and a fashion designer. Their ""complex"" relationship, if you could call it that, was the only redeeming plot point to this entire move.Art and sound:The art and sound design are what is to be expected from the studio responsible for a cinematic masterpiece like your name. I find that the only redeeming factor to this lack luster film is that at least I sat though an hour and a half of pretty nothingness.Overall, I find this movie as a hard no as for someone who has the same reasons to watch as I did. Aside from my own ideals prior to beginning the film, I find that the entire film as a whole is a hobbled tougher amalgamation of half baked stories that the studio just had laying around and decided to pump 3 short films and tie them together for a quick buck. single movie feels like a crime as the only similar trait between them is all of the characters are finding their \'meaning\' in life and reflecting on their journeys.

Such a sweet and easy watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.What I loved is that we were able to see such different parts of one country, and how all these different parts had such different stories, with such different settings and cultures, with such different characters and lifestyles.It was a breath of fresh air, because the movie was so unique from other films. Something that I'd like to see a little bit more of.But in saying that, it was also kind of mediocre in a way.

As someone who lived in both Japan and Vietnam and has travelled extensively through SE Asia, China and the two Koreas, I can honestly say that food is the central theme of East Asian life. Subtles differences in taste, memories and passions all centre around food. This reflects that.The middle tale was less interesting. And ageing model worries about losing her looks, Disneyesque ending. Watchable but that's all.The third story I enjoyed more. I liked the medium of cassette tapes to symbolise the passing of time.The link of them all in...the airport was a bit weak. the airport was a bit weak."", ""I really wish I could write a review for each of the different stories because I think they all were so different it's hard to give them an overall number score together. I didn't not like the story of any of them, but I think they all had varying levels of success and execution. Whether that was time, energy, funds, or a combination of all three, the last one was easily the best out of the three. I think they were smart to put it last because it was the story I connected with the emotions of the characters the most. The first was like...hearing a story from a grandparent, it was nostalgic and heavily relied on the connection between food and memory. I love that idea and wish we saw more of it in Western media. The second story was, I think, much more successful in establishing the connection and emotion between the two characters. And the third had the most heartwarming and relatable characters. Either way, visually it was gorgeous as Kimi no na wa, and the soundtrack was alright. I think people are also underestimating the importance of this collaboration, but anyway. Definitely worth your time. Especially if you watched Fireworks. hearing a story from a grandparent, it was nostalgic and heavily relied on the connection between food and memory.

It was also longer than the first part, I wish that they had spent more time on the third part or even the first part, rather than dedicating the majority of the movie to...this...

I get that there was barely anything going on, but that's also the reason why the director put it there. In reality, not every story is going to be dramatic or as interesting as some other stories do. The director wants you to relate to the characters somehow, not just show anything enjoyable. A story doesn't always have to be intriguing. I think the director wanted to remind us that there's not always going to be people with big events happening in their life. There's going to be people...where they have a neutral life, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be interesting later. The director just wanted to show us reality that things don't go the way people always want, like the noodles and the girl he liked (in the first episode). The story line in the second episode was a little too straightforward and fast paced, but it wasn't supposed to be that long, so I get it. They didn't really finish with the boyfriend issue, so I wanted to see what happened there. In the third episode was where most of this rating came from. I'm not a fan of romance, especially in anime because for me, personally, they're just the same story over and over again. I also don't like hopeless romance, especially in 5 Centimeters Per Second (If you haven't watched 5 Centimeters Per Second, then you won't know what I'm talking about). The ending in that movie was good, but the director didn't make it good. But the third episode, it was a little bit of hopeless romance, but not too hopeless for the lovers to get too depressed about. It nice and pure, wasn't too lovey dovey in a way, either. For people who don't like too much romance, this episode was the perfect one. The one thing I wasn't quite satisfied about was the ending where the girl suddenly showed up and they're all happy again. It was a little too rushed, but the nice scene where everybody joins up at the end made me ignore the bad little detail right away.Art: 8/10I'm not going to say much; it's already beautiful. It's the same director from Your Name. I took two points off because I'm not a fan of the people, but everything else is amazing.Sound: 10/10This is my first review, so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about the opening/ending for this. I watched the music video and it was fantastic. I don't remember if that's the same music for the opening/ending, but if it is, this deserves a perfect score.Character: 7/10In the first episode, he didn't really have much character, but it's not entirely his fault as the episode was supposed to be like that way. In the second episode, I really love family relationships, so it was nice to see two siblings living together and not separated like anime usually does. The third episode was pretty interesting; all the characters had good character development and not keeping the same personality as when they were little.Enjoyment: 7/10This could have gotten a 6, but if you're the type into emotional stuff like this, it's not so bad. I really enjoyed how neutral the first episode is even though a lot of people disliked the fact it was so boring. It really showed how real it was, and really just showing an ordinary life of an ordinary person. I'm not saying the other two episodes were not as good, but I love when it's unique and different what you see in anime in general.Overall: 8/10I wanted to give this a 9, but it wasn't very powerful as some of the popular movies. Personally, I really like to find deep meanings after finishing a movie. Not that this movie didn't have any meaning, but I think this movie just wanted to remind us our youthful days and how that impacts our future. And if not, some day. where they have a neutral life, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be interesting later. The director just wanted to show us reality that things don't go the way people always want, like the noodles and the girl he liked (in the first episode). The story line in the second episode was a little too straightforward and fast paced, but it wasn't supposed to be that long, so I get it. They didn't really finish with the boyfriend issue, so I wanted to see what happened there. In the third episode was where most of this rating came from. I'm not a fan of romance, especially in anime because for me, personally, they're just the same story over and over again. I also don't like hopeless romance, especially in 5 Centimeters Per Second (If you haven't watched 5 Centimeters Per Second, then you won't know what I'm talking about). The ending in that movie was good, but the director didn't make it good. But the third episode, it was a little bit of hopeless romance, but not too hopeless for the lovers to get too depressed about. It nice and pure, wasn't too lovey dovey in a way, either. For people who don't like too much romance, this episode was the perfect one. The one thing I wasn't quite satisfied about was the ending where the girl suddenly showed up and they're all happy again. It was a little too rushed, but the nice scene where everybody joins up at the end made me ignore the bad little detail right away.Art: 8/10I'm not going to say much; it's already beautiful. It's the same director from Your Name. I took two points off because I'm not a fan of the people, but everything else is amazing.Sound: 10/10This is my first review, so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about the opening/ending for this. I watched the music video and it was fantastic. I don't remember if that's the same music for the opening/ending, but if it is, this deserves a perfect score.Character: 7/10In the first episode, he didn't really have much character, but it's not entirely his fault as the episode was supposed to be like that way. In the second episode, I really love family relationships, so it was nice to see two siblings living together and not separated like anime usually does. The third episode was pretty interesting; all the characters had good character development and not keeping the same personality as when they were little.Enjoyment: 7/10This could have gotten a 6, but if you're the type into emotional stuff like this, it's not so bad. I really enjoyed how neutral the first episode is even though a lot of people disliked the fact it was so boring. It really showed how real it was, and really just showing an ordinary life of an ordinary person. I'm not saying the other two episodes were not as good, but I love when it's unique and different what you see in anime in general.Overall: 8/10I wanted to give this a 9, but it wasn't very powerful as some of the popular movies. Personally, I really like to find deep meanings after finishing a movie. Not that this movie didn't have any meaning, but I think this movie just wanted to remind us our youthful days and how that impacts our future. And if not, some day."", ""So Flavors Of Youth is an anime mixed of 3 different stories. So let me explain each of them.1st one. So the first story is about a guy named Xiao Ming and his grandmother. The whole story of the anime was about the moment's of Xiao childhood with his grandmother and some highschool memories of Xiao.2nd story. The second story was about two sisters named Yi Lin and Lulu. So Yi Lin is a beautiful model and her little sister is a fashion designer. They both lost their parents in childhood. So they both live in an apartment together. But for some reason, the...relationship between Yi Lin and her sister Lulu is not that good. One day Yin Lin had to quit her job ( I'm not saying the reason because it would be a spoiler). But Yin's sister Lulu doesn't want her sister to quit her job. So that's why Lulu tried to fill the gap between the relationship with her sister and encourage her to not quit the job.And finally the last story.The last story is one of the best stories of this anime. The last story is about a boy named Li Mo and his youthful days with his two friends Pan and Xiao Yu. So Xiao Yu was Li Mo's past lover. An exchange of tapes became their language of love and their words of encouragement for each other. But one day Xiao's father decided to send her daughter to a popular high school far away from her home. So that means she has to leave Li Mo. But Li Mo doesn't want to leave Xiao. So he studied day and night to get admission to the same school where Xiao going. So, as a result, he started to avoid everyone even his lover Li Mo and studied like crazy.

But before leave Li gave the last tape to Xiao and describes how she feel about him.So all three-story was really so enjoyable and the last story was totally heartwarming. I mean the last story was the best story of the whole anime. Overall the soundtracks and the animation were great.

I think the anime film\'s ""faithfulness"" in trying to depict Chinese settings is 70%, 60%, 65% for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd stories.  The directors of the 1st and 3rd stories are Chinese folks who actually were born and were once living in places in China, and the director of the 2nd story is a Japanese yet I think this Japanese director (from CoMix Wave Films that once made Kimi no Na wa.) did his homework.The 1st story, ""The Rice Noodles"" in Hunan:- it gives me the most echo,...because in my area there was a long-time snacks shop of my favorites had closed and it was a pain in the throat for me to see it being changed to a boutique shop- while the 「食」 ""Food"" has very important meaning in Chinese culture, I want to emphasize that, the people with whom I once ate the food are the most important to me; everytime I eat the food I remember the people I miss, for example, my late aunt....her food once connected me and her....something like in Kimi no Na wa. how Yotsuha\'s grandmother said ""I make the rice balls, and you eat them, so you and I are connected.""- the 「三鲜米粉」 ""San Xian Rice Noodles"" in this anime film is not my type of noodles; my favorite noodles is 「越南牛肉河粉」 ""Vietnamese Beef Rice Noodles""- 「米粉」 was originated in Hunan, this is partially the reason why I gave it a 50%+20%=70% ""faithfulness"" of Chinese settings• 「米粉」 and 「河粉」 are both called ""Rice Noodles"", yet 「米粉」 is much thinner while 「河粉」 is thicker and flatterThe 2nd story, ""A Little Fashion Show"" in Guangzhou- it gives me the most shiver, because in my work place there are a lot of age discriminations and work pressures which lead some people to their personal dilemmas- while the 「衣」 ""Clothes"" has very important meaning in Chinese culture, I want to emphasize that, there is a Chinese saying 「上流社会有下流人，先敬罗衣后敬人」 ""High people have low quality, people respect your Clothes first then your own self next"", it is not uncommon, mostly in old times, to see some poor people do their best to earn a good looking Clothes to pretend they are rich people in order to get some respect from the others- the cruelty in the business world was idealized by making the Fashion Show Manager a super nice guy in this anime film- the Guangzhou city view in this anime film was not bad, yet the story could actually take place in any cities, this is partially the reason why I gave it a 50%+10%=60% ""faithfulness"" of Chinese settings- the sisters kind of remind me of the Mitsuha and Yotsuha in Kimi no Na wa., when the younger sister seemed to be more mature than the older sister• I didn\'t need to use Japanese translation again when I read the Chinese words on the mobile phones, what a reliefThe 3rd story, ""Shanghai Love"" in Shanghai- it gives me the most Shinkai feel, because of its similar intro, scene views, flashback, camera angles, characters, props (audio cassette tape & Chinese biscuits metal container), plot, climax, ending....all these elements made this last story the best one- while the 「住行」 ""Living & Travel"" have very important meaning in Chinese culture, I want to emphasize that, living out of hometown due to school or work, is a big thing for folks to consider in China.  Traveling back to hometown on national holidays like the Chinese New Year is the most important ""event"", folks can fight for travel tickets for real, it is like a big time immigration move.

I think it is targeted at a certain demographic starting at late 20s to early 30s, when one begins to realize the extent of this loss. It is an emotional experience for those of us who can relate to it, but to those who not it may be boring, since all three stories are built on a feeling more than a plot: In that aspect, it reminds me of Jiro Taniguchi's works. Let's say as well that I...don't agree with other reviewers in the point that it is a product for an Asian audience specifically: I am Spanish and I can fully relate to the themes presented.When giving a score to it, the problem is that I'd give a different score to the three shorts: 7 to the first one, 6 to the second and 8 to the third; therefore, by average I give it a 7 (plus an extra point because overall I enjoyed it quite a lot and felt touched). I feel though that the themes could have been better executed, specially in the first and second stories.Keep in mind that this is not something you watch for the story, but for the shared feeling of nostalgia between the film and your own experience. If you haven't felt that experience of seeing the things that mean your younger days disappear, you'll probably find this boring. don't agree with other reviewers in the point that it is a product for an Asian audience specifically: I am Spanish and I can fully relate to the themes presented.When giving a score to it, the problem is that I'd give a different score to the three shorts: 7 to the first one, 6 to the second and 8 to the third; therefore, by average I give it a 7 (plus an extra point because overall I enjoyed it quite a lot and felt touched).

The keyword is ‘just’.Flavors of Youth is an anthology movie that consists of three segments. Each individual segment is about people reminisces their past in a way in their current situation. I watched the international version on Netflix, so if I miss anything that existed on the original version, let me know.The first segment goes like this: Hi, I love noodles. Noodles was my food everyday when I was little. The noodles in city is stale and pricey, but the ones at...my town are pretty good. My grandma loved noodles. Everybody should love noodles. The girl I had a crush on, had long noodle hair. Noodles are life. And if you reject noodles, life rejects your happiness.Well, they got the flavors part right and it makes you hungry for noodles, even when I ate a pizza. Thank you noodle guy!The second segment is about models. We see a women dealing with it as her age is kicking in and as how she tries to spend time with her younger sister. We see how she is seems to be replaced by someone younger, releasing how she is replaceable. This is also about her younger sister, who wants to make cloths and cake. Okay, we got some flavour here..And the third segment is about a man who discovers his old mixtape of conversation with his then best friend, who was a girl, but not really a girlfriend. We see how time passes between as they goes to school and trade their mixtape with each other as they go on their lives. This however changes as they are applying for the entry exam and the conversation becomes less and less. Why they don’t simply talk normally with each other? Because her father said fuck you. None of this has anything with flavour, except for the cookies in the opening.I want to mention that this movie was a Chinese - Japanese project, which explains why most the locations are based on Chinese cities and culture. Showing these landscapes and having these establishing shot as we see time lapses is probably the best part of this movie. These time lapses makes you feel some kind of nostalgia for these places somehow.Now my concerned about this movie except for how the character aren’t as detailed as the background, is regarding its subject. Only 1 of the 3 stories as anything relevant to flavours. Sure you can argue that flavours can be more than just food, but do mind that when we think of flavour, we think of stuff eatable!Not about some kids recording their thoughts on a cassette tape! Okay? Nor how a woman turns into a granny! F.O.O.D! FOOD! I know the original title is Season to Season, yet this isn’t an excuse!Alright, beside the title being kind of misleading, the plot of these doesn’t make me, that invested. With exception of the first one of course. I was more invested on the background than on the foreground. This goes both for animation and the story itself. The landscapes and the details of the noodles was amazing, yet the character animation was lacking times to times. The personalities and character interaction wasn’t interesting enough for me to not look at the background. The stories are too average for me.Sorry, I’m just seeing the same problem on what most of these pretty background pictures has. Not a interesting story to back it up. Take it from me, stories ages less than art. What could look great back then might not look great now.Now spoiler for the third and final segment. So if anyone who is interested, listen now.So the manboy studies for the exam so that he could be in the same school as womgirl. He receives the mixtape but he doesn't have time to listen to it and his mother puts it away. Later turns out that only manboy passed to go to that school and womgirl didn’t. He moves away and completely forget that the mixtape even exists, even if he did the mixtape thing regularly. So year passed and she asks him if he heard the mixtape. He says no and she turns away. And now back to present, he finally listens to the mixtape and in it, she confesses that she didn’t want to pass the test because she wanted to stay with him. Wow! Way to go to handicape yourself with a goddamn cassette.With that said, here is my summary. This movie is nice to have when eating food, but not that great. Nice background but that’s about it. Watch the first part for sudden craving of noodles.Pease out Noodle man. my town are pretty good. My grandma loved noodles. Everybody should love noodles.

The script is the main issue I had with this movie, whenever this show tries to sound deep it comes off as someone reading a smart poem rather than an actual deep show, it feels artificial and fails to have the intended impact, this also helps make most of these characters pretty forgettable. These still are fine shorts that come together as a fine movie that I would recommend for 1 watch, but there...just isn't enough here to warrant a rewatch. just isn't enough here to warrant a rewatch."", 'All in all this film was beautiful, like all Comixwave films. I feel like this would have been better if this was a short series rather than trying to be hastily connected with an after the credits scene. They could have possibly even made more stories than the three presented.The title (in English) made me think that the stories were going to be connected by food or related to it, but that only factored into the first one. To me, the Japanese title (Shikioriori) which can be translated as season by season or four seasons made more sense and I wonder why they changed...the title for the US release. the title for the US release.', ""I've read reviews of this movie written by Chinese people who said this spoke to them very deeply. I respect it, because this is coming from a very specific place, but I don't relate to it for the same reason. I just don't share the context. Artistically, this is another hyper-detailed anime that mistakes fidelity for quality. It's completely at odds with my aesthetic preferences.The first of the three shorts exist solely so they could get funding to make animated food gifs. But I found the short so unappealing that I'll probably never look at those gifs (which recycle regularly) the same again. The second...was fine, but not challenging at all. It seemed like they threw it together naratively, because there was no point to the pink-haired girl whatsoever by the end, even though she was nominally an antagonist. The shot of the main girl fainting on the runway was really good, though.I liked the third short the best, but it was also somewhat simple.

I did not really know what to expect. What could the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese animation industries bring? Is this China just trying to copy and be like someone else? Well, after watching this, I realize that this was not the case, Shikioriori was something different, very different that caught my eye.Shikioriori is a anthology film made up of three stories that take place in three cities in China. Each story is a flashback about something the character of that story yearns for. Something that they missed...in the present that they had in the past. Each story tells it differently through the art and the storyline but they all build off this idea of yearning for the past that they missed.STORY: 7/10I will review the story overall first and then go down to each one of the three.Overall, story writing was mixed. Out of all the three stories, each one had their own strengths and weakness and some overpowered more than the others and the transitions between the stories could be more smoother. I wished that they found a way to connect the three stories instead of ending it and then showing a black screen with a short version of credits. It would have made the storyline more unique and given it deeper meaning. There was an airport scene in the beginning and end of the movie with all the characters in it which sorta hinted at a connection between all three but it was done poorly and could have been expanded.Sunny Breakfast-7/10Out of all the three, this would be my 2nd favorite story in the film. It was in this story where the art truly served its purpose. The food and the depiction of Xiaomin thoughts gave the story a human touch (though there is another one that will also do it too). I felt however that the art came to be a bit too dominating in this story and more emphasis on the storyline would have made this story better and more impactful.A Little Fashion Show-6/10Ok, this story was not as good as Sunny Breakfast or the third one. I felt that this story clearly was not developed and it kinda hit on a point that was a bit too obvious. There were parts of this story where character attitudes and thoughts took a 360 out of nowhere and that made me go WAIT WHAT? Characters were seemingly brought in with little to no context and relationships were not really explained. I did not feel so attach to this story as to the other two and if the movie had to remove one story....it would be this one.Shanghai Love- 8/10This story was by far my favorite. Out of all the three, I thought this was the most developed plot and the characters were strong and truly made this story shine. I wished this movie was only this story as it would have been even better had it been expanded. The art and the music paired with the story and truly brought out the emotions and thoughts of the characters. The theme of family and shelter along with a love story gave it a rich and vibrant plot that keep me watching till the very end. I thought the ending of this story could have been a bit more smoothed out as it seemed kinda inconclusive at the end.ART- 9/10This film did a great job at the art. Clearly the Shinkai style art was replicated in this film. The ultra-realistic appearance and the bright colors made this film pleasant to watch and could serve as amazing wallpapers on phones and computers. The depiction of China in the 1980s as well as today was even more stunning and if it wasn't for the art, this film would have surely been something else.SOUND- 8/10Music was beautiful. I enjoyed the soundtrack throughout the film. The ending theme song was the best out of all of them and paired very well with the ending of Shanghai Love. The use of sound, in my opinion, did not really shine in Sunny Breakfast and A Little Fashion (may it did I do...I did not pay attention) which made the soundtrack seem more dominating towards the end.OVERALL- 7/10Shikioriori is a good start for Chinese-Japanese co-production in the anime industry. Although there are flaws in the story line and areas of improvement. It is not Shinkai as there can only be one, but it has its own touch and that touch is what the Chinese anime needs. I enjoyed this film and would recommend anyone to watch it. I think this movie would be better for older audiences as it would allow them to walk back on their own experiences and past. This film is not a masterpiece, but it is worth an hour and fifteen minutes of one's time. Walk in with a open mind and don't be quick to make judgement and you will see something interesting about Shikioriori.(This is my first review...hopefully you found this helpful)-J in the present that they had in the past. Each story tells it differently through the art and the storyline but they all build off this idea of yearning for the past that they missed.STORY: 7/10I will review the story overall first and then go down to each one of the three.Overall, story writing was mixed.

I wished that they found a way to connect the three stories instead of ending it and then showing a black screen with a short version of credits. It would have made the storyline more unique and given it deeper meaning. There was an airport scene in the beginning and end of the movie with all the characters in it which sorta hinted at a connection between all three but it was done poorly and could have been expanded.Sunny Breakfast-7/10Out of all the three, this would be my 2nd favorite story in the film. It was in this story where the art truly served its purpose. The food and the depiction of Xiaomin thoughts gave the story a human touch (though there is another one that will also do it too). I felt however that the art came to be a bit too dominating in this story and more emphasis on the storyline would have made this story better and more impactful.A Little Fashion Show-6/10Ok, this story was not as good as Sunny Breakfast or the third one. I felt that this story clearly was not developed and it kinda hit on a point that was a bit too obvious. There were parts of this story where character attitudes and thoughts took a 360 out of nowhere and that made me go WAIT WHAT? Characters were seemingly brought in with little to no context and relationships were not really explained. I did not feel so attach to this story as to the other two and if the movie had to remove one story....it would be this one.Shanghai Love- 8/10This story was by far my favorite. Out of all the three, I thought this was the most developed plot and the characters were strong and truly made this story shine. I wished this movie was only this story as it would have been even better had it been expanded. The art and the music paired with the story and truly brought out the emotions and thoughts of the characters. The theme of family and shelter along with a love story gave it a rich and vibrant plot that keep me watching till the very end. I thought the ending of this story could have been a bit more smoothed out as it seemed kinda inconclusive at the end.ART- 9/10This film did a great job at the art. Clearly the Shinkai style art was replicated in this film. The ultra-realistic appearance and the bright colors made this film pleasant to watch and could serve as amazing wallpapers on phones and computers. The depiction of China in the 1980s as well as today was even more stunning and if it wasn't for the art, this film would have surely been something else.SOUND- 8/10Music was beautiful. I enjoyed the soundtrack throughout the film. The ending theme song was the best out of all of them and paired very well with the ending of Shanghai Love. The use of sound, in my opinion, did not really shine in Sunny Breakfast and A Little Fashion (may it did I do...I did not pay attention) which made the soundtrack seem more dominating towards the end.OVERALL- 7/10Shikioriori is a good start for Chinese-Japanese co-production in the anime industry. Although there are flaws in the story line and areas of improvement. It is not Shinkai as there can only be one, but it has its own touch and that touch is what the Chinese anime needs. I enjoyed this film and would recommend anyone to watch it. I think this movie would be better for older audiences as it would allow them to walk back on their own experiences and past. This film is not a masterpiece, but it is worth an hour and fifteen minutes of one's time. Walk in with a open mind and don't be quick to make judgement and you will see something interesting about Shikioriori.(This is my first review...hopefully you found this helpful)-J"", 'With the cover of this anime boasting ""from the creators of \'Your Name\'"", I had some high hopes, but unfortunately, I didn\'t get nearly as much out of if as I think was intended.This ""anime"" is three short stories, about three different people, focusing on three different things that they are dealing with. These people have nothing to do with each other except for a point where they all board the same plane, but otherwise they literally have nothing to do with each other, and by the end, the random plane boarding feels forced just to make the connection between them apparent.Story one is...""Man talks to audience about how noodles impacted his life"", in which, a man monologues about how he ate noodles in the mornings most days of his life.Story two is ""Women in modeling starts to doubt herself because she didn\'t get a job"", in which a woman with a modeling job shows up late to a job she was scheduled for, and doesn\'t get the position, then throws herself into a series of self destructive behaviors to try to regain what she lost.Story three is ""Dude runs across city to listen to a tape recording"", in which this dude flashes back to when he was a kid and worked really hard to get into a good high school to be with the girl he liked, only to have the whole plan backfire and him being alone because he was so focused on school he didn\'t listen to a tape recording, and didn\'t tell the girl he liked that he was applying to surprise her. It\'s the best one because it actually has some plot.The art is obviously pretty good, except for some parts where there were some pretty jarring switches between hand drawn animation and CG.for characters, the third story is the only one that really does anything. the first one is literally a guy monologuing about noodles. The second one has people thinking it has character, just to have people make a 180 for the sake of the ""plot"". Though my favorite is squint eye blond guy in story two that you know is a jerk before he even talks and he lives up to your expectations.If you watch this, be honest with yourself and just watch the second two, the first one isn\'t worth your time.Overall, this anime tastes really machine made, 6/10.Don\'t watch first story while hungry ""Man talks to audience about how noodles impacted his life"", in which, a man monologues about how he ate noodles in the mornings most days of his life.Story two is ""Women in modeling starts to doubt herself because she didn\'t get a job"", in which a woman with a modeling job shows up late to a job she was scheduled for, and doesn\'t get the position, then throws herself into a series of self destructive behaviors to try to regain what she lost.Story three is ""Dude runs across city to listen to a tape recording"", in which this dude flashes back to when he was a kid and worked really hard to get into a good high school to be with the girl he liked, only to have the whole plan backfire and him being alone because he was so focused on school he didn\'t listen to a tape recording, and didn\'t tell the girl he liked that he was applying to surprise her.

The story is as the MAL description says. It has three parts that do not really have much to do with each other. Each story is sweet and features about 80% voice over to tell it. Your enjoyment of the three may vary. I personally feel that the middle story is the weakest and kind of played out. However, the characters are solid. The first is my favorite for the visuals and the voice acting (which we'll get into later) but lacks any...kind of story. The third is the only one with a real story line. However, the characters are bland and the voice acting is terrible. No one part has everything.The art is absolutely spectacular. While the character design is lacking, the background and and settings are very deep and dazzling. There was a shot of a puddle in the opening minutes that made me mark out hard. The art is pretty consistent throughout the three stories, but the first is where the most animation time went into.The sound and music are not very noticeable. Aside from a few good tape recording and cooking effects there is not much to talk about. The dubbing is a bit rough. It is a little noticeable in the second story with not awkwardly read, but awkwardly translated lines. Then, in the third story we get to listen to captain no charisma do the main character.The characters are where this movie takes a hit. Outside of the second story there are not any noteworthy characters. Some kids, some grandparents etc.Overall, it is a very easy and fast watch. The movie likes to try to trigger nostalgia and in some cases may do so effectively. I would recommend watching it with the dub if only to be able to focus on the beautiful artwork as it is one of the few saving graces of the work. kind of story.

All three explore different aspects of nostalgia and the difficulty of moving forward in life while reconciling oneself with missed opportunities of the past. As it is a classic example of slice of life, it should be appraised more for the way it evokes the feelings revolving around the theme and artistic decisions designed to evoke it rather than the plain mechanics of detailed characterizations with invigorating plot. Overall, it is moderately successful in its redolent aims, with the success very unevenly...distributed among the short films.Before saying much about the individual vignettes, inevitably since it is released by CoMix, the art style is so similar, and the third vignette is an homage to a 5 Centimeters, it surely will invite comparisons to Makoto Shinkai. This is really a bit of a strenuous comparison and Shikioriori really should be judged independent of any connection to Shinkai. Though the art style is similar, the directing style is totally different. It features less focus on background transitions and far more first-person and panoramic shots taken that are more reminiscent of Keischi Hara’s work (Colorful, Sarusuberi) than Shinkai. Overall, the artistic quality  in terms of both camera angles, scene direction, and photorealistic animation are top-notch, as can be expected from anything produced by CoMix.The same cannot be said, however, of the writing, a fact that becomes very apparent in the first short called Hidamari no Choushoku. It tells the story of a man in the city who is struggling with loneliness and is reminiscing back to his childhood when he would eat rice noodles with his grandmother every morning in a smaller town. It is supposed to evoke and explore the loss of meaning in life and nostalgia that comes with rapid urbanization and modernization which has occurred in China in recent decades. The premise is simple and compelling enough, and the animation sequences of the noodles is mouth-watering, but it is marred by being almost entirely told through voice-over narration.The whole point of a slice-of-life film is to evoke feelings by showing you the circumstances that lead to them very subtly, not spoon-feed the feelings by dictating to you how you should feel. Not only does it get mundane to basically spend fifteen minutes listening to a lecture about a story rather than actually telling it, it just kills any sense of immersion and subtlety that is the entire point of a vignette like this. The whole film would’ve been better off if this short were entirely left out, a shame since the metaphor of the flavor of the noodles is what gives the whole film its title. It might have been fine as a short story for a creative writing class, but not a screenplay for an anime.The second short is a marked improvement on the first, although also the most out of place of the three. Chiisana Fashion Show is about a model who is beginning to age out of the peak of her career and her difficulties with balancing her struggling career with her relationship with her younger sister. Probably the most accessible and plot driven of the three, it is decently well-done. However, its thematic connection to the other two shorts is a bit tenuous: it does have to do with the feeling of loss of one’s past and confusion about the one’s future in the form of the memories of their childhood relationship, it just feels slightly out of place compared to the other two. Further, the plot itself is extremely predictable and slightly cliched. It’s perfectly fine short that is well-executed, but mostly predictable and forgettable.The third and final vignette is by far the strongest of the three. Shanghai Koi is ostensibly an homage to Shinkai’s 5 Centimeters, but it is different enough to stand up on its own merits. It depicts a twenty-something in 2008 who is moving out of his parents’ house on a whim when he comes across an old cassette tape given to him by his first love. Most of the short is then a flashback to 1999 and the events that led to the making of a tape. At the end of their middle school, he found out his love interest was trying to get into a prestigious high school, he decides to start working hard academically to be accepted so he can be with her. All the while they exchange recordings of themselves on a cassette tape, and he was so busy studying he never listened to her final message. She winds up not getting accepted but he does, and they are separated left only with regrets about what could’ve been. It essentially explores the same subject matter and emotion of nostalgia of typical Shinkai fare, but gives a far more hopeful look at how to cope with it than he typically does. More time is taken to pay attention to emotional subtlety and detail than either of the two shorts, it is highly atmospheric, and very well written. It’s slightly soured by over the top music at key moments, but overall is a really stellar short.At the end of the day, Shikioriori is worth a view just to see the stunning visuals and the great exploration of nostalgia for love that is Shanghai Koi. I cannot say it is particularly great film overall since the vignettes aren’t as cohesive as they could be and the quality between the three is inconsistent. The first is a frustrating, poorly executed missed opportunity, the second is decent but forgettable, but the third certainly makes up for the other two.Story 6/10Art 10/10Sound 6/10Character 6/10Enjoyment 7/10Total 6/10 distributed among the short films.Before saying much about the individual vignettes, inevitably since it is released by CoMix, the art style is so similar, and the third vignette is an homage to a 5 Centimeters, it surely will invite comparisons to Makoto Shinkai.

Throughout his story we see him as he grows being happy than melancholy over aspects of his life that he found great fading away or disappearing from his life util there was nothing but grey skies and dreary china left for him, until the end of the story course.Story 1: I thought this story wasn\'t bad but i feel focused too much on its food aspects (yes i grasp the show is called FLAVORS of Youth but that made no difference for the other 2 stories so i feel it wasn\'t necessary), however i wouldn\'t say it didn\'t have a purpose and came full circle at the end when he eat noodles after his beloved Grandmother passed away so i\'d say this story was a 5.5/10 by itself.Our next story follows a girl who grew up to tall but was thankful for her height because it along with her interest in wearing cute clothing helped her to become a fashion model while also taking in her sister a while after their parents died (dead parents in anime? Shocker...).Story 2: If you\'ve seen other concepts like this involving a relatively older fashion model in different media it’s not hard to see where most of the story is going from the very beginning so it’s weak point for me at least is its predictability. But i have to give credit to how the show flows and makes you care at least a bit about our main 3 characters (let\'s call them oblivious, inspiration, and nice guy) and their interactions with one another albeit Nice Guy being a bit to idealistic for what he actually is. The points this story tries to get across are clearly conveyed to the watcher; be aware of what you have and treasure it, nothing lasts forever, don\'t sacrifice your health for your career and of course girls are cutthroat and jealous as hell (that last one is real important). Overall this story i felt was more impactful, albeit predictable, than our first story so i give it a 6/10.Our last story is when we get real anime-like and get closer to what Netflix (via this shows preview) wants you to compare it too, Your Name. Our new lead (let\'s call him Idiot), is just moving into a new apparent with the help of his childhood friend that he doesn\'t act like a friend towards when in the process of unpacking he finds a tape (that has a series of messages on it that he and his childhood crush listened to and recorded when they were young) that he didn\'t know he had received a new message on or even had in his possession (despite being reminded 3 times) and now wants to hear it because everything has done up until this point was to make it so her, his childhood friend and him could live together of which he told her in one of the messages he recorded to her way back when (that was a mouth full).Story 3: This story made me cringe a bit from how Idiot was acting. One moment he’s carrying his crush home and spouting cheesy lines like ""if it will make you smile i\'ll do it"", the next he\'s mad at her for choices she felt were beyond her control, than he doesn\'t tell her he’s trying for the same school as her to be with her and this ends up in a miscommunication after receiving the tape but not listening to it that had her fail her entrance exam so she could be with him and get beaten by her father for it.Oh but it doesn\'t stop there! Than when they meet again after being in different schools he almost completely ignores her and lies AGAIN about his reasons for going to the school on top of being told about the tape AGAIN to once again not know about it... At this point if i wasn\'t aware of his desperation to find the tape and only aware he accomplished his goals and became an architect while just reminiscing of what could have been i would have like the character more but sense i\'m aware of the situation ahead of time he just seems like an idiot to me and his life goal came at the cost of the people he wanted it to involve. When he builds the place he wants all of them to live in (a motel apparently?), WHAT DO YOU KNOW she comes walking in out of frame and he smiles ending the last of the 3 stories.Yeah... I wasn\'t a fan of this one. They story could have been better, the characters i didn\'t care about the characters (Idiot also admits he was acting childish which i think is an understatement), and the real lesson is if you love somebody DON\'T IGNORE THEM! This one gets a 4/10 for me cause it annoyed me.That adds up to a grand total of 5.5/10 for overall story which i\'ll put as a 6 sense the first 2 weren\'t as bad and MAL doesn\'t do .5 ratings...The Art: In current year there\'s a LOT of bland art in the series that come out but sense this is considered a movie i intend to judge it by movie standards. As a movie this animation isn\'t the best i\'ve seen and sense the trailer wants to shove the fabled legend ""Your Name"" in YOUR face to let you know it was made by the same group i would have to say it was fine, just fine. 6/10.Sound: This one is relatively hard for me despite enjoying music quite a bit sense i don\'t usually hear the songs in these anime unless they really stand out like in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Lucky Star, Carol and Tuesday or Made in Abyss. I can\'t say i had an issue with what i was hearing but nothing stood out to me so take this with a grain of salt but 5/10.Characters: I\'m gonna be honest, none of these guys left a lasting impression on me (i hope you could tell when i couldn\'t be bothered to get their actual names to use in the review). I can\'t say as though i had an issue with them but we get maybe 30 minutes with each set and though we learn more than we really learn about characters like the two in Garden of Words IMO, we still don\'t have a lot to go on. If i had to give an MVP award to better group of characters i\'d say Story 2 wins sense i didn\'t care whatsoever about story 3s group and story 1 we focus on one guys being melancholy (he should have stuck with Haruhi for that). Overall they weren\'t remarkable but not terrible so 5.5/10 which will be 5.Despite my griping about certain parts of this show i did enjoy the experience of all 3 stories combine more than i expected i would so i\'ll give it a 6.5/10 or a 6 in MAL terms cause it wasn\'t THAT good.Considering i\'ve already said the rating it may be confusing as to why looking back on my other scorings but let me explain: This show despite my gripes once again did make me think about my life and my youth in some way and i had more connections with the second story than i was expecting to have sense i\'m sure as hell no model and not a girl. That experience is part of what reviewing a show is all about (despite being illogical), how one feels about a show after watching needs to take into consideration but NOT sway your thoughts of the show so much that your rating end up like the new Lions Kings audience ratings. So though i did give a bit higher of a rating than my scoring suggests, i did so with another factor involved that many people of today seems to think solely with but i will not, After-feeling: 6.5/10. is not looking to great in his eyes now that he\'s older and decides to attempt to reminisce about the good times of his youth while traveling back home to see his dying relative before she goes.

Overall they weren\'t remarkable but not terrible so 5.5/10 which will be 5.Despite my griping about certain parts of this show i did enjoy the experience of all 3 stories combine more than i expected i would so i\'ll give it a 6.5/10 or a 6 in MAL terms cause it wasn\'t THAT good.Considering i\'ve already said the rating it may be confusing as to why looking back on my other scorings but let me explain: This show despite my gripes once again did make me think about my life and my youth in some way and i had more connections with the second story than i was expecting to have sense i\'m sure as hell no model and not a girl. That experience is part of what reviewing a show is all about (despite being illogical), how one feels about a show after watching needs to take into consideration but NOT sway your thoughts of the show so much that your rating end up like the new Lions Kings audience ratings. So though i did give a bit higher of a rating than my scoring suggests, i did so with another factor involved that many people of today seems to think solely with but i will not, After-feeling: 6.5/10.', 'Here\'s what I\'ve observed from the reviews thus far. There seems to be a spectrum of enjoyment of the show, and the reason why is because of how ""unrelatable"" the plot is, especially to Westerners. There\'s nothing wrong with that, I just wished people would be more conscious about the fact that Asian stories go beyond generic, plain Asian stereotypes portrayed in Western shows and truly evaluate the show based on it\'s cultural relevance, and how the stories have been true to life.So, as a Chinese, here\'s what I thought about the film. There\'s 3 short stories, and I will review them separately, or...at least, the storyline. HEAVY SPOILERS, so if you haven\'t seen it, you\'ve been warned.""Sunny Breakfast""       Overall: 6/10Much of the plot revolves around the main character and his inner dwellings and reminiscence of his hometown, and of his feelings towards San Xian noodles.The way this story was told reminded me very much of those kinds of essays we used to write in school, those that would use descriptions and recounts that would lead to an ultimate reflection to some aspect of life, or of values.The noodles were the subject matter that connected the main character to a)his kind grandmother who raised him, b) his first crush he would see when he ate the noodles, c) the different incidents of the family who ran the noodleshop. Also, those shots of making noodles, pouring the soup and everything was just pure bliss. They were such a highlight. Anyway. The noodles hold sentimental value to him, and as he grew up, the taste slowly disappears, which symbolises the passing of time, the changing of tastes and letting go or even forgetting what used to be.I think the storytelling was beautifully written, and I do think the nature of English was unable to emulate the same weight of words as it would be in Japanese, or in Chinese. I do feel that the plot was predictable, but it was a good attempt at the iconic Shinkai-esque storytelling.""A Small Fashion Show""       4/10I really wanted to like this show. I really did. But, something about the main character, or the storyline, just didn\'t impact me the way it intended to.Yes, it\'s a pretty realistic story about two sisters relying on each other for survival, and unspoken feelings and conflicts because one of them has been so caught up on life that she failed to notice her sister\'s growth. There is some sort of closure to the story that gives a nice, pleasant feelings. But it was... weak.By the time it reached the halftime mark I felt beyond bored. Besides the rare shots and closeups with spectacular rendering and detail to animation, nothing impressed me. Even the model walks weren\'t as dynamic or detailed as I would have wanted it.Probably the weakest short amongst the three.""Shanghai Love""              8/10I came from Shanghai. And my grandparents and my dad still live there, so I do go back every year. This personal experience may have played a part in pulling my heartstrings, but I do genuinely think this story was the strongest out of the three.For one, the story was true to life. The changing of times as Shanghai develops into a bigger, more bustling city--- that\'s what I see every time I go back. The old house in the film, my grandmother\'s family grew up in the house like that. Narrow alleyways, really dangerously steep staircases, like four floors of small rooms on each one, and the furnishing of the rooms were exactly like my grandmother\'s, it made me really nostalgic.Okay, sorry, I\'m getting side-tracked. But, the characters were really endearing to me. Growing friendships, communicating through cassettes, working hard for one another--- those actions really evoked sympathy in me. I felt happy for them, I felt sad for them, and my heart ached when they fell apart. Sweet, simple. Which is more than enough in films sometimes. No need for dramatic actions, for exaggerated witty words. This was reality for many Shanghainese millenials, and that alone spoke volumes.Next, I really liked the fact that it tried to intermingle past and present. Going back to the old, worn house for the old, outdated cassette player; the contrast with the modern skyscrapers that dominate Shanghai today--- these are subtle touches that make the story that much better. The settings were beautifully done, they definitely did their research, and I really appreciate that.As for culture, a good portion of the plot revolved around how the main characters were trying to study to get into this elite school. A lot of panels about studying, no fun, and about being a hermit at home. That\'s also very true to life. The study culture is such a deeply entrenched concept in China that it can totally consume our entire childhood. Those violent methods would also be reality to many, and shouting to wake up neighbours isn\'t uncommon.Probably the closest to 5cm per second, and I appreciated the film a lot. Made me miss Shanghai.-The after credits scene was a little forced and extra but okay I\'ll tolerate it. Gives closure I guess.Also that ending song is a BOP it was such a refreshing piece to compensate for the extremely uninteresting OST of the entire film. at least, the storyline.

It resonated with me deeply in the way that people say Your Name did for them. It primarily focuses on the feelings and experiences we have during youth and the effects and consequences that we might have from them many years in the future.Story:Each story of the film focuses on a different main character, and their love and want for something. The first film isn’t the best story-wise but is beautifully told through its art. The second film is very character-based and is able to tell a coherent story but...is the least unique and touching overall. The third story was a masterpiece and put me in tears but quickly smiles at the end. I’ve never resonated with a story so well, and every part of that last part is amazing.Art:The backgrounds are truly stunning; almost every one is a work of art. Most of the character animations are very good, but some parts don’t seem to care too much about the character’s faces. The food, though. Mmm.Sound:The sound in this film is perfect. All of the sound effects are incredible and perfect for their scenes, and the music fits every scene perfectly.Character:The characters in these films are fleshed out enough so that we can understand them and their story. For such short stories, the amount of character building for every character is stunning, but the first story lacks severely in the character department.Overall, I loved this film. I know that many may find this film not as interesting as I do or enjoy it as much, but I implore you to watch this anthology. You won’t be wasting your time on this gem of a movie.P.S.

This movie have 3 part, 1. The Rice Noodle, 2. A Little Fashion Show and 3. Love in Shanghai. Personally for me, the story is not something special, maybe you have see it somewhere that have similar plot. But the ending and message that they have put in this movie is strong enough. I specially like the ending, but maybe a lot of people skipped this because that ending played after credits.But if you think you can skipped the story and go for the ending you won\'t...get the same experienced. Because you don\'t watch the struggle of 3 story before. Although the story is not connected with each other they have the same message that connected in the end. So just watch it and don\'t skipped it.If you say only Asian can relate to the movie just because it portrayed ""the rigorous life of China"" maybe you only see the story in the surface. Clearly we have different culture, but it doesn\'t mean we won\'t feel the same feeling. Our life maybe different but we still enjoy the same flavor of regret, egoism, love, reckless and other. The same flavor of youth.In conclusion the movie is good enough to watch. Maybe you will it boring because you already see it in other series, but it is the easiest way to deliver the message of being youth. The ending is the best part of this movie, it ties all the story nicely and conclude the final message. So check this movie if you want to feel your youth again. get the same experienced.

The story uses flashbacks sooooooo well, as it is about reminiscing about each character's past. The animation is incredibly stunning by itself. If you took away everything else and just watched the characters move... it is still so amazing. The music does absolute wonders for this show with its extremely emotional piano chords. The violin accompaniment to the piano made me swoon. I especially loved the animation of moving noodles and steam. Cooking is very cool in most animes... but this anime shines in that department. But...finally, the most important and impactful thing I can say about this show... is it made me more emotional than A Silent Voice. I know that may sound criminal to say... but it is honestly how I felt. Please give this a watch. You won't regret it. finally, the most important and impactful thing I can say about this show... is it made me more emotional than A Silent Voice.

They are three icons mounted together on hinges at the sides, that open in the middle. The holy images included in a triptychon are typically part of the same spiritual theme, or contribute to a larger whole: for example, a Christ Enthroned icon seated between the Mother of God and Saint John the Forerunner; or icons sequentially narrating the progression of the Crucifixion or the Resurrection. However, all the figures and all the moments are present simultaneously to the prayer before the icon. Past...and futurity are eliminated. Time collapses within a diptychon or a triptychon just as sæcular time collapses within the liturgy. Moments in a diptychon, a triptychon or any other kind of sequential icon are not meant to be taken as repeated or consumed, but rather reiterated and renewed through liturgical participation or prayer.The Chinese-Japanese animated film Flavours of Youth (《肆式青春》) came out last month, and got put on Netflix. A collaborative effort between directors Yi Xiaoxing 易小星, Takeuchi Yoshitaka 竹內良貴 and Li Haoling 李豪凌 and produced by CoMix Wave Films, Flavours of Youth consists of three animated shorts (one from each director) that fit together a bit like a triptych. Even though Chinese animation, like Chinese film generally, is traditionally structured in an operatic format, here really only one of the shorts comes anywhere close to having that operatic feel. But all three have very similar themes – like trying to grasp at fragments of meaning and reality in a hyper-real modernisation where time speeds up and leaves all merely-human things in the dust. Reassembling the human element is done here through a kind of iconography. Moments are reiterated. Time is collapsed. Sense begins to filter through only when futurity and past are liminally overridden. In the beginning of the first short, all of the main characters are sitting together in a Beijing airport waiting on a flight to Guangzhou.The first two shorts are visually impressive, if a bit impressionistic, and tend to be more character-based vignettes than actual stories. But the third short is where the collection as a whole really started to shine. Somehow the iconographic conceit of the entire collection was seized upon with gusto by Li Haoling, and he put together the tear-jerker ‘Shanghai Love’ or ‘Sun After a Light Shower’ (纖雨初晴) that collapses time as it narrates, with operatic flourish, the disjointed life of real-estate developer Li Mo 李墨 and his first crush Xia Xiaoyu 夏小雨, after he discovers an old cassette tape from when he and Xiaoyu were in middle school together that he didn’t remember ever playing.The sequences run together, memory and present blur seamlessly. Mo borrows the tape player from his grandmother and learns that Xiaoyu deliberately failed her exam just to be together in the same school with him, in spite of her father. It is a poignant religious moment in a Kierkegaardian or Dostoevskian sense for Mo: a moment of repentance that spans the entirety of their relationship. The screen forms a diptychon as the teenage Xiaoyu talks into the tape recorder to a weeping adult Mo about her love for him, about the hopes and dreams she had for their life together.There is something deeply Grantian about this collection, in that it voices certain ‘intimations of deprival’. It’s not a Jia Zhangke film by any stretch of the imagination, but the intimations are there. The hyper-real modern forces, forces of capital – symbolised by the Beijing noodle shop (or really Beijing tout court, which functions like Saint Petersburg in a Dostoevsky novel), by the Guangzhou modelling agencies that refuse Yilin on account of her age, by the real-estate firms that tear down old Shanghai neighbourhoods, even by small and ordinary things like the CD Walkman that prevents Li Mo from listening to Xiaoyu or the cellphone that Yilin ignores – are continually pressing in, and they appear to be winning in time. But there are these glimmers of hope – small moments of human connexion that rebel against the tyranny of time and the ontology of age and death.It’s slightly unfortunate – I say slightly here because I am indeed a fan of the animation style – that the directors and the producers chose to use a hyper-modern Japanese artistic vernacular to illustrate three very modern Chinese stories. It is far too much to ask that there be a return to Havoc in Heaven-style visual conventions, which probably wouldn’t fit these stories anyway, and of course as a joint venture there is a marketing angle to consider. Netflix branded the collection as ‘From the Creators of Your Name’ – a Japanese animated film I will now have to check out. But the exquisiteness of the local details – in some places rivalling films like Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away or From Up on Poppy Hill – seem to mark a point on the revitalisation of conventional animation currently in progress on the Chinese mainland.

Flavours of Youth is definitely worth your time to go see.', 'This movie is oddly enough, one serious contender in terms of anime, especially when it\'s a joint Sino-Japanese animation, at that.It was really enjoyable to watch, and it\'s like one of the eye-candies you see in watching Kimi no Na Wa and Koe no Katachi. I even remembered they compared this movie to the former, to which I say that it\'s sufficiently far from it, enough for this movie to be unique.With that out of the way, I have to mention one glaring flaw, and it\'s about the characters- their arcs aren\'t that satisfying when concluded (that doesn\'t mean it\'s bad), because it falls short...of time needed to give them character development, which is specifically recognizable for me at the last . That being said, it\'s not a deal breaker, and they caught my attention, though I recognize that might not apply to everybody and think it\'s boring.TL;DR: If you want to have a ""mild rollercoaster"", watch this movie. of time needed to give them character development, which is specifically recognizable for me at the last . That being said, it\'s not a deal breaker, and they caught my attention, though I recognize that might not apply to everybody and think it\'s boring.TL;DR: If you want to have a ""mild rollercoaster"", watch this movie.', 'WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS BUT I DO WARN YOU BEFORE SAYING THEM:I watched the international version on netflix as 1 hour long movie and not as 3 separate episodes and...I had no idea what to expect but show definitely shook my expectations but in a really good way. The first story was interesting and not gonna lie I was a bit worried that I had just signed myself up to watch an hour long movie about noodles, but even though I couldn’t relate so much to the family traditions and the protagonists memory of noodles I still felt somewhat entertained and I felt for...him when *SPOILER* his grandma died. I felt so bad and I found it interesting how they decided to end the “episode” there.Fade to black screen, beginning of story 2 (this movie/show had soooo many black screens oh my gooodness)This story hit a little closer the home, although i have never experienced having a parent pass away and I do not have any younger siblings I really connected with Yi Lin’s feeling as if all she has to offer is her body. Modelling can be such a toxic industry and seeing her struggle to grapple with her ageing honestly mad me very sad. I love LuLu and her personality, timid characters always make me feel happy and having steve really made me happy as unconventional family’s really are a thing and they can be just as strong as ‘normal’ family dynamics. I loved the ending and this was one of my favourite stories out of the three.Another black screen (this is like out 5th one lol) and here we begin our 3rd and finally story.I liked but it made me start to wonder. Are people this connected to past loves in real life as they are in animes. Is this asian culture? I know that as a South Africa who has never had any long term friends from under the age of 14 or any family friends of the opposite gender who I’ve know forever I might not understand so much. Just I have had experience with past crushes where we had stopped talking and I just forget them from my life. Yes a thought of them may pop up from time to time but I meet other people along the way and in the back of my mind I know they’ve moved on aswell. even with friends who I have stopped talking to. It’s almost as like their life just carries on from there. Xiao Yu moved to a whole new school and he never met anyone new? I know it’s anime and it can not always realistically relay real life but come on! this trope is becoming boring and maybe it’s because I don’t understand the sentiments of it but I feel the happy ending we were given at the end was wasted and I would of preferred if we could just see Xiao Yu’s life carry on as normal.Now enough about the plot let’s talk about the concept:A story about chinese culture written in a japanese anime :p I liked it and I found it very interesting. I liked learning about those noodles and seeing how life in a small town in china might be like. It was also interesting seeing Beijing being depicted as the City for these characters. I liked seeing how the modelling industry kind of looks like in beijing and the family dynamics of two orphaned girls. I also really liked how story 3 shows all the options for someone living in a small town and how even a decision made in middle school affects them and their social life and their family dynamic. It’s interesting seeing a child just walk back home in a small town and be so independent something I have never really seen or experienced. The whole show showing how youth affect these people growing up and how certain memories and things just stay with you forever was really cool.the art was nice, I didn’t really notice it until one scene in story 2 which was animated a bit too realistically for me lol and the sound also I didn’t notice it much besides the end outro song. The japanese voice acting was nice and the movie was overall enjoyable :) him when *SPOILER* his grandma died. I felt so bad and I found it interesting how they decided to end the “episode” there.Fade to black screen, beginning of story 2 (this movie/show had soooo many black screens oh my gooodness)This story hit a little closer the home, although i have never experienced having a parent pass away and I do not have any younger siblings I really connected with Yi Lin’s feeling as if all she has to offer is her body. Modelling can be such a toxic industry and seeing her struggle to grapple with her ageing honestly mad me very sad. I love LuLu and her personality, timid characters always make me feel happy and having steve really made me happy as unconventional family’s really are a thing and they can be just as strong as ‘normal’ family dynamics. I loved the ending and this was one of my favourite stories out of the three.Another black screen (this is like out 5th one lol) and here we begin our 3rd and finally story.I liked but it made me start to wonder. Are people this connected to past loves in real life as they are in animes. Is this asian culture? I know that as a South Africa who has never had any long term friends from under the age of 14 or any family friends of the opposite gender who I’ve know forever I might not understand so much. Just I have had experience with past crushes where we had stopped talking and I just forget them from my life.

Gosh I detest this production. But I have to give it a 3 / 10 because while the stories are terrible, the art is above average so it technically balances out.Another cookie-cutter tale of the intersection of personal backgrounds, bygone times, and change this is. Good thing CoMix only made, um, like six of these?Now, if we disregard the fact that this story literally rips off CoMix’s own stuff (which we should actually disregard since originality does not necessarily equate brilliance), the story is...quite bland. It feels like a slog because it's just boring. As for the specifics in the story and other stuff I won't go through them. They are covered by other reviews so just look through those ones I guess. But I just have to comment that some parts of the story are so crap that I closed my device right away and had to restrain myself from unleashing terror upon this world.The only good thing about this is that its many depictions of food, food, and more food are really good: they are detailed and drawn accurately (at least a step up from chow mein everyday), and really drive home the fact of how suited CoMix is to making travel ads.I encourage you to avoid this.

Watching the PV, the only reason I wanted to watch this movie was because the studio created Kimi no Nawa.I started to watch the film and I was bored. Very bored.The third story was entertaining enough that it didn\'t manage to distract me thinking, ""when is this movie going to be over?"" because, for the first 2 part of the film, it did.Hopefully, many people would agree that the third part of the film was the most entertaining and would wish that it took up the whole film\'s length.

And it\'s from the same studio as well (ComiX Wave). So, immediately, I was being really fussy about: how good this movie is. Is it like the same level as Your Name? Because, Your Name is personally one of my favorites movies I\'ve ever watched. And then I went to anime section on Netflix, and I found this movie, that said it\'s from the same directors of Your Name. Clearly, Shiki Oriori\'s story is not presented at the same way as Kimi...no Na Wa, but I need to say: the story caught me at the first look. This review won\'t be too long, but I\'m warning you previously: that this review contains a lot of major spoilers, so don\'t see it, if you still didn\'t watch the movie (and you definitely need to take a time to see the genius of this movie). So, let\'s go!Story: 9/10So, Shiki Oriori (Flavors of Youth) is a chinese trilogy, that reaches 3 different stories, on 3 different cities, but with 1 common thing: ""the pleasure of continue to live our lives, and follow with our dreams"". The  1st story talks about: Xiao Ming, an man that went to live on Beijing. In his childhood, he lived in a small city on China, with one of the most famous lamen restaurants on his country. So, in his childhood, he always went to this restaurant, to appreciate the delightful taste of the bifum spaghetti. And he remember that: in a lot of moments when he was an child, his grandmother made the perfect bifum spaghetti for him. And a lot of major things happened to him on this restaurant, like: the meet with his first love. But, after months, the restaurant and the family that founded decided to get out with all the things. And, to complete, when he reached the adolescence period, his grandmother (a person who he was always very grateful for prepare one of your favorite foods, and very cheerful to have by your side) suffered by a huge heart ache, and after a little days, it resulted on her death. Clearly with that, he ended up crying a lot, because in all his life, until the present moment, he didn\'t have the greatest relationships with his parents, and he was more next to his grandmother. But, years passed, and Xiao Ming reached the adult period, and he\'s still alive and remembering how heartwarming and important his grandmother was to him, going to an lamen restaurant in Beijing, to feel again his childhood and the nostalgic taste. And that\'s how the 1st story ends. His grandmother just died, but he\'s still remember, all the days, of her, and continue to live your single life, appreaciating in a lot of times, the taste of an lamen of which he always loved to eat.The 2nd story, for me, it\'s the best story on this movie. It\'s about two sisters: Yi Ling and Lulu; Yi Ling is the older sister, and she\'s an famous model, while Lulu is a clothes designer, that likes a lot to draw dresses molds. Both of two sisters grew up without her parents, because her mother just died by a disease years ago. And now, they\'re trying very hard to keep going with their lives in the right way. So, Yi Ling always try to do her best, eating an average and not exaggerated amount of foods, and always exercising herself to maintain a great body shape. But, one day, she felt that her career could be compromised. A girl called Shui came to her, saying she\'s her big fan, that loves her works, and etc. But Yi Ling discovered that Shui is one of the main competitors, and she can overtake her so easily. In fact, she\'s ""apparently"" a fan of Yi Ling, but she\'s one of the main rivals of her, so Shui is trying to intimidate her with all her conquests. And this made Yi Ling very worried about the fashion competion, so she\'s basically trying to practice your daily routine in a harder way. And Lulu, seeing that situation, was worried with her sister, saying to her: ""Yi Ling, you need to eat more, you need of more energy to go to the presentation shows, you need to care more about yourself and your health"" etc.... But, Yi Ling was more worried with her rival, than with her sister. And for that, she ended up developing a chronic disease, due to the lack of an great feeding, and it resulted on an fainting. But, fortunately, she got to recover of her disease, and the final day (the day of the definitive competition between her and Shui came), and after all, all of her relatives (her sister, all of her supporters, and her helper) just came to the presentation, to wish to her a good luck, and on that day, Lulu just gave to her a red dress that she designed specially to her sister. And that\'s how the 2nd story ends, with the win of Yi Ling on the presentation, and a closer sister relationship between her and Lulu.The 3rd story (and the final story) is about a group of 3 friends (two guys and a girl), that were always together. One of them Li Mo believes in an old story about: ""The love on Xangai"". So, all of the 3 friends reached the adolescence period, and now, this is the time that they\'ll need to decide what they\'ll do on their whole entire lives. In their childhood, it was an period that didn\'t exist the cellphones. So, they always were communicating with themselves through of cassette tapes: on the past, some people usually communicated with themselves, recording messages on cassette tapes, that could be played with cassette tape player. But, now, they reached the adolescence period: the period that they\'ll need to decide: in which university they\'ll study. And there\'s a complication between the friends: the parents of girl on the group (Xiao Yu) were definitely decided to take her to an university on another city, and Li Mo always loved her on all the time. So, due to that notice, he was scared to lose her, so he promised to himself that he\'ll study at the same university as her, but this would be a surprise. So, he would make the test, to be approved on the university, without Xiao Yu knowing that. But the lack of dialogue between them resulted on something tragic. Li Mo was always thinking on himself, and wanted because he wanted to go to that university, but his mother just called him to go back to his old house, to hear the last tape that Xiao Yu sent to him. The tape was basically the Xiao Yu declaration to him: that, no matter where they are, they\'ll always be friends, and Xiao Yu said to him (on the tape) that she\'ll always love him, no matter where he is. And after, he ended up crying, because he noticed that friendship can be a shiny and colorful thing, and something that need to be cultivated forever. And after that, he also noticed that Xiao Yu parents thought two times, and decided that Xiao Yu will make the college on Beijing. But, Li Mo passed on the university of another city. So, this resulted on the separation of the friends. But, the 3rd story ended up with the 3 friends finding themselves again on the airport, and now they decided to live together again, as friends forever.So, as you can see, all the stories talks about things that can easily happen on the real life, such as: the difficult acceptance of the death of loved ones, growth without parents, relationship between sisters, acceptance of their own body, betrayal, prejudice, abusive relationship of parents, humiliation caused by their own family members and a destiny that no one foresaw, because you know: life isn\'t always as we want. And all of those things are compiled in just one movie, and it worked perfectly (it was so smooth like a butter). So, the story is 9/10, you know: the story was very great, but: have you already the feeling that something is good, but it lacked somethings, that made the anime stay with some slightly problems? Yes, I felt that, but I can\'t say exactly: what were those slightly problems. But, in general, the story left to me a very nostalgic taste, and it was really well developed. 9/10 for that.Art: 10/10As I said on the top of my review, Shiki Oriori is from the same directors of Your Name. So, can we expect a similar art style as Your Name? Yes, I mean: the art and the design of this movie remembers a lot the art on Your Name. Very detailed traces, perfect character design and scenarios design are things that doesn\'t lack on that movie. But, different from Your Name, I felt that sometimes, the art quality can decline, but this is not a glaring thing. The art on this movie is truly beautiful, and I felt that the art was very faithful to Your Name. I mean: it\'s an obvious thing, because both of these two masterpiece movies were produced by the same studio (ComiX Wave). So, this is what makes the animation aspect a very beautiful thing. 10/10 for that, and you guys know: that I don\'t like to be very harsh with my reviews, and the movie, in specific, really deserved more attention that it looks.Sound: 8/10So, the soundtrack aspect is very good, but it\'s not like a remarkable or very catchy element. The sound is good, the rain scenes on the start, and the final scenes had very sweet piano soundtracks at the background, and it makes your ears very thankful to delight something like that. The soundtrack is a very calm element, and it\'s basically the same as meditation songs I mean. There\'s nothing too much to talk about this aspect (and about this movie), because this was a simple movie (with simple aspects), but it was deeper than it looks, because the things that happened on that trilogy were there to make you rethink about your actions, your thoughts, and etc. And the soundtrack, even it isn\'t almost a thing, just intensified my feelings about that movie, because there\'s some moments (with soundtrack) that\'s something like a mind travel, leaving your mind venture itself with the things that happen on Shiki Oriori. So, I gave to the sound aspect a solid 8/10, because it was not the best, but it was something to appreaciate and something very delightful to hear, like meditation or lo-fi musics. I know, this can be a dumb comparison lol, but it\'s a little bit true, so there\'s some sense making that comparison. So, 8/10.Character: 9/10So, I saw the plot and I saw (as I said on the top of my review) that this movie consists to show us 3 different stories. And I need to say: on all these stories, the character development was something that really enchanted and caught at the first look. Because, it\'s something like: we can feel what they\'re feeling, because this movie tried so hard to show human situations in a very real way, and they got it perfectly. You know: on all the stories, there\'s the background voices of the characters, explaining all about them and their lives. And I can say that: the way that the characters were shown on Shiki Oriori was very good, because we can indentify with one of them, in some hour. But, beyond that, the characters past and stories were just shown in some many nostalgic ways, that it was like to push you, and to motivate you: to make the things better, to follow with the things that you like to do, and to be near to the people that you really trust. As I said, the movie just shown a lot of situations that can easily happen on the real life, and the way that these characters were facing these issues was something very real, that it turns to something like: be present on that movie, you\'ll have the feeling that you\'re on the actual movie. And that\'s something that I found very very good, because as you all guys know: the characters and story development are extremely important to catch up the attention of the viewers. And Shiki Oriori made it very well. All the stories were really well-worked, and this is a curious thing: this an adult movie for kids. Confusing, right? Because as I said, it has like the nostalgic taste. So, 9/10 to the characters aspect, very good, and it was like: we could identify with one of them in the most of the times, and they really got my attention, because sometimes I almost felt that I was present on the actual movie.Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 9/10Ok ok, some people consider the stories a little bit bothersome, and yeah: sometimes I was feeling very tired, but the movie is just made you to reflect: about the life and how can we dealing with the situations that it gives to us. In the final of the movie, all of the main characters of the 3 stories (Xiao Ming; Yi Ling and her sister; Li Mo and his friends) were in the same airport, to move to another city in different airplanes. All of them are now having the pleasure and enjoying the joy of to live, the joy of follow with their own paths, and with their own lives. So, to end up my review: this is not like the type of movie that will make you cry exactly. And yes, I cry too much with dorama animes (such as: Violet Evergarden, AnoHana, Koe No Katachi, Kimi No Na Wa, and etc.). But, Shiki Oriori isn\'t exactly to make you feel sad, but to make you lift up your head, and continue to appreaciate the pleasure of live. This movie is more like a motivation, a little push to make you think different about your actions and thoughts, and enjoy every single second of your life. Because, life is too short, and we need to appreaciate it with the better way as possible. So, to end up, I really enjoyed this movie: this movie is the typical movie that you can watch on rainy days, drinking a hot coffee, like chill vibes. So, 9/10, it\'s not like the same way as Your Name, but the producers just made a very great work on that movie too. And if the movie was inspired on Your Name, you can clearly expect some great results, and this is something that you\'ll have on this movie. So, you definitely need to take a chance on it, and I really don\'t know why this movie has this average score (7,29). It was so great that it really needs more attention. So, I mean: trust on me, and watch it, because this is something that\'s very necessary to experience. I finish my review right here, and have a nice day guys. Bye bye! no Na Wa, but I need to say: the story caught me at the first look. This review won\'t be too long, but I\'m warning you previously: that this review contains a lot of major spoilers, so don\'t see it, if you still didn\'t watch the movie (and you definitely need to take a time to see the genius of this movie).

In the final of the movie, all of the main characters of the 3 stories (Xiao Ming; Yi Ling and her sister; Li Mo and his friends) were in the same airport, to move to another city in different airplanes. All of them are now having the pleasure and enjoying the joy of to live, the joy of follow with their own paths, and with their own lives. So, to end up my review: this is not like the type of movie that will make you cry exactly. And yes, I cry too much with dorama animes (such as: Violet Evergarden, AnoHana, Koe No Katachi, Kimi No Na Wa, and etc.). But, Shiki Oriori isn\'t exactly to make you feel sad, but to make you lift up your head, and continue to appreaciate the pleasure of live. This movie is more like a motivation, a little push to make you think different about your actions and thoughts, and enjoy every single second of your life. Because, life is too short, and we need to appreaciate it with the better way as possible. So, to end up, I really enjoyed this movie: this movie is the typical movie that you can watch on rainy days, drinking a hot coffee, like chill vibes. So, 9/10, it\'s not like the same way as Your Name, but the producers just made a very great work on that movie too. And if the movie was inspired on Your Name, you can clearly expect some great results, and this is something that you\'ll have on this movie. So, you definitely need to take a chance on it, and I really don\'t know why this movie has this average score (7,29). It was so great that it really needs more attention. So, I mean: trust on me, and watch it, because this is something that\'s very necessary to experience. I finish my review right here, and have a nice day guys. Bye bye!', 'Very beautifully and artistically clubbed together 3 pieces of stories, all of them shares a common thing - \'taste of youth\'. But the catch is, different meaning of taste/youth ( or perspective i should say) has been depicted in these 3 stories. Since they are not related, i\'ll try to review them separately based on my experience.In the first one, taste may refer to the original taste.. the foods we used to love at childhood and can never forget the smile it used to bring on our face, but alas, is available no more. It could be the food made by our grandparents,...or as simple as a small candy.Only for this part, my rating is - 8...............................................................................................In the second one, taste of youth is the the indomitable desire to be youthful forever. There are very few people in the world who haven\'t felt insecured about getting old and fading beauty, especially if beauty is what you rely on for a living. This episode depicts the inner conflicts and insecurities of human minds at this stage..Personally I didn\'t feel it is at par with the other two episodes, somy rating is - 6................................................................................................The third one is the one I loved the most. Here the taste of youth simply means the bittersweet memories we leave behind at adolescent age. Those childish fights, fooling around hours after hours with best buddies, & that heavenly feeling of ""First Love"" ! and in most of the cases feeling the pain of a broken heart.Whether successful or not, we always keep that most precious memory hidden in the safest room of our heart. And once in a while when we are completely alone, maybe looking blank at the horizon from balcony, raindrops touching our face falling into the cup of coffee.. we try to go back in time and pick up the threads where we left off.I apologize if I deviated from the actual topic, but I see no reason to give this 3rd episode a rating any less than 10 !Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy the movie too ! :) or as simple as a small candy.Only for this part, my rating is - 8...............................................................................................In the second one, taste of youth is the the indomitable desire to be youthful forever.

On many occurrences, the steam escaping his hot and fresh bowl of noodles foggs everything else starting from his childhood crush, everyday struggles in life between chores and school highlighting his grandmother's love for him. A bowl of noodles that not only encapsulates his childhood memories that seem to have faded out and lost its taste with the passing years but also represents his unconditional love and connection with his sickly aging grandmother.Compared to the two other stories, “A Little Fashion Show” was sandwiched too tightly that it couldn't be expressed freely in the given time and widely different vibe of the other two stories.While the two other stories have somewhat of a similar setting to them, with both parties coming from rough, poor to below-average living conditions, this one flashes all the broadway lights at one of the top lifestyles between fame and wealth.Although the vibe in this one might not be as captivating and as relatable to others, the meat o the story resides on the relationship of two sisters as weight on a famous fashion icon obscures a lot of their desires to share love and prosper. Two individuals where one has talent but no front to make it whilst the other is the complete opposite but with so much success that it starts eating away at her ego and degrading her self-esteem and confidence.The movie concludes with the third and last story named “Shanghai Love”, a young sparkling beginning to an innocent love that gets lost between the stubbornness and determination from both parties.It was because of this particular peek into two childhood friends that made people call out Shikioriori as a 5-Centimeters Per Seconds rip-off, some even calling its second coming or its redemption, but the romance element was the least captivating thing about it for me, instead, the display of parenting was the real hook.Both Limo and Yu grow up in similar circumstances only for one of them to have been born into an intolerant parent that would turn to violence as a show of his parenting, an entire night of taking a beating, and then in the morning no tears to be shed but the grave marks left all over the face and the body. A harrowing reminder of how things went in people's daily lives and everybody still acted as nothing happened.Some call Shikioriori an unoriented narrative that doesn't know where it's going but in my eyes, the tripartite bit-sized look into the characters it presented was what made the best of it. The real seller for me was the last scene where all parties were revealed to have been present in the same waiting area in some airport, waiting for the next flight in anticipation, revealing that no matter how far and unrelated they were, their stories managed to intersect at some point uniting all of these different people while they reminisce on their lives up until that point before they go their separate ways until another unfated encounter.Story (8/10):Art (9/10):Sound (8.5/10):Characters (8/10):Enjoyment (8.7/10):Overall (8.44/10): noodles that's yet to remind him with his long lost tasteful youth.

The writing\'s not that bad, but it\'s obnoxious and pretentious, which i guess isn\'t something that can be avoided, since the plots basically are basically ramen, fashion and childhood romance nostalgia. As you can imagine, the first two are absolute garbage, while the third one...was watchable at least (although it still had no story to it).Just save yourself from the dissappointment and time waste, you\'re literally better of watching ANY other show there is.

And I really wish I won’t experience a bigger let-down by the end of this year, cause this movie was enough to last me for some time.I wanted to love Flavors of Youth, I really did. I was excitedly waiting for its release ever since...its announcement and I ended up watching it as soon as it premiered on Netflix. I adore anthology stories, I love watching as the lives of different people become somehow interconnected, I love not having to sit through a 1,5-hour long movie but three 30 minutes long movies. There is nothing about the premise of this movie that doesn't apeal to me.Plus, I am still so, so needy after Your Name, and I craved a Shinkai movie, with gorgeous animation, subtle, compelling stories about every-day life and a conclusion that will break my heart.But because it’s just a ComicWave movie, not a Shinkai movie, I got only one of those things – Flavors of Youth surely look pretty ( especially the first story – those rice noodles were straight-up food porn) but there’s really not much there besides that. In all three stories, characters feel shallow and artificial, with no real depth or a way we can relate to them;  the character writing itself is very cheap. Even our mains are only characterized by a few qualities, if at all and I’m not even going to talk about the secondary cast. The narration is used excessively and what’s even worse, it’s used in a way it isn’t supposed to be used. The writers clearly did not remember about the golden rule of storytelling – show, not tell- because through the whole movie I felt as if somebody was telling me these stories, not as if I watching them, and let me just tell you, this was probably the worst thing about this movie for me. It felt horrible. We, as the audience, only know how characters feel, because they tell us that and we see no real emotions, we are not given a chance to think for our self and develop our own conclusions, but instead of that, we are spoon-feed everything.About the plot itself... Let me start with Sunny Breakfast and A Little Fashion Show - I really think these stories had some potential, but it was all lost in some very early part of the production process. There is not an ounce of substance here, nothing to latch onto, nowhere to find some hidden layer or depth. They are all so straightforward that it hurts. I can’t even count how many times during this movie I was thinking to myself how I’d love to be watching a Garden of Words in this very moment. There’s nothing wrong with showing little scenes from an ordinary life, small snapshots of reality – I’ll be the first person to defend this kind of filmmaking. But not like this! Again, too much talking, too much leading the audience by their hand to follow blindly what the creators are telling us. No space to analyze the stuff happening, because well – either nothing really happens or the things that happen are so painfully simple and dull that it hurts.And the conclusions! Oh god, don’t get me started on this topic. While Rice Noodles had some kind of a semi-satisfying ending ( although, again, boring as hell), A little fashion show almost killed me on a spot. How can you take such an interesting premise – an aging model trying to figure out what she wants from life as her options become more and more limited, a family love between two so different sisters, the gap that they can never really close- and just butcher it completely? Everything about this second story makes me mad and especially the thought about all this wasted potential, this idea that could be developed in so many interesting ways instead of – this.And I’m not saying they’re terrible – because they are not. Sunny Breakfast had me smiling and, again, the food animation was just so gorgeous that I had to marvel at it, it actually made me truly hungry which rarely happens when I’m watching something. The parts about the childhood and first crush and how his favorite meal kinda linked different parts of his life together were all sweet and charming. And A Little Fashion Show had some nice moments too, especially at the moment when sisters quarrel and the watcher is finally given some freedom to analyze what’s happening on the screen. But overall, I think I’m so mad at them precisely because they were not all bad, there were little elements that worked while the whole stories didn’t.And about Shanghai Love.. well. It’s quite amazing for me because I remember times, not long ago, when Makoto Shinkai was the one to copy others – namely and mostly, Miyazaki – and now we’ve come to the times when he is the one being copied. Shanghai Love really is a tribute to 5 centimeters and maybe that’s why it comes out a little bit better than the other two. There is a complete story there, the one with things unsaid, less narration and a pretty nice ending. Of course, I think it would be much nicer if it was turned into a longer movie –  the story would just flow better if certain parts were more developed. But all in all, it’s definitely the best out of three, the one with most believable characters, best storyline and overall quite decent  execution ( however, I think the animation was definitely the best in Rice Noodles story. In Shanghai Love, well, characters sometimes doesn’t look as polished as they’re supposed too).To sum up this angry rant – Flavors of Youth is not a bad anime or a bad movie per se. But it is a textbook definition of wasted potential, and its overuse of narration and shallow writing drove me mad while watching and I think if I ever come back to it for a re-watch, I’ll settle for Shanghai Love only. its announcement and I ended up watching it as soon as it premiered on Netflix.

Some might find this movie to be 'boring' as the concepts on paper are quite simple and not particularly interesting, however the artistic way that these stories are told makes them surprisingly engaging and really shows the talent of the studio behind this movie.It might not be for everyone, however I can safely say I really enjoyed my time with this film and recommend people to give it a chance. "", 'Written under the pretense that life is boring, Flavors of Youth showcase’s the mundanity of ordinary people in all of their glorious banality. Injections of “shock and awe” are inserted to obfuscate the viewer’s attention away from the overt vapidity that is present on screen, but it is to no avail, as the blandness is too pungent for one to completely ignore. Furthermore, the presence of a theme or overarching message seems to be absent, leaving the viewer confused as to what they are watching an insipid movie with little-to-nothing to offer.Sunny Breakfast: 1/10“Translucent.”This was one of the numerous words that “Narration Boy” used to...describe the essence of his entire existence (i.e. noodles); yet, it also serves as an accurate description of his unremarkable life. Rather than concocting a recipe to cook his own noodles, “Narration Boy” laments how empty his life is without his daily dose of San Xian noodles, creating a dissociation with himself and society — although, to be fair, he doesn’t seem to have any friends, nor does he attempt to initiate a conversation with the girl he is secretly stalking on a daily basis, but that’s neither here nor there. The point, if there even is one, is this: that “Narration Boy” expects life to cater to his refined noodle consumption needs; otherwise, he will loaf around in a depressed mood complaining about the capitalization of the noodle industry in Japan.A Little Fashion Show: 2/10Documentaries about the ruthlessness of the fashion world, and the lengths that the models are willing to push themselves to for the prestige of walking in front of a distinguished crowd of critics, have become streamlined to the public for several years now. To put it comically: it’s an ugly business about beautiful people. “A Little Fashion Show,” however, extracts much of the wickedness out of it, rendering a softened version that is hardly more interesting than the first film. Once again, the characters offer very little in terms of substance, and the motif of finding oneself through your family/love one’s is presented in a prosaic manner.Shanghai Love: 3/10It felt like this story was told from the wrong perspective, as it would have been far more intriguing hearing the girl’s first hand accounts. The implied child abuse could have lent itself to an emotional struggle for the girl to overcome before entering into a relationship with the boy in the story. Also, the failure in gaining acceptance to her desired school could have led to depressive episodes, in which she struggles with her own self-identity. But enough talking about what isn’t, let’s talk about what is.In lieu of cell phones, our main characters “message” each other through the use of cassette tapes (people know what these are, right?). It is presented in a fairly charming way (albeit a bit corny), but the reasons as to why these characters express interest for one another is ill-explored. And as the main character grows up, and becomes immersed in the rigors of his “desired” career path, he discovers a tape from his past, and guess what: the girl randomly shows up at the end and they live happily ever after. Disney ending, much?Overall: 2/10Given the upward trend of the anthology film ratings, if the studio decided to make seven more shorts, they possibly could have produced something quite masterful. But, as it stands, it was a dismal performance with a poverty in memorable moments. Nothing watched here today will persist in the memory banks of my brain, and recommending to others should be avoided, as they will probably no longer wish to talk to you.

And as the main character grows up, and becomes immersed in the rigors of his “desired” career path, he discovers a tape from his past, and guess what: the girl randomly shows up at the end and they live happily ever after. Disney ending, much?Overall: 2/10Given the upward trend of the anthology film ratings, if the studio decided to make seven more shorts, they possibly could have produced something quite masterful. But, as it stands, it was a dismal performance with a poverty in memorable moments. Nothing watched here today will persist in the memory banks of my brain, and recommending to others should be avoided, as they will probably no longer wish to talk to you. One has to wonder why Netflix authorized this weird amalgamation for widespread consumption, but, then again, “Neo Yokio” exists, so……..yeah.']"

Tokimeki Tonight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3125/Tokimeki_Tonight,"['Tokimeki Tonight is not a well-known anime (which is why there are no reviews for it). It\'s fallen to the wayside since it finished airing 35 years ago. Is it fair or is there more to this series than what\'s on the surface?Story:If you ever wanted an anime version of the Addams Family with your typical shoujo clichés thrown in, this is the closest you\'re going to get.Due to the episodic nature of the series, don\'t expect any significant progress. Yes, even after the dramatic events of episodes 25 and 26, everything turns back to normal when the credits roll. Also, don\'t be surprised...if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground.The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze\'s love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers. (More on that later!)Music:I was rather taken aback by the score on Tokimeki Tonight. The score was quite infectious, to the point that some of it played in my mind while I was trying to fall asleep. A special shout-out goes to the fighting music with the saxophone in it.Of course, the main draws are the OP and ED. I must admit, this is one of the few series where I liked the ED music more than the OP. However, both are quite catchy and memorable (in accordance with the law of 80s themes).Characters:While there\'s no character I like 100% of the time (outside of the shark in episode 32, which, trust me, makes sense in context), the main cast tends to be likable more often than not.However, there were some I couldn\'t bring myself to like, no matter how hard I tried. The rigidness of Ranze\'s mother made any scene she was in tough to digest. She wants Ranze to fall in love with a fellow monster and repeatedly tries to sabotage her romantic efforts with Makabe-kun. In fact, her rabid traditionalism even puts Ranze in danger in episode 13.Yoko, Ranze\'s rival in love, is a brat at best and downright treacherous at worst. However, I believe she was intentionally written to be unlikable.Recurring characters Sand and Prince Aaron are borderline predators and that ruined any enjoyment I could have had of them.Art:One of the most unusual aspects of Tokimeki Tonight is the background art. While the series presumably takes place in Japan, most of the signs are in English and the architecture has an old European flair to it.As for the rest of the art, it\'s par for the course for an anime made in the early 80s. There was obviously a limited budget, which explains why the coloring is often basic and there\'s a lack of detail in the character\'s faces (you\'ll notice several times throughout the show, characters are drawn without noses). I\'m willing to let this fly, as the art isn\'t vomit-inducing and anime wasn\'t the most fruitful industry at the time.Enjoyment:Tokimeki Tonight is a mixed bag. Sometimes it\'s bad, sometimes it\'s good. Some stories are entertaining, while others can be borderline snooze fests. Like most everything else with this series, my enjoyment was about abverage.Final thoughts:While not the worst anime I\'ve seen (*cough* Blue Flames), it\'s understandable as to why this series fell to the wayside. It\'s a 7 at its best and it\'s a 3 at its worst. I honestly thought I would have more to see for this, but it\'s just-so average. It\'s an obvious 5.So, all in all, I give this series five glasses of tomato juice out of ten. if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground.The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze\'s love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers.

This review is pretty subjective and if the points I make don’t personally bother you then you might Like Tokimeki Tonight and I recommend heading over to YouTube where the whole series has been uploaded in pretty good quality.At first glance the premise is really cool. The protagonist Ranze is an average 15 year old girl except for the fact that her mother is a werewolf and her father is a vampire...(It's sort of like the Munsters if it was a shojo). Ranze’s parents are by far the best part of the show, and if the show was just about vampire dad and wolf-mom I probably wouldn’t have had a problem finishing the series. The problem is I think that's where it stops being interesting (at least for me.)For the most part Tokimeki Tonight is your typical 80's shojo/gag anime. The main focus of the story is the bland protagonist girl, and her infatuation was a slightly less bland boy who won’t even give her the time of day. But this is the early 80’s and this type of plot is a shojo mainstay, especially in the early days so I won’t be too harsh on that aspect. I figured that this was just the type of mind numbing fluff my brain needed at the end of the day so I kept going. The real problem for me (and the reason why I didn’t finish it) is more complicated.Ranze, as I've said, is a 15 year old girl. She’s in love with her classmate Shun. This would be totally fine if that weren’t her only concrete characteristic. The only other female character her age (who gets screen time) is Ranze’s classmate Yoko. It is the dynamic between these three characters that made the series unbearable for me. Ranze doesn’t do anything besides try to win the affections of Shun. She has no hobbies of interest or even any friends. Yoko’s only purpose is to serve as a rival for Shun’s affections. If Ranze had at least one female friend then maybe I could have gotten past her flaws but that's just it. The only interactions between female characters involve petty jealousy fighting over a guy who doesn’t even notice them half the time. Maybe it’s my modern sensibilities but I can’t watch a whole series where girls do nothing but fight each other like that. All i’m saying is girls shout support girls and this series made me want to watch legally blond to scrub it from my memory. You want a good old Shojo then look to the works of Ryoko Ikeda because this just isn’t it.Because I hate to end this on a down note I will say that the opening and ending theme songs are absolute bangers and they are the whole reason why I even knew about this series to begin with. Seriously look them up; the ending in particular is way better than it has any right to be. (It's sort of like the Munsters if it was a shojo).

Unico,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2427/Unico,"['This review contains minor spoilers!I decided to watch this movie on a whim, expecting nothing of it, and I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the first 30 minutes of the film. After the absolutely adorable opening song, Unico is sent away to a wasteland. The lonely, cold atmosphere really got to me, and seeing Unico, the beacon of happiness and hope, pull through and turn the selfish, temperamental devil Akuma into a charmingly awkward friend was really inspirational.Sadly, the rest of the movie is much more average and not well-constructed. The second character Unico meets on his journeys is Chao the cat, a far...less charming friend than Akuma. She stays a boring ditz the whole movie, not really learning much from Unico.The villain, while totally fearsome and creepy (mostly due to excellent visual design), really detracts from what the film could have been. He has no depth and is defeated without any emotional fanfare. While his battle with Unico might be visually grandiose, there is nothing of substance here.I really did enjoy the bittersweet ending, though. Unico’s curse, bringing happiness to all, but never being able to stay with his friends, is tragic but meaningful to me. The plot and pacing are really unfocused for most of the film, leading to plenty of interesting themes…that are completely underutilized.Still, I really admire how atmospheric and interesting the visuals are in Unico. The sheer scale of important figures like the West Wind, the Night Wind and the villain is immediately apparent with their distinct designs that look great animated. Unico is literally the most adorable character on the planet. The whole package oozes creativity.I should also mention that while this is technically a children’s film, I wouldn’t recommend it for really young ones. There’s plenty of violence and dark atmosphere, a very imposing big bad, not to mention subtle rapey undertones.Unico has a lot of problems, but its heart and creativity push it into the 7/10 territory for me. On a bad day, maybe 6/10. I recommend it to anyone who’s a sucker for this power of friendship type of stuff and wants to see some fun art and animation.

It drove the plot forward and caused good character...development and was taught a good lesson about kindness. The demon Unico meets learns about friendship and how to be a good friend.

The other characters in the movie are adorable and interesting, each with their own role so far in the story and as for the villain I don't have much to say because he appears suddenly but it's fine...I guess although the end of the movie was the same what I liked the most, good ending for this movie. The artwork is precious and the songs fit well with the atmosphere of the movie. The truth is I hope Sanrio will remember Unico and release something new about him because he has a lot potential for more movies o even a anime series.

Wu Shang Shen Di 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48956/Wu_Shang_Shen_Di_2nd_Season,['Very repetitive story line where each episode a new villain will appear who will underestimate the MC and tell him trash bla bla. Then MC will start kicking the ass of that villain and at the middle of their fight another more powerful villain will arrive and this cycle will continue. Each episode is full of fighting and trash talking. There is no consistency in power level either and explanation is too vague. Also there are 1500+ chapter in the novel and they have covered 200+ chapters so far in the donghua due to the shitty pacing. So just avoid this. ']

SSSS.Gridman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35847/SSSSGridman,"[""Warning: spoilers and sarcasm are featured belowHey, are you feeling down because you have this great idea for an anime but keep getting rejected by every studio that you try to sell your pitch to? Well it's time to turn that frown upside down, because Studio Trigger will gladly produce your anime for you, as long as your anime contains a few specific things of course. Here are the three easy steps that you must follow in order to have your anime green lit by Studio Trigger!1. Make sure to have a LOT of steamy hot fan service. It's best if your main source of...sex appeal comes from your leading female character, because being hot waifu material > having a personality and depth.2. Have your main character (who has to be an edgy teen btw) fly around in a giant mecha all the time because BIG ROBOTS ARE AWESOME!!!3. ADD ALIENS! Especially as twist villains for the final arc of your story, because there's nothing better than kids in giant robots fighting against aliens in FREAKING SPACE!!!Follow these simple steps and your anime will be practically guaranteed to end up as Trigger's next unsuccessful imitation of great anime like NGE and TTGL just like SSSS.Gridman is!...On second thought, maybe you should just try your luck with a no-name studio.I'm starting to think that creativity died at Studio Trigger. Yet although they seem to consistently recycle the same exact ideas, I've still enjoyed their works. I loved Kill la Kill because it somewhat deviated from the traditional Trigger formula and was just a great and fun anime all around. I even really liked Darling in the FranXX up until they butchered the ending because Trigger just HAD to have aliens. But with StopSoundingSoStupid.Gridman (Seriously, are the four S's supposed to mean something?), it just felt hollow. I never got the impression that this anime was trying to stand out and make a name for itself, and it unfortunately ended up being painfully average because of it.Interestingly enough, my score for this anime fluctuated several times throughout its run time. I actually did find some episodes to be enjoyable and even thought provoking, yet others were the embodiment of mediocrity equipped with bad character interactions and bland scenarios. The only things that remained consistent throughout were Rikka's sexy legs. But even those thick thighs weren't enough to salvage the dysfunctional plotline of this anime.The setting is quite bizarre. Our protagonist has come down with a rather unfortunate case of amnesia that is poorly explained near the end of the anime and finds himself in a city surrounded by a bunch of giant kaiju that only he can see. But he doesn't really seem too concerned about any of this. In fact, he doesn't seem to care about anything at all except for getting in Rikka's pants. And when other characters finally realize that our hero Yuuta isn't insane and see the kaiju too, they also don't seem to care too much about their situation. And that's one of the glaring issues with this anime. If the characters are completely nonchalant about basically everything, then why should we the viewers care about what's going on? Not that the story itself is anything exciting. It's just a typical monster of the week that Gridman and Yuuta beat up and then everything resets (the damage to the city and the memories of everyone who isn't an important character) because plot. And despite what you may be thinking, there really isn't much more to this anime than that. If anything, it just became even more confusing and convoluted by the end of the show.For the most part, the characters are pretty stale. Gridman is the most bland sentient robot ever conceived and is piloted by the most uninspired kid imaginable. Utsumi is that typical friend guy who never does anything useful except crack a joke or two every ten minutes. Rikka is the attractive female lead who's personality unfortunately isn't as good as her looks. Alexis is some random alien that's randomly in this anime because Trigger has an alien fetish. The other characters bar one aren't even worth mentioning.*This short segment contains spoilers as well as positive thoughts on this anime*The one person who keeps this anime from falling into garbage territory in my eyes would be Akane. She takes the role of the antagonist, making all of the kaiju herself and trying to kill Gridman and people she doesn't like with them, and the anime literally revolves around her since she is, you know, a god. She seems like a fun and energetic girl at first, but after peeling away her mask, her true colors as a heartless, attention seeking psycho are exposed. And the anime even further sheds light on her intricate and delicate psyche later on in the show. The dream sequence episode, while weird, was one of my favorites from the anime simply because of how it portrayed Akane. She's just a really engaging character who I enjoyed watching. She's also pretty hot, I'd say even more so than Rikka's (Yeah, I said it!) Akane is definitely the highlight of SSSS.Gridman for me.*End of spoilers and positivity*Despite my obvious displeasure with a decent chunk of this anime, it was still semi enjoyable to watch. Sure, the anime doesn't have much heart, but watching a giant robot beat up giant monsters is always fun, despite how repetitive it gets. And Rikka and Akane were a pleasure to watch (for more reasons than one~), so that's always a plus.Show'sStorySeriouslySucks.Gridman is underwhelming. It never really went anywhere and just felt sort of pointless. A lot of things didn't make sense and when the anime did try to explain something, it usually just made it even more confusing.

I think a lot of the surface-level elements turned people away, especially since the first few episodes were fairly slow and predictable. But once the show actually got going, the actual content there kept us coming back week after week, and it ended up being not just one of my favorite shows of its season, but of the year as a whole.Gridman is a precarious mix of genres, balancing seemingly everyday school life against giant mecha fights. The former goes against what people expect from mecha anime, and is likely responsible for the show being labeled...as slow. However, these two disparate halves somehow built off each other, with the tension of the daily life feeding into the catharsis of the action scenes. Since it's the more mundane material that seems to have garnered the most criticism, that'll be the focus of this review.Interestingly enough, this means I really don’t need to talk about Yuta. While he may pilot Gridman, his amnesiac protagonist bit gets in the way of him having a particularly interesting school life, and instead Rikka steps forward as the protagonist. Rikka is the more emotionally-driven of the two, and while she’s aware of all the kaiju shenanigans going on in the show, it’s never really her main drive.Instead, Rikka’s conflict is her trying to reconnect with Akane, the antagonist of the series with whom she used to be close friends. Akane creates the kaiju that terrorize the city, and it would be so easy to just view her as the villain, especially since this is how she presents herself. But unlike the other protagonists, Rikka doesn't look at her through this lens. By refusing to play on Akane’s terms of mecha and kaiju, she is the one who is able to genuinely reach out to Akane and save her from her isolation. This story of reconnection could have been treated as secondary to the main action, but instead it’s given the same level of attention, receiving much of the show’s expressive animation and relatable character moments.Also, the show absolutely nails atmosphere. Though everything seems mostly normal for the first half of the run, the show's use of its claustrophobic camera and tendency for long pauses serve to constantly instill a sense of discomfort in the viewer as they try to figure out why the world seems off. The summer heat is tangible and oppressive, and the rainy days are all the more miserable. The soundtrack goes a long way to sell these scenes, and the opening and ending are both fantastic.Briefly, I’ll talk about how the show handles homage. I think a lot of the criticism leveled at the show is based on it being too steeped in references to other shows, to the point that animator for the original Gridman Obari Masami complained that they weren’t doing anything new with the material. With that said, I don’t mind having these callbacks as fanservice to fans of the original, especially since they don’t conflict with the story being told. Plus, how upset can I really be over all of the character designs being based on obscure Transformers? That’s adorable.In conclusion, Gridman is just really good, you know? If you’ve been on the fence about watching Gridman because of the initial negative reception, I'd say it's worth trying for yourself. I'm still not entirely clear why so much of the community is down on this show, but I absolutely loved it, and I hope that more people will give it a chance. as slow.

Akane creates the kaiju that terrorize the city, and it would be so easy to just view her as the villain, especially since this is how she presents herself. But unlike the other protagonists, Rikka doesn't look at her through this lens. By refusing to play on Akane’s terms of mecha and kaiju, she is the one who is able to genuinely reach out to Akane and save her from her isolation. This story of reconnection could have been treated as secondary to the main action, but instead it’s given the same level of attention, receiving much of the show’s expressive animation and relatable character moments.Also, the show absolutely nails atmosphere. Though everything seems mostly normal for the first half of the run, the show's use of its claustrophobic camera and tendency for long pauses serve to constantly instill a sense of discomfort in the viewer as they try to figure out why the world seems off. The summer heat is tangible and oppressive, and the rainy days are all the more miserable. The soundtrack goes a long way to sell these scenes, and the opening and ending are both fantastic.Briefly, I’ll talk about how the show handles homage. I think a lot of the criticism leveled at the show is based on it being too steeped in references to other shows, to the point that animator for the original Gridman Obari Masami complained that they weren’t doing anything new with the material. With that said, I don’t mind having these callbacks as fanservice to fans of the original, especially since they don’t conflict with the story being told. Plus, how upset can I really be over all of the character designs being based on obscure Transformers? That’s adorable.In conclusion, Gridman is just really good, you know? If you’ve been on the fence about watching Gridman because of the initial negative reception, I'd say it's worth trying for yourself. I'm still not entirely clear why so much of the community is down on this show, but I absolutely loved it, and I hope that more people will give it a chance."", 'This show is so under-rated.

He also suffers from a memory loss which is the single worst trope invented by man, which is great because that\'s exactly the type of lame shit this show deserves.Rikka is the best girl because she sighs every 3 seconds and sounds both disinterested and bored, which is also great because I imagine she has become self-aware and has realized she is a character in this fucking thing. *sigh* ""this out of all anime""There are also other characters here.

The last S. is really supposed to be moved at the end of the sentence, hence the dot in title. Thanks Triggarh', ""SSSS.Gridman is an anime inspired by the old tokusatsu series Denkou Choujin Gridman. It takes what's interesting about the genre and adjusts it to fit the modern day's standards. Thanks to that the final product turned out to be an interesting mix of old and new. Add to it the outstandingly good execution and you get a masterpiece that can keep you glued to the screen with every episode.The main character of the anime is Yuuta Hibiki - a high school boy that wakes up at Rikka Takarada's home having no memories at all. At the Junk Shop, which belongs to Rikka's family, there's an...old computer called Junk. And inside of it there's Gridman - the Hyper Agent telling Yuuta there's a mission he needs to fulfill. Yuuta lets his school friend Utsumi in on what's happened and when huge monsters called kaijuu start attacking the city, these three form the Gridman Alliance and with the help of the robot inside Junk, they start fighting said monsters and begin the journey to discover the truth about the city and everyone in it.Since the very beginning there's a feeling that there's more to the show than it might appear at first. In what could be labelled as a naive show targetting the younger audience there's always the feeling that something is off and with every episode the eerie atmosphere becomes more apparent, which only makes the experience better. I loved the mysterious atmosphere of the weird, closed off city and the scenery filled with giant dormant monsters reminding you that even the calm days aren't how they should be.What adds to the atmosphere is the background music, or rather the frequent lack thereof. Because of that (and of the animation) some scenes look pretty slow, but I wouldn't call it a bad thing in this particular case. The music does always appear during the fight scenes, though, and it's fitting and good. I also liked both the opening and ending song. There's a song I liked even more, though, and namely Yume no Hero - the original Gridman's opening song - which the original version of we can hear in the last episode and there was also a rearrangement of it played before.As for the fights, what's much more outstanding about them than the soundtrack are the visuals. The fight scenes are super good and in my opinion they only get better with every episode. The CGI used during them looks clean and good quality and it also makes Gridman and the kaijuu look kind of heavy like they are supposed to be. We also get to see lots of cool transformations and gattai. Many cool combinations appeared throughout the show.The visuals are great not only during the fight scenes. There are rather many still frames, but I perceive them as an artistic move, which I like. But when things are moving, the animation is fluid, especially when there's a lot of action going on. The backgrounds are full of details, the characters have nice designs (I also love their eyes) and there is nothing about the visual side of the show that I could complain about.I found the characters to be another really strong point of the anime. Our main trio is totally likeable. Although devoid of some super unique traits, they feel genuine and their actions are understandable. And that's exactly what I like about them. They are just a group of normal high school kids whose everyday life changes because of the strange events happening. One could complain about the main character being bland, but there's a reason behind that, and it's more than just the fact that he has no memories. There's also Akane Shinjou - the girl everyone loves and a friend of Rikka. The Neon Genesis Junior High Students are a crazy but lovable and useful bunch, whose eccentricity doesn't fail to make the viewers smile. There's also a certain kaijuu boy that grew on me over time. The supporting characters are also fine.As for the references - there seem to be many of them, but as someone that has never been into tokusatsu shows, I can't say much about them, unfortunately. I feel like I'm missing out a bit, but it's not like being knowledgeable about this kind of thing is necessary to enjoy the show. I'm sure the references will add to the experience for people that are more familiar with that stuff, though. I also wanted to mention one thing I looked up before, and namely the background of a certain girl that played an important role in the episode 6. If you are interested in that, I recommend looking up a kaijuu named Anosillus. It's quite moving. Episode 6 is also the one the aforementioned rearrangement of the old opening song was played in.To sum it up, I see SSSS.Gridman as a show made of love and care for details. In spite of it taking inspirations from other things, it feels like it has its own identity. The quality of the anime is super good. To me this show is one of a kind.

While being heavily inspired by the 1993 live-action series Gridman the Hyper Agent, this version is loaded with visual references to numerous tokusetsu series and mecha anime of the past – Space Runaway Ideon, Getter Robo, Evangelion, several iterations of Gundam and more receive stunning rendition scenes that serve as quick but effective throwbacks appealing to nostalgia for the die-hard fans of yesterday. Whilst on the other side of the community, Gridman had managed to conquer the ever-present “best girl” debate of the season, with each week providing more material and support for why each girl and this series is worth one’s attention. Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist’s child the entire time (there’s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.SSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time – focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There’s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.The story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people’s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it’s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.Gridman’s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.As far as Gridman's production value is concerned, this is where the series really shows off its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman’s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.Whenever a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation – all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn’t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines.

Koyama sees the designs of both girls and a slick smile forms across his face.]Shigeto [amused]: Well, when all else fails, you can always make dem titties big!Masaru: ….(Inner Masaru [sighing]: What the hell did I sign up for?)_____________________________________________________________Regardless of how seriously you take the frankly awful transcript written above, it’s hard to argue just how much attention to detail went into the creation of SSSS.Gridman. While being heavily inspired by the 1993 live-action series Gridman the Hyper Agent, this version is loaded with visual references to numerous tokusetsu series and mecha anime of the past – Space Runaway Ideon, Getter Robo, Evangelion, several iterations of Gundam and more receive stunning rendition scenes that serve as quick but effective throwbacks appealing to nostalgia for the die-hard fans of yesterday. Whilst on the other side of the community, Gridman had managed to conquer the ever-present “best girl” debate of the season, with each week providing more material and support for why each girl and this series is worth one’s attention. Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist’s child the entire time (there’s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.SSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time – focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There’s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.The story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people’s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it’s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.Gridman’s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.As far as Gridman's production value is concerned, this is where the series really shows off its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman’s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.Whenever a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation – all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn’t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines."", 'SSSS.hit!Is Studio Trigger aware that they are not required to produce wack-ass anime ad infinitum?  It feels like they take pleasure in discovering new ways to SSSS.hit all over your computer screens, just to see how desperate we are for a new Mecha anime.  Perhaps the success of Inferno Cop went to their heads, giving them a false sense of entitlement to shove even worse rubbish up our collective SSSS.hit(holes), in hopes that we would gobble it up like a bunch of mindless, horny drones.  I can’t blame a player for wanting to get paid, but I can certainly blame Studio Trigger...for wanting to get paid…………What?  Why are you staring at your screen like that?  Nothing to see here.SSSS.Gridman is an anime that utilizes a formulaic approach to present a vapid adventure about a young boy who merges with a Mecha to fight outlandish “monsters” in a no holds barred, explosive battle to the death.  The fights, themselves, are  standard-fare.  Emulating the exaggerated absurdity of Gurren Lagann, but never quite reaching the eccentricity of Kill la Kill.  But while the former two attempted to stitch together (see what I did there? **Kill la Kill reference**) an acceptable narrative with their own, unique brand of action-comedy, SSSS.Gridman fails to capture the viewer’s attention in any meaningful fashion.  Per the cyclical, episodic framework, each 23 minute offering utilizes a “rinse and repeat” approach, where a new “monster”/Kaiju enters the city only to be defeated by the Gridman and reset everyone’s memories (except for those directly involved), as if the crisis never happened.By virtue of being repetitious, Studio Trigger, once again, displayed a general lack of ambition and creativity, especially with the addition of a superfluous river rafting episode, to give the staff an excuse to animate the girls in scantily clad outfits.  Furthermore, SSSS.Gridman is not funny.  The entertainment is lackluster, at best.  The concepts and themes are tedious.  And dare I mention the plot?…It’s not like the staff cared to mention it in any detail.Perhaps the worst aspect of the show is the prosaic, uninspired characters.  None of  them say/do anything worth remembering, nor do they come off as likable or worth caring about.  Yuta is your typical “only I can save the day” protagonist, with a plain, “nice guy” demeanor and a distinct red hair color.  His rival, Akane Shinjou, is a cold, despondent female with a murderous rage that can only be quelled by generating new Kaiju to terrorize the city and anyone who has wronged her.  Why, you may ask: because she’s a psychotic bitch (need I elaborate?).  Akane’s manipulator, Alexis Kerib, is the show’s token evil “alien,” to guide events to their ultimate conclusion. Studio Trigger, much to my dismay, seems to excel at producing low quality characters that exude pure nothingness, except for some hackneyed quarks and superficial characteristics.The only positive aspect about SSSS.Gridman is the OST, not that it was anything spectacular, but it accomplished its goal of being mildly entertaining.  But if we consider that an OP/ED are merely shallow, trivial components of what a show truly entails, then it’s quite the condemnation to the substantive portions of the show in question.Wouldn’t you agree?… for wanting to get paid…………What?

After the monumentally disappointing Darling in the FranXX and the surprisingly worthwhile Planet With, this show completes the year’s holy trinity of super robot anime by being a confusing mixed bag that is a nightmare to discuss. While it doesn’t exactly go full Evangelion, there are still references to it as well as stylistic similarities between the two. However, there’s more to this peculiar anime than just being another run-of-the-mill mecha series.First and foremost, this is both a tokusatsu and super robot anime. Sparing you the lengthy history of both concepts, it’s clear that the trappings of the two...genres aren’t easy to deal with in contemporary anime—or any anime in the case of tokusatsu. Case in point: while reused animation is common in mecha series, they’re mainly utilized for robot transformations and special attacks. However, SSSS.Gridman goes as far as to rewind even non-action scenes, creating unnecessary repetition. Studio Trigger also decided to render the Gridman and its Kaiju foes using CGI, and the jarring blend between these 3D models and their 2D environment causes a serious case of the uncanny valley. Not helping matters is how these hulking titans continually swap between 2D and 3D, making everything they interact with --i.e. the road, the cars, the debris, etc.-- become a visual disaster. It’s a shame these graphical problems make the fights harder to follow given their cool choreography and sakuga moments.The art style of this series is far from appealing. Aesthetically, the show is incredibly bland. The inconsistent animation can sometimes make the faces look like deformed potatoes, which are further accentuated by the uninspired character designs. The characters look incredibly plain apart from their vibrant eyes, and even the more appealing individuals such as Anti and Rikka seem lacking. Another problem is the awkward movements, specifically the hand and arm motions. Long story short, this show has a bunch of visual oddities that dampen the experience.In spite of all the aforementioned problems, SSSS.Gridman has a striking direction. There are moments between fights that highlight a sense of discomfort and eerie quietness, similar to the atmospheric pauses in Evangelion. These scenes feel pretentious at times, but the clever framing of shots that illustrate the emotional distance of the characters makes them more engrossing than not. Film buffs might find this directing standard fare, but such a thing is noteworthy in the anime landscape. The dream sequences in episode nine are particularly fun to witness and showcase the creative talent of director Akira Amemiya.S^4 Gridman heavily restrains its usage of background music. Most non-action scenes lack an accompanying soundtrack. You would think the absence of music makes their purpose more meaningful, but sadly this isn’t the case. Since the soundtracks aren’t utilized frequently, none of them are memorable as a result. However, there is one track that stood out: the opening theme “Union” by OxT. As an uplifting song, it works as a call to action that plays when the main cast is gaining the upper hand against their Kaiju opponents. The song doesn’t always mesh properly with the sequence since it’s sometimes too quiet, but when it does, be prepared for some epic moments. Sadly, all this can’t be said for the forgettable ending theme.The cast of SSSS.Gridman is a mixed bag. For every character like Calibur, whose quirkiness comes from his silent, dorky attitude, we have someone boring like Yuta, our unremarkable protagonist. Most of the main characters, including the titular Gridman, are one-dimensional; the most interesting thing about them is their genuine interactions amongst each other. On the other hand, the three antagonists are highly fascinating. Akane is similar to a child trapped in her own sandbox video game world, twisted by her own influence, loneliness, and creations. One of these creations, Anti, is a foil to Gridman. He’s an overly serious edgelord so hell-bent on destroying Gridman that he ends up being hilariously awkward in social interactions. He would even pick fights with other Kaiju simply because of his desire to personally kill Gridman. As for Alexis, his voice and demeanor make him seem incredibly humorous and lackadaisical -- even as he shoves a buzzsaw to someone’s eye.One irksome trait the cast share is their tendency to restrict themselves for no proper reason. For example, in episode three, Yuta, Calibur, and Gridman worry the others by disappearing after a Kaiju defeats them, only for them to be on standby the entire time. One could make the argument that rushing back into battle or retreating immediately would have tipped the Kaiju off, but they could have escaped after it left since they can just warp back to the shop.All this segues perfectly into SSSS.Gridman’s obscure narrative. The mystery surrounding the show’s existentially horrifying world is unnerving in the sense that the narrative gradually becomes more destructive as secrets begin to unravel, a la FranXX. While I don’t feel the show crosses that line enough to destroy any investment I could possibly have --at least until episode 10-- there’s a fundamental aspect of the world-building that doesn’t strike me the right way.Tiptoeing around spoilers, one of the major gimmicks of this show's world is that everyone’s memories of the dead are altered when a character dies at the hands of a Kaiju, or a Kaiju gets destroyed. With the exception of the surviving combatants, everyone’s mind starts to become hazy. It’s not quite on the level of Re:Zero where society begins to doubt the existence of certain individuals, but it’s still a frustrating gimmick that doesn’t entirely make sense. As such, the show’s convoluted narrative makes it difficult to recommend. The asspulls in the second half only adds to this problem.Despite its various shortcomings, SSSS.Gridman is still an entertaining mecha anime. The fights are fun to watch, the banters between the characters are engaging, and the twisted hellhole of a world leaves viewers with much to ponder. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I’m familiar with the tokusatsu genre, but I doubt such knowledge would make this show any less difficult to unpack. It’s an enigmatic mixed bag that I am glad to have watched.Oh, and on top of the Eva references, this show makes a Gurren Lagann reference, so there’s another link between the Gridman Planet With FranXX trio.Written/Edited by: CodeBlazeFateProofread by: PeregrineEdited by: Skittles genres aren’t easy to deal with in contemporary anime—or any anime in the case of tokusatsu.

I actually thought the series would go back it's Little Witch Academia/Kill la Kill days where it a nice blend of style and substance. However, after watching all 12 episodes of this show subbed and the first 8 episodes dubbed I can definitely say that this is not Trigger as it's best. In fact, this...is one of Trigger's weaker shows.The word dull is honestly the best word to describe the story of SSSS Girdman. While it wasn't actually awful by any means it just so dull and at times uninteresting to follow. The series basically follows your classic monster of the week formula where set kaiju comes in to cause trouble in the city then they get defeated by Girdman and the series goes back to the status quo. Rinse and repeat.Along with the show's monster/kaiju of the week formula, the series uses a certain plot device that I have grown to dislike over the years and that is Amnesia. If you don't know what Amnesia is then is basically a person who has no memory thanks to a certain event that caused him to lose memories and they essentially walking husks on screen until set character of set series gets they memory back. It is a plot device that essentially takes a big shit of the plot for set show as set show is literally forced to follow every amnesiac plot device possible and it's honestly tedious to watch.SSSS Gridman is no different to this and as a result, the series was a chore to watch as we just see this our amnesia protagonist defeat Kanju left and right without a second thought.When the show finally stops being this generic monster of the week in the last couples the series is being a boring God story with our main antagonist Akame and no surprise it's generic.Finally, you can tell that Trigger was holding back/ I understand Trigger wanted to play itself after the disaster that was Darling in the Franxx but unfortunately there is a huge difference between playing itself and simply holding back for no reason and it really shows.If there's any silver lining to SSSS Girdman to speak of it was the show is simply a fun throwback to not only the mecha anime genre from the past but the Tokusatsu genre as a whole. While I personally cannot get into the Tokusatsu genre myself, I will admit it genre has its appeal and anyone who is a fan of the Tokusatsu genre would probably have a good time with SSSS Girdman. It's such a shame the narrative isn't all that good to back it up.The characters in SSSS Girdman were easily the weakest part of SSSS Girdman. They aren't terrible but they don't stand out all that much outside of a certain character trait for the most part.Yuuta is your typical mecha/high school boy shounen protagonist that we all have seen before. Thanks to his amnesia in the narrative, he has no real personality to speak off. He doesn't grow as a character all that much and just simply a bore to watch. Even more boring than Katsuhira from Kiznaver.Rikka started off as a decent character at first but she sadly devolved into a meme as the series progressed.Shou is just there. He doesn't offer much to the story other to be a semi-useless sidekick for Yuuta.The only slightly decent main character in the show is Akane as she has a decent motivation of killing all the Girdman. I really enjoyed how after she had peeled her cute face as she turned into a proper psycho. She was the most entertaining thing about this mediocre series.The rest of the characters are just there. They not terrible but they not memorable as well.Compared to the unpolished Trigger+ Cloverworks that was Darling in the Franxx the visuals in SSSS were pretty appealing for the most part.The characters deigns are very distant and pretty to look at thanks to the beautiful smooth colour palette that was used to colour each character, Kanj and Gridman mecha itself which was nicely designed. The background scenery was well drawn as it had a lot of detail.The animation was pretty solid for what it was however at the time it got a bit choppy in certain fights least it's not as bad as Franxx second half although the CGI itself could have been a lot better as it was janky at times.The soundtrack is alright for what it is but not that memorable.The opening and ending themes were decent but nothing too special.As for sub vs dub well, this was a tricky one because I only saw the last 2 episodes subbed as I mainly watched this show dubbed and it was great and it manages to surpass the sub which was already pretty good on its own. The voice actors really did an excellent job with the roles they were given as it was well acted and nicely directed.I really wanted to like SSSS Girdman I really do, but the series was ultimately average at best and underwhelming at worst.

Out of all the genres though, mecha seems to be one that I’ve always been fascinated by. In recent years, it seems mecha shows have caused a bit of controversy. From Full Metal Panic to Darling in the Frankxx, they can either be really, really good or pretty damn despicable.Perhaps we shouldn’t jump too far ahead. Studio Trigger has been able to produce series with memorable quality...from their lineup. Sure, Darling in the Frankxx was a show that had a divided fan base but who can forget some of their other phenomenal work like Kill la Kill or Little Witch Academia? SSSS.Gridman got announced during Summer 2017 and to think, it also stands out as a celebration for the 25th anniversary of the original Denkou Choujin Gridman from 1993. I think if you’re a fan of tokusatsu programs, then you may be prepared for a treat. But if you’re not, be prepared for a wildly bizarre adventure.I should say right off the bat that SSSS.Gridman’s synopsis may take a few times to read before getting a first impression of what the show may be really about. It reminds me of a bit of blending between the Western and Japanese culture. We have mecha that somehow reminds me of Transformers, action heroes that feel like they are in the role as Power Rangers, and battles that resemble Pacific Rim. When I was young, there was a time when I watched Power Rangers especially the classics like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. However, I was never too big in the Ultraman franchise despite also being a tokusatsu classic. When people mention Ultraman, SSSS.Gridman also comes to my mind with the similar style of presentation. The first few episodes quickly unravels a dark plot about Akane Shinjo. As a central antagonist, she has a troubling personality and holds disturbing grudges towards those who “wrongs her”. She could be someone you would call a sociopath and can be highly manipulative. When we meet Akane the first time, it doesn’t take long to realize that there’s something deeply wrong about her inner personality. And honestly, a type of character like her easily brings in trouble into the main story.Of course, our main story involves protagonist Yuta Hibiki who wakes up with no apparent memory. As the human host of Gridman, he fulfills the role of an action hero. That is, he fights the Kaiju (the main monsters in the show) and protects the innocent. You could say he is the show’s friendly neighborhood Spiderman type of guy who swings into action when trouble knocks at doors. Thankfully, he gets assistance not just from Gridman but also from his friends. These the Gridman Alliance such as Shou, Rikka, and members of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students. The show reveals more about their roles as Yuta develops an alliance between them. However, the elephant in the room should be addressed. Why should you care about a story that resembles something done over a decade ago?As I mentioned before, most anime fans tends to favor genres that they’ve really experienced with. SSSS.Gridman blends a variety that’s draws the line of science fiction, mecha, and super hero. The plot isn’t hard to understand but may take some take to get attached to. Mainly, some of the first half resembles more of the Monster of the Week format where a hero fights against an enemy, defeats it, and saves the day. But don’t worry, the show does get more complex later on that deals with their world and Akane herself. I’m not going to throw spoilers as the show gets fairly dark as every episode progresses. Maybe that’s even an understatement because right from the start, this show had an unsettling mood. I’ll make this crystal clear now. Characters that die doesn’t just result in death but disappear completely. Erased from seemingly existing. If that doesn’t instill a sense of fear, then I don’t know what does.Beyond the dark story, we’re also treated with character relationships that play some key emphasis on the show altogether. Akane, Yuta, and Rikka stars as the main characters and they connect on a level that is fairly important. By understanding each other, they establish character connection that the viewers can get invested in. This is especially true to learn about character motivations such as Rikka’s desire to be a hero despite wanting to live a normal life. Or in the opposite case, Rikka’s resentment and desire for revenge for those who wronged her. Indeed, Rikka is a complex character, perhaps one of the hardest to accept but also incredibly enticing to watch for her unpredictable role. Her character expressions often hides her façade like a monster would. It’s as if she’s always wearing a mask as a beautiful creature on the outside and a harbinger of death on the inside.With 12 episodes, some questions popped to my head made me wonder if it’s really enough. Despite the show having a more serious storytelling, it still retains lighthearted moments and humor. Not to mention, we also got an obligatory beach episode to service the fans and one other particular episode to showcase Kajiu’s human-like behaviors. Viewers will also likely to poke fun at some of the character interactions and behaviors such as Akane’s hikikomori-like lifestyle. I think what the producers were aiming for is resurrecting this franchise as a way to pay homage to the original series while crafting its own story. It definitely succeeds at that when committing to its genres without stepping out of its comfort zone.Among the many elements of the show, one that’s impossible to evade is the style of its artwork. Studio Trigger has been known to make some extravagant cinematography with its battle contents. Here, SSSS.Gridman succeeds in similar ways. The action is over the top like how a tokusatsu show should be. From the first few episodes, it manages to showcase just how dangerous the Kajiu are and what they can do. Gridman himself has abilities that can neutralize monsters such as energy lasers and is incredibly durable as a fighting Hyper Agent. Make no mistake though. The monsters themselves are formidable ranging from the debut of Ghoulghalias to the deadly Devadadan. Each of them are decorated with impressive fighting capabilities and poses a threat to humanity. Similar to Godzilla in size, it’s nightmares coming to life in their world. The CGI was easy to get accompanied to and adds a colorful style to the overall character designs. Oh and before I forgot to mention, Rikka has some really meaty legs.I should say while SSSS.Gridman is more suitable for the Japanese audience, it can hit home for newer fans too. Prior to watching this show, I had little experience with tokusatsu related shows outside of Ultraman. Hell, Ultraman was an iconic franchise but that hasn’t been resurrected as a full anime show in a long time (2019 does have one though). Outside of Asia, tokusatsu had limited popularity so perhaps SSSS.Gridman could raise the bar. Funimation dubbed the series for the Western audience we may see more coming ahead. from their lineup.

Interestingly enough, those who hate it all have similar criticisms, mainly the premise is unoriginal, the title is stupid, the action just rips off Ultraman, etc. To such comments I would say: do your homework and maybe you’ll learn something. The source material (because yes, this is based on something) was a sentai show from the height of the tokusatsu era. And let’s face it, every sentai show has at least 87% Ultraman-inspired content. It just goes with the territory.Regarding the story however, Trigger has decided to move away from the typical...Power Ranger-esque scenarios and inject more characterization and atypical pacing into the anime. This, I think is a good thing. The original Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad (yes it is a dumb name, and yes it is misspelled for the sake of alliteration. Blame DIC Entertainment, who brought Gridman to the US market for that.) was probably even less popular in the US than contemporary shows like Beetleborgs. So switching up the story for the anime gives opportunity to rise above mediocre sentai action to something with actual substance. The show mixes the expected kaiju fights with slice-of-life scenes along with unexplained plot points yet to be revealed. Is there a *reason* everyone in the town seems somewhat bland and full of ennui? Is there more to the town then appears at first glance? And WTF is with the insanely immense ever-present daikaiju that everyone just kinda ignores? Only story development and plot progression will tell. =)And the characters themselves play a large role in that development as they themselves progress in their relationships and understanding of the world around them. And character development involves realistic situations in slice-of-life environments, not the continual amped-up, hyper, in your face action of a typical shonen anime. Heck, there’s more fight scenes in MHA, but the cast doesn’t run around in rage mode all the time (except Bakugo, but he’s... unique).The animation is decent, granted not Trigger’s best, but sufficient for conveying the jagged atmosphere of a robot-versus-giant-monster scenario. And the music, while sparse, matches the understated feel of the characters well.So, it’s a mecha/kaiju anime with a different slant that pays homage to its roots. It’s not Gundam, it’s not Code Geass, heck, it’s not even the original Gridman. There’s plenty of shows out there like those but there’s not many anime that feel like SSSS.Gridman.

There is a lot which surprised me and there was a lot of lost potential. This anime was not good and not bad, but very likableArt:First thing that putt me off was the CG. It felt sluggish and painful to watch as i\'m not a fan of bad CG. But in the end it got better and better, so I forgive the first few episodes. The world itself and the monster design are not something to get hyped...about and are simply lacking something to make it interesting. The details and the cameo\'s in this show was what did hype meSound:Grue Elise von Mir plays in the background, so that was more than enough. Jk what i missed in this was a badass music track what Trigger always has to hype up the action. The sound effects were okay. The overall sounds impression was average.The positive: the voice acting of most of the cast was fabulous. Rikka sounds just as soft as her thighs, Akane was a perfect oppai loli. As for the rest of the cast i think they could have more emotionCharacters and Story:Well the story on itself wouldn\'t be worth an 8, and the cast neither, so it was really a mix between good plot and good cast. While Trigger gives its own spin to the story and cast, the first few battles feels a lot like Ultra man. Simply beating up bad guys. But as the story and fighting choreography progresses, there are some shocking twists.Yuuta, a bit generic, but not to cheesy. Has to balls actually try and get a girl, but doesn\'t push trough. Not much of a mcShou, Yuuta\'s friend but not much of a character either. While he feels much more ""weeb"", his presence is just to balance out the party.Rikka, the only right character there is. Thicc thighs, a dreamy voice and a lovely character. While she isn\'t the one who actually does the action, her dialogues and thoughts show a bit how the world is built up.Akane, an oppai lolli with marvelous acting talent. Self conflicted she has to find out the trough by herself with hardship.As you can see the characters themselves are not super interesting, the interactions and the follow up on actions is what was intriguing. The way it played out because they held back information or just spouted it out was what made it enjoyable to figure out and watch. The fights advance in the very end just like the character Anti slowly evolves.Enjoyment:Somehow i think this anime was enjoyable and it left me with a good feeling. There are a lot of loose ends and plot holes, but that was actually never the focus of the story. The little cameo\'s in this anime showed that Trigger still cares and loves its old work.

He is your everyday high-schooler with nothing that stands out about him. You could replace him with any generic main character from any anime and it won\'t change a thing.The main girl ""Rikka"" comes off as bored, uninterested and fed-up, all the time. She is sighing constantly and has no expressions.May be she is supposed to reflect the audience response while watching this anime.Only good thing about her is her character design, which is pretty good.MC has a generic supportive sidekick. But he is only there to be...friend-zoned and not threaten the MC\'s chances with the girl.Rest of supporting cast is also pretty ordinary.Story 2/10:A giant robot shows up and wrecks the city. MC fights the enemy with his own robot. MC wins. Next day everything resets to normal.Rinse. RepeatSound 6/10Art 7/10:It is good. Most of the attention has been given to character of ""Rikka"" to make her look good. Too bad her personality is as interesting as a wet blanket.Animation 4/10:Animation is often choppy. Feels like they are trying to use less frames per second to save money.Enjoyment 3/10:If you have watched more than a few good anime, you won\'t find it particularly enjoyable.Unless Mecha anime is your guilty pleasure.Most People who like this anime have 1 reason only. That is the design of character ""Rikka"". She has become somewhat of a meme for her ""THICC THIGHS"". (Although I disagree that her thighs could be classified as thicc. But that\'s besides the point)It would have been better if the creators made an Ecchi anime or a Hentai. Atleast, that would have distracted from the weak story and bland characters.EDIT: The main problem with character of Rikka seems to be her Japanese Voice actress. This problem is less pronounced in Eng Dub.TLDR:A red-haired guy fights a giant robot while his sidekick friend and a girl with thicc thighs watch him on a screen.**The girl sighs, puts her finger in her right ear and rotates it back and forth.

As I was watching Guriddoman I felt a sense of emptiness in the show and I started wondering about what others thought about this show. So I thought I would write my honest review of this show.Story: The story revolves around this yung redhead lad who has amnesia. This dude goes on trip and talks to a computer and they fight together against Godzillas. This is simplified episode synopsis for the initial 5 episodes. This made it feel like I was watching some pokemon episodes where main characters are doing their thing...until obnoxious antagonist arrives and the protagonist defeats em. It felt like watching same episode over and over again. What was able to keep me watching was big bob the builder (referring to boobs) girl and the dark gurren lagann looking thing. The plot never had anything else interesting in it to keep me hooked for the first 4 episodes. In general Gridman felt like I was watching some lame ass mecha PG-7 anime for children(minus the parts where Akane ordered to kill someone).Characters: We have a MC with amnesia. This is a good start since it fucking destroys his whole personality(not like there was any in the beginning because of amnesia). We have MC's friend who doesn't neither show almost any personality aside from drooling for Akane (big bob girl). Main heroine is a tsundere bait that in reality just doesn't give a fuck. She doesn't show much of emotions aside from time to time some cute behavior so that she doesn't seem like to be just dead inside (She also learns to smile towards the end). Then we have team Gridman support group. This consist some forgettable characters and their only reason is to be Gridman's augementations. So the cast is Optimus Prime's sonic wing and super mode (Transformers: Cybertron), Gurren Lagann drill mode and sword mode (couldn't think any reference but sword is pretty generic). Not too original. To me only interesting characters are the antagonists Akane and Alexis echo. Akane's motives are lacking so Alexis is probably controlling her for it's own purpose.Art and Animation: I won't tackle on this too hard but the fighting animations are orgasmic and on par with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. High Quality CG.Sounds: Musics are good too but nothing ground breaking.Enjoyment and conclusion: I cant really enjoy anything in this show exceptfor animation and sounds. It's just overall a mediocre mecha anime in my opinion.  Be sure to give me some (constructive) criticism if you feel like it, I would really appreciate it. until obnoxious antagonist arrives and the protagonist defeats em.

It's just overall a mediocre mecha anime in my opinion.  Be sure to give me some (constructive) criticism if you feel like it, I would really appreciate it."", '(There will be spoilers in this review.)Art and Animation: For me personally, the word mediocre perfectly encapsulates it. I see people heaping a lot of praise on the CG of the Gridman, but being slightly better that your contemporaries, in this department, hardly warrants all the commendation. 2D animation can be summed up by the word decent.Sound: I think this section is highly subjective. I didn\'t like nor the OP nor the ED, and can\'t remember a single piece of background music, but that doesn\'t mean you won\'t like any of the music in Gridman aswell, you\'ll just have to listen to it and find...out for yourself.Story: It\'s sort of there, but at the same time it\'s not. Essentially, pretty much every episode follows an extremely simplistic formula of ""Have 15 minutes of inane chit-chat in a high-school-esque setting, then be alerted to the presence of a new Kaiju and have a 5-minute long one-sided fight"", and that\'s about it. I will elaborate on what final episodes bring us a bit later.Characters:Yuuta: He\'s not a character, he\'s merely a vessel for Gridman. The fact that he\'s an amnesiac is also very convenient cause that just takes off some work from the scriptwriter, as the typical amnesic character is defined solely by that trait and, therefore, doesn\'t require any personality at all.Utsumi: By his own admission in the last episode, a completely useless character that serve barely any purpose and is defined by a single trait of being a Kaiju fanatic.Rikka: At first she seems somewhat interesting, as she\'s protrayed as an apathetic person that sighs every 10 seconds and hardly seems interested in anything, but later evolves (devolves?) into your typical ""friendship is paramount and is above all else"" character.Akane: I will cover her more in-depth down the line.Hyper Agents: They\'re so cookie-cutter you can guess their personalities from their design. It seems like their reason d\'etre is to simply provide upgrades for the primary Gridman unit so he can show a new attack in an episode. They claim they have a purpose and are here to deal with Alexis, but strangely enough spent 85% of their time lounging in Rikka\'s shop, doing absolutely nothing.Rikka\'s mom: She\'s there. She mostly just cheers the main cast from the sideline, even though she appears to be bewildered by everything that\'s going on.Rikka\'s classmates: They\'re also there.Anti: A very moody young man who is defined by a single trait of wanting to destroy Gridman, as that his reason for existance. He later undergoes a character development after standing for 30 seconds in the rain and listening to Akane, after which he decides he\'s a good guy now.Alexis: He\'s an evil man that\'s evil, he takes pleasure in depraved acts of destruction and suffering of the people. Your typical Trigger antagonist.Ending analysis: My take on the ending is that Akane is actually a real-life person, that appears to be bullied at school, probably because she\'s geeky and nerdy, due to her affection for Kaiju and Gundams, so when she comes home she, probably, writes a story (aka the actual Gridman show we see), and that\'s her method of releasing her frustration and coping with the stress (as she destroys things, then fixes them right back, and also removes umpleasant characters).What supports this theory is that characters in the show recognize her as a god, just like writer is technically a god to the characters he created. The symbolism in Gridman and Alexis, is that Alexis is the evil within Akane, due to all the bullying, and Gridman is that proverbial remaining light of hope, which fixes everything by the end (he does this quite literally with his Fixer Beam). Rikka is just a perfect friend that Akane wishes she had in a real world. Utsumi low-key looks like a love interest Akane would\'ve liked, as he\'s a giant Kaiju geek and all. The final frames are also that of real world, shot with an actual camera, and we can see Rikka\'s gift to Akane on the table, which further confirms my idea.All said and done, by no means do I think this is correct, or anything plausible to begin with, but who knows. Seems a little too deep for a show that essential a one giant homegae to a lot of different titles.Overall: A typical Trigger fair, style and action over subtelty and substance. I personally cannot recommend it, even if it had some interesting moments and, perhaps, even some meaningful and intersting concept that ended up being butchered.I think the original Gridman, with it\'s abundance of pyrothecnical effects and models of cities being crushed by actors wearing monster suits, is a vastly superior experience. But if that\'s (understandably) might not be your cup of tea, and you would rather watch some mecha anime, then I would recommend you Shin Getter Robo Armageddon, Gundam franchise (Zeta and 0083, specifically, are quite good) and even TTGL, even though I\'m not a fan of it. out for yourself.Story: It\'s sort of there, but at the same time it\'s not. Essentially, pretty much every episode follows an extremely simplistic formula of ""Have 15 minutes of inane chit-chat in a high-school-esque setting, then be alerted to the presence of a new Kaiju and have a 5-minute long one-sided fight"", and that\'s about it. I will elaborate on what final episodes bring us a bit later.Characters:Yuuta: He\'s not a character, he\'s merely a vessel for Gridman. The fact that he\'s an amnesiac is also very convenient cause that just takes off some work from the scriptwriter, as the typical amnesic character is defined solely by that trait and, therefore, doesn\'t require any personality at all.Utsumi: By his own admission in the last episode, a completely useless character that serve barely any purpose and is defined by a single trait of being a Kaiju fanatic.Rikka: At first she seems somewhat interesting, as she\'s protrayed as an apathetic person that sighs every 10 seconds and hardly seems interested in anything, but later evolves (devolves?) into your typical ""friendship is paramount and is above all else"" character.Akane: I will cover her more in-depth down the line.Hyper Agents: They\'re so cookie-cutter you can guess their personalities from their design. It seems like their reason d\'etre is to simply provide upgrades for the primary Gridman unit so he can show a new attack in an episode. They claim they have a purpose and are here to deal with Alexis, but strangely enough spent 85% of their time lounging in Rikka\'s shop, doing absolutely nothing.Rikka\'s mom: She\'s there. She mostly just cheers the main cast from the sideline, even though she appears to be bewildered by everything that\'s going on.Rikka\'s classmates: They\'re also there.Anti: A very moody young man who is defined by a single trait of wanting to destroy Gridman, as that his reason for existance.

I could appreciate how similar it is to the old tokusatsu shows but that didn\'t impress me. So after 5 or so episodes, I was ready to write it off as just a passion project that would only appeal to a small group of people.Boy was I wrong.After the first few episodes gridman really starts to come into its own and stops being just a passion project and...starts to be a piece of media worth celebrating. A lot of people have considered gridman to almost be a stain in triggers catalogue. But in my opinion, this is the close thing to a gainax anime the trigger has made.But after episode 6 we finally get some answers and gridman finally comes into its own as a story. At this point, it\'s clear that Akane isn\'t all that she seems, how she is constantly craving attention and how she kills someone she mildly dislikes. But now we find out why.Akane is god.but after Yuuta start defeating her kaiju Akane\'s fantasy starts to crumble. Akane no longer has control. She is no longer all-powerful and can\'t do anything about it. So she creates anti. But even anti starts to become more human and defies Akane\'s control. There is a line in episode seven that is ""if you can\'t find your own identity, then it is impossible to describe who you are as a person"" (and as it says person it immediately cuts to Akane) which in my opinion perfectly sums up her character. She has not found an identity and instead is just using her power as a god to make everything work out for her. Because of the way she abuses her power as a god she is lonely. She has never worked on herself and instead uses kaiju to constantly fix all of her problems. She is running away from real life which brings me to the second main theme of gridman. Escapism.Effectively criticising escapism in anime is hard as anime tends to be an escapist fantasy. Gridman is no different having its first few episodes being a light-hearted tokusatsu show that seems to be aimed at people who are nostalgic for those old tokusatsu shows. But gridman takes a different approach and doesn\'t just state that escapism is bad but instead shows us someone who has the power to live in their own fantasy and not be troubled by the day-to-day problems of real-life and it shows us how lonely and depressed Akane is because she can\'t meaningfully connect to anyone because she is a god. People only like her because she made them that way so while Akana is living her fantasies she is truly alone.Utsumi also used to show the issues with escapism and living a fantasy. Utsumi is living the dream. He gets to see his gridman fighting kaiju and he loves it. But when the rug gets pulled out from underneath him and some actually gets hurt, his best friend Yuta. And then when everyone takes a proactive role in stopping the kaiju assault he can\'t do anything. He just sits next to an unconscious Yuta. And just reflects on how his dream harms others and how living this escapist fantasy of constantly fighting kaiju is going to eventually cause something horrible to happen.And while we are on the topic of fantasies it\'s important to mention episode 9 because it is one of the best episodes of the series and it encompasses this whole theme of dreams. This episode shows the characters in their dreams where everything is perfect for them and Akane. But there is an uncanny feeling that something is wrong. This atmosphere is made by having a distinct lack of background music and then piercing this silence pulling you out of this dream-like atmosphere. In all of these sequences, there is a constant feeling that the characters have that something is off, and while this is perfect they need to wake up and face reality. In Yuta\'s dream, Akane states that ""if you\'re having fun then what\'s the matter"" in response to Yuta questioning why something feels wrong and she also says ""wouldn\'t you rather dream forever?"" which shows the key difference between Akane and the rest of the cast. They chose to wake up. Even though their dreams were perfect they chose to wake up and face reality. While Akane is still dreaming.In the final scene when Akane becomes a kaiju Anti comes and rips open her closed-off self and pulls her out of her closed-off kaiju and defeats Alexis. A manifestation of her darkest thoughts. And in the final scene live-action scene, Akane wakes up from her dream and faces the light. Akane finally broke out of her dream and faces reality.A quick note of the visuals of the series. All the characters look extremely distinct and the animation is fluid, visually the show is impressive until you get to the kaiju fights where the CG looks incredibly jarring but it does improve as the series goes on.The last 6 episodes of gridman are great and if I had to rate them separately it would be an 8/10 but the early few episodes are what drags down the series for me.TLDR: While gridman is a simple monster of the week tokusatsu show in the first half it becomes its own show in the second half which make up for it. starts to be a piece of media worth celebrating.

It has lots of similarities to it and tries to be a lot more ambitious at what it’s about. It’s definitely better in terms of themes and presentation, since the creators had the liberty to do a lot more with animation than what the low budget live action could allow them. It’s a shame they didn’t make it fun. And by fun I mean the battles not being exciting. They are fairly...basic in choreography, short, and mostly predictable. Action is the main attraction of these types of shows and Gridman is not particularly good at it. They made the monsters move like people in rubber suits despite being fully CGI, but that is again nothing more than homage and not something that improves the battles.The show also tries to be homage to tokusatsu in general while smiling at the camera, as if it tells you it’s self-aware. For example, any buildings that get destroyed by the monsters are instantly repaired. That is what was supposed to be happening off screen in all tokusatsu. It doesn’t improve the show in any particular way. It makes it more self aware to its silliness but it also ruins the tension and can be very immersion breaking for the same reason.It also tries to double down on the homage and have a meta-commentary on the escapism nature of technology. Despite the buildings getting repaired, the same does not happen for the people who get killed. They stay dead and even disappear from the memories of the living. It sounds very creepy when described that way, but it has little to no impact when nobody seems to be bothered by it. The population of the city is literally seeing giant monsters being frozen in the distance and everyone runs away to save their hides on a daily basis, but life is otherwise exactly the same as it would be if there weren’t monster attacks.The characterization is not much better for the major characters. It’s very bland and even eye-rolling when you have to suspend your disbelief with what they are doing all the time. Yuta for example is a cookie cutter boy scout type of protagonist, suffering from amnesia and the one who has to fight the monsters with no motivation other than to protect his friends. Gah! More generally speaking, male characters are defined by a single trait (usually an emotion or an ideal) while females have the camera constantly ogling all over their feet and thighs.Down to it, Gridman is not a good tokusatsu. You can still appreciate the visual directing, which is stuffed with easter eggs of the previous version, the genre as whole, and even a few shot-by-shot recreations of Neon Genesis scenes. It’s all about the meta than the actual in-story experience. And even then, it’s not very successful, since the only thing most people remember from this show is Rikka’s thighs. basic in choreography, short, and mostly predictable.

They\'re all so lifeless, only slightly affected by the possibility of their classmates or teachers disappearing when I can only assume...thousands of people died in the first three episodes. Why does no one care about anything??????Even the battles were terrible because no one can make low budget CG robuts look nice, you need a budget to do that.

For those who are new to Gridman and tokusatsu entertainment, it is the Japanese term attached to any sci-fi/fantasy live-action series that uses an abundance of special effects. More specifically, practical effects; think people wrestling in rubber monster suits smashing through model cities and stop motion animation.That leads us to SSSS.Gridman, the love child of first-time director Akira Amemiya and Keiichi Hasegawa, famed screenwriter of the 1990s Ultraman. It is overflowing with...references and callbacks to the live-action series, SSSS is a lovingly crafted modernized take on the original series. The new story takes a theme relevant to today’s audiences and focuses on the youth of Japan and their relationship to technology.The show opens on Yuta Hibiki, an amnesiac first-year in high school who’s just woken up in the home of Rikka Takarada, a girl in his class. With no clue who she is, or who he is for that matter. His standard introduction no doubt had people rolling their eyes, including me, and it does detract from the story, at least until we learn why he lost his memory. Yuta sees hallucinations of a robot named Gridman in an old computer in Takarada's family store, later called ‘Junk’ in reference to its name in the original show. Afterward, he meets Sho Utsumi, his friend before getting amnesia. Sho helps him with his memory loss, which is more or less his role in the series, being Yuta's support. He's a decent character, with a minor arc and some development. Throughout the first episode, the information we’re being fed by the characters is incongruous with what we observe from Yuta’s perspective. Rikka and Utsumi easily accept Yuta’s amnesia and when he sees Kaiju looming in the distance they assume he’s joking because—like his Gridman hallucinations—he is the only one who can see them at first. In spite of the mundane reactions of people around Yuta, the directing of nearly every scene communicates dread. It constantly feels like danger is just off the frame and the next scene will change everything.Amemiya lingers on long shots too long for them to feel normal, instead, they communicate anxiety, you constantly are waiting for something to happen that will break the mundanity. Lighting is oversaturated during the daytimes to convey the crushing heat of the summer, and at night is subdued with fog and the monsters are constantly shown looming in the distance over the heroes. In the first episode, a radio playing is placed in between scenes to shift the tone. It bears so much similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion. It’s no surprise considering the director is a Gainax veteran. No doubt, SSSS.Gridman's greatest strength is the tone, it balances the mundane life of high school students with the dread of a Kaiju attack. Eventually, when the Kaiju do attack, it is equally satisfying to watch play out. The three main characters are together in Rikka’s family store when the first Kaiju begins wreaking havoc on the city, forcing Yuta to work with Gridman fight off the monsters in giant robot form. Together they create the Gridman Alliance, dedicated to defeating any Kaiju that threatens to destroy their city.The animation is fluid, characters are incredibly expressive, storyboards are filled with detail, shots are excellently framed. The camera work is dynamic making the action always exciting and even the CGI used during many of the fight scenes is superb. The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike. From time to time the show's incredible opening is used as background music in fights, and this would typically grow tiresome but because the song is so good and relevant to the story it never bothered me. At times the monster's movements look janky, but it never feels unintentional, watching old tokusatsu series shows that this is how the monster/giant robot fights looked, they move in ways that make it seem as though someone is inside a suit navigating them. 2D animation could never have achieved the authenticity of the monsters they were aiming for here. Not every scene is exploding with action, but even when the pace slows down, the directing and intruiging storyboarding are still visually arresting. One qualm I would bring up is the overabundance of fanservice placed at awkward moments, this thankfully only happened in certain episodes around the midpoint of the show. All around, this show is incredibly faithful to the original series, visually, audibly, and narratively.The story is at times too standard to the genre and could have used more originality rather than reliance on the source material. It delivers it's story beats confidently and plenty self-aware of the nostalgia it's evoking, but the times it updates the script to a modern audience are worthwhile. Important information is shown to us rather than told, a characters motivation is never told to us before it is shown, a twist never comes that wasn’t foreshadowed heavily. This showing rather than telling comes across the most in Akane Shinjou's scenes, a classmate of Yuta’s. She offers the most exciting writing in the show. In the first episode alone, her scenes convey more fear than any of the Kaiju scenes. She’s subtle with her dark side and when she gets her quiet moments of angry reflection you get to see how bitter she is. Her psychotic tendencies and lack of care for others are made all the more frightening by how much power she proves to have.Although Yuta's simplistic personality is explained very well in the narrative, Rikka and Akane get far more development than him. Eventually, they even take his place as the protagonists, and the show is much better for it. Rikka gets more development than Yuta and becomes a remarkably sympathetic character right away. While Yuta and Utsumi celebrate their victories against Kaiju she worries about the fallout of the city being attacked and if her friends are safe. She's the most nuanced character in the show, and it often feels like she is a normal person who was placed into the plot of a wild sci-fi kids show. Her apprehension towards conflict and her contemplation of the effects of what's occurring in the story are what makes her so believable. Yuta and Utsumi are at first, ecstatic to escape the mundane life of being a student, then the shock of the danger they’re in forces them to face reality and change their mindsets. Whereas Yuta accepts he has to overcome challenges at face value and follows through like a typical protagonist, Rikka is constantly questioning why she’s in such a dire situation and where her place is in all of it. Her development throughout the show is intertwined with Akane's and they both change in ways that are very engaging to watch play out.The themes of Gridman are showcased throughout the story in the elaborate technology the villain has, all alone in her room, contrasted with the beat-up old computer the Gridman Alliance use. Yet even with basic technology, they prove to be formidable foes to the Kaiju, and they enjoy working together. What the screenwriter is trying to say is rather basic, but it’s nonetheless a well-reinforced theme and consistent throughout the show, you don’t need an abundance of technology to have good relationships and valued friendships.SSSS.Gridman stands as one of the best mecha in recent memory. Stylistically it is much different than the rest of Studio Trigger's anime, but it is one of their greatest works yet. It wears its love for the original series and tokusatsu entertainment on its sleeve. The story is wonderfully nostalgic, and surprisingly enough, thought-provoking. Laden with subtle details building up to every twist, every theme, it is both visually interesting and endlessly analyzable. I look forward to rewatching it time and time again in the future. references and callbacks to the live-action series, SSSS is a lovingly crafted modernized take on the original series. The new story takes a theme relevant to today’s audiences and focuses on the youth of Japan and their relationship to technology.The show opens on Yuta Hibiki, an amnesiac first-year in high school who’s just woken up in the home of Rikka Takarada, a girl in his class. With no clue who she is, or who he is for that matter. His standard introduction no doubt had people rolling their eyes, including me, and it does detract from the story, at least until we learn why he lost his memory. Yuta sees hallucinations of a robot named Gridman in an old computer in Takarada's family store, later called ‘Junk’ in reference to its name in the original show. Afterward, he meets Sho Utsumi, his friend before getting amnesia. Sho helps him with his memory loss, which is more or less his role in the series, being Yuta's support. He's a decent character, with a minor arc and some development. Throughout the first episode, the information we’re being fed by the characters is incongruous with what we observe from Yuta’s perspective. Rikka and Utsumi easily accept Yuta’s amnesia and when he sees Kaiju looming in the distance they assume he’s joking because—like his Gridman hallucinations—he is the only one who can see them at first. In spite of the mundane reactions of people around Yuta, the directing of nearly every scene communicates dread. It constantly feels like danger is just off the frame and the next scene will change everything.Amemiya lingers on long shots too long for them to feel normal, instead, they communicate anxiety, you constantly are waiting for something to happen that will break the mundanity. Lighting is oversaturated during the daytimes to convey the crushing heat of the summer, and at night is subdued with fog and the monsters are constantly shown looming in the distance over the heroes. In the first episode, a radio playing is placed in between scenes to shift the tone. It bears so much similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion. It’s no surprise considering the director is a Gainax veteran. No doubt, SSSS.Gridman's greatest strength is the tone, it balances the mundane life of high school students with the dread of a Kaiju attack. Eventually, when the Kaiju do attack, it is equally satisfying to watch play out. The three main characters are together in Rikka’s family store when the first Kaiju begins wreaking havoc on the city, forcing Yuta to work with Gridman fight off the monsters in giant robot form. Together they create the Gridman Alliance, dedicated to defeating any Kaiju that threatens to destroy their city.The animation is fluid, characters are incredibly expressive, storyboards are filled with detail, shots are excellently framed. The camera work is dynamic making the action always exciting and even the CGI used during many of the fight scenes is superb. The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike. From time to time the show's incredible opening is used as background music in fights, and this would typically grow tiresome but because the song is so good and relevant to the story it never bothered me. At times the monster's movements look janky, but it never feels unintentional, watching old tokusatsu series shows that this is how the monster/giant robot fights looked, they move in ways that make it seem as though someone is inside a suit navigating them. 2D animation could never have achieved the authenticity of the monsters they were aiming for here. Not every scene is exploding with action, but even when the pace slows down, the directing and intruiging storyboarding are still visually arresting. One qualm I would bring up is the overabundance of fanservice placed at awkward moments, this thankfully only happened in certain episodes around the midpoint of the show. All around, this show is incredibly faithful to the original series, visually, audibly, and narratively.The story is at times too standard to the genre and could have used more originality rather than reliance on the source material. It delivers it's story beats confidently and plenty self-aware of the nostalgia it's evoking, but the times it updates the script to a modern audience are worthwhile. Important information is shown to us rather than told, a characters motivation is never told to us before it is shown, a twist never comes that wasn’t foreshadowed heavily. This showing rather than telling comes across the most in Akane Shinjou's scenes, a classmate of Yuta’s. She offers the most exciting writing in the show. In the first episode alone, her scenes convey more fear than any of the Kaiju scenes. She’s subtle with her dark side and when she gets her quiet moments of angry reflection you get to see how bitter she is. Her psychotic tendencies and lack of care for others are made all the more frightening by how much power she proves to have.Although Yuta's simplistic personality is explained very well in the narrative, Rikka and Akane get far more development than him. Eventually, they even take his place as the protagonists, and the show is much better for it. Rikka gets more development than Yuta and becomes a remarkably sympathetic character right away. While Yuta and Utsumi celebrate their victories against Kaiju she worries about the fallout of the city being attacked and if her friends are safe. She's the most nuanced character in the show, and it often feels like she is a normal person who was placed into the plot of a wild sci-fi kids show. Her apprehension towards conflict and her contemplation of the effects of what's occurring in the story are what makes her so believable. Yuta and Utsumi are at first, ecstatic to escape the mundane life of being a student, then the shock of the danger they’re in forces them to face reality and change their mindsets. Whereas Yuta accepts he has to overcome challenges at face value and follows through like a typical protagonist, Rikka is constantly questioning why she’s in such a dire situation and where her place is in all of it. Her development throughout the show is intertwined with Akane's and they both change in ways that are very engaging to watch play out.The themes of Gridman are showcased throughout the story in the elaborate technology the villain has, all alone in her room, contrasted with the beat-up old computer the Gridman Alliance use. Yet even with basic technology, they prove to be formidable foes to the Kaiju, and they enjoy working together. What the screenwriter is trying to say is rather basic, but it’s nonetheless a well-reinforced theme and consistent throughout the show, you don’t need an abundance of technology to have good relationships and valued friendships.SSSS.Gridman stands as one of the best mecha in recent memory.

I look forward to rewatching it time and time again in the future."", ""SSSS Gridman is a pastiche of Tokusatsu media, transformers, and landmark mecha anime; framed in the skin of a reboot of a moderately successful live action Tokusatsu show. It's also an anime that excels in direction, shot composition and in the use of motifs. To the unassuming viewer, it's just another show that references other popular shows. But in the little details does it express it's own unique offerings, eventually surfacing in bombastic moments of action and character expression, often with brutal consequences. But it's biggest achievement is possibly questioning the very act of being in love with the media that is adores. Lets be...clear, this is a show tailor made for the people who love the things the creators of this show adores and isn't for everyone.The titular Gridman is a hero of all that is well and good. However this is not his story, rather it is the story of the villain. A rarity in the genre. But more on that later.First off on the technical side, Gridman excels at the use of clever shot composition and motif. Even unassuming scenes convey the state of minds of the characters that are a part of it. And in certain cases it cleverly hints towards the resolutions of the mysteries that the show presents at the beginning. Everything from the lyrics of it's opening, to the walk cycle of the kaiju Gridman fights against to every reference to other pop cultural works have a dual purpose. Speaking of those Kaiju fights, many of them are animated to imitate the way live action tokusatsu Kaiju move. This takes a bit of time to get used to, apparently both for the people who worked on it and the viewers as this aspect becomes even better integrated later on. The character designs are simple, iconic and tailored for both free flowing animation as well as powerful still shots. The soundtrack is muted for the most part but at points explodes but never forgets to become spine chilling when necessary. The voice acting goes for a more naturalistic tone, which once again feels out of place in a mecha anime, where over the top voice work is the norm. But this helps ground the characters are more vulnerably instead of powerful and heroic.As a whole SSSS Gridman attempts to tell a story of how belief in the idea of heroism is important for a healthy mind. Characters in the series are rarely spared from trauma. But they are forced to live with it and accept it for what it is. Not everyone will be able to attain what they desire, regardless of how badly they want it and even in cases where much is sacrificed.Now for the main meat of SSSS Gridman, it's narrative or rather it's meta-narrative. It's rather difficult to explain without discussing spoilers so you have been warned.The world of Gridman is not reality. It's a fictional world created as a coping mechanism by the “villain”. However in spite of having utter control over reality that said character does not find solace. SSSS Gridman preaches that there is no happiness to be found in enclosing oneself in escapist thoughts. When minds are enclosed, our own thoughts start to betray us. Rather happiness it is a result of acceptance of reality. Escapist media exists as a powerful relief drug. But as always an over-reliance of such is harmful. Self harm is what draws in evil. And Gridman, the symbol of heroism, exists to drive it out by mending one's soul. Just as works of fiction acts as a brief moment of respite in our everyday life. clear, this is a show tailor made for the people who love the things the creators of this show adores and isn't for everyone.The titular Gridman is a hero of all that is well and good.

Kaijus are a mainstay in popular culture due to their massive size and their ability to level entire cities with their overwhelming strength. They are pop culture icons with monsters like Godzilla being easily recognisable. But you know what also is associated with Japan? Giant robots. With series like Ultraman or mecha series like Gundam helping to strengthen that idea, it is no wonder we have had robot vs Kaiju shows and movies before. Even today, shows like this one are still being made. With Trigger at the helm of this...anime as well as being a homage to older kaiju movies like the Godzilla and the Ultraman series, it made for some interesting results.Sit back, relax, put on a rubber costume and roar as loud as you can as I present to you the anime review for SSSS.Gridman. Lets begin.Story: 6.5/10Set in modern day Japan, the story follows Yuuta Hibiki who wakes up in Rikka Takarada\'s (a fellow classman) house while also suffering from amnesia. He is then shocked to see massive Kaiju just standing in the distance with the city covered by a massive fog and for some reason, aw well as a human looking robot in a very old computer. The next day, the city is attacked by a Kaiju and with the help of the robot in the computer who calls himself Gridman and the help of his classmates Rikka and Shou Utsumi, they managed to defeat the Kaiju. From there ""The Gridman Alliance"" is formed and vows to stop every Kaiju from destroying the city and find out where they come from.Predictably, the structure for the story is very much a monster of a week type setup. Every episode, they encounter a new Kaiju, smack it around a bit, then get smacked around themselves, only to find a new power and defeat the Kaiju. Meanwhile, the plot is more developed and more is unveiled as they slowly learn the point to all of these Kaiju attacks and why there are massive Kaiju just standing there in the distance. While the plot starts out slow as it is establishing its characters, it starts to pick up and get real interesting, real fast. This is supported by the significance of the characters in the story and some nice curveballs to keep the viewer hooked.It is pretty standard affair because I would say it doesn\'t do anything unique or does anything to make itself unique. But it does things that we have seen before pretty well. The fact we get the villains\' perspective early on as well help see both sides and what these characters are essentially fighting for and what they desire. However, it does have a plot dump halfway through the show as to why the things are the way they are. So instead of finding these things out naturally, we essentially just get and exposition dump just so we can move the plot forward. Yeah, that\'s not good storytelling. If we were told these things in small handfuls, then that\'s fine, but to tell it all at once leaves the story in a state of mind of ""where to go now?"" Thankfully, it does know where to go next with a greater perspective on the villain and how the villain feels about everything that is happening around his/her perspective.Characters: 7.5/10Yuuta is the bog standard protagonist of the show and along with Gridman, is the character that fights the Kaijus. His amnesia allows him to basically make him a blank slate for the story to help develop his character (even if it is a bit cliched). Just like a standard protagonist, he\'s naive, too kind for his own good and just wants to help people. He doesn\'t really have qualities that make him stand out but doesn\'t do things that make me groan in annoyance. He\'s just there to be the main protagonist.Shou acts as the comic relief character and is pretty much the enthusiastic one due to his love for Kaijus. Honestly he doesn\'t have too much relevance to the plot and acts as more as a right hand man for Yuuta to lift his spirit and to motivate him. But it is something that develops later on in the show so you could say it was intentional. But instead lets talk about best girl Rikka as she has some of the best character scenes in the anime and some of the best thighs in anime history due to them being EXTRA THICC. But seriously, she has some interesting development as she doesn\'t know if everything they are doing is right due to her friendship with the show\'s villain. She also acts as the middleman when she needs to get some sense into Yutta and Shou or to support them. She slowly becomes a character that stands thighs first above the cast of the show due to her being somewhat relateable. In fact, the show does a nice job of treating these three like actual high school teenagers and not a veteran defence force in stopping Kaijus. It\'s some nice realism that these are characters that would act like this in real life.My favourite character in this show though is the shows main villain named Akane Shinjou. She is another character with some delicious thighs as well. But other than that obvious statement, her character arc throughout the show takes some twists and turns as she sees her world slowly crumble around her thanks to Gridman. Being the one that creates the Kaijus along with her accomplice, Alexis Kerib, in order to shape the city to her liking. She essentially has a god complex as she believes everything is done because she is making everything better. So when The Gridman Alliance appears to defeat the Kaijus she helps create, she doesn\'t know what to do because the everything is not going her way. This makes her fall from grace throughout the show a rather tragic one because she is only doing what she believes is right to make a better place.Anti is the final character I want to talk about. He is one of the created kaijus by Akane and Alexis designed specifically to defeat Gridman. All he wants to do is to defeat Gridman because that is his purpose in life. So throughout the show, we see him get told that there is more to life than fighting Gridman and that he is more than just a Kaiju. The show makes us question how much humanity Anti has and if he can have a change of heart by embracing it. He makes a good rival and foil for Gridman by being somewhat of a sympathetic character and you hope he can have some redemption.Animation: 8.5/10Now this is where things get interesting. Trigger; I will type it again, TRIGGER. The same studio that brought us shows with great animation like Kill La Kill, Little, Witch Academia and Darling in the Franxx uses, in this series, CGI animation...AND IT WORKS. Let me explain. If this show was done using traditional animation, then you wouldn\'t be able to see all the little details put into the fight scenes to make it feel authentic. The entire show is an homage to all of the Kaiju related movies and TV shows that uses props, rubber suits and wires to make the fight scenes feel like two people fighting in rubber costumes in the studio full of paper mahce buildings and toy cars. To the way the Kaijus are designed and how they attack using flailing parts of their rubber suit to how Gridman makes his entrance, making it look like it is all on a green-screen. The attention to detail put into this must be applauded because Tigger has clearly done their homework on this. Traditional animation just wouldn\'t work because of how the Kaijus are designed and how they attack just wouldn\'t feel as authentic.Now for the rest of the animation, it does look good with plenty of colour to make it vibrant and the character designs are unique from one another (even if Rikka\'s mother looks like a character out of flcl). I could go on about Rikka and Akanes\' thighs and how you just want to look at them all day but it would make this review too long so I won\'t dribble on about these ""unique"" features. But I do have a gripe with the animation and that there is still images throughout the show with the characters doing nothing and you just hear background noises or they are just talking. This is especially noticeable in earlier episodes. How bad is it you may ask. Well I would say it is Evangelion bad but just lasts a little bit shorter.Sound: 8/10The Soundtrack can also be considered an homage to shows like Ultraman with its rather cheesy power up moments, its fast beat music in fight scenes, and the fact that the main theme of the show plays whenever Gridman is close to victory. So not only do the fight scenes and designs are authentic, the music is also trying to be authentic by playing the right music at the right time. Sound effects as well help with explosions, sound of collision between Gridman and the Kaijus and how the Kaijus roar also help add to the authenticity.The opening ""UNION"" by OxT is made to be more like an opening that you would see in a Saturday morning show with simple zoom ups of the characters and their personalities somewhat to the catchy lyrics that you could sing along to. While it still has some action to get hooked to, it\'s main selling point for this opening is to kick back and relax as you sing along to the opening. OxT knows how to make a catchy opening song (just look at the first two Overlord openings) and here, I would say there is no exception. It also updates with slight changes to the scenes to keep up with the plot of the show. It is a nice touch.The ending sequence is used to highlight the two best girls in the show, Rikka and Akane and their friendship. It uses live action backgrounds with the girls being their animated selves. It likes to show the more good side of Akane and how thoughtful and kind Rikka can be. It is just a nice, pleasant ending sequence.Conclusion:SSSS.Gridman is a show that wants to pay homage to old Kaiju shows and films and I would say it does that. The animation and sound do that very well with a story that doesn\'t require alot of thinking and you can just relax while you watch it. Its characters as well are all likeable (well, except the ones you\'re supposed to hate) and never rubbed me the wrong way. The show is a complete package with not one aspect dragging the others down as they all compliment each other. I think this is the kind of show Trigger needed to make after Darling in the Franxx. Something that they can have fun making and have people who can make it enjoyable for the viewer. Girdman does this and I would recommend this to someone looking for some good old robot on Kaiju action.My personal enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall score: 7.8/10  Recommendation: Watch it anime as well as being a homage to older kaiju movies like the Godzilla and the Ultraman series, it made for some interesting results.Sit back, relax, put on a rubber costume and roar as loud as you can as I present to you the anime review for SSSS.Gridman.

Something that they can have fun making and have people who can make it enjoyable for the viewer. Girdman does this and I would recommend this to someone looking for some good old robot on Kaiju action.My personal enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall score: 7.8/10  Recommendation: Watch it', 'Honestly I have no idea what this is, I watched the first two episodes and just thought \'what is going on\'. However it looked like it was gonna be an interesting third episode which, to me, turned out to be just as confusing and annoying. When I was watching it, it felt like the characters didn\'t really have any feeling or any real reaction as to what\'s going on, like when you see a huge monster coming towards you is your first reaction to say ""oh look a monster, it looks so cool"" and then proceed to take pictures of it? Mine isn\'t and i\'m...pretty sure no sane person\'s is. I\'ve watched quite a few animes and this isn\'t the only one i\'ve disliked but this is the only one that i\'ve just sat here for an hour watching it and decided to make a review on how confused it made me.Now i\'m not necessarily here to stop people from watching it, i\'m pretty much just here to see how many people are as confused as me. To me this anime feels like power rangers which i enjoyed as a kid but it\'s just a lot worse. Obviously if you\'re interested in the anime try  it and if you don\'t feel the same as i do then i hope you enjoy it. As i am writing this there are currently eight episodes out i think but i just can\'t think of any reason to force myself to carry on.  It might even get better.It has taken me over half an hour write this because i think this anime has legitimately fried my brain and i am literally either in a state of confusion as to what\'s going on or in a state of shock because of how bad this anime is. pretty sure no sane person\'s is.

Mostly because it is literally  ""mind storming"". What I mean is that the whole story - as I noticed - comes from the old Ultraman story, something my age could not really know.So basically I was lost from the start and ended up half lost. The whole anime remains very mysterious until something like episode 6-7. Then you will slowly but surely get to know every important point to fully understand the plot. Anyway it doesn\'t mean SSSS.Gridman represents a full reflexion show, many parts (not to say, every second half of...each episode) will feature big mecha fights vs Kaijus. Powerful, joyful and explosives as always !The major positive points are surely the intriguing story (even at the end you might feel quite lost), with a really surprising conclusion. Indeed, to sum up my mind : it in fact tells the story of a young normal girl, inventing in her head, her ideal life, in an ideal city with the ideal persons. But contrary to me, you or any human being, she will actually become the God of her dream and will live in her dream, at a so deep point that she can\'t figure out how to live normally, she can\'t turn back.This, is the daily routine of many persons : going to work / school / college, coming back to their home, listening to some music while thinking - no, dreaming - about an ideal life. I was really astonished by the fact they told a sad story without even showing any sad side until the last episode. I should probably watch it again with another eye, able to see more than it could by the past. A really interesting show with a catching (for some viewers, heart-breaking) ending / conclusion.Nevertheless, the fact that I was lost and discovered everything progressively cannot be a full positive point. Indeed, it even was a negative point for me, leading to almost dropping the show. What I would like to explain, is that you won\'t see where the devs wanted to go with their production ; you won\'t be able to get answer unless you decide to act like ""Ok, I don\'t get it but let\'s move forward to learn"".If you dislike mysterious and weird stories, better not starting this show. The fighting moments were good but not extremely impressive. Plus, all the characters are quite undevelopped ; you get to know the major parts for the rest of \'em, yuck... Example : what is the real purpose of Hyper Agent ? What is the Neon Genesis High School ? Where does Akane really go at the end ? What would happen to the city ? Who was the little Kaiju girl we see twice in the show ? Etc etcThe global anime was satisfying to watch - not a masterpiece - but still a great mash up of mechas, fight, waifus (I\'m not into stuff like this, but shit, every one claims Rikka or Akane were best girls) and complexed plot.

Each episode has a different monster, and the hero finds some new way to destroy them. This is probably the generic tokusatsu storyline, and for a modern...remake in anime form, Gridman does this quite well, and adds a few extra plot points in.Art:Now, while the CG may seem \'clunky\' and annoying, remember that the tokusatsu genre had people in bad-quality plastic constumes acting out the monsters and heroes - so the CG in the anime is already a massive upgrade, not to mention the numerous possibilities that it creates (if you did everything in 2D, the art would be quite horrendous and janky).Sound:Not much to say, often comes up with the generic ""opening during battle"" trope which never fails to create goosebumps.Character:The characters are admittedly quite one-dimensional and generic, but considering how the main selling point of the show is the Gridman vs Kaiju battle sequences (much like how tokusatsu was only enjoyable because of the battles), I really couldn\'t care less about the character developments and individual arcs.Enjoyment:If you\'re looking for some deep, profoundly impacting anime, SSSS. Gridman probably isn\'t the one to go with. However, if you\'re simply looking for a quick break from everyday boredom and some superficial fun, Gridman will most likely be one of the more entertaining choices out there. remake in anime form, Gridman does this quite well, and adds a few extra plot points in.Art:Now, while the CG may seem \'clunky\' and annoying, remember that the tokusatsu genre had people in bad-quality plastic constumes acting out the monsters and heroes - so the CG in the anime is already a massive upgrade, not to mention the numerous possibilities that it creates (if you did everything in 2D, the art would be quite horrendous and janky).Sound:Not much to say, often comes up with the generic ""opening during battle"" trope which never fails to create goosebumps.Character:The characters are admittedly quite one-dimensional and generic, but considering how the main selling point of the show is the Gridman vs Kaiju battle sequences (much like how tokusatsu was only enjoyable because of the battles), I really couldn\'t care less about the character developments and individual arcs.Enjoyment:If you\'re looking for some deep, profoundly impacting anime, SSSS.

It pretends to make concessions to those outside that niche through flashiness and fanservice— but this is maybe halfhearted, because it\'s the writing that carries the day, and the writing pointedly does not explain itself to anyone outside its specific niche. That specific niche is people who already love Tsuburaya Productions in general, and Ultraman in specific.The fact the characters themselves are constantly making references to Ultraman that go over a general audience\'s head is your primary warning that this is the case. That this is literally a sequel to a very Ultramanlike-but-not-literally-Ultraman...Tsuburaya Productions show— which only the most hardcore of Ultraman fans are likely to be aware of— is going to be your secondary warning. Fortunately, you don\'t really need to know much about the original Gridman show. However, characters will say things like ""If this were the Ultra series—"", and the show will assume you have some ability to complete that thought on your own.That said, I don\'t want to make this show sound like an utterly impenetrable sequence of in-jokes. Even if it\'s extremely in-jokey, it doesn\'t want ""people who are in on the joke"" to be an exclusive club. If you\'ve watched and enjoyed even a single iteration of Ultraman, everything will be intelligible— the alien antagonist, the bizarre henshin sequence, the light that flashes on Gridman\'s head, the bizarre snaps back to the status quo, and, most importantly, the dry deadpan hilarity of many of the premises of the episodes and how heartwarming the finale manages to be despite that hilarity. I\'ll often take off a point from a show— or even rescind a recommendation— if I think it\'s otherwise excellent at what it\'s trying to do, but what it\'s trying to do is too difficult to understand for most people. This isn\'t that— this show just wants to do something fun and weird with your memories of enjoying tokusatsu shows like Ultraman. However, you need have to have SOME fond memories of tokusatsu shows like Ultraman first, and those aren\'t exactly being handed out for free.SSSS.Gridman understands the absurdity of teenage ennui and escapism. It\'s essentially about putting weird tongue-in-cheek twists on that escapism and warn against its dangers, but without ever really being condescending about it, and without failing to celebrate the positives we also take away from that escapism. It does this by blending the archetypal Ultraman plot with a bizarre, awkward almost slice-of-life alternative to the human cast of an Ultraman story. The cast, as established, feels like they would fit better in almost anything other than a toku tribute. It then alternates between undermining and fulfilling toku expectations in a way that feels fresh and surprising right up until the end, and does it with an odd, dry-but-affectionate wit. The push-pull of undermining and fulfilling is what makes it work. This is not a show about how it would actually suck if Ultraman, or the things that happened in Ultra shows, were real. This is not a cynical deconstruction. There\'s enough in its premise that could\'ve taken that route, but it doesn\'t. Instead, this feels like examination of the feelings of hopelessness and alienation that cause people to be fond of fundamentally hopeful characters like Ultraman— and an assertion of belief in the possibility of overcoming that alienation. It\'s a basically good-hearted show.People love to treat Studio Trigger as successor to Gainax— SSSS.Gridman makes a stronger case for that than almost any other entry in their catalogue.

Don't complain, if you don't find what you were looking for.Many people(I should say men), as they claim to be, are here for a particular character's thighs or another character's boobs. Or for that big black tall shadowy villain who is intriguing if you'll pay attention to him.But do read my review before you judge this animation for all that it is lacking. For I wish you all to see what this anime is actually all about.SSSS.Gridman is a tokusatsu love letter for the 90's live-action TV series of the same...name. Tokusatsu is the Japanese name for the special effects. The most famous tokusatsu series will be Ultraman. That should give you an idea. Or you should check out Ultraman or a show with tokusatsu before diving into this series, if you wanna understand its true value.To be honest, the people who have watched a lot of tokusatsu in their life, they are the best ones fit to give this review. And boy my childhood was filled with power rangers tokusatsu, which now makes me blush about it. A lot.Now this series has tried to replicate tokusatsu effects through its animation, and damn, they did that pretty successfully. Not only the effects, but they also tried to replicate the general tropes, the archetype characters and the lifeless villains who are being bad for sake of being bad.But just copying isn't enough. They needed to own these stereotypes and boy did they perform an excellent job with that. I was genuinely shocked when they took some archetype filler episode stories and integrated them into the main arc, rather than the main character pointlessly keep on fighting for another 40 episodes like they do in the actual live-action series. And man, they were some sweet plot twists, which left me craving for more.Yuuta, Hibiki and Rikka are three stereotypical main characters, which many claim are bland, dull and boring. To me, they weren't typical anime characters but typical characteristic human beings. To me, they were characters that were deep, grounded in reality and genuine. That instantly made me fall in love with this series.The Gridman fights were stereotypical and they were good replicas of the live-action tokusatsu fights. Some might complain that the CGI stands out, but I think that was done on purpose. Cause tokusatsu fights are generally bad looking, if we look back to that time and review those shows with the present standards. And yep, these CGI fights look much better than those special effects.This isn't just a love letter to tokusatsu, but a clever, recasted series to fit the generic anime we all love watching. Best elements of an Anime and tokusatsu were combined to create this masterpiece and considering the plot twists towards the end of the season, it leaves one on the edge of the seat, wanting for more. And it makes me wanna write a review on MAL, which I would typically never do.Finally, I would like to tell you that everything you dislike about this anime, there is actually a reasoning behind it.

Being the second animated project from the Trigger studio in regards to last year, we move away completely from the whole controversy about whether Darling in the Franxx was a good series or not, to instead witness one of the clearest love letters to the genre of tokusatsu given by the anime industry in recent years.SSSS.Gridman is an original anime inspired by the tokusatsu live action series 1993-1994 Gridman the Hyper Agent, also referencing with...the SSSS of the title Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad the American adaptation of Gridman in 1995. Being produced by the studio Trigger with support of Tsuburaya Productions, the company with the rights of Gridman and the Ultra Series (Ultraman, as it is the best known of its work on this side of the world) this series had a total of 12 episodes broadcast between October and December of the year 2018. Directed by Akira Amemiya whose peculiar style had already been seen in Trigger series such as Inferno Cop or Ninja Slayer, with screenplays written by the ultra legendary Keiichi Hasegawa who left his name on the tokusatsu industry being one the main writers of the Ultra Series. The sound direction was provided by Toshiki Kameyama, while the soundtrack was composed by Shirō Sagisu. Meanwhile the design of characters with Masayuki Gotou preparing the designs of Gridman, and Masaru Sakamoto managing the rest of the characters that participated in the story.The synopsis of this series is the following: Focusing mainly on Yūta Hibiki, a freshman who lives in the city of Tsutsujidai. Suffering a strange case of amnesia and being able to see a mysterious being called Gridman through an old computer, Yuta will be involved with his friends in the mission to stop the sudden attacks of the huge Kaijus that threaten to wipe out the city and all its inhabitants, while trying to find the answers after all the mysteries that are affecting what they know as reality.Under the guise of a simple, somewhat ridiculous and undoubtedly kitschy tokusatsu aimed at the whole family with its already ancestral monster routine of the week, SSSS.Gridman actually presents us with a story a bit darker and stark compared to the original that aims not only those who grew up consuming this genre but also trying to attract a new generation of viewers. Being a thematic sequel that reinterprets and updates several of the concepts of the original of 1993, this is a work that among multiple references and tributes seeks to demonstrate its own value as an individual work. This being a story that uses fighting against monsters as secondary, when the priority is above all to focus on the development of their characters and the need to accept reality instead of escaping from it.We are facing a work that does not hesitate to have multiple silent, uncomfortable, or plainly strange scenes that invite you to try to understand the mentality and emotions of its protagonists with what you can infer from their unspoken language or visual narrative. For those who expect great surprises, the turns of this anime may not be satisfactory or even consider how the events progress, but Gridman from the first episode has been a series that has had most of the answers to its mysteries hidden to simple view, waiting for someone to focus on them and get to understand them, thus leading an incredible thematic attachment in all its aspects.Trigger is a studio known for always offering a high quality animation and Gridman is no exception, although it does have curious differences to the standard when we take notice that the main names of the studio are working on Promare leaving the door open for Amemiya and Hasegawa to do the least ""Trigger"" anime in the history of the Trigger studio. As one would expect the animation is incredible with great care in its scenarios, the action is dynamic with fluid and natural movements that complements the sample character of do not tell of the series, along with a cast of expressive characters that show a lot even in the scenes more silent, however where the average series of this studio would bet to do something bombastic, in Gridman is decided by a much more subtle and intriguing approach, using from the saturation of the light to represent the summer heat to static shots or irregular angles to generate anxiety to create a balance between the most mundane and human of the series with the supernatural of the Kaiju. Speaking of the Kaiju even though it may seem that making them in 3D is a strange decision when most of the elements in the series is 2D, however when we consider how to manage in this way to simulate the movements of a person in a complicated costume crushing a diorama, it can be seen that it is an alternative chosen to capture the originality style of the series.Regarding the music and soundtrack of the series, Gridman surprises us by balancing the silence with energetic and positive songs for the action scenes together with much more classical or melancholic tunes, some themes seem straight out of the original series with that nineties style, but others take a much more electronic and modern way, but as strange as the mix seems, they never break with the atmosphere that the series wants to build. I recognize that out of a few issues like ""HumanLove"" that did not drastically alter the atmosphere, does not make them particularly memorable, however it is a soundtrack that deserves to be listened to separately since the work of Shiro Sagisu has no loss. The entry theme to the series is ""UNION"" of the Japanese duo OxT which perfectly represents the theme of youth in the series allowing to initiate in an energetic and optimistic way each episode, on the other hand the closing theme ""youthful beautiful"" of the singer Maaya Uchida, although she maintains the theme of youth, focuses more on being a quiet but energetic song about friendship that manages to fit more than well with the themes that the series wants to relate.SSSS.Gridman is by no means a perfect series, however, what series is it? Although it tried to reach viewers who do not know anything about the Ultra Series, a great fact that affects how you enjoy this series is if you can ignore the ridiculous / inherent kinkiness of the tokusatsu and if you are willing to follow the game of its narrative, since in the worst case it will seem like a boring work. However if you manage to connect with the story, this production, as I said at the beginning, is a tribute and a love letter to everything that makes the tokusatsu great and could easily enter the list of the best works of the Trigger studio. the SSSS of the title Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad the American adaptation of Gridman in 1995.

Back then I loved it but never thought about watching the original tokusatsu series because my SHS\'s memories were the best and I didn\'t want to ruin it. SSSS. Gridman came to fit my desire to know better the world from the original Japanese series and I decided to watch it for the nostalgia.Some elements surprised me a lot during the series. First was the development of the history that differs from the live-action tokusatsu ""rule"" of getting a new...monster per episode with minimum or no-story sustaining it. Although I think it is still a teen-series, it has a solid story! Another thing is THE REFERENCES! From Tsuburaya\'s Superheroes Universe and its monsters.

Access Flash!!!', 'A beautiful story about confronting reality, SSSS Gridman offers a compelling story that will likely appeal to fans of franchises like Evangelion or Power Rangers. Each of the characters are enjoyable and possess unique traits, and every single episode was a fun ride to the very end.As an antagonist, Akane Shinjo is complex yet sympathetic, which make sure her entertaining. Her arc is a brilliant commentary on the dangers of escapist fantasy, and telling us all that eventually, we have to grow up and enter the outdoor world to comeback towards fragile, mortal reality. Living in the world of a god, isolated from all else,...drives us mad.The writing blends action perfectly with an emotional and melancholic storyline while also paying plenty tribute to the show that bore its name: Superman Samurai Syber Squad (and Gridman the Hyper Agent). Each episode escalates events more, and even when an episode feels like potential filler, there’s still something to help push the storyline along. In 12 episodes this show tells a spanning story that creates wonder and justice, while also justifying common tropes seen in shows such as Power Ranges (e.g. how the city repairs collateral damage after every battle).The giant Tokusatsu battles are undoubtedly incredible, and a testament to the potential that CGI could have in anime if more studios applied it beyond background filler. Each fight feels incredibly powerful, and the first time each new form appears is nothing short of mindblowing. You truly feel the weight of each robot as the fights clash, and every time Gridman gets upgraded, they make sure the transformation is mighty and intensely powerful. TRIGGER makes a good point to ensure that each different mecha gets at least one epic battle, from base form Gridman to even Powered Zenon.The main theme and music are all pleasure to my ears, and they’ll probably be tunes I’m still humming long after i’ve finished watching.This is an anime I actually would prefer not get a 2nd season, if only because there’s no way to really top that ending, that beautiful ending. It is certainly beautiful.SSSS Gridman is an exercise in the beauty of animation and it’s a declarative love letter to the Tokusatsu genre that evolves it to the limits of heroic power.

Giant robot battles, robots combining and transformations, shouting out attack names before performing them - I had such a blast watching this. The action was really entertaining.The CG did seem a little clunky at times but it didn't interfere much with the thrilling action. I also enjoyed the character development of Rikka and Akane. Ultimately if you want a good time watching an action show...that makes you feel pumped and excited over giant robot battles, look no further. that makes you feel pumped and excited over giant robot battles, look no further."", ""A beautiful marriage of animation and tokusatsu, with a dash of thighs thrown in. The fights are all animated in a way that mimics classic tokusatsu techniques used in properties such as Godzilla and Ultraman. The same extends to the designs of Gridman, Anti, the support weapons and the forms they provide, and all of the kaiju. This show also excels at making the villains the actual main characters while they're still antagonists. If you love mecha, kaiju, tokusatasu, or just want to see some juicy thighs then you should absolutely watch this show and if you enjoy it then check out the original show...as well, you can find it on YouTubeAlso GRIDMAN BABY DAN DAN as well, you can find it on YouTubeAlso GRIDMAN BABY DAN DAN"", 'Visuals: The character designs and storyboarding is great but the actual animation is nothing to write home about.

Backgrounds are forgettable, I normaly don\'t put much judgment into backgrounds but Made in Abyss upped the bar.Characters: BOOORING. None of the characters stand out and they have no goals or personality. the only thing differentiating them is their designs. Exeption is Shinjou who is slightly more memorable cause she actually has emotions.VA: Fantastic, Trigger never dissapoints with VA but it\'s...a shame the characters attached to them are so shitPlot: Honestly it was so uninteresting I dropped it after 2 eps so don\'t expect much accuracy from this section...Monsters/kaiju of ""unkown"" origin (somehow spawned via clay models created by antagonist(s) ) start attacking \'generic japanese metropolis #1145\' and our MC fights them with a giant mecha suit.

So, on it's surface, SSSS.Gridman is a giant robot vs kaiju of the week show. The combat scenes are done in a manner that accurately depicts what a fight like this would look like if you were filming men in rubber suits, and this was done for a very specific reason.The villain in this show is my choice for villain of the year. They are deeply layered and interesting. The remaining cast, at least at first was really two dimensional at first. Gorgeous best friend next door. Nerdy buddy. Generic...love interest for the villain. This, once again, was done for a very specific reason.  However down the road, some of the rest of the cast grow into much deeper characters.The setting of the show, is beautiful in it's emptiness and kaiju clouds in the background, which was done for a very specific reason.Look, SSSS.Gridman on it's surface is a fun giant monster/mecha anime, but there is a lot going on under the surface here.  This takes a fun show, and elevates it to brilliance. For you to totally know why, you'll have to give it a watch.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.P.S.

A question that I've been asking myself ever since I started watching SSSS.Gridman. From the first, to the last episode. It has been a journey that I never expected, but am grateful to have undergone. Finally, after completing it though, I now have the answer to that question....Because Trigger.Please, do yourself a favor, and watch this anime.On the surface, this anime looks like it's about giant mecha battles with Kaiju. Your standard run-of-the-mill Ultraman series type of thing. I can assure you that this cover is simply used to hide the true nature of the story. It is one that is...slowly revealed in the most unnatural, yet fascinating way that I have ever seen. You will be puzzled as to what on earth is going on in this anime, and slightly put off by how unnatural everything seems. Yet, I can assure you, please do not drop this series. It will pay off, and it does so big time.The art and sound are at a good quality. One fit for a series about mechs beating the living daylights out of kaiju while shouting out the name of the special move they used. It is very stylistic, which I personally liked.The characters are all so mysterious. I wanted to know more about everyone, and the anime does deliver in on this. Plus, this one anime has two possible best girls of the season, all in one package! How could you not watch it?Apart from that, the character designs were distinct and vivid. Each character seemed to have been created with much care. Perhaps the average viewer, upon watching this anime, might not notice it, but just take a look at all the fan art that has spawned from this anime, and you'll see how much artists love these characters.Overall, it was a confusing, yet strangely compelling experience that I don't regret having. I have so many questions, yet I feel satisfied for some odd reason. It's truly hard to describe how this anime made me feel, since the mixture was unlike anything that I've experienced before.

The show’s got a Saturday morning, Pokemon-in-pyjamas vibe that takes me right back to my childhood and does what a lot of other anime fail to do; be something I want to watch. Apart from all that, the show features and pretty likeable cast of heroes for us to root for and a central mystery that – especially with this last episode – has me excited to keep watching (I mean, the show’s basically power rangers meets the matrix at this point and who can say no to that).This show largely hinges on...the kaiju. As it is said “they are the main characters”. With that in mind, I think the first episode is pretty brilliant all that numbing build-up – that sense of weekend morning calm – bursts into a shower of roars and screams as a creature that looks and feels (because of the CG) like an over worldly force, completely incongruous with the misty setting. The appearance of the first kaiju is brilliantly executed in a way that made me root for the characters and cheer when they succeed like I rarely do.So, to all those people who say its boring, i can\'t help the feeling that you\'re just impatient - i mean I\'m not saying, ""wait till episode 26 it gets good I sear!"" - but its a nice, fifteen or so minute ride till the shit hits the fan and with all the cute designs, likable characters and hints of greater mystery, how could you not like it. the kaiju.

Its funny to see how bad the anime is and thats wht this anime slightly watchable in this anime *THICC*Its kinda boring cause fights like this only like a couple of minutes with little action predictable outcome like how gridman/ultraman get defeated first and when there light is flashing (indicating they are at their limit) then win it because they awaken some bullshit power.Overall its a shit anime with good waifus, Its a bad anime ""yes"" but does it mean u cant enjoy ""no"".

Then this anime will feel you with nostalgic for sure and give...you something new to walk away from as well so I suggest you watch it and see for yourself. you something new to walk away from as well so I suggest you watch it and see for yourself."", 'I personally really enjoyed this show. With the widely public positive reception. Including the unique and story telling and presentation skills. The narrative explores the psychological perspective of characters and delves into their inner struggles.The show garnered significant attention from the community when it aired, sparkling discussions about our main characters, Rikka and Akane. Additionally, there was a plethora of illustrations featuring these characters during that time. The captivating storyline and immersive character interaction made audience were invested in the show very much, to the extent that people began formulating theories and speculations about the upcoming episodes and story development.Animation: the animation was produced...by Trigger, one of the prestigious production company on fighting and robots. The production quality is guaranteed.Art: The character design was done by couple of talented people, some of them later transferred to company Yostar, which is a game company that makes famous gacha games with amazing graphics. Remarkably, two main girl characters as you could find in the visual, Rikka and Akane, were well designed, at that time assumed to be the groundbreaking character designs in a decade. The popularity of two characters still preserve today.Sound: The soundtrack was composed by the renowned composer Shiro Sagisu, who composed the soundtrack for Evangelion and Bleach. Personally speaking the VA of Akane still regarded as the best performing character in my mind at the period. Also the director has played some trick to deepen the emotional impact of the show. For instance, in a scene of ep9 the soundtrack was played backward. A Japanese song “Kokoro no Hitomi” was played to the key scene in ep10.Plot: To be honest the main story revolves around the MC struggling with the monster fight, on the other hand, as the story progresses, unfolding more mystery elements and character development. Alongside with the main show, there are also post-airing short radio for each episode, enriching the development of side characters and the whole story. Another thing worth notice is that this show is a brand new animation of the original mecha TV series “Gridman”, some of the lore were inserted into the anime and you will be surprised once you’ve found it. (Yeah the discussion did it)Production and theme: Not just the composer is the same person, this show was influenced by Evangelion by a certain level. From community saying, some of the scene composition directly pay homage to it. Robots, MC’s personality, assembling the impact that Evangelion still remain. Besides the animation, symbolism in this show plays a crucial role in conveying deeper meanings and themes. What makes it stands out is that most of the time the show will not tell you what is the problem, instead conveying it through symbols. One example is in the first minute of the show, you will notice in a scene a shoe standing alone from others on the ground, a girl on the school roof watching the ground, meteoric falling from sky, which is essential enough to convey the main theme and the plot of the whole story. And with these elements, you can’t help but start building up theory in your mind and excited on what’s happening next. With this stunning opening, for sure you can know the following of the show will not disappoint you. Such presentation skill made me thinking of this show sets it apart.Character: As the story continues, more clues are revealed about the character and their motivations. The antagonist plays a central role in the storyline, and by exploring their motivation, you may find it relevant to the audience. The narrative is designed to be self-inserted and aims to resonate with audience.World development: The world building in this story features a mystical setting. In the first episode, the MC discovers a stationary monster at the end of the sky. As the story unfolds, additional elements are introduced to enhance the world-building and allow the audience to delve into the true story of this whole universe.To close this, the Japanese song that mentioned above “Kokoro no Hitomi” literally means the eye of the soul, I hope after the hype ride of this immersive experiences, at the end of the day the impressions will dwell in your heart. by Trigger, one of the prestigious production company on fighting and robots.

No spoilers in this review, and while I am a firm believer that spoilers do not ruin media, I think the logical steps the story takes you all the way to the end is a big part of why I appreciate this show so much. So TL;DR this is a show that is incredibly tasteful and chooses not to pander to the Gundam audience but teaches us how we may have been affected by this medium for the better.Go watch itI use the word ""appreciate"" a lot because...SSSS.Gridman selects certain elements from Gundam shows and uses them as motifs or reminders, i.e. repeating certain animation sequences as a cost saving measure in Transformers or GI Joe. For other important elements SSSS.Gridman puts a lot of love and quality into i.e. the fighting sequences using realistic motion, possibly from reference footage. To which and how these decisions were made elevates SSSS.Gridman above other homages to 90s anime. Look at Pacific Rim for example, a movie I love mind you. The film has a love for Kaiju and Mech designs, but it also bashes on the medium\'s poor story telling with the attitude that the only thing that matters in Kaiju animes are big monsters fighting big robots. I think it\'s fair to be self aware about the stuff we loved in the past, but after watching SSSS.Gridman I realize this kind of attitude is dismissive of the idea that everything we experience and have experienced molds who we are as people. SSSS.Gridman might recognize the flaws from those cartoons past, but it also recognizes that the media we consume as children made the heroes we aspire to be now. And again no spoilers, but the ending enables the viewer to connect with their past and maybe see how those dumb cartoons shaped us to be the people we are.One aspect I want to give big praise to is the sound experience I had with this show. First, the OP is amazing. OxT captures that 90s anime, childish, hyped up attitude while adding in modern OP elements. The song is extremely clean and I did not skip it a single time. Then comes the choice to not play background music. Some other animes rely on OST too much to invoke emotion, but SSSS.Gridman strips this back which forces the animators and character designers to invoke that emotion and the sound designers to use diegetic sounds. This creates less stress on the ears and allows you to interpret emotions and scenes for yourself.SSSS.Gridman gave me a lot to think about about how my childhood experiences affected me now, and it tells its viewers to not be ashamed of their fandoms. For delivering such in interesting, simple, yet pensive message in a very tastefu, clean way, this show has won me over.

What I got was something else entirely, and I\'m glad it subverted my expectations.The story follows a boy named Yuta Hibiki, who shares an unknown link with an otherworldly entity named Gridman. Together, they must combat kaiju created by his classmate, Akane Shinjou (best girl, by far), who has a few secrets of her own. The series begins as a ""monster-of-the-week"" style tokusatsu show, paying homage to numerous other tokusatsu such as Dengoku Chojin Gridman and the Ultra series. Akane creates a kaiju brought to life by an alien...named Alexis Kherib, Yuta and Gridman defeat it, rinse and repeat with some powerups and combination attacks along the way. Not until a little before the halfway point do things diverge.The directorial style had heirs of Neon Genesis Evangelion (with some characters even borrowing the namesake), utilizing empty frames with overlapping dialogue. It added that sense of loneliness and existentialism that came with Evangelion, albeit to a lesser degree. Still, there was a presence of stillness; a bizarre addition to a tokusatsu show. It works well here, but takes away from the great animation style Trigger is known for.SSSS.Gridman is more of a deconstruction of the tokusatsu genre rather than just being another entry, and was a highly engaging watch. The single season is only 12 episodes, making it easily digestible. I\'d definitely recommend if you\'re either a fan of Trigger Studios or looking for a show that does things a bit differently. named Alexis Kherib, Yuta and Gridman defeat it, rinse and repeat with some powerups and combination attacks along the way.

It is not the classic episodic enemy kind of story. It is really complex in the background, with a clear inspiration of series like Evangelion (is Trigger... you know...).The only bad points on the story is that only if you have seen the original 90's Gridman live action, you will be capable of understanding all the glory and implications of the end.Story: 8Art: Impressive, the designs are very good, the characters, the Kaijus, Gridman...Itself. All of them are cool. The animation is really good with the usual Trigger Style that some people love and other ones hate. The battles can be a bit more dynamic but they are very good battles. And can we talk about the references? HOLY S$#T there are a lot of references. From other animes to Tokusatsu classic series. What a good time i have looking for all the references. And a good one for all you to know: Rikka's mother has the same face of Haruko from FLCL and THE SAME SEIYUU! What an amazing touch right there!Art: 8Sound: very good, the music is good, it feels out of place in some parts, and then you remember is Trigger (you know...trigger...gainax...Evangelion...) so in the end is quite an experience. In some parts i really began to expect a battle with beethoven music. The opening and ending are good, the opening specially made me feel like watching and old Tokusatsu series so it really achieve the objective.Sound: 9Character: This is the low point of the series, the characters lack with their personalities. At some point i stopped caring about the characters and just wait for the next amazing battle, Anti is by far the most interesting character of the series. And the only one i really cared to find out his true motivations.Characters: 7Enjoyment: If you are a Tokusatsu fan, this anime touch the line of the very very good anime. I enjoyed the battles a lot. To the point of watching the entire anime in less than half a day. So if you are fan of trigger or Tokusatsu this is a highly recommended series, every episode will let you with hunger of more. If not, it is still a good mecha vs kaiju style of anime for you to watch.Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8 Itself. All of them are cool.

I'm not a huge mecha fan, so I was very skeptical at first, and didn't bother starting until halfway through the season. But damn was I impressed. It started out strong, and every episode kept getting better and better, up until the grand finale - one of the best final episodes I can remember. Here's some of the key points.Plot - How many plot twists can an anime have without losing its impact? You could tell that the writers were having a blast working on this, as the entire storyline felt...loose and free; nothing was forced, everything came naturally, and minor plot holes were shrugged off only to be patched by the next reveal. Every time a major plot twist happened it felt like it for sure would be the last, so every new event always came as a surprise.Art - The style was pretty normal, with just a miniscule hint of shaft-y accents, and CGI for the kaiju that wasn't terrible and was appropriate for the circumstance. There was nothing to complain about, and I did like the subtle accentuation.Sound - UNION is the hypest OP I've heard since OPM. The hook is so good, and the lyrics fit both the melody and the anime. Actually one of the best openings I can think of in terms of lyrical relevance. Others have also praised the voice acting, which I didn't really notice much but I think that was the point. I don't remember anything special about the actual soundtrack though.Character - Really meh in this department.... which was disappointing because the story was so great. On the other hand, the story explains why there's not a whole lot of character development, and including more background would go against the plot. Knowing the reason, however, doesn't change the fact that the characters are weak.Enjoyment - This very quickly became one of my favorites this season, and one that I was eagerly waiting for each week. That puts it in 8/10 territory, for me. loose and free; nothing was forced, everything came naturally, and minor plot holes were shrugged off only to be patched by the next reveal.

The art style is beautiful and the colors are really nice.They use a cgi when there are battles witch gives you a nostalgic throwback to the 2005 era of mecha and in the same time they manage to fit it surprisingly well with the overall art style.The story at first glance may look generic and nothing to special but as the...anime continuous the story gets better.The show has some good characters and some that they could have had a better development.Overall SSSS Gridman is an amazing anime and i highly recommend it not only to the mecha fans but also to the ones who are not really interested on  mechas. anime continuous the story gets better.The show has some good characters and some that they could have had a better development.Overall SSSS Gridman is an amazing anime and i highly recommend it not only to the mecha fans but also to the ones who are not really interested on  mechas.', ""SSSS. Gridman, what an adventure.  I'll try to make this review as spoiler-free as possible.From the show's relatively humble beginnings to it's grandiose end, it's was excellent all the way through.SSSS.Gridman is an amusing blend of genres, putting one of the spotlights on the school life aspect of it's main cast but driving itself forward through both elements of Mecha and Kaijuu tokusatsu shows. It's the perfect transition to animation an original Henshin tokusatsu show could ever ask for.Every episode littered with great cinematography, art and animation accompanied with high energy tracks that compliment the production.It's filled to the brim with 2D sakuga and...fluid CG animation which shows just how passionate the staff was about the whole show.The atmosphere's carefully crafted by the proper use of soundracks and effects combined with the cinematography consisting of airless, sort of confined shots of the blistering summer heat and oppressive cloudy rains. It gives the show a sense of an identity that a lot of recent anime just can't seem to grasp.The story is rather formulaic as it sticks to a Monster of The Week format but the archetypical structure of the format is broken down in a few places, making way for an actual overarching plot within the setup.Every plot point the show setup was unveiled at a proper pacing, and while the characters lacked development outside of Akane, the underlying themes still got through and eventually culminated into it's fantastic ending which saw Akane finally facing herself instead of finding fault in everything else.The entire roster is colorful and visually distinct, making them easy to remember, and potentially iconic - someday, down the line.The development for Hibiki, Rikka and Utsumi did feel kind of miniscule in the grand scheme of things and they should've gotten more screen time addressing their personal characteristics but the main focus of the plot didn't really require much on that front so they can be given a pass.Overall it's a great show that's totally worth everyone's time and attention. fluid CG animation which shows just how passionate the staff was about the whole show.The atmosphere's carefully crafted by the proper use of soundracks and effects combined with the cinematography consisting of airless, sort of confined shots of the blistering summer heat and oppressive cloudy rains.

Gridman came out, it was met with a mixed reaction and many people didn't continue the show. This is due to a huge chunk of present fanbase only tries to find context on surface material. In fact, a huge part of anime fans thinks any show with giant mechs fighting have no other theme or story other than cheap monster-a-week fights.Everything that happens in the show is part of a meta-narrative. As the story progresses the narration slowly expands and by the end you'll view every incident of the story in a...different angle. Although you'll probably be able to guess what the meta-narration is for by Episode 10,it still doesn't make the ending any less emotionally powerful.The cast of the show is a perfectly balanced mixture of Goofy Side Characters and Emotionally driven protagonists. Something Hiroyuki Imaishi does in a lot of his works. It's hard to get into the characters without giving away spoilers so,I'll just point out my favorite two characters and their brilliant dynamic. Akane and Rikka are my two most favorite characters and their relationship has the best development in the entire show. Rikka had thousands of reason to turn her back on Akane but she didn't. She reached out to Akane and was genuinely able to get through.The most amazing thing is this brilliant character arc never played second fiddle to the show's actions.Neon Genesis Evangelion's influence in the show is very evident.It's a mecha driven narrative with underlying themes of loneliness, isolation and escapism.In fact,the SSSS Gridman team is called Neon Genesis Junior High Students.

To fully experience this masterpiece you at least have to watch some of the old Ultra series as this anime is a tribute to those incredible works in the past.Story 10I found myself very intrigued by the mysterious world of SSSS and this is the part that i love about Trigger. They reveal just little bit about the world each episodes to keep the audience engaged and they\'re really good at doing this. Every tiny details, every bits are all connected helping to build up the story then when the the twist hit, it feels...really satisfying and not just for the sake of shock value. In addition, the pacing is excellent and i could see the time and effort they spent to make all the plots comes together.The fights between Kaiju and Gridman are exhilarating as hell and every fights has its own depth and meaning, oR its just really cool to have Gridman overpowering them all with cool combinations of transformations.Art 10Trigger went all out on this masterpiece. The screenplay, the colorful world, the aesthetics, those damn sakuga, Im mean ComE ON Kaijus vs Giant Robots anime style. There were some uses of CG and its not half bad, also i think it fits perfectly. The amount of details of the world, the characters, the Kaiju and the Gridmans (different versions of him) makes for an ""above average"" of your typical highschool anime. The Kaijus each has unique styles, strengths, and abilities adapted to defeat Gridman. Trigger really is the king of Mechas.Sound 10Right from the get go, you can hear only the sounds, no music, just sounds and it gives me chills every times. I noticed that there were little uses of soundtrack (but it\'s fine cause those tracks are awsome) and just the sounds and it makes me very emerged in the world of SSSS, the humming of the mites, the noises during break times at school , the chorus in the background ... AnD that song they use in the final fight, uwe! the nostalgiaA little bit about the ending, perfect for the relationships between Rikka and Akane, outstandingCharacter 9I wont be able to talk about our characters too much without spoiling the entire anime but again Trigger has outdone themselves making me invested in these people. And the one who surprised me the most was Anti, thats all I have to sayAlso, Rikka thicc thighsAlso Also, Akane panty hoseEnjoyment 10I watched a lot of the Ultra series as a kid and SSSS G man is a like an anime style payoff to the late 90s series on how great they were back then. I was just excited as much as I was a kid watching this anime giving me chills whether I recall the feelings of similar moments being recreated with such love, care and creativityOverall, I love SSSS.

The music is okay. The animation is okay.Every single one of them were uninteresting, the only thing I can remember was their pretty designs, there was little exceptional about them, their chemistry non-existent and ""FRIENDSHIP"" was painful to sit through even though in the end they [potential spoiler] actually defeated the main shadow villain with the power of their friendship, yes, really.[potential spoiler ends].Even the villain, who\'s motivations is flimsy and inexplicable because it is coupled with the confusing plot, one really has...no idea what the villain is. Human, God, Dreaming? What? It doesn\'t matter but I thought there was some other huge twist coming at the end but turns out that was all and I was like suppose to know the settings on my own already. The only thing that carried the series forward is the character design and the anticipation of a twist that never came. And that was the other reason I watched it for.It is really excruciating as there was a clear buildup for a twist but the multiple twists are so absolutely nonsensical because the settings itself is unexplained and it really has no effect on the overall story.There is also this theme about Grid and computers, and Hyper World, blah, blah, blah, but it is again, unexplained. I would assume probably because this was based on an old TV series from the 90s, this is like a spiritual sequel and you are just supposed to know what it\'s about? I don\'t see why they can\'t explain the settings either for new watchers because that was the only thing I can wonder about as the plot trots forward confusingly.It\'s a confusing mess. I thought it was going to get better because of how little they explained at the start and how there were so many random things going on in the city, I thought there were going to be hints littered around about the settings here and there, but no, there was fucking nothing. The settings remained unexplained, and the twist was something that happened within the settings.It\'s mediocre. I want to call it bad but the design, music, art, and animation elevates this a lot. So, I suppose it is just mediocre. no idea what the villain is. Human, God, Dreaming? What?

So, I suppose it is just mediocre.', ""SSSS.Gridman is an anime modernization of the tokusatsu genre, in the same vein as shows like Ultraman and Super Sentai, and it manages to do this shockingly well. My personal experience with the genre is essentially just seeing a few episodes of Power Rangers as a kid, which I never really cared for, so I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I ended up enjoying this show. I picked up Gridman mostly because of Trigger being the studio behind this entry in the series and the teaser trailer they put out after it's announcement alongside Promare (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGw4SmxkryU) which led me to believe this could...be a slightly darker take on the genre with the same action and story elements. This assumption was partially true.The story is solid, especially for it's genre as plot normally takes a back seat for dramatic action sequences, but I feel like Gridman does a respectable job of balancing story and action. There are some well thought out twists which you can probably predict well in advance if you are observant but are still satisfying, and much of the final few episodes is focused on character analysis and introspection. After the first two or three episodes my expectations for a mature super robot series were deflated since most of the beginning is a parade of monster fights with little bearing on the plot, so it was enjoyable to see the show shift its focus to plot and character development while still keeping up the one-fight-per-episode pace.Gridman's art is generally quite good, most notably with inventive use of 3D CGI to replicate the old rubber suit fights which have been a staple of the genre since its very beginning. The fights themselves look fantastic with a lot of dynamic movement and flashy action sequences. Transformation sequences, of which there are quite a few, are a little long but they are suitably cool and it's awesome seeing Gridman and his various forms drawn out alongside the 3D models used for most of the fighting scenes. The character designs look fine and are nothing particularly interesting but consistently pretty high quality regardless of the scene. However, the mech and kaiju designs are all excellent and look really cool no matter what they're doing, and there's always a lot of emphasis on making their size seem massive and real against the backdrop of their environment. Background art is good across the board with lots of little details and looks really nice in quite a few shots throughout the show.Sound design is really good. All the mech and kaiju noises fit perfectly and are exactly as loud and weighty as they should be, and the accompanying environment sounds during the fight scenes fit well. The music is also generally good, some tracks are awesome. The OP and ED are both real ear worms.Characters were the weakest part of the entire show for me. Most of the cast are very flat and underdeveloped, and there's kind of an in-universe explanation as to why this is though it still makes for a weaker viewing experience, but the characters who are given ample screen time and exploration of their motives are actually really interesting and I would have loved to have more of the main cast fleshed out in the same ways. It's a shame that this show didn't have a longer run or dedicate a little more time to a lot of the major characters, but I'm also glad it's only 12 episodes because it doesn't overstay it's welcome or get padded out with pointless filler like many other Trigger shows have.In all, I found myself having a lot of fun with Gridman. I never expected to get much enjoyment out of something in this genre because of previous experience with it, but this show is so well done that I couldn't help but smile when the good guys win and the major plot moments were meaningful to me, I'm even a little interested in checking out the rest of the franchise because of the way it was tied in with this series.

Some things are given as facts, but there's no explanation as to why that's the way things are. Instead, the viewer just needs to accept everything at face value and try to enjoy it for what it is: yet another mecha anime. And as Trigger is wont to do, all things must involve giant robots.Some spoilers:So we've got people who fly into computers and get transformed into parts of a giant robot. Why? Who knows!Where did the people with black suits come from? Who are they and why...do they have anything to do with Gridman?Who or what is Gridman anyways?

What's her deal here?Is nothing actually real? Just some dream or simulation of an anxious IRL girl?There's many more questions than that. But at least the art and music were generally good. Characters were pretty flat in the personality department. And giant robots fighting giant kaiju gets repetitive. do they have anything to do with Gridman?Who or what is Gridman anyways?

One is good, one is... meh.The first part of SSSS. Gridman is the typical mystery, romance, and slice of life. I find this to be great. The main character has amnesia and is a little goofy at first, but he will grow on you pretty quickly as a decent MC. His best friend is a typical best friend in these types of shows, forgettable, but at least he is not annoying.The strength of this show is the female cast, particularly the main female girl, Rikka (the love...interest) and the ""enemy,"" Akane. Rikka is probably the best girl of the season, very strong female character who does her own thing and not your typical love interest girl who just goes along with whatever the MC wants/likes. Akane could make a run for best girl, though her being the bad guy is putting her at a disadvantage (not really a spoiler because it is stated so early on in the anime).The mystery is how and why things happening the way they are instead of who is doing what. So far, the mystery is entertaining enough.The downside to this anime is the action sequences which will remind viewers of the corny old school Power Ranger fights... at the end of each episode where the enemies grow exponentially and the good guys bring out some huge mechanized human looking thing. These fights are corny as hell and majority of the adults who watch this anime will cringe at these sequences. The good part is that they are a very small part of each episode and they do not overstay their welcome.I enjoy watching this episode mostly for the interactions between each character and to figure out what is going on.

Yuta is a precious boy and all but he really isn\'t all that interesting, his situation not withstanding.Rikka often picks up the slack of the protagonist and her relationship with Akane is the absolute narrative crowning jewel of the show. I am almost starved for more interaction and information from them. While the romantic tension between them is there I wish it were less vague. There was a great opportunity to voice...LGBT representation and Trigger merely gave a timid squeak. There are other characters who are super interesting, but in my opinion not all are quite utilized to their full potential. One stand out being the Kaiju with intelligenceI loved the heavy atmosphere of the toned down moments where the characters are allowed to shine, as well as the show\'s use of silence conversationally to emphasize certain moments for humor or drama.The other draw is, of course, the massive kaiju mecha fights which are quite impressive and original for the Genre, using some impressive cg animation to invoke a guy in a rubber suit was both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. The designs of them were all great, however,  I wish the design of the Alien character had a less generic ""trigger/gainax"" look to him. it felt like he had no personality of his own.For better or for worse there\'s pretty much no other show like this and despite its flaws I definitely think it\'s worth a shot.

It was great in the beginning and slowly got worse until the end where it all crashed and burned. Overall I found Darling in the Franxx to be really good. The production was fantastic all the way through, the characters were great and the story was also really good until the halfway point. But it's hard to ignore that ending. Trigger really needed to shape up to not lose its reputation.And in a way, SSSS.Gridman was the exact opposite of Franxx for me. Let me explain:In the same way...that I liked Franxxs beginning more than ending, I liked SSSS.Gridmans ending more than beginning. I haven't rewatched the episodes, so I don't know if there was information that could have been interesting after watching everything. But it felt like every episode was: A kaiju appears > The gang can't get to Gridman/They can't kill the Kaiju > They figure out a plan, and they kill the kaijuAgain, maybe I missed foreshadowing that could have been interesting. But I don't think you should write an episode of a show so that people who have already watched it think it's interesting. Cause if new people find that boring, no one will get to the ending.Maybe that's just my opinion though.But around episode 6, something happened. It instantly got more interesting. It was the episode where we are introduced to a new character (I won't say who for the sake of spoilers) who explain a little more about the antagonist. But it didn't feel like they explained it to the audience. More like the Protagonist needed information that she could give. And after that episode, the quality just flew up. The characters got a lot more development, especially the antagonist. The story got more interesting. It was pretty amazing.And now everything is finished, and I haven't rated it higher than Franxx. Mainly because of the characters. I know I said that they got a lot of development in the second half, but not enough IMO. The more memorable characters were the antagonist, Akane, and one the of main characters, Rikka. They both had inner fears and insecurities. They did bad things, they did good things. They were very interesting. And even though the rest of the cast were fine, they weren't nearly as good as those two.So at the end of the day, I liked this show less than Franxx. It wasn't bad, it wasnät even average. It just didn't beat the thing it tried to beat.A solid 7/10 that I liked Franxxs beginning more than ending, I liked SSSS.Gridmans ending more than beginning. I haven't rewatched the episodes, so I don't know if there was information that could have been interesting after watching everything.

Yes, I was as blown away by Kill la Kill as everyone else, and the studio’s resolute embrace of the creative, freeform ethos of classic anime (especially its roots in the Gainax style of aesthetic as narrative) makes it arguably the strongest keeper of anime’s history today. But just because its creative process is steeped in tradition and it’s one of the few animation houses regularly putting out original works at a far higher rate than adaptations doesn’t...make it the best or most important studio, and it certainly doesn’t give it the exclusive keys to anime’s future. Lest we forget, the year that Kill la Kill supposedly saved anime for the first time was the same year that Attack on Titan blew the medium’s relative profile into the stratosphere like never before, easily eclipsing any negligible impact Ryuko and Senketsu had on the broader popular culture. Trigger is a studio like any other, as capable of succeeding or failing as the likes of Bones, Madhouse, A1 Pictures, Production IG, and all the rest. Perhaps it may at one point in the future create a story worthy of this hyperbolic praise, something that truly changes the anime landscape for the better as opposed to just helping carve out its own little eclectic niche. But it isn’t going to be this year, and it isn’t going to be with SSSS.Gridman.SSSS.Gridman is a particularly difficult show to talk about, because it’s a show where the long con of figuring out exactly what you’ve gotten yourself into is very much part of the point, and it’s nearly impossible to get into the details of what that entails without slipping into spoiler territory. From the first episode, it’s clear that there’s a far bigger picture at play than what we’re immediately made aware of, and it asks us to stick with it as it slowly lays all its cards down on the table. Yuta Hibiki wakes up with no memories of who he used to be, in a city where giant kaiju are part of the skyline. In absence of answers, he tries to fit normally back into his daily life, going to school and reconnecting with his friends. But it quickly becomes apparent that there is trouble afoot: kaiju have begun materializing within the city to wreak havoc, and the only one who can stop them is Gridman, a classic tokusatsu-style giant robot who Yuta is somehow able to connect with through a broken-down computer. Thus, it’s off to the races as Yuta and his friends tackle a series of weekly invasions by giant monsters, and the show only lets you get comfortable with that monster-of-the-week dynamic long enough to yank it out from under you as it starts pulling the mask off and revealing what it’s really about.I won’t get into any explicit spoilers, but safe to say there is a lot going on underneath the surface here, a sprawling network of ideas and themes weaving in and out of each other connecting to what exactly the kaiju are, where they’re coming from, and what it even means to be fighting them. There are a million different ideas bouncing around, a million little details hinting at the big picture lurking just beyond the horizon... and in a way, that ends up doing more harm than good. The show demands a lot of trust from you as its setting up its dominoes, giving you little teases of its master plan to keep you invested in finding out the truth. But it runs into an issue that a lot of similar puzzle-box narratives run into: it isn’t quite sure how to keep things engaging while it’s still teasing out all the details. The early few episodes of this show are honestly kind of uninteresting once the initial intrigue of the premise wears off; neither Yuta nor either of his friends are interesting enough on their own to wring real dramatic stakes out of, nor memorable enough personalities to coast by on the strength of their banter and interactions. In absence of finding any truly interesting directions to take them in, we’re pretty much just stalling for time until the show can get where it’s going and give something of substance to get attached too. And even by the end, none of these characters end being textured or engaging enough to warrant hanging the story off of them.But therein lies the clever little trick that clicks into place once Gridman finally stops playing coy; this isn’t actually the story of three kids using a giant robot to fight giant monsters. Again without getting too spoiler-y, it’s actually the story of their opponent, the person making the kaiju in the first place. And while the Gridman Alliance, as they come to call themselves, don’t have that much going on, the story of their classmate Akane Shinjo (who is revealed to be the kaiju’s creator in the second episode, so that’s not much of a spoiler) ends up packing some real goddamn punch. It’s in her that Gridman reveals its true game plan, and the result is a fascinating, almost abstract at times exploration of the human psyche that feels like a truer successor to Evangelion’s crown of philosophical robot-punching than pretty much every other pretender to the throne that’s cropped up in the past two decades. Not many stories I’ve seen have pulled off the “antagonist is actually the protagonist” switcharoo as well as this one does, and I just wish the show trusted itself enough not to leave that thread dangling for so long without much of interest to pass the time until it was ready to reveal its hand. The resonance of the later episodes really does end up throwing the emptiness of the early episodes into even greater relief; there really had to be a more efficient way to sneak in this genuinely great story without making the hook to its eventual reveal so lacking.It’s a damn good thing, then, that the production as a whole does its best to make up the difference and keep the proceedings from slipping into outright boredom while the story is still hemming and hawing en route to its destination. The Evangelion comparison I made earlier wasn’t just for lack of a more original comparison point; Gridman’s direction really does call back to it, using a lot of atypical shot compositions and heavily moody, off-kilter editing to leave you in a constant sense of unease. This is a show where there’s always something important happening on screen, always an important piece of information being conveyed by the cinematic language, and it helps keep your eyes glued to the screen lest you miss something important. And when the action kicks up for the big kauji battles, Trigger’s willingness to push boundaries truly shines through; this might genuinely be some of the best CG I’ve seen in an otherwise traditionally animated show, using the medium’s unique properties to give its titanic combatants a real sense of weight and momentum. You can tell how much love Gridman has for the tokusatsu series that inspired it; almost any one of these battles could easily be recreated by a pair of actors in rubber suits, save for the chaotic whirlwind of cool-ass street debris these lumbering titans kick up with every step.But I think this show’s real secret weapon is its cast; where the writing leaves Yuta and his friends distressingly bland, their voice actors do a hell of a job wrangling some genuine depth into their empty shells. Relative newcomer Yume Miyamoto, in particular, is really goddamn fantastic as Yuta’s friend Rikka Tarakada, capturing a kind of lived-in, weary teenage authenticity that feels as immediately star-making as Tomoyo Kurosawa’s similarly grounded turn as Kumiko Oumae in Sound Euphonium. Ditto Reina Ueada as Akane, delivering a performance that feels like emotional razor wire bleeding itself raw in poignant gashes. Forget the discussion around thicc thighs and big breasts that’s dominated the conversation surrounding this show; these two ladies’ best assets are the stirring power of their voices, a glimpse of the beating heart that I wish we could’ve seen more of. I wanted this entire story to be as good as when these two interact. I wanted every character feel as genuine as the connection built just through their performances. Gridman had the potential to be not just good, not just great, but genuinely special in a way that might have actually earned the “saving anime” moniker. And against all that, having to just settle for “good” feels like a waste.And yet, Gridman is still good. It’s lumpy and lopsided and takes far too long to get to the point, but once it gets there, the result is really kickass, really touching, and really goddamn powerful. The journey absolutely has its rough spots, but the destination is well worth it. make it the best or most important studio, and it certainly doesn’t give it the exclusive keys to anime’s future.

CG. And just like Planet With, Gridman is criminally underrated. I\'ve never written a review here before, but I just wanted to give my 2 cents about how I felt. I\'m not knowledgeable on the Tokusastu genre so I wasn\'t able to appreciate all the references packed into the series, but I still enjoyed the hell out of this show. If you are someone who appreciates art direction I highly recommend you watch this. There were so many interesting and well chosen shots that...keep you invested and unable to look away. The first episode does a great job setting the tone and is full of fantastic still images. I remember looking at an image of a staircase closed for repairs thinking ""why are these stairs mood"". The direction in this show put a fat grin on my face the entire way through, episode 9 especially.Most of the kaiju v Gridman battles are in semi-clunky CG models that somehow still feel awesome. They feel just like a Tokusatsu battle with humans fighting in giant monster costumes. I personally loved the CG fights but I can see how it could be off-putting to some.Don\'t get me wrong, this show is definitely not all style with no substance, not making the amnesia trope feel annoying is testament enough to the writing. There were many tense moments where characters from opposite sides had to interact with each other, rather than groups fighting by proxy through kaiju vs. Gridman battles, and each moment was perfectly satisfying. But like I said I don\'t write reviews and don\'t care enough to put out my librarian glasses and spend 30 minutes writing a literary analysis.SSSS.Gridman\'s mix of style, direction, and story make it an INCREDIBLY entertaining watch and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good art in their anime. keep you invested and unable to look away.

I suspected I might not like it quite early on. SSSS.Gridman had a lot of baggage to overcome. Unlike with Franxx, this was a solo project for Trigger. That boded well for me, but I still had a certain fear that the roots of the company would shine through and we'd end up with another mech-Gainax-wannabe. With both series, I went in not knowing anything except the studio information. And while Franxx was a struggle for me to sift through, SSSS.Gridman kept me binge-watching once it had finished airing. It...was everything I never knew I wanted.I think that what I really loved about this show is that it knew its predecessors. Often with shows like Franxx, Attack on Titan, or Sword Art Online, they try to brand themselves as very individual and erase the ancestor-like material. Gridman never pretended to be a hot, fresh take on the mech genre. It dutifully paid homage to the roots of mech pop culture. The art and sound were very impressive to me, and while it wasn't the new Evangelion, the atmosphere of it was extremely captivating. To me, it was like an 80s-90s experience but dressed up in a 2018 style. It was nostalgic and refreshing compared to more mass-produced trending shows.I haven't written many reviews on anime, because I tend to find them ranging from unnecessary to obnoxious. Generally, there tends to be a massive discourse surrounding certain shows. Whether I agree or disagree, I don't value arguing about anime on the internet. Gridman isn't trying to be a massive statement though. That's why I am so thrilled to make my own statements about it.I think it's okay that a lot of people weren't enthused with Gridman. Gridman isn't here to capture a massive wave of praise. What it does do, I believe it does well. For the 12 episodes I spent watching it, I was a kid again, experiencing science fiction shows for the first time. It is one of the purest watching experiences that I've had in a while. For people who don't value the same things as me or value them differently, this show was just another drop in the massive bucket of anime.

Gridman is a series that i did not expect anything for being a living reference to the tokusatsu genre, like Ultraman, it sequels, and the original live action Gridman serie. It left me with a bittersweet taste in my taste bud, but a little more sweeter than bitter.The story centers on Yuta Hibiki, a first-year student with amnesia who lives in the fictional Japanese city of Tsutsujidai. One day, he meets the Hyper Agent Gridman on an old computer, who gave the boy a mission he must fulfill, just as he has to look for the meaning of those words and his memory loss....While that happen, the day reset by some reason and when someone die, they will not come back. In my opinion, it sound interesting, but it didn’t squeeze the reset as much as I wanted. It answered how the day is reseted and what would happen if those shadowing kaiyus were killed, but it could be used in a different way to give more character development to the protagonist. How? Killing more characters. Important characters. What I meant with the reset the day is that the fights of Gridman and the buildings destroyed during the fights disappear from the people’s memories and the buildings turn back as it was before the fights.It reference attacks like: jump and do a karate chop in, mid of the air, to the kaiyu's neck or the shoulder, if it has one, or grab the kaiyu's neck then lift it while it rotate and throw it to somewhere. Also, huge explosions are common, after eliminating the kaiyu. The need of a secundary hero, as a copy of the main hero. Then the color design of the hero, being red, the most prominent of Gridman, then gray and blue. For Anti is the color purple as the prominent color of it design, then the gold and gray. But a really great reference to this genre of super hero in specific is the movements and reactions of some kaiyu is their limited movement and how it react and counterattack. It give the sense if the kaiyu was really a person wearing a costume of a monster. In the first episode, the kaiyu always has a neutral face and the mouth open, or when the kaiyu rotate the head to hit Gridman, it didn't has any expression but the same face.Having as antagonist: a charismatic and human Akane Shinjo, although I can not say the same with Alexis Kerib, being a unilateral character as Gridman. About Akane Shinjo. Initially, she was a average antagonist, until she showed her human side, a depresses Akane Shinjo because everything she had done was in vain. Something that a person can empathize with it. While the protagonists: a forgettable Yuta Hibiki and Gridman, the friendly Rikka Takarada, and the most human of the group, Sho Itsumi. Why is he the most human?  During the 12 chapters, he has done anything remarkable and he is aware of it, leaving him into a semi-depression because of his impotence. Something that we could not see much. Anti, an intermediate character who was mistreated by Akane Shinjo and Alexis Kerib, while Rikka Takarada and Samurai Calibur were the ones who took care of him. His move from antagonist to protagonist was not forced but great either, Anti was an antagonist because he wanted to be on the lookout for Akane Shinjo, he uses the argument of wanting to kill Gridman as an excuse to have a goal in his life, although close to the end he questions it, and then become a ally of Gridman.The protagonist and the antagonist probably have a good or average designs, but they really don’t have a character development or just a little of character progression for some, like Sho Itsumi or Akane Shinjo. Yeah, she got one, near the end of the anime. We don’t know nothing about the protagonist, beside of their personalities, and a little bit of Yuta Hibiki’s past before his memory loss. The glasses guy said he was a nice guy. That’s it. How about the antagonist? Ha! None. We don’t even known how they got there. Or how Gridman and his comrades got there. Note, I haven’t watch the original source, so I don’t know anything about gridman serie beside this one. I think the only antagonist that I don’t really care of character development and progression are the kaiyus, except Anti, he is decent. They are just huge monsters with the only objective of destroying gridman. While that happen, the day reset by some reason and when someone die, they will not come back. In my opinion, it sound interesting, but it didn’t squeeze the reset as much as I wanted. It answered how the day is reseted and what would happen if those shadowing kaiyus were killed, but it could be used in a different way to give more character development to the protagonist. How?

What I meant with the reset the day is that the fights of Gridman and the buildings destroyed during the fights disappear from the people’s memories and the buildings turn back as it was before the fights.It reference attacks like: jump and do a karate chop in, mid of the air, to the kaiyu's neck or the shoulder, if it has one, or grab the kaiyu's neck then lift it while it rotate and throw it to somewhere. Also, huge explosions are common, after eliminating the kaiyu. The need of a secundary hero, as a copy of the main hero. Then the color design of the hero, being red, the most prominent of Gridman, then gray and blue. For Anti is the color purple as the prominent color of it design, then the gold and gray. But a really great reference to this genre of super hero in specific is the movements and reactions of some kaiyu is their limited movement and how it react and counterattack. It give the sense if the kaiyu was really a person wearing a costume of a monster. In the first episode, the kaiyu always has a neutral face and the mouth open, or when the kaiyu rotate the head to hit Gridman, it didn't has any expression but the same face.Having as antagonist: a charismatic and human Akane Shinjo, although I can not say the same with Alexis Kerib, being a unilateral character as Gridman. About Akane Shinjo. Initially, she was a average antagonist, until she showed her human side, a depresses Akane Shinjo because everything she had done was in vain. Something that a person can empathize with it. While the protagonists: a forgettable Yuta Hibiki and Gridman, the friendly Rikka Takarada, and the most human of the group, Sho Itsumi. Why is he the most human?  During the 12 chapters, he has done anything remarkable and he is aware of it, leaving him into a semi-depression because of his impotence. Something that we could not see much. Anti, an intermediate character who was mistreated by Akane Shinjo and Alexis Kerib, while Rikka Takarada and Samurai Calibur were the ones who took care of him. His move from antagonist to protagonist was not forced but great either, Anti was an antagonist because he wanted to be on the lookout for Akane Shinjo, he uses the argument of wanting to kill Gridman as an excuse to have a goal in his life, although close to the end he questions it, and then become a ally of Gridman.The protagonist and the antagonist probably have a good or average designs, but they really don’t have a character development or just a little of character progression for some, like Sho Itsumi or Akane Shinjo. Yeah, she got one, near the end of the anime. We don’t know nothing about the protagonist, beside of their personalities, and a little bit of Yuta Hibiki’s past before his memory loss. The glasses guy said he was a nice guy. That’s it. How about the antagonist? Ha! None. We don’t even known how they got there. Or how Gridman and his comrades got there. Note, I haven’t watch the original source, so I don’t know anything about gridman serie beside this one. I think the only antagonist that I don’t really care of character development and progression are the kaiyus, except Anti, he is decent. They are just huge monsters with the only objective of destroying gridman."", 'Godzilla represented the fears and destruction of nuclear weapons, so what if a lonely human created kaiju, then what do these human created kaiju represent for the one that created it?SSSS.Gridman is something like a modern retelling of the 1993 Gridman the Hyper Agent tokusatsu series. SSSS.Gridman follows Yuta Hibiki voiced by Yuuya Hirose having woken up with amnesia but later on told by Gridman voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa on an old computer screen that he has a purpose, with his friends Rikka Takarada voiced by Yume Miyamoto, Akane Shinjou voiced by Reina Ueda and Shou Utsumi voiced by Souma Saitou to help him out,...until the kaiju\'s appeared...Some Spoilers Ahead...Now LA really doesn\'t watch tokusatsu series but was mildly interested in Power Rangers at one point or another, but nonetheless the basic premise is nearly the same as it\'s 1993 counterpart, but where SSSS.Gridman is different is where one certain character just changes up the formula of what would be a typical ""monster of the week"" serial, that being Akane Shinjou.SSSS.Gridman has two main plotlines that it goes throughout the anime, one of Yuta and how he is linked with Gridman, the other of Akane Shinjou herself. Yuta\'s story is mainly fixated on his amnesia and who he is which coupled with his friends interactions and the strange instances of the city and it\'s people ""resetting"" as it were to piece together why the kaiju appears and that answer comes in Akane Shinjou, see Akane Shinjou is shown VERY early on that she\'s not the typically nice genki girl, as she\'s the one creating the kaiju for her own personal reasonings, some for the mildest of indiscretions and tries killing them. The typical monster of the week plays out for the both Yuta and Akane with Akane closing in who Gridman really is and Yuta closing in as to the strange incidents being linked to Akane in the process. There is one chaos factor as it were and that is Anti voiced by Kenichi Suzumura, a kaiju made human having a vendetta against Gridman and something of a repeatable monster that Gridman and Yuta fights often within the anime and he later get major character development on it\'s existence as a human-kaiju.Yuta\'s plotline IS interesting as it ties up loose ends as ti were, but the downsides are that Yuta is something of a doe-eyed main male protagonist with his amnesia NOT helping matters and he\'s a little bit dense but not too dense as it were which is probably helped with the Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Students (yes really that\'s their group name), 4 suited mysterious people who give Gridman different transformations and this being adapted from a tokusatsu series, YUP Gridman can combine with them. Anyways the Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Students are like the voice of reason to Yuta as well as Utsumi and Rikka in many ways and it\'s because of their involvement they make things interesting to say the least, not only because of Gridman\'s fancy new weapons but with the character interactions, LA\'s favourite Neon Genesis Junior Highschool Student being Borr voiced by Aoi Yuuki, for having the Macross Missile Massacre installment but also for her brash personality. With favourites, LA\'s favourite character would definitely be Rikka Takarada as her personality and involvement in the anime was just interesting compared to Yuta and Utsumi, though Utsumi was something of a audience surrogate, especially towards the tokusatsu fans.Now for Akane, the MOST interesting character of the anime, with Akane able to create kaiju it embodies her desires and feelings as it were, she is something of a god as it were and the dynamic of her obsession with kaiju and making friends comes full circle for LA when it compares to Yuta\'s situation of being the ""hero"" that fights against the kaiju, as it were dispelling the negative emotions Akane creates with the kaiju in the city. For LA\'s interpretation, Akane WANTS to have friends as it were and she is already popular but with her being a god, is her being popular is fake due to how she orchestrated it all and she\'s creating kaiju not only because it\'s something she likes to do but to also get Rikka to truly be her friend in the process?, as both of them share a great deal of screentime together. There\'s also the notion of the ""god complex"" as her having a world all to herself, she one, can\'t handle the outliers and two, her personality leads herself into almost self-destructive state that she would rather destroy it all, not helped by Alexis Kerib voiced by Tetsu Inada the bigger bad as it were. Akane is a pretty complex and interesting character and bringing up that Akane is the Big Bad very early on was refreshing and different to say the least and what they do with her later on and thoroughly commit to this was executed excellently.SSSS.Gridman\'s animation is impressive to say the least and from Trigger along with Tsuburaya Productions who does special effects on tokusatsu shows, this to be expected, with many of the kaiju battles being 3DCGI but used excellently well and the motions and choreography being somewhat intentional to harken back to the old tokusatsu series but still the level of animation was amazingly done. Character designs are vibrant and interesting looking, with standouts from Akane, Borr, Anti and Rikka to say a few. Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions did amazingly well to modernize a tokusatsu into anime format with detailed background work, character designs and those awesome CGI Gridman vs. kaiju fights were the icing on the cake. Expected Trigger but also major props to Tsuburaya Productions for making the CGI seamless to the traditional animation done with Trigger.As for voice acting, well LA will commend Reina Ueda as she once again for LA has been typecasted but exceedly typecasted well as Akane, in voicing another ""genki character with bloody steel""-type characters (the other one LA can remember is μ from Caligula) but seriously Reina Ueda easily earns LA\'s MVP award in terms of voicing acting as she went all out with this role. The rest of the voice cast were great as well, from Yume Miyamoto as Rikka who had some great emotional range, Kenichi Suzumura as Anti, sounding like a semi-hyped Accelerator most of the time and Hikaru Midorikawa as Gridman for the name attacking moments which SSSS.Gridman does OFTEN. What can LA say a great voice cast!SSSS.Gridman gives us two spices as it were with either one pleasing, if you want to see kaiju fights then get your adrenaline pumped for that with it\'s amazingly done animation work done by Trigger and Tsuburaya Productions, but if you want intrigue, character development and interestingly drastic changes to the plot that accompanies the kaiju fights then that will satisfy  you as well, SSSS.Gridman does have some weakness with both these plotlines converging of course, that of our main protagonist may not be a bit bland with Rikka and Utsumi taking up the slack but that\'s a small flaw to what is a great anime celebrating tokusatsu in all it\'s CGI glory.Thank You Gridman and welcome to the Melancholy of Akane Shinjou until the kaiju\'s appeared...Some Spoilers Ahead...Now LA really doesn\'t watch tokusatsu series but was mildly interested in Power Rangers at one point or another, but nonetheless the basic premise is nearly the same as it\'s 1993 counterpart, but where SSSS.Gridman is different is where one certain character just changes up the formula of what would be a typical ""monster of the week"" serial, that being Akane Shinjou.SSSS.Gridman has two main plotlines that it goes throughout the anime, one of Yuta and how he is linked with Gridman, the other of Akane Shinjou herself.

Gridman almost adds nothing new to the genre, really. A boy wakes up with a severe case of amnesia, gets pulled into a series event that he doesn\'t even know of, with a righteous, justice-oriented partner. But the twist at the middle of the series genuinely surprised me, I\'m looking forward for more of what the series has to offer.Art: 8/10The character style of SSSS. Gridman makes it clear that it\'s a show from Studio...Trigger, it has problems here and there especially at 5/6 above perspective, but I feel like it does the job well and so far I don\'t have a really major problems with it. However, the use of CG for the Kaiju fights is the one that really pulls me in. At first glance it looks mediocre at best, but after a while I\'ve grown to like it to the point that I feel like I\'ve fallen in love with it. Seeing that this show is a throwback to classic Tokusatsu series the use of CG really captures the ""Actor in a big suit"" feeling which makes the Tokusatsu series iconic in the first place, but sometimes the switch between the CG and hand-drawn (not actually) scenes can be a little jarring.Sound: 7/10Now, I\'m not really a master when it comes to sound design, but I really, really like the sound design of SSSS. Gridman. The sound effects of Gridman\'s fist clashing with a Kaiju, I really enjoy all of them.Character: 6/10When it comes to characters, I feel like the show doesn\'t really focus on this as much with the Kaiju fights. Sure, the characters have personalities but only 2 relationships (I\'m being vague in order to avoid potentially major spoiler) are the only ones that\'s interesting and has some actual progress despite the amount of characters. For me it\'s fair, nothing more nothing less.Enjoyment: 10/10This show really takes me back to the times when I was still 6-7 years old watching the Ultraman series. The combining scenes, the beam scenes, it really makes me feel like an innocent child when I don\'t say a show or some form of entertainment is bad because it\'s bad, but because I don\'t enjoy it.Overall: 9/10SSSS.

I would be a sucker for those in a heartbeat. Considering this is coming from someone who grew up watching Power Rangers as a kid, I would have fallen in love with the genre to begin with.SSSS. Gridman is actually a reboot of the original of Gridman since the people behind the Gridman series, Tsuburaya Productions collaborated with Kill La Kill and Darling of the Franxx studio Trigger.Story - The shows prime focus is on Yuta and his friends Rikka and Utsumi. Yuta and his friends discovered a run down computer that...has Gridman inside. Ultimately, Yuta and Gridman, alongside with the help of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students, decided to team up to stop giant monsters, also known as ""Kaijus"" from destroying the city. The person making the kaijus is Akane, who is also a classmate for the Gridman Alliance in school. She is also being manipulated by Alexis Kerib to create these monsters.It\'s a very bare bones plot at first, but it does change things around at the last few episodes. Despite the fact that Yuta is Gridman himself, the anime doesn\'t focus a whole lot on him in terms of plot. He has important roles in the story, but the show focuses more on the other characters. More specifically Rikka and Akane and their relationship with each other. The ending was a great way to end off the series in my opinion.Characters - The characters did take some time getting used to. Some of them I like but other ones didn\'t leave a huge impact on me. That\'s not to say they\'re bad by any means. They are developed as the show goes on and they do liven up the plot. Akane is honestly my favorite character simply because she stands out from the crowd by just being this evil mastermind who loves to live in her own fantasy world. To a certain degree, I also sort of relate to her. I too want to live in my own fantasy world where I can have as many friends as I want and do whatever I want to do (though I\'m not going to send monsters out to destroy things. I\'m not that evil.) I loved the chemistry between Rikka and Akane as well. Rikka knows that even with all of the terrible things Akane has done, she still refers to Akane as her friend. It\'s a touching moment that\'ll leave an impact on you.Everyone else though I can\'t really say a lot about. I think my least favorite character has to be Yuta. I did like him at first but as the show goes on, he really doesn\'t contribute too much to the series besides becoming Gridman and having amnesia. I did like his chemistry with his friends though, much like with Rikka did to Akane. And he does have his moments with Akane as well, but besides that nothing too noteworthy.Art & Sound - Since this is Trigger making it, you know what you\'re in for. The animation looks really damn good. The 3D fight scenes look fun and frantic and the 2D animation is bright and colorful too. I\'m a huge sucker for those kind of animes and I will gush about them non stop if I could. And the music is also damn catchy. I do like the OP and the shows soundtrack. They utilize background music perfectly, fitting with the tone of the series. If they released the soundtrack, I would buy it in a heartbeat.Verdict - I liked this anime. True it has faults but it more than makes it up for it by having a good plot, great animation, and a faithful source to the original Gridman series. If you loved the original Gridman, then you\'ll have a blast with this one. And even coming from an outsiders point of view, I still enjoyed it.Score - 7/10 has Gridman inside.

People who are not able to appreciate the creativity and care that went into the series are smoking something.Gridman is not a simple monster of the week beat-em-up as it might appear based on the first few episodes. On first watching the first three episodes feel almost formulaic, but soon it becomes clear that there is far more to the story.Aside from the character development, the standout aspect of this show is the cinematography and how it is used to effect visual storytelling. Nearly every shot is...dripping with implication and meaning; characterization also benefits from this as the way characters are posed and frames speaks volumes without requiring a word of dialogue. It's clear that the creators of this show are masters of the craft and had a clear vision for what they wanted to create.I have two recommendations. One, don't stop watching until at least the 4th episode as the series takes about this long to really get going.Two, watch it a second time. There are many small but significant details hidden in plain sight that will make more sense and be appreciated more on a second viewing. dripping with implication and meaning; characterization also benefits from this as the way characters are posed and frames speaks volumes without requiring a word of dialogue.

This is something that I would only recommend to fans of mecha, trigger, or CG, and probably won\'t be something that I would consider re-watching. I had to give this show a 6 for a few reasons, but I would have given it a 6.5 if there was the option.The opening theme by Oxt is a complete ear worm with a filthy bass line. The soundtrack wasn\'t too shabby either.The CG was goofy in my opinion, but if CG decreases a project\'s production...costs enough for it to get made, then its not such a terrible compromise. Good animation, especially the backgrounds, apart from the CG.This anime was a bit over the top, and was very reminiscent of Tenga Toppa Gurren Laggan for that reason. (They even referenced/copied the drill break and Kamina\'s sunglasses.) I wish they didn\'t call out attack names constantly, but it wouldn\'t have been the same without that.The Kaiju/gridman\'s design felt a little underwhelming, especially considering the series is an original and not trying to remain faithful to the source material or anything. Gridman\'s style definitely borrowed a little too heavily from Gundam.The show\'s concept was interesting and pretty original, as far as I know, and sacrificed being well explained for the sake of not over-explaining things to death.Voice acting/casting and character design were well done. I can usually find at least one character that irritates me to no end in every anime, but the characters in Gridman were mostly reasonable.The pacing was consistent, and with only 12 episodes, this is a quick watch. costs enough for it to get made, then its not such a terrible compromise.

Gridman\'s style definitely borrowed a little too heavily from Gundam.The show\'s concept was interesting and pretty original, as far as I know, and sacrificed being well explained for the sake of not over-explaining things to death.Voice acting/casting and character design were well done. I can usually find at least one character that irritates me to no end in every anime, but the characters in Gridman were mostly reasonable.The pacing was consistent, and with only 12 episodes, this is a quick watch.', ""“With all the might and justice bestowed upon me, with the sacrifices of my brethren whom the bond between them in me is deeper than blood and stronger than steel, I shall pass judgment on thee, JUSTICE BEAAAAAAAAM!”Just as nostalgic and cliché as the intro to this review, SSSS.Gridman brings back a familiar side of the genre that speaks to a lot more than nostalgia for some of us. Before the modern Gundam spread was a thing, going back to the root of the classic display of brutal punch exchange between a heroic giant robot at corner A, and a barbaric Kaiju roaring a corner...B. A 90's theme song would play in the background as the hero speaks of his flashily named power moves that are often mixed with ordinary wrestling technique, fighting for justice on a battle that spans across multiple scyscrappers wide.SSSS.Gridman is by its very core, a modern shot at the classic Godzilla-Mecha fest which doesn't sacrifice a drop of the expected cliché moment that pretty much became a defining aspect of the mesh. But at a good price.- Story (6/10):To be honest, when it comes to similar shows, a ground-breaking isn't what you should be looking for, or expecting at the very least. It's all about the hardcore metal collisions that shake skyscrapers, as common sense and deep thinking has no place in making a bad Godzilla massacre better or a good one bad. And I'm not trying to say that there is not a single entry that managed to have both aspects going for it, it's just not a very critical rule of thumb that matters in these type of shows anyway.My biggest problem with the story was how horribly scattered everything was. They would drop some vital information on you that gets you to ask questions but never bother to address it or explain it afterward like you're supposed to get the meaning behind everything yourself. Pardon me, but I didn't know I was staring at a Picasso abstract when I first signed in.- Art (8.8/10):I would have increased my rating on this a bit higher, but it seems that decent CGI could only get you so far.I absolutely am not a fan of heavy use of CGI in Anime, and my greatest fear before stepping into this territory was just that. It doesn't get more classic than expecting heavy reliance of CGI in mecha related shows for how complicated it might get to animate everything and tie it up together, but God blesses SSSS.Gridman's animation team for the phenomenal job they did to sell the series, at least visually.The normal 2D artwork direction was just as fantastic if dare I say better, I love the color pallet, and even more so the gloomy atmosphere and complicated and messy backgrounds.The character designs were gorgeous, aside from Utsumi who looked as generic as you can get. All the Kaiju and Gridman action, on the other hand, was definitely the highlight, to see a skyscraper-size hand swing so swiftly and heavily until it messes a Kaiju's face making you feel the impact as if you took the punch instead. The use of complicated particles and VFX all over the place really helped blend in 2D and 3D nicely together. If anything, this might have been able to cure my ever-loving fear of CGI in Anime. And for that, I thank you, Gridman.- Sound (7.8/10):Let's get this out of the way. I never wowed hearing the opening song of the show until later in the series, maybe I had to get used to it, but no. I just wasn't ready to handle the epicness it had. I take its frequent use in the big fights a key to that. Sadly lyn I don't say much for the ending song, and I'm and ending song man.With that off the way, I can finally appreciate the voice acting.I thought the voice acting cast was decent in general, but God did I enjoy Akane and Rikka's performances, I don't know how, but those two make it work somehow, for the critical roles they take in this show, they sure were the right pick for whatever roles they handled.- Character (6/10):Not going to lie, I'm very disappointed in how the characters turned out to be. Yuta the main character, wait, did somebody say the main character? I literally mean it when I say that he had nothing that screams “main” character in him aside from his visual design. The same goes for every other main character.It's like they trying so hard to be relatable and strike a likable trope, I'm sorry, I couldn't relate, maybe other people did, but that was just my personal experience with them.Akane was an interesting choice of a character to the extent of me considering her the real protagonist behind the curtains.Maybe the reason behind that is that they try to pair up an older structured character “Gridman” with a more modern bunch of 21-century teenagers, call me gatekeeping, but Gridman's enthusiastic heroic boi didn't match very well the emo-edgelord group of characters.- Enjoyment (7/10):Let's be honest, crappy it may be, I could never hate my punch-porn worth of seasonal overhyped fest. I need it in my life.Yuta was never that great of a protagonist, or a character as a matter of fact, but he and everybody else helped deliver a blood rushing action-packed Kaiju kicking simulator. I really appreciate its attempt to take on similar vibes like FLCL, but no matter how hard it failed, it blessed us with a phenomenal episode that I'm sure to rewatch as a standalone episode on my free time.- Overall (7.12/10):I would probably recommend this, not for how game-changing it was, but for how really fun it stood for what it is. I would want to enjoy a city buster with a friend or two, there is no shame in that, ugh, also, don't forget the famous tights this show has gathered the attention on about. B.

May include spoilers.SSSS. Gridman would be a much better anime if it wasn't a mecha. Simple and clear. The plot and characters, if giant robots and transformers were excluded, would have shone more. I'm not implying I don't like mecha anime, if I did I wouldn't have even started watching Gridman. I just feel like the robot fights are so out of the blue, and it could be replaced with another kind of plot, like a mind/time-controlling power held by Shinjo.Also Yuta, being the main character, is even simpler than some secondary characters. How so?One...aspect I really liked about this show is its animation. You'll say: what? It's not even that good. Indeed! But it creates some kind of soft and warm atmosphere around the city and the places where the story develops. I love the scenery, even if the quality isn't the best.To sum up, what I'm enjoying (and think I'll enjoy) the most, are the parts of the episodes where relationships between characters (which are pretty bland anyway) are formed, and I rather skip the robot fights. aspect I really liked about this show is its animation.

In fact I give it an 8 out of 10 overall since it's not perfect, and in fact has some flaws or issues. That said, just form an entertainment standpoint, and if you're a kaiju or mecha fan, you'll enjoy this show a lot.For starters, and I do my best to not spoil too much about the story. It's a good story, but not great. The one spoiler I have to say to explain some things is revealed in the mid episodes about how world isn't...real, and is fact a creation of one main character. Now for this story it works well; however, it also leave some questions unanswered. Such as how this one person were able to create it, how this person got to this point, and so forth. Now these questions don't deter from the plot, but the lore creation is a little shaky here. Furthermore, there are other characters who developed in a way I may not fully agree with the direction. I won't go into too many details, but I will say how the hero ends up isn't bad at all, and is a good ending. Furthermore, the story in the 2nd half has more psychological elements, and it was presented well. Therefore, the ending fits the world I mention how it was created by one person and not our actual world.That said, beyond some of the basis of the world, the main story of the main characters, their issues, and how they interact is well done. I truly enjoy Trigger's character creation from their aesthetics to their personalities overall. The characters goal is to fight off the Kaiju that keep invading their city, and somehow resets the world after every battle. That is the premise of the first half of the story until things are revealed, then it shifts to handling the world's creator. The overarching premise is fighting the Kaiju that invade the world, and figure out why and where they come from. Everything comes full circle in the end, and it works.Moving beyond the story which is the most complex aspect of this show, the animation is amazing. I mention the character designs earlier, and I stand by how they have a great designs. The same thing goes for the Kaiju designs overall which are basically cool and fun. As a Godzilla fan I enjoyed this show a lot, and the battles were beautifully well done. Minus a few scenes here and there where the CGI stood out a little bit, but the animation was pretty flawless. Even the non-action scenes such as everyday life were beautifully presented.Meanwhile the sound design was amazing as well. Since this is a giant monster fighting show, I expected top notch sound design, and we got it. The roars of the kaiju was good, and the action sounds from attacks to direct hits was amazing. It almost had an Evangelion feel at times during the battles, and Gridman's theme was awesome.Overall it's a very good show. From an entertainment value alone you wouldn't have feel to waste your time. That said, my only issue is the story to an extent. The story works, and isn't bad at all. In fact, it's a good story. My issue is some questions surrounding the world leaves me wondering how the world came to be, how a certain character enter it, and so forth.

Before deciding to watch this, I\'d never heard of Gridman the property, and from the experience I have with Studio Trigger anime, was fully prepared for this to be just more of Trigger doing as Trigger does.  Narrative focus has never been their strong suit, always feeling like an after-thought in favor of action, humor, and ""the cool factor.""  So color me blown away when I watched Gridman to find, by God, an intimate, character-driven low concept drama draped in the typical Trigger fashion?!!Yes, as shocking as that may seem, this show is very much...a tight, smart seriocomedy focusing on just five characters and their feelings and relationships, reacting to each other and the changes they go through, using giant monsters and alien robots as merely a backdrop to set the stage.  More important than the focus being on the narrative, though, is that it is also done WELL?!  Now you must be doubly surprised.  Yes, I\'m glad to say that the characterization is the perfect balance between the typical simple, silly fare one might expect from Trigger, but with great attention to making them have real, human thoughts and feelings and reactions, subtle enough to organically understand them without needing to be over-the-top, shoved in your face oversimplifications or leaving them shallow and one-dimensional.  It never goes so far into being brooding melodrama, but has enough seriousness to also not be kiddy, mindless schlock.  Gridman is the ideal for what I think trigger should be striving for in terms of narrative focus.That said, if you come to this show seeking action, or even if you don\'t, you will still find the actual fighting to be underwhelming.  It feels mostly inconsequential exactly how the fights go down (until the last few episodes) and it\'s easy for your mind to wander during the combat scenes.  It\'s a shame that the individual characteristics of the large majority of the kaijus have no bearing on the narrative and diminishes the gravity they ought to convey.  Now, as much as I appreciate attention to the narrative, I\'m not a complete condescending 2deep4u snob.  I like me some kickass action, too, just not when it\'s mindless punch kick explosion garbage without purpose.  Thematically, the kaiju *are* just props, but they are also the impetus for the plot and having them be indistinguishable from each other beyond appearance emphasizes how underutilized the whole framing device of the show is.  The action is typically relegated to the last five minutes of the episode and during that time feels almost severed from the character development going on for the bulk of the screentime.The last two or three episodes really drive this home (while at the same time showcasing the potential for the interweaving of action and story.)  I really don\'t want to spoil anything but there\'s a certain kaiju in the 10th episode iirc that embodies the narrative themes of the current situation and while it\'s going about its course, the action AND the story coalesce into a perfect exemplar of having everything on screen matter without a single wasted thought.  It\'s really hard to convey what I mean without spoiling it so I hope that got through.  Because the last two episodes have the opposite and what I\'d consider the lowest point of the action, where it does just devolve into brainless bang and boom, and a lot of that I think can be attributed to the fact that this show is not entirely an original production.If you weren\'t aware, which I wasn\'t until halfway through watching, SSSS.Gridman is an adaptation, to some degree, of a 90\'s tokusatsu show (google that term if you don\'t know it because I\'m sure you will be familiar with the genre, just not the name for it.)  I don\'t know to what degree it adapts the 90s show and how much is original, as I\'ve never seen the live-action series and know nothing beyond my post-watch cursory googling.)  But in regard to the last two episodes, and some other aspects of the show, a good deal of it is clearly simple reverence on the anime creators\' parts to pay tribute to it.  The ultimate battle largely untethers the fighting from the core character-centric story you\'ve been watching before and only deals with the superficial plot elements.  While all the threads that have been developed throughout the show DO pay off, some of them suffer in terms of quality directly because they need to reconcile the overarching plot with the characters that have been building up in the show.  I will say most of it is satisfactory, but some of the pay-offs are clearly leagues above others.  Also, this is a minor spoiler but I think it\'s prudent to mention to other viewers going in blind: there is a character introduced in I believe the sixth episode who seems completely non-sequitur, but they are an allusion to the original show, being the successor to a one of the characters.  Just keep that in mind, I think you\'ll know by the end who I\'m talking about.  Without prior knowledge, that character is at best totally unexplained, but potentially detrimental to your understanding of the narrative.  There are many artifacts of homage to the original that detrimentally affect SSSS.Gridman as a self-contained experience, unfortunately.  That and the excellent build-up of the narrative elements having disparate pay-offs in terms of quality are the greatest points against Gridman and what stop it from being a 10/10.But those are the critiques and forewarnings.  As you can see, I still enjoyed this greatly and whole-heartedly recommend this show to all.

I used to like them as a mindless kid but they are rather cringe-inducing as an adult. It\'s B-movie cheesy-ness is an acquired taste. But like a lot of weird or fantastical styles of entertainment, it can become much more bearable in a less realistic medium such as anime. There is no guy struggling under an unwieldy monster suit or dorky ultraman costume, no toy guns or low budget effects, and no distorted facial expressions from actors trying to ham it up. The campiness is still there,...but you can focus on the more enjoyable aspects, like the monster and mecha designs and transformations, the fighting, and of course the explosions and ultrabeams. It\'s not too serious and has it\'s own quirky comedy.Until of course halfway through the series they decide to ruin the flow by introducing a whole bunch of crammed in, manufactured angst, existentialism, and drama. Not only do they have references to Neon Genesis Evangelion (a previous gainax/trigger anime), they are literally ripping the playbook from it scene by scene. Eery silence punctured by cicadas. Loud ambient noise of trains. Flashing traffic lights. Slow pans of characters laying in bed listening to music while deep in thought. Mumbling, half-baked conversations littered with confusion and trailing, abstract thought. All it\'s missing is the game of scrabble with bible references.They also run wild with the weak-willed, ground-staring, passive Japanese stereotype. The villain gets away with murder, hundreds if not thousands dead or wiped out of existence, without so much as a hand raised in opposition. Even an in-person stabbing of the MC yields no reaction from the dozen characters standing around, some carrying swords and knives, and the villain just waltzes out. This passivity and hesitancy extends to any and all meaningful dialogue and actions. A giant monster is rampaging and the MC is running out the door because no way is he going to let them die, but then his friend tells him to wait, mumbles about something frivolous, people die in the meantime, and then the MC goes nonchalantly back to his hero work. You wonder how ER doctors in this world even perform operations. There\'s a car accident. A man is rushed in. His head is hemorrhaging profusely. The doctor starts to stabilize the patient, but his colleague suddenly starts mumbling, ""eeto, eeto, ano, that thing I said yesterday. I mean, I\'m not sure...but. It might be something, I\'m not sure how to say this, possibly, could be, didn\'t really mean to, but maybe, you might understand, but I didn\'t mean to, truly, say it in that way, but just, hope that it wasn\'t misconstrued in such a manner, but was actually what I really wanted to say, or that\'s what I think I wanted to say but am unsure."" A loud persistent beep is heard as the patient flatlines, because it would be rude otherwise to interrupt someone in the middle of them bearing their very confused soul out to you.Either stick with the light-hearted campiness and one-dimensional characters or properly build a convincing narrative with genuine character development. Don\'t shoehorn a convoluted, pretentious plot at the tail end and spin your characters into something they aren\'t.The animation is high quality and especially the mecha and monster fights have all the bells and whistles of 3D cel-shaded action without the awfulness of looking like inanimate video game models. It starts bogging down later on though, as you see some of the same canned animations more than once and some of the cheap canned explosions are used to cover up the screen and save the animation budget. There\'s even a deja vu episode that is nothing but reused assets from the first episode, as if the NGE influence wasn\'t beaten enough to death. As well as the sound, following NGE, is mostly ambient noise. There are some short, unremarkable tracks during initial fight encounters, and the victory theme is just the opening theme and gets grating fast. but you can focus on the more enjoyable aspects, like the monster and mecha designs and transformations, the fighting, and of course the explosions and ultrabeams.

You wonder how ER doctors in this world even perform operations. There\'s a car accident. A man is rushed in. His head is hemorrhaging profusely. The doctor starts to stabilize the patient, but his colleague suddenly starts mumbling, ""eeto, eeto, ano, that thing I said yesterday. I mean, I\'m not sure...but. It might be something, I\'m not sure how to say this, possibly, could be, didn\'t really mean to, but maybe, you might understand, but I didn\'t mean to, truly, say it in that way, but just, hope that it wasn\'t misconstrued in such a manner, but was actually what I really wanted to say, or that\'s what I think I wanted to say but am unsure."" A loud persistent beep is heard as the patient flatlines, because it would be rude otherwise to interrupt someone in the middle of them bearing their very confused soul out to you.Either stick with the light-hearted campiness and one-dimensional characters or properly build a convincing narrative with genuine character development. Don\'t shoehorn a convoluted, pretentious plot at the tail end and spin your characters into something they aren\'t.The animation is high quality and especially the mecha and monster fights have all the bells and whistles of 3D cel-shaded action without the awfulness of looking like inanimate video game models. It starts bogging down later on though, as you see some of the same canned animations more than once and some of the cheap canned explosions are used to cover up the screen and save the animation budget. There\'s even a deja vu episode that is nothing but reused assets from the first episode, as if the NGE influence wasn\'t beaten enough to death. As well as the sound, following NGE, is mostly ambient noise. There are some short, unremarkable tracks during initial fight encounters, and the victory theme is just the opening theme and gets grating fast.', 'If i were to boil down my viewing experience of Gridman to one word, its ""HYPE"". SSSS. Gridman is an anime reboot of a live action, tokusatsu (aka ultraman, power rangers etc) show from the 90s. Keep this in mind, take the goofiness of a kids TV program, stylized it as a Trigger anime then add a dash of seinen serious tone. This combination; the contrast between the absurdity of giant heroes fighting kaijus and high-schoolers dealing with loss and death, turns out to be a beautiful amalgamation of visual and auditory spectacular.Story:Every episode follows the basic Tokusatsu structure; discovery, contact, conflict and resolution....The Gridman alliance will go about their daily lives after resolution from the previous episode and discover a new threat. This comes in both the kaiju, their true enemies or even drama that they fear would affect the group\'s dynamics. Next is Contact, where the group or members of the group confront\'s said discovery (Hibiki\'s indirect manner of interacting with Rikka after she attended a mixer, the alliance\'s approach after knowing Akane\'s secret). Following that is Conflict, this is where you have Gridman fighting the Kaiju(s) and how the alliance have to adapt their approach due to the limitations of their memories. Finally resolution, Gridman fights the kaiju, struggles, then gets a power up from the alliance and beats the kaiju.Art:Beautiful, just fucking beautiful. Theres a lot of subtle nuance to the background and how they invoke this mundane atmosphere which is quickly demolished by the appearance of Kaijus. Gridman and the Kaijus are mostly CG but not the shitty quality kind that you see in the background characters of Hataraku Saibou or even Bunny-senpai. Theres a polish and this glossly tone to them contrasting them to the bland and flat colors of the world, indicating their abnormality in this world. There are several shots of our characters doing nothing but laying around, drinking tea, listening to music etc. All mundane tasks that we do in our real lives, theres not attempt to make these activities more lively or colorful because you cant and you shouldnt. Real life is boring, that is why we have fantasy, its escapism. Going back to the background designs, theres a later part of the show where you are shown this other world that is different from the world our character is based on. During those scenes, the lines between CG and drawn animation are blurred to the point of indistinguishable. My final point for the art of the show; DRAWN EXPLOSION. If you\'ve watched Shirobako, you might remember this scene where 2 directors argue over whether to use CG or drawn explosion, the latter being more time consuming and costly. Every fight scene ends with this bombastic combustion from the defeated Kaijus (like the always do whenever the power rangers or ultraman defeats a monster) and its just so beautiful. The animation for these explosions are fluid and smooth and splashes on bright colors into this bleak and dull environment. If drawn explosions are truly more time-consuming as shirobako has pointed out, it has definitely paid off in terms of the emotions that is being brought out in those scenes.Sound:Soundtrack is beautiful, both OP and ED are made to get you hyped up for the next fight, especially the OP which brings forth the mixture of melancholy and excitement and accurately representing the dark and fun aspects of the show (dealing with/preventing loss and Gridman fighting Kaijus). Every fight will end off with the chorus of the OP being played, giving you that hope that Gridman is gonna prevail (like how they do in power rangers and ultraman). The sound effects used are beautiful, from the sounds of cicada in the summer, music leaking out of Rikka\'s earphones and other monotonous sounds of the real world to sound Gridman makes when he transforms or gets a power boost. These effects, while minor, adds up to the tone of the scene and hype for each fight.Lastly, the silence. There is little to no qwerky tune or songs played during our character\'s conversations. You only hear the conversations between our characters or whatever elements that was present in those scenes. This again hammers in the point that REAL LIFE IS BORING and reminiscent to my viewing of the first Digimon movie where everything outside the digital world was slow and dull. The lack of qwerky and fun music makes certain scene really serious and uncomfortable, ie Akane and Rikka on the bus, Akane\'s conversation with Hibiki at the River, making you pay close attention to the subtle nuance characters are doing/saying/implying.Characters:Without revealing too much about the show, the character dynamics for the most part is good. The strongest (and has the most layers) would definitely be Akane, Anti and the crew of Neon Genesis Junior High (NGJH). The rest with the exception of Rikka are pretty one dimensional but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Hibiki has amnesia and only has to rely on the alliance and Gridman. Utsumi is Hibiki\'s best friend and a Kaiju weeb and gets fired up during every fight, sometimes to his detriment.Our main antagonist Alexis, is your typical straight up evil being who exist only to destroy. He manipulates others and has no real motivation to see kaijus destroying the city other than ""he likes it"". That sounds really bad right? However, we get these scenes where Alexis interacts with the other members, engaging in candid dialogues and almost having a meal with Hibiki. Its almost as if destruction is just a hobby to this character, take that a way, he can simply become a normal person who jokes around his friends that no one would notice (apart from looking like a villain, but the restaurant owner seem to mind).The NGJH are the accessories and weapons of Gridman in human form. Each having their own distinct personality and preferences but are united under the Gridman cause, they serve mainly as the supporting cast but in the latter episodes, shown that they have a care for others and the Gridman Alliance crew (ie. Max cleaning the dishes behind the cafe counter).Anti is the underdog of the show and whose story is one of redemption and acceptance, basically Viral of Gurren Lagann, and theres no way i can hate such a character.Lastly everyone\'s waifu, Akane (whom i want to kick me in the face). Akane and the Alliance have this L and Kira dynamics going on for half the show. Both parties have information that the other does not and want to see the other fail. Its a game of cat and mouse to see who\'s gonna get who first. Theres no way i can elaborate further without spoilers so if you like the character design (or have a foot fetish), just watch the show.Overall:I\'ve seen a couple of bad reviews on this show and could only attribute them to the lack of understanding of the source material. This is an adaptation of basically ultraman. Theres gonna be cheesy moments because thats the very nature of the show. It is a show that requires you to play attention to for the subtle hints to certain phenomenon. Character motivations ranges from simplistic to downright complex, each with their own merits and watching that kind of character drama being resolved (like how they do in a good seinen show) is extremely satisfying. If i were to pick a flaw of the show, it\'d be the lack of screen time for NGJH since they\'re easily the most badass characters.

An episodic monster-of-the-week tokusatsu style show reminiscent of old school power rangers for me. Then something clicked with me as the Gridman started showing what it was about. There was always a looming oppressive feel over everything mostly due to the fact that there was next to no background music. Anything background noise related was always based on the scene creating this intense feeling that a kaiju was gonna pop up out of nowhere. The dialogue never drug its feet and every conversation had real weight and meaning never truly bogged down by exposition or...meaningless dialogue. Everything about this show just fell into place and really struck some sort of chord with me.Combine all of these story telling elements really fun and flashy and overall just hype battle scenes makes for a really fun watch for anyone who grew up with these shows/movies with great characters and an oddly sinister feeling to its world and that makes Gridman what it is. Sidenote, I have never seen a show end with a 15 second epilogue that completely changes the entire narrative of the show into something completely different. Shattering any preconceived notion for what the ""universe"" of the show was and adding insane levels of depth to an already technically deep show. meaningless dialogue.

Shattering any preconceived notion for what the ""universe"" of the show was and adding insane levels of depth to an already technically deep show.', 'This review contains spoilers.The first question to be asked is why do SSSS.Gridman decides to limit itself to a completely clichéd formula. It really grinds my gears to see a storyline with potential that decides to not invest in what makes it special. Instead, it invests exactly in what every other show already did much better than SSSS.Gridman ever could.This show has a personality crisis. SSSS.Gridman has no idea what it wants to be. Is it a mecha show or a college slice of life with a twist? Because it surely can’t be both. Here’s the formula: The first 10 minutes of every episode...was college slice of life, and then the last 10 minutes were straight mecha action. I’m certain that if it tried to pick only one of the two genres, it would be a much smoother experience. Heck, the premise of Akane constructing its own world was a really cool idea that just didn’t deliver.SSSS.Gridman shows just how pointless a story can be. There is a massive screentime problem -  It starts and ends too slow for a show with only 12 episodes to spare. The first 6 episodes are all criminally short of explanations and the mecha fights are dragged around like we’re in Dragonball. Let’s not forget the production also added a pool episode just for the sake of pointless filler. This lack of proper screentime management led the show to have MANY plot-holes. SSSS.Gridman creates a universe, but can’t explain it in time. It creates characters but have no time to give them backstories. Even Gridman, the center of the series, gets completely shadowed by the lack of proper direction.Hibiki Yuuta is a bland and unappealing main character with no real objective. He is given a cliché personality with an even more cliché amnesia introduction. He has no backstory, never recovers from his amnesia, and has only ONE role in the entire show – to transform into not himself to fight some evil giant creatures. The story might have been better off without him taking unneeded screentime for himself.Utsumi and Rikka are simply useless characters that add nothing to the show. They are not involved with Gridman whatsoever, they get absolutely no backstory and no character development at all. Even when the show massively hints at Rikka and Utsumi being important for the storyline, all they get is a few lines of ‘motivational’ dialogue that can’t possibly have changed anything.Akane is the only solid character as she is given a unique personality and is quite a decent antagonist. She has proper motivations for her actions and is an understandable character from the viewers point (who, being a omnipotent god, wouldn’t make some unwanted people disappear from Earth?). Even though there really isn’t much of her backstory revealed (of when she got to meet Alexis, how did she become a god in the first place, and even the horror that is the last scene shown in the last episode), at least we got what we got and that was okay.Nazo gets a lot of screentime and some development but without proper background it doesn’t really stand out. The rest of the characters aren’t given any proper screentime to judge or are simply usable plot devices to make the story go forward.When the story has many flaws and the characters can’t stand up for themselves, the conclusion just can’t work. The climax is never there because there was no build-up in the first place. The storyline starts, and then ends, and you are left hanging like “was that it?”. Why did Akane create the world? Why was she always with Alexis? Who are the supporting characters that transform into Gridman parts? Why does Gridman fight? WHO IS GRIDMAN? SSSS.Gridman makes a very strong case that it does NOT want to address these questions. And it is all a damn shame.It’s an okay show animation-wise. I am not a fan of the 2D-CGI mix, even more when the last fight scene suddenly wants to go 2D, but the CGI was bearable. There are A LOT of recycled scenes that really kind of bothered me, and it bugs me that the episode with the best animation was the pool episode.Soundtrack was nothing special. was college slice of life, and then the last 10 minutes were straight mecha action.

It's an atmospheric mecha mystery show that also follows monster-of-the-week formula.While the mystery elements are weak, the characters and their interactions are complete blunders. The show is heavily focused on studying and developing the complex relationship between the heroes and the main antagonist, who are friends but also enemies. 2/3 way into the show it is revealed that the antagonist is actually a god, and that the main cast only likes her because she built the world and made everyone like her....what? This plot point completely undermines anything that was even remotely interesting about these characters' relationships and...Akane herself. Oh, and later on it is also revealed that Yuuta, who was supposed to suffer from amnesia, is actually not Yuuta but Gridman, who is in no way related to Yuuta's friends, Rikka and Shou.Way to go Trigger! You just undid all the character development in the series, as the supporting cast has absolutely no depth. What was the point of the series again? Akane herself.

The story quickly moves from simple fights against Kaiju into the mystery of their reality.But that's not what this anime is about...either. It's a meta story, about the experience of watching anime. It deals with why we love all these characters, the good and the bad, and what effect they had on us when we were kids. About how they expressed our emotions when we couldn't, and how they let us dream of a brighter future, where we would have the power to could defeat anything that was getting us down. either.

It’s more directed towards fans of older super robot or tokusatsu shows, but it’s a fine watch even for people who aren’t into that stuff.--STORY—Gridman’s story is both fairly standard, and goes for some unique stuff here and there. Pacing is solid enough, and I don’t particularly have any qualms with it. The first half is mostly your average monster of the week toku style show with Gridman getting to show off its various forms, and you get some slight...plot development but nothing major. The 2nd half actually starts to get interesting, but I wouldn’t call it anything amazing. I like the concept of a god trying to make their own ideal world, and not being able to control it as it steadily falls apart and even entraps them before being saved by the very creations she toyed with. The actual execution of the concept isn’t particularly great or anything, but it does the job well enough. Seeing the characters try to find out the mystery behind the world and what is even going on is mostly engaging, but I can’t lie and say I wasn’t more interested in the actual fights/action most of the time. Though the main reason I find it hard to stay engaged is the characters, and speaking of…--CHARACTERS—The protag characters are quite frankly boring. The character designs themselves feel average, and the only somewhat cool designs are the Neon Genesis squad peeps however there are wasted on fairly one dimensional characters. The main trio themselves get good enough growth, but I wouldn’t call it compelling or anything.On the flipside however, the antags were actually quite enjoyable. Anti’s growth from basically being an animal made human, to his own individual who decides what he wants to do beyond just fighting Gridman is nice to see. Alexis is quite enjoyable since what he lacks in depth, he makes up for in an entertaining personality. Akane in particular was a really great antagonist, and her close relations to the cast made for a great catalyst for her growth. Overall, she easily has the best growth of any character in the show, and while I’m not too fond of her basically being forgiven in the end despite the numerous people she killed…I mean what is anyone gonna do lol. It’s implied she can be killed in the world, but considering Akane seems to be a real life girl who retreated into her own world instead of facing reality head on I just wonder.I’ll make one last note saying I do like the rather natural dialogue. There are pauses in conversation, normal reactions, etc. It works well, but it would’ve worked much better if I didn’t find the cast mostly boring.--ANIMATION/ART--I honestly don’t really have any problem with the 2d animation of Gridman. I could be extremely nitpicky and maybe point out a few examples where the animation had some QUALITY going on, but it’s pretty consistently great. Most of the backgrounds are quite pleasant to look at. I’d say my biggest issue is the cgi animation. I don’t have too high expectations when it comes to cgi mecha action admittedly, but here it can just come off as jarring. I can’t really complain about the large reuse of stock footage as that is the norm for this genre, but what I can say is that a bunch of very clearly cgi buildings and cars coming towards the screen does take one out of the experience. It’s a shame too since there are sometimes great 2d shots of Gridman, and the final battle is nearly entirely 2d animation and is beautiful to look at. In the end though, the cgi animation is “good enough to work, and there are some great action moments trickled across the series.--SOUND—Gridman’s music is pretty good. The OP is very catchy. I would’ve preferred maybe a slightly larger amount of songs to listen to during scenes, but it does the job. The actual ambience and sound effects during the silent, convo focused moments are great. I watched dub for this, and all the actors did a great job on their performances. They were able to do reserved, emotional, and intense scenes all well. Akane, Alexis, and Max’s va’s in particular were my favorite.--Enjoyment—Despite my flaws with Gridman, it’s still a nice modern mecha show to watch. If it was any longer I might have more complaints, but the ep count is just about perfect. Watch it if you enjoy old mecha, tokusatsu, or just some good Trigger mecha. Dynazenon has now started, and while there’s only 2 eps out I’d say it improves on problems I had with Gridman already. plot development but nothing major.

Toward the last couple episodes certain aspects of their setting/world just isnt properly explained well enough for my satisfaction.But I do have to say the story is interesting and kept me on edge.Animation: Before watching...I had my doubts in CGI, But in my opinion it looks awesome and they did a great job.Soundtrack: there doesnt seem anything that really stands out to execpt the intro which is pretty good.Characters: so some of the characters motives don`t make sense, But lets be honest Rikka is the best anime girl of 2018 lets go!!!!Overall: I gave it a 6/10 which doesn't make any sense due to my aspects I reviewed, But No Spoilers the ending didnt satisfy and I`ll leave it that to anyone who still hasn`t watched this.I would still recommend it though  thank you for readingWatch my Drunk Review videos on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQgUunFHoK8PyuVPvlVL8Q I had my doubts in CGI, But in my opinion it looks awesome and they did a great job.Soundtrack: there doesnt seem anything that really stands out to execpt the intro which is pretty good.Characters: so some of the characters motives don`t make sense, But lets be honest Rikka is the best anime girl of 2018 lets go!!!!Overall: I gave it a 6/10 which doesn't make any sense due to my aspects I reviewed, But No Spoilers the ending didnt satisfy and I`ll leave it that to anyone who still hasn`t watched this.I would still recommend it though  thank you for readingWatch my Drunk Review videos on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQgUunFHoK8PyuVPvlVL8Q"", ""Watching this anime is a very mixed experience. This anime succeeds in being so much incredibly bad and boring, but the end makes it change your mind by,,,a lot.Why do we enjoy shows like this? We can have joy by watching well written characters get together, or enjoy a good plot.SSSS. Gridman has very, very big big gap between the characters. On one hand we have the most uninteresting, annoying and shallow characters you would expect from an action anime: a nice guy, an only male friend, a r34 girl and a lot of other characters which names you will forget just a...day after. This anime has only one character that is worth mentioning. She is the main antagonist and i would say it's funny how much more she brings into the overall quality of the anime than the other hollow main characters.This show doesn't have comedy in it, which is crucial in making your audience attached to your characters. Their chatter is boring, and most of the dialogue is pointed towards advancing the plot, which is weak too.The plot is as blank as you could ever imagine mecha anime's plot could be. There's a bad side and a good side. They fight each other and take turns superior to the both sides. Is it engaging? No. Do characters help the situation? No, there is either no comedy or romance.But it's only the first half and quarter of the anime. The end turns everything upside down and makes you think about whether you've seen anything like this before? Maybe everything they did with the shallowness of the main cast was intended? It's truly astonishing to know that the studio sacrificed all ambitions they didn't use just to make their point more clear. The story near the end is very interesting and engaging, comparing to the rest.Overall the artstyle and animation is pretty good. The character design has fallen into the modern anime's moe fashion and it's already explains the popularity.Overall, i recommend watching  SSSS. Gridman just for the end. It's worth it.

What I mean by this is that you can't necessarily understand whats going on around you, but you still want to know what the hell is going on and why things are the way they are.If you're a mecha fan,...then I'd say give it a try, as it's an interesting combination. But if you're not a fan of mecha, maybe just watch for Rikka's thighs. then I'd say give it a try, as it's an interesting combination. But if you're not a fan of mecha, maybe just watch for Rikka's thighs."", 'SSSS.Gridman is a show with a reputation problem. Coming off the heels of the dumpster fire that the ending of Darling in the FranXX was for the anime community in the first half of 2018, Gridman was not received with the same kind of fanfare other Studio TRIGGER shows prior got upon release due in part to the participation of the studio in the production of the former, despite not being the main production team (that honor being reserved for A1 Pictures instead). Between this, and the relative obscurity of tokusatsu shows in the west (beyond Super Sentai/Power Rangers), the initial reception on the show...was... mixed.Now, Gridman is not a show with the kind of explosive first episode hook that will get you in for the whole ride. Instead this is a show that rewards those willing to look into a slow burner of a story. Gridman begins awkwardly and throws you right into the thick of it without much initial explanation or context, however, by the end of the story all the pieces are assured to fall into place and give way to a very interesting take on the genre it takes inspiration from.< STORY: 8 >Like mentioned before, SSSS.Gridman is a story with an strange sense of progression that results in an awkward first episode. The problem of this strange pacing results in the show suffering from a bit of a deceiving first half that makes you think that this is just your standard superhero/mecha show: a completely by the numbers monster-of-the-week story spiked with fanservice. Gridman certainly does very little to make newcomers to tokusatsu feel welcome, and even with the context that being a fan of the genre can give you, there are plenty of questions posed early on that are just left hanging in the background. While this makes for an interesting mystery, the bulk of the first half is spent easing you into the sense that this show is about Hibiki Yuuta, your bland, run of the mill protagonist with amnesia, who battles the kaiju in his mecha/transformation Gridman, to save the city or whatever. I wouldn\'t fault you for thinking this, as it is exactly what I thought too and was the reason I almost gave up on it even I saw the show as it aired.The reality however is that Gridman is using its first six episodes or so as means to setup the events of its ultimate goal. Even for a monster of the week superhero story, the show has throughout a slight feeling that something is not quite right with the way things pan out. Our antagonist is called a god of the world our characters are in, but if this is the case why is it that whatever kaiju it throws at our heroes is never enough to defeat them? Why can\'t the antagonist just... erase them with its god powers? Why is it that the characters that die to the kaiju are erased from reality, as showcased during the second episode? Who is Gridman, what is the relationship it has with Yuuta and why is it trapped in a crappy 80\'s mainframe? There are a lot of questions like this that the show posits early but only decides to answer in the final third of its run.Without going into specifics and spoiling as little as possible, as it turns out, the show is not a monster of the week superhero story, but rather one about saving a lonely, tortured soul.  A lonely character that did not feel adequate in the world it lived in and allowed darkness to take control of themselves in exchange for unlimited power. This deal was however a ruse from the darkness to trap and use this soul for their nefarious purposes, something that a few would not stand for and so would fight to save the lonely character from damnation at the hands of evil. The reveals that allow the viewer to see the big picture take time to show up but when they finally do they never stop coming, one after the other, building towards an incredible climax and an ending that ties the story in a neat little bow.It\'s hard to unwrap what makes the story of Gridman work, however it is a story that has a lot to say about its main character and its struggles, the conflicts that led it down the path it did and, ultimately how Gridman is involved in this battle of good and evil. Along the way the story explores themes of loneliness, the struggle to connect with others and the toll it can take in one\'s psyche, as well as the unifying power of bonds of all kinds to be a beacon of light in that kind of darkness.< ART: 9 >The visuals of Gridman are, all things considered, very impressive. Studio TRIGGER is well-known for their wacky, highly exaggerated animation style that takes cues from both western animation and the influence of many of their senior staff members, however this quirky flair that they are so famous for is almost absent in this show. It\'s not gone as there are plenty of moments where the visuals just feel like the kind of thing TRIGGER is known for doing, but compared to other shows of theirs, like Kill la Kill or Inferno Cop, they are just not there. Instead, the animation style goes for detailed highly animesque style that switches up for CGI during the action scenes of the show. Everything is also infused with nods to the style of tokusatsu shows it\'s honoring. There are a couple of weird moments with the animation but given that the show is very consistently animated throughout and these moments are all found in the first episodes, it may be fair to say that they are intentional, though they are not all that well executed.The CGI is a surprisingly well done part of the visuals. The CG battles emulate with great accuracy the movements and mannerisms of actual tokusatsu, and only breaks with these conventions where it benefits more from a more anime-like aesthetic with 2D animations.The background art is also used to great effect in the show. The panoramas of the city, where giant kaiju statues loom menacingly from far away in an otherwise fairly average cityscape are great, but the background used in many of the later, more emotionally charged moments of the show are very impressive mood setters too.Altogether, the animation is the high point of the production values in this show.< SOUND: 7>By contrast, the sound design, while still good, doesn\'t do much to stand out in the crowd. While Gridman has a fairly good use of sound effects and proper use of their OST, very few tracks in said OST are worth mentioning. The OP is probably the one track in the entire show that deserves a mention as it is also the main theme for Gridman during the battles of the show and is very like to get stuck in your head after a while with its explosive cold opening.Beyond the OP, the ED has a good vibe to it, though it owes more to its visuals and what they entail to the plot, than what the music itself provides.< CHARACTERS: 8 >The characters of SSSS.Gridman are a bit of a conundrum. On one hand, they can feel pretty bland because they are characterized in a way that clashes with the more exaggerated characters in the show, while on the other there is a great degree of nuance that is easily missed in the way the main cast behaves (for the most part). This is all results in the characters of Gridman being a bit of a hard read for most of the story. That\'s not to say that the characters are badly written, just that the main cast can be hard to like on their personalities alone, at least initially. This is particularly noticeable with Yuuta, our hero, so to speak, who is amnesiac and can\'t seem to remember anything before the point when the show begins. This piece of characterization results in his personality being understandably devoid any distinguishing traits, in other words he\'s totally bland. There is a plot-related reason for the amnesia but it\'s not explained until much later and that makes it hard to relate to him, though then again the developments in the story down the lane make it seem like this is intended to an extent. All in all, Yuuta is an ambivalent character and probably the weakest in the main cast.If you want to talk highlights of this show, the best character is far and away that Akane Shinjo, who has a very central position in the plot as the antagonist of the show. Her character is so intricately linked to the plot that most of the points relevant to her have already been covered in the Story section, but needless to say, her involvement in any scene of the show almost invariably lifts it up in terms of narrative and this only becomes more pronounced as the episodes go by. It truly is a sight to behold how her story pans out in the end.The rest of the main cast can\'t really be discussed all that much in terms of their character development. That being said, this section wouldn\'t be complete without praising the character designs of the show. While this praise can be extended to the kaiju as well, the real stars here are the cast of characters. Yuuta and Shimizu have that typical ""shonen hero and his nerdy friend"" kind of aesthetic to them that fits in very well with the way the story conceals its final narrative initially, while the characters of Akane and Rikka got pretty attractive designs that no doubt reached the point of memedom, especially with the latter. The character designs are not all that unique, but they make up for it with a highly polished style and that is enough for them to be great.< ENJOYMENT: 8 >As much as the Gridman does to tell us a great story, the beginning can be a very rough start, especially if you are not familiar with tokusatsu shows, and that was the case for me. I only stuck around during that part due to starting to watch the show late when it was airing, which allowed me to binge through its slow start. However, the last third of the show provided such highs that they completely obliterated the mediocre start for me. So much so that it even left me a little shook by the time the final episode ended. The final episodes were such a wild ride and I loved them to bits.With all that in mind, I can say that the ending of the show was worth it for me. And it really tied the story up in a very tight way for me.< TL; DR >SSSS.Gridman is slow burn of a show that takes the ideas of the tokusatsu series like Ultraman and Kamen Rider or Super Sentai/Power Rangers and successfully translates them into a unique anime that pays homage to the genre while also telling an impressive story filled with both tragedy and hope, love and hate, and all encased in something as classically superhero-like as a battle between good and evil, with life at stake.While it is probably not for everyone, this is a great show that demands attention and will reward anyone willing to look past the more superficial elements of its story.< OVERALL SCORE: 8.0/10 = 8> was... mixed.Now, Gridman is not a show with the kind of explosive first episode hook that will get you in for the whole ride.

And it really tied the story up in a very tight way for me.< TL; DR >SSSS.Gridman is slow burn of a show that takes the ideas of the tokusatsu series like Ultraman and Kamen Rider or Super Sentai/Power Rangers and successfully translates them into a unique anime that pays homage to the genre while also telling an impressive story filled with both tragedy and hope, love and hate, and all encased in something as classically superhero-like as a battle between good and evil, with life at stake.While it is probably not for everyone, this is a great show that demands attention and will reward anyone willing to look past the more superficial elements of its story.< OVERALL SCORE: 8.0/10 = 8>', 'I never watched a minute of toku as a child, teen, or adult. Since SSSS.Gridman is a heart-covered love letter to that genre, I could take that as a sign that I should recuse myself from providing an opinion. But since my overall impression is positive, I\'m going to go ahead and add mine to the pile.SSSS.Gridman is a lightly metafictional take on the tokusatsu genre, injecting the classic action formula with MFA-ish storytelling priorities (e.g. depression, the nature of living in a narrative, etc). That\'s not a knock against it: crossing the streams takes us somewhere relatively unique. I\'d call it a more straight-laced...Samurai Flamenco, and that\'s good company.The focus is split between Yuuta, an amnesiac with a heart of gold (trust me, don\'t run away, it\'s set-up for a nice hat trick later on) and Shinjo Akane, a girl with both a Columbine High mentality and the ability to create Kaiju. Yuuta can turn into Gridman, who is somewhere on the all-caps JUSTICE scale between 1960\'s Superman and contemporary Captain America. You might guess that Akane is more interesting. You\'re right. But Yuuta\'s antics do have a classic appeal, and Trigger does their usual good job of leaning on the mechanics/standards of a genre for effect.The style of the fights takes a moment to get used to, but works marvelously. Trigger did an excellent job of giving the movements of the kaiju and Gridman variants a sense of scale and gravity. They lumber the way something of that size should. Thanks to the animation, and show underlining these battles having very real casualties, every building that gets knocked over feels like it matters.I have an odd relationship with the ending. I\'m fine with the outline of events, wherein Akane finds some measure of autonomy and acceptance. The last fight looks great, and they do a decent job of not leaving any threads dangling. Then there\'s the big ""but."" I think there\'s a tendency in spec-fic to associate going abstract with a good climax. And it can be done well. But in Gridman\'s last episode, I don\'t quite feel the sense of control that it takes to make that narrative work.I think it comes down to the pacing of the last episode. Most of this show works because of how deftly it handles it\'s atmosphere, and the doling out of information. That\'s a sharp contrast Alexis and Gridman shouting at each other about mortality, which feels a little familiar. Granted, you\'re supposed to see a few echoes of the past in a tribute like S.S.S.S.Gridman. But it\'s possible to get a little too much of a good thing.Samurai Flamenco had similar inspiration, and handled the home stretch a little more artfully. As someone that enjoyed both, I recommend it as a companion piece for anyone that vibes with the overall tone of SSSS.Gridman.It\'s a good time. Not perfect, but good. A fine choice for anyone looking for some extra optimism in their media diet.

However, it backfired, Utsumi is just a good friend of the protagonist, a talkative ""introvert."" So I think Utsumi is a wasted character.Or I misunderstood the director\'s meaning: you tokusatsu weebs are nothing more than supporting roles even in the virtual world, grow the *hyper* up and embrace reality...Ah, I see why it gives...me an EVA feeling... me an EVA feeling...', 'For this anime I have been excited from how I have watched the original ""Denkou Choujin Gridman""/""Hyper Agent Gridman"" which is the tokusatsu show that was made by Tsuburaya Productions. The art style is very good from how it stays to be relatively polished throughout with the sound doing a great effort to having depth. As for the soundtrack the songs sound very good but they rarely show up to fit in with the subtle tone of the story. The favorite song in the soundtrack is the opening and the cyber sounding theme that happens sometimes in the action moments in Gridman to show how...powerful he is or the mysterious world.For the story so far I am amazed from the amount of suspicion the show places on the characters and how the world works. What makes me very thrilled for the things that happen in SSSS.Gridman is that I always anticipate when stuff that is similar to the plot-points in the original tokusatsu show or any type of reference to the things inside that show. People who have seen the original tokusatsu or even Ultraman will be grasping into the style of SSSS.Gridman while for people outside that medium may have to dedicate some energy to watching it.In its own right SSSS.Gridman is a good show that balances from having mystery or suspicion moments for those who want a somewhat brain running story. And for those people who can get into the kaiju battles with Gridman. The show can be slow especially if you are currently waiting for the next episodes in this point of time, however I am excited for the upcoming climax that will reveal potential awesome moments and closure to the characters. powerful he is or the mysterious world.For the story so far I am amazed from the amount of suspicion the show places on the characters and how the world works.

Firstly, YOU WERE INTENDED TO WATCH ALL TWELVE EPISODES. The show REALLY doesn\'t work if you stopped at like, episode 4. I know, it starts off pretty shaky, but it DOES get better. Secondly, it\'s based off of a freakin\' Tokusatsu show, of COURSE there\'s going to be a lot of Gridman shows up and kicks a Kaiju in the dick. They establish pretty early on that it\'s in the same general vein as Ultraman. the amount of people who didn\'t get that is ridiculous IMO.Story: 9/10 SSSS.Gridman starts...off somewhat shaky leaning pretty heavy into the monster of the week format and not much else. Once you reach about episode 6 though the main plot kicks off, which is where I feel Gridman really starts to shine. the twist in the end of the show was fantastic IMO, though a lot of people who watched it didn\'t seem to understand it.Art: 9/10 There isn\'t really anything too standout about the art to Gridman IMO, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s not great. The 2D AND 3D are both well animated and I don\'t recall having ever seen any glaring animation errors.Sound: 10/10 This was one of the really great facets of the show. There\'s no background music when the great are just sitting around talking. That might sound weird, but it\'s really great. It makes conversations in the show feel more genuine, and puts emphasis on the soundtrack when it does actually run.Characters: 8/10  They\'re not super or deep or anything for the most part, but they\'re still generally entertaining. A lot of people clearly watched a couple of episodes and then either A, stopped watching, or B, decided they hated the show then continued to watch anyways (for some reason). I\'ve heard all sorts of weird allegations like ""Yutta is an edgy teen""(Were we watching the same show?) or ""Akane was there for fan service""(Dude CLEARLY didn\'t finish the show) but if you actually watch the show all the way trough these aren\'t really true. The only characters I felt were kinda neglected were Glasses guy (whose name I cannot remember) and Rikka (who kind of gets a plotline of her own?). I\'ve also seen people hate on Alexis, which clearly shows they really weren\'t paying attention when the show explained who Gridman was.Enjoyment: 10/10 It\'s not a perfect show, but it\'s pretty damn close IMO. TBF I do enjoy watching Tokusatsu though, so this show was kind of already in my strikezone. Overall I\'d say it\'s a fun show, but if you\'re going to watch I\'d recommend keeping a open mind and watching the whole twelve episodes.

If you are someone like me, an over-analysis person, you'll find a huge meaning within this series.{spoiler WARNING in 2nd paragraph}This anime looks like the average 12ep 1season anime, however, when looked into the details and characters depths one can suspect that the hidden story behind the colorful and action-packed episode is about depression or low-self esteem(Asian-style), the reason why I included Asian-style is because low self-esteem in most Asian nation(Japan for example) is so much different to that compare to the West.The anime is a sleep-dream of an anti-social girl[MC]....IRL, the girl[Akane] an otaku who likes Ultraman[a live-action TV series] and other Gundam shows. Within the dream, Gridman is a personification of her desire to move forward. The Kaijus are reasons to not move forward fueled by depression. Another character in the dream, Anti, could be interpreted as many things but the easiest is anti-depressants/meds. The character Yuta, who sits near the popular kid but is ignored has a crush on someone that drives them and has a friend with the same interests, is Akane in the dream experiencing spectator-style Lucid Dream.

What started off as ""holy shit this is some good R34"" became a mixed bag of emotions and thought thrown at me at about the last 4 episodes of the show.Spoilers are included, I don\'t know how to write this out without.Our MC, Yuta is more or less a blank canvas who just so happens to enjoy good ol tree-trunk-thigh Rikka, and while perfect to project whatever personality you\'d want onto him, is also the biggest flaw in my opinion. This isn\'t a ""pick your own story"" like Skyrim or Fallout, this is...a story that wants to guide you through the experience, and a blank canvas achieves not-that.Rikka is pretty much what led me to check out Gridman. Aside from having unnecessarily thicc thighs, she\'s relatively quiet throughout the show, and her ""friendship"" with Akane was only somewhat utilised during the final episodes of Gridman. Not that it was a poor execution, hell I think it was a decent idea that wasn\'t executed as much as it should have to make the story somewhat engaging.Akane is probably the star of the show. She\'s cheerful, she\'s popular, she\'d probably get into a graduation bukkake, wait her room\'s an absolute dumpster and nothing you\'d expect from a chick\'s bedroom, hold on she\'s...she\'s not what everyone believes she is, is she? Throughout the story, Akane\'s cheerful mask gradually gets peeled off, a girl who\'s had everything now has...nothing. Her descent is probably the one and only element trucking this show along its knees, her (back)story is powerful, you can very clearly see Akane tearing herself apart as for the first time in her life, nothing\'s going her way. Also, the off-shoulder jacket is sexy as all hell.Our star of the show, Gridman, really is...just a star. He\'s painted in bright colours, constantly accommodated by flashing rainbows, saving the day...and that\'s it. He barely progresses the plot aside from the last 2 episodes, he beats down kaiju with abilities he\'ll chant out loud, he beats down bigger kaiju by fusing Power Rangers style (I really don\'t watch shows like that, its the only reference I have), and to no one\'s surprise he finally decides to ADC and press that goddamn ult button to one and for all take down the main villain (who isn\'t well-written, at all, that\'s all I have to say about him). He\'s persona-less aside from the justice-craved ""we must fight"" and the longest sentence I remember him saying can be filled by a single subtitle thread. Just like Yuta, he\'s awfully blank.As a bonus gift, SSSS.Gridman has an antihero, literally named ""Anti"". Run of the mill ""I\'m bad until I\'m not"", his concept is overused yet his execution, just like Akane, was interesting to watch. Even with his Bakugo-esque distancing behavior, it\'s possible to notice he genuinely has changed/gained a heart and rises up to the occasion when the going gets tough. He still lurks around with the ""you can\'t die unless under my hand"" (which is a tiring troupe) but his actions also act as a stepping stone for the plot.The story itself is barely narrated until the last quarter of the anime. Episode 1 starts you off with a mystery, who am I, who are you, then quite literally ignores it in favour of a monster of the week ""eyy lmao slapped the bad dudes"" marathon before finally remembering it has an ongoing plot and decides to move all pawns on the chessboard at once. This is my main gripe with the show. It doesn\'t push the narrative all the way through until the end, and I would be fine with meaningless big boi vs kaiju for all 12 episodes if it never implied a plot at all.The animation is...a mixed bag. I can\'t stand CG, and for it to be relatively dominant in fight scenes (except the final fight which all the budget went to) was enough for me to alt+tab to Discord just to chuckle at it with some mates. When traditionally animated though, its sometimes mesmerising. The combine sequences, Gridman throwing a non-CG punch, Rikka\'s hair flowing as her head turns, it baffles me that they couldn\'t just stick with pen on paper like Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans had.TL:DR SSSS Gridman felt like it started off with Director A, was then lead by Director B with nonsensical fighting for about 8 episodes before finally being passed back to Director A for him to continue the storyline.

Faith in Trigger is that big, that anime fans still attribute bad quality of DitF to exclusively A1 Pictures and CloverWorks. On top of that, Cyberpunk Edgerunners won anime of the year award. I watched Edgrunners and decided also watch their relatively recent SSSS series. Unfortunately I was too naive, thinking that if the studio made several good anime, the rest will be at least just good. Ultimately, I can\'t imagine I will watch other anime of that series.In the first episode the anime introduces the...two protagonists: Rikka and Youuta. And aside from the first episode, Youuta won\'t develop whatsoever, in addition he has amnesia, so we won\'t see any backstory of him. After losing memory, he start see weird things: a talking computer, tremendous kaiju, thick mist that other characters don\'t. The next day, the city was suddenly attacked by a giant kaiju. And Youta decided to help people by turning into mecha after being swallowed by the talking computer. In the next few episodes ""a giant kaiju attacks the city"" thing repeats several times, and in the same time the anime introduces some new supporting characters who also don\'t have any interesting personalities. So far, the show don\'t bother explain anything or make the characters interesting, even the main characters. Instead, it shows you repetitive fights Gridman vs kaiju.At this point, it is time to talk about the antagonists, who create these kaiju and afterwords recover the city. Akane and Alexis are gods who can control the city. Trigger gave her enormous screen time to make us sympathize with her. But it is hard to sympathize with the girl, who can easily kill her teacher or classmate, just because they inadvertently hurt her. I mean most people are ignorant and arrogant, but it\'s not an excuse to kill them. But she is pretty smart, she discovered who was behind the distractions of her kaiju. And in order to nerf her acute intelligence, Trigger created a character whose the whole point is say the mc about abilities of Akane. And instead of trying to kill her, they are trying to convince her not to kill people. And that\'s also happening for a while without any results. Eventually, Akane gets too depressed that she couldn\'t produce any kaiju and Alexis decided to turn her into a kaiju.The showdown between Alexis and Gridman, of course, boils down to power of friendship. And it\'s done in the most vulgar way when the protagonist, being on the verge of the loss, suddenly becomes more powerful and procures new abilities. Winning the fight, Gridman and his talking weapons bid farewell and fly to somewhere. Meanwhile, receiving a farewell gift from Rikka, Akane just disappears. In the end, it turns out that everything was just a dream of Akane (I would rather describe it as a nightmare).And what was the point of the final twist? In my opinion, it was done to patch the plot holes, boring characters, weak world building, etc. Because your dreams are always inconsistent and doesn\'t stand to reason.The technical aspect is just decent. There is everything that I expected from studio with such great experience in anime production. They, as always, pulled off a great character design. If you forget their names or personalities, you would at least remember their appearance. The cinematography just works (If you don\'t think that the peak of cinematography is ""weird anime angles""), the most remarkable is mecha fights and destructions. Music was fine but I\'m sure I\'ll forget it afterwards.This review might look harsh, but I don\'t think that is the worst anime or some kind of dumpster fire. All of these flaws in the plot are usual for a temper scriptwriter, and you didn\'t expect to see them from the seasoned studio. The concept is, per se, very good, but the execution isn\'t bad it\'s just weak. You simply need to make the characters interesting, elaborate the world building, improve the pacing.

The first few episodes are all over the place and the last few are a bit rushed, but it's fun for a quick watch that won't leave you so attached that it makes you want more episodes.A lot of inspiration was obviously taken from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and concepts from the show are just blatantly name dropped - at one point Utsumi writes 'God's in his heaven, all's right with the world' in his schoolbook. One of the episodes has a very Shiro Sagisu-sounding score which may...or may not have been intentional but I found it to be a nice homage to the composer.The kaiju design is the strongest part of the show by far and without spoiling anything I just want to say that there are so many good kaiju-centric story ideas in this show that even though it was lacking in cohesiveness I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope Studio Trigger makes more shows in the mecha genre in the future. or may not have been intentional but I found it to be a nice homage to the composer.The kaiju design is the strongest part of the show by far and without spoiling anything I just want to say that there are so many good kaiju-centric story ideas in this show that even though it was lacking in cohesiveness I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

The mystery isn’t just about the main dynamic, it’s about literally everything and is everywhere.Why does the main character have amnesia? Why is everyone reacting to this insane things to casually? Where did the dead people go and how come everyone’s memories are false? How do buildings get instantly repaired in the next day? Is the Chief-Over-Justice-looking dude simply an ally to the main villain or is he the main villain and is the master of puppets in...the situation? Is the world we’re looking at even real? A dream? A simulation? What’s with all the sequences in the op? Is the ed sequence in the “real” world? Else, why are they wearing different uniforms and acting like friends? What’s up with that marble they keep pointing to? What are kaijus and where do they come from?It is all answered bit by bit and, at least to me, it was all very satisfying, though I can easily see why it wouldn’t be to someone who did pay attention althroughout. This is one of the best “mindfuck” anime out there, both in writing and effectiveness. Screw Steins Gate!Characters – 8/10You get introduced to a cast of awesome and ridiculous characters with names like “Samurai Calibur”! And yes, they come from a place called “Neon Genesis Junior High”. Gridman references almost every other previous work of Trigger as well as Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, Tokusatsu, old mechas, Power Rangers and even Ultraman. This is not an entry point anime for anyone. Trigger shows tend to be underrated with their genius going under radar for many of their viewers, as they tend to be niche, but this is even more niche than some of the other Trigger shows. You need to have seen a lot of stuff before you can truly grasp what this is all about, even if it is also good as a standalone story in many other ways. I’m sure there were many references and easter eggs even I didn’t get. That’s because SSSS Gridman was fundamentally designed to be an homage to the old Saturday morning cartoons and things like Power Rangers. One of the girls in the show is often listening to music, which a lot of the time is either a theme from another Trigger show or a cover/remix of one.  The whole anime is one of the most meta things I’ve ever watched. I believe that buildings getting fixed seemingly overnight is a jab at how super-hero-type stories never have any of the mass destruction affect the plot in any substantial way.Art – 8/10A lot of (very ignorant) people will be quick to criticize the animation as generic and often lacking. Some might even criticize the purposely bizarre-looking CGI of the mechas and the enemies/kaiju. It’s very clear that the animation team put a lot of effort into making them look a very particular way, almost as if you’re watching people in suits. I believe that motion capture was not used in the production, which makes it all the more impressive that they’re using regular CG to model and replicate the motion capture feel. There are other creative ways the animation composition is handled. There is one scene that comes to mind where they either recorded an actual set piece explosion and integrated it into the scene, or they drew one that looks incredibly realistic to the point where I can’t tell it apart from a real one. They also often had fights with a mixture of CG and 2D where the blending point wasn’t clear at all, all while rotating the angles of the camera and having an epic fight. Oh and when the action gets going, it looks absolutely amazing.There are many moments where the animation team was obviously saving animation frames, but it is done in a way that is never jarring or takes away from the show. By that I mean that there are certain scenes where animation is reused or a near-freeze frame is used, but they are all gag scenes which work better because of it. Trigger always knows how to balance their production for the best output possible. On the contrary, there are many moments that look like wallpapers but in motion.Enjoyment – 9/10SSSS Gridman had some of the shortest-feeling episodes of any anime. At the end of some of the episodes I could swear I had only been watching for a couple minutes. The last time a show had episodes go by so fast for me was when I watched Hunter x Hunter. Gridman is a super entertaining show from beginning to end. It was not exactly what I expected, because most other Trigger shows I had seen had super-fast pacing and this was not like that. I didn’t think I was gonna like the slower, calmer pace of this show, but they made it work just fine.My only issues with it are:1) The characters felt a little lifeless at times. They should have been given more energy. Kill la Kill level energy maybe wouldn’t have worked as well for this show, but they should have been given more.2) They should have had a few more episodes at the end in which the epic fights escalate to new levels. If they actually fought a giant Alexis in the op and had a longer fight, it would have been awesome. The pacing was fine and I was surprised they could pull off the ending so well in the final episode without it feeling rushed, but for a concept this good there is a lot more they could have done. I know anime studios like to stick to the 12-13 episode format, but something like 15-16 episodes with more explanation and use of the concepts, like the motherboard-looking thing itthe sky or the marble, would have been great.Overall, I would give SSSS Gridman a strong 9/10. It was an excellently written piece with a very original concept and great execution. Just like with every other Trigger show I’ve seen, I’ve gotten into it with the mindset of “maybe this is the one that’s actually gonna be mediocre” and like every time before I get another show that enters my top 15 of all time with ease.

This is the show that got me back into anime after a decade-long hiatus.The first few episodes may seem like setup for a generic kaiju show, but the story does enough to tweak the kaiju/toku formula and does something new. The characters are actually realistic and likable and the fight scenes are fantastic.The animators aren't afraid to use CGI, which I know can turn some people off but it blends well with the 2D animation. The fluidity and fight choreography is eye candy. If you're a fan of action anime with a great...soundtrack, you can't go wrong with Gridman or its sequel Dynazenon. soundtrack, you can't go wrong with Gridman or its sequel Dynazenon."", ""SSSS.Gridman is not the anime that I thought would pop my review cherry, but here I am.Gridman stays true to its formulaic storytelling pattern throughout the series until the final episode. Each other episode consists of 65% high-schoolers doing high school things and 35% Gridman one-shotting Kaiju in the streets of somewhere in Japan. Even for what I would consider being a mid-tier anime, this formula gets a little old despite being inoffensive and highly binge-able.Because I'm not part of the old vanguard of anime watchers that grew up with the mecha genre hype, I am forced to review Gridman based on the 12...episodes I just watched rather than any previous work that may add some clarifying details and thus change my opinions. The characters alone in SSSS.Gridman drag my overall score for the show down immensely. Yuta, Utsumi, and Rikka are a trio of forgettable characters whose impact on the overall plot of the show is little to none, and no amount of thigh-game is going to remedy the fact that they in no way move the story forward despite being given the most amount of screentime.Only after reaching the midpoint of the series is there a character that adds some depth to the formula. Of course, I'm talking about Akane. She's the only character to go through any sort of internal struggle worth caring about. Truly, worthy of being called a bitch in the early episodes, I couldn’t help but feel for her struggles towards the later parts of the series. Akane is the main antagonist and becomes the main character of the show. She raised my enjoyment and maintained my interest long enough to get me to the end of the series.All in all, SSSS.Gridman has a young adult, Saturday-morning-cartoon sort of vibe. If you're into the vibe, I can see you enjoying the show. If you're looking for something with a bit more substance, this isn't the series to fill that void. Despite having glaring flaws in storytelling and character-building, I still think the show is alright for a quick 12-episode watch.

Show starts off slow and with almost every character giving off distinct unreliable narrator vibes.I\'m guessing this explains all the negative press from Trigger-haters or those expecting this to be the second coming of TTGL, etc.If you have a bit of patience as a viewer it quickly (within 2-3 episodes) becomes apparent that there is much more going on...behind the scenes which neither the characters in-universe nor we the audience understand.I don\'t mind this approach to story telling so I actually found myself growing increasingly invested with each episode. 9 and 10 were masterpieces - hopefully they can keep the momentum going strong for the last remaining episode.Much like the relatively small but very vocal extreme negative responses to Trigger/A1\'s Darling in the FranXX earlier this year I don\'t understand people giving Gridman ratings of 1 or 2 at all.Even if you hate the story or think the show is pure ""waifu bait "" (or whatever!) it\'s hard to ignore that there is still so much good stuff going on here - from art to animation to voice acting the production on this show is generally pretty damn awesome...

Although the action is the worst part of the show, the dialogue and story feels lackluster and mediocre. There's course-correction later on with a Haruhi-esque twist, but with a completely forgettable main cast it just runs completely out of steam and falls more or less on its face.The art direction for everything but the...battle scenes is superb.

That's a given since the show hasn't finished airing, but it's an impression that comes across loud and clear, whether purposefully or not.To preface for anyone considering watching, SSSS.Gridman isn't a mecha anime like Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, or Trigger's recent Darling in the Franxx. Rather than the steady, continuous narrative that these series build up, SSSS.Gridman has a distinctly episodic feel in structure, like the original Gridman, or shows like Ultraman or Power Rangers. There's a consistency to each episode that you'll soon get used to, with various flavor of the day monsters/Kaiju appearing just...like the shows of old. But oddly enough, the show's main draw is the plot outside these confrontations, which moves unrelentingly forward with new discoveries, and unexpected developments, and that's what's causing this feeling of disconnect.We know what usually happens. As great as watching throwback fights with weird monsters is, older shows like Ultraman are nothing if not consistent in execution. But SSSS.Gridman feels like it's hinting at more from the very start, that it's more than meets the eye if you just stay tuned and keep watching. Unlike any of the shows mentioned above, which are unabashedly themselves from the get go, SSSS.Gridman feels like there's always more.

Eso se puede darse a reojo.Empezó como un anime de ese estilo (suspenso-mecha) donde el protagonista no puede recordar el cómo puede ser el único que puede pelear y conocer al tal Gridman...La música, como lo puedo notar, no ha estado tan presente a lo largo de la historia a excepción de la parte de la acción.Su forma caricaturesca de Trigger se hizo algo presente (como cuando Yuta es ""tragado"" por...la Basura). la Basura).', 'Gridman\'s point of appreciation is not in this ""deeper"" relationship of important themes that anime tries to work on, but in a more vulgar way in which he treats the most objective subject of anime - this one that refers to a nostalgia for the moments of action.I like how the anime works with this more vulgar and objective plot relationship that exists on the surface. Vulgar not in a negative sense, but in this well assumed visual relationship with a heroic, destructive and nostalgic charge.Even though it has a continuous story, the focus is on the immediate resolution of each episode – it progresses...by giving more focus to isolated events of each episode, and that\'s very gratifying. This structure with the main events ended in a more episodic way also reminds me of this form of the tokusatsu’s.The vibrant colors of the Gridman, the robots\' movements that follow a more choreographed logic and the way in which the connections made with the other robots are shown have this more enchanting characteristic. The way they show the cgi of robots and monsters as elements that are more distant from that reality. This relationship fits more with the face of the studio, which normally seeks this intensity of scenes and movement. It all goes together very well.I\'ve gotten used to the fact that there\'s always been a reference to the old works of the Gainax studio. Which in Gridman\'s case wasn\'t bad, since the work has this more ridiculous approach. And these kind of obvious personalities also have that intensity that the anime positions itself to have.Unfortunately, once again the studio tries to work with a poorly articulated deep theme, making some parts very superficial. This more contemplative relationship does not match the intensity that the anime presents.Not that having the theme itself is the problem, as it intentionally seems to exist just for that. But the way in which director Akira Amemiya works with this relationship in a more “subtle” way ends up separating and isolating his theme from everything else.What I mean is, Gridman can\'t bind these two properties. It seems that the two exist in dissociated ways. An example of something that works very well within this logic is Trigger\'s own Kill la Kill. It is a work that has the same intensity of scenes and movement, at the same time, a subtle theme present in the work. But, Hiroyuki Imaishi integrates its theme within this intensity of work. Not that I mean this is THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT, but rather that he came up with an idea that makes this approach unique.But, the job itself isn\'t bad. Even though he couldn\'t articulate an idea that would provide a unique experience for the viewer, there are still many things that work. The difference between the two is that: this deep relationship is developed in an illustrative, obvious and boring way; and this heroic, destructive and nostalgic relationship is practically the best thing about anime.It works much better as a direct allegory to the tokusatsu’s themselves than this more immobile and expressionless form that sometimes makes you sleepy.The final stretch of the anime has the best/worst moments. Better because the anime arrives at the apex of this more intense and nostalgic relationship with the final battle against the main villain. And worse, since the anime ends with a sobriety that tries to put an end to its most delicate and underdeveloped theme. by giving more focus to isolated events of each episode, and that\'s very gratifying.

Not that I mean this is THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT, but rather that he came up with an idea that makes this approach unique.But, the job itself isn\'t bad. Even though he couldn\'t articulate an idea that would provide a unique experience for the viewer, there are still many things that work. The difference between the two is that: this deep relationship is developed in an illustrative, obvious and boring way; and this heroic, destructive and nostalgic relationship is practically the best thing about anime.It works much better as a direct allegory to the tokusatsu’s themselves than this more immobile and expressionless form that sometimes makes you sleepy.The final stretch of the anime has the best/worst moments. Better because the anime arrives at the apex of this more intense and nostalgic relationship with the final battle against the main villain. And worse, since the anime ends with a sobriety that tries to put an end to its most delicate and underdeveloped theme.', ""I really was enjoying this show a lot, then I made it to the last episode, where it felt like everything that had built up to this final episode was going to come to a close, you'd get the final episode that you had wanted but instead of resolving problems you are thrown with a big NOPE, remember in Fairy Odd Parents that Child Block?

Arguably it does do so at various points.And yet while so much here is plainly unoriginal, there's enough that genuinely is to save the whole thing from disaster. The plot has its twists, though mostly they're delivered gradually and without any big reveal moment, so they lack a certain punch  to them. Nevertheless, they're there and they had a certain complexity to a story that could have easily fallen into a...purely episodic, monster-of-the-week nostalgia-fest.There's a lot of corny, cringe-worthy material here, that seemingly belongs to a more innocent age, but this is somewhat mitigated by the winking, self-awareness of the writing - not a guaranteed save, but we can at least appreciate that thought went into this aspect. I suspect some of this might add to the whole thing for those with a deeper and longer running familiarity with the genre conventions being displayed here than I do, but it certainly didn't derail the whole thing for me.What's done very well is the start, which manages to be moody and atmospheric, with compelling visuals. Sadly this stylistic standard isn't maintained. I'm aware of some who have criticised the first episode for being slow, but to my mind it was one of the better entries with its pacing meaning I cared more about these characters more by the time buildings started getting smashed up in robot vs kaiju fights.There are other times too, later on that the show isn't afraid to slow down and build on its characters and the end result is a main villain who feels a lot more fleshed out and human than most. It does this just as I was on the verge of giving up on the show for its repetitive, seemingly low-stakes action sequences in the series' first half.Indeed, whilst some elements of the climax will leave many less than satisfied, if not downright disappointed, in general the back end up these twelve episodes is stronger than the front.I must say, many of the action sequences felt entirely generic and I often grew bored during them, which may be a problem for a show that is ostensibly about these big fights, but there's enough on the side that the overall product still manages to be entertaining.Ultimately, though, I probably would have given this a 5 rating, but it gets an extra point for Rikka Takarada's thighs.

Characters suddenly appear and join the gang, no questions asked.Dialogue is generic and uninspiring.I still recommend this anime to people looking for something to pass the time. ', 'tl;dr: An anime that’s mostly well done tokusatsu kaiju action but with enough depth to characters to elevate it above just that.Note: This review has minor spoilers.SSSS.Gridman is an anime that is based on Denkou Choujin Gridman, also known as Gridman the Hyper Agent, which is a live action show originally broadcasted in Japan in the mid 90s. I have not seen the original Gridman show, but I do have some familiarity with what seem to be the shows central themes, tokusatsu type action and kaiju. And I feel that this anime does a pretty good job at using them.One of the core aspects of...this anime is the action, more specifically what basically feels like mech versus kaiju action. Various monsters known as kaiju with different power sets attack the town and the protagonist is able to transform into the kaiju sized hero Gridman in order to fight them. This action is larger than life and designed to be more cool than to actually have any depth or anything like that. The majority of fights involved Gridman being on the verge of defeat until he obtained a new form with the new form having abilities that are easily able to defeat the new kaiju. New forms are pretty common in the genre, though I think this goes a bit farther than most in how many forms there are in such a short time, though that may be because this being only 12 episodes long is quite shorter than most shows in the genre. Still, I felt that they managed to make it work, wherein the combat is simplistic enough that each new form feels like a welcome addition rather than making things feel bloated. There is also enough variety to the action and it flows well enough that it doesn’t feel like it ever gets boring.The other core aspect of the anime is the characters. The overarching story centers around four key characters. The protagonist, Yuta, has lost his memories and the beginning of the anime involves him getting accustomed to both his normal life as a high school student and serving as a hero to fight kaiju. Once the anime gets past this phase though, Yuta as a character begins being focused on far less, basically just being a pretty standard heroic character and not really going through any development.The focus shifts to a large degree to the antagonist Akane, the one creating all the Kaiju, and essentially the god of the world. Her character and character are quite complex. It could very much be said that she’s a psychopath, seeing as she cares not at all for those that her kaiju kill, but at the same time, she’s a goddess who created all of them in the first place, so it very much feels like she’s just operating on a completely different type of logic than everyone else. She wants to be liked by her creations and live a happy life in the world she created as a part of it, but at the same time feels like she’s a distinct entity from everything else and thus can’t simply enjoy a peaceful life there. She brings the most depth to the narrative of this anime and when focusing on her and the world building surrounding her the anime even pivots around to focusing on some pretty heavy themes somewhere around existentialism and nihilism, though it only lightly touches on them. Still, this is in itself enough to feel like the anime has more substance and weight to it than just being a story about simply defeating kaiju.There are a number of side characters as well. There’s Yuta and Akane’s fellow high school students, Rikka and Utsumi. They have character arcs which make them feel a bit more developed than Yuta, but they’re also pretty simple so not substantially so. Still, their dynamics with Yuta and Akane and the bonds between all of them add another layer of depth to everything. There’s also the kaiju Anti who has a much more fleshed out character arc which is actually pretty solid and feels like it does a good job at adding more depth to what kaiju and the heroes that oppose them are. Lastly, there are a number of other minor characters that don’t have character arcs or anything, but most of them have well defined personalities that keep things interesting, especially from a comedy point of view.The plot proceeds with pretty solid pacing. There’s a really good balance of action and elements surrounding the action from beginning to end. There’s a good variety to both the action and character stories as well. It all leads up to a pretty standard epic finale with the final boss and pretty standard epilogue following that. There are some minor character elements that felt like they elevated the ending to a bit beyond being completely generic, but for the most part it’s largely entirely predictable. Still, I don’t think that that’s bad in and of itself, and overall I found the ending perfectly satisfying in most regards.The animation and art were pretty solid from beginning to end. The kaiju and Gridman were mostly CG as far as I can tell, but CG at this point is great at handling things like them so I thought it still looked great. The designs were also pretty great. Gridman is based on his old design but I feel like he’d been updated in ways that were major improvements. The variety to his form and such was pretty solid too. The kaiju designs were also pretty solid, wherein most of them were pretty stand there was a decent variety. I also felt the character designs were really solid as well all around including even making most of the minor characters somewhat memorable. The OP and soundtrack were pretty standard for the genre and thus not particularly memorable, but solid enough nevertheless.

This tradition that comes from Evangelion, Gurren Laggan and recently Darling in the franxx have at its core two root elements: Giant Robots and Gnosticism. This formula may have dragged many fans over the time but it's getting more and more predictable and boring. They try to give it a new cover mixing elements from tokusatsus, from which the original Gridman comes. It does add a special flavor to this whole gnostic experience, but it's questionable if that flavor really harmonizes with the...rest of it. Tokusatsus are known to be really straight forward and the good guys fighting the bad guys. Adding things like false evil gods, false realities and mysterious women from beyond dimension may be compared to adding fruits inside your spaghetti: an unusual mixture that may please some, but disgust many. In general it was a interesting experience for me, that in my childhood watched tokusatsus even before knowing that genre existed, and also since I have watched many gnostic giant robot animes, all from gainax/trigger, except Code Geass, from sunrise, and that's why it's much better.Art: pretty good art, including characters, robots, scenario.. it was pleasing to my eyes.Sound: the soundtrack didn't catch my attention. It did not annoyed me at any moment, though. The opening song is good, and is constantly showing throughout the episodes.Character: As it was in last Trigger original anime (darling in the franxx) the characters are very well conceived and well developed throughout the serie, considering the lack time to develop them more.

The anatomy and proportions of the human characters checked out and the non-human characters looked pretty neat too. The kaiju looked cheesy but they fit well with the style of the show. I thought the art was mixed because the quality could vary between below average and pretty good-looking. Zoomed out shots of characters looked pretty bad honestly (worse than what you\'d expect is what I mean): dots for eyes, minimal detail and coloring, etc. Closeups of characters, however, looked good. There was a lot of detail in closeup shots that I appreciate. The luminescent...and detailed eyes, the hair-work and facial expressions looked nice. The environmentals and supporting details looked good. Panoramic shots added a lot of atmosphere to the narrative and the fact that they looked good too is a plus. I gave this area a 6 because the clear drop in quality in often-enough select moments bothered me.Animation 7/10Animation was good. Action was thrilling and created hype. Character movements such as walking, running, and gestures looked believable and were fairly crisp. Impact sequences had a drop in detail but looked nice. CGI elements and sequences didn\'t look weird and hit their mark. There was some select-framing in anything that wasn\'t cgi, but it\'s fine. Not too many shortcuts taken such as dropping frames.Characters: 8/10Characters were great. The character development is what I liked most about this show. The particular events of the show somewhat make up for the lack of development and presence of some of the characters such as the Evangelion crew, Utsumi, and even Yuuta. Akane\'s development more than made up for my few gripes about the time spent on the rest of the cast because this show was more or less Akane\'s story.Plot: 6/10The slow and vague plot setup this show decided to go with really isn\'t my style when it comes to world-building and narrative but I eventually grew into and and began to appreciate it by the end. At first I was a bit annoyed, asking myself lots of questions: Who is he? Why haven\'t I been hinted at why Yuuta has amnesia this far into the show? Why hasn\'t Calibur been explained or why was just shoe\'d in so nonchalantly? What\'s up with those giant kaiju statues? I wasn\'t really into how the show refused to address a lot of these questions for quite some time, but by the end the narrative direction from start to finish really played out well so I don\'t think of the vague startup as too much of a negative anymore.Development: 8/10The development was all worth it. I enjoyed the action, but I really bought Akane\'s development. It was really neat when events slowly lead to the shift in perspective; that the whole thing was an exercise in Akane gaining the confidence to leave her imaginary world behind and take the ""first steps"" towards opening that ""door.""Music: 5/10Mostly the same theme song during almost every fight. No sound design to note. Soundboard was fitting as well. OP and ED were cool. Favorite was just the main theme song which was pretty catchy.Overall: 7/10I\'m happy that TRIGGER went with something more story-driven this time around rather than their usual shounen-esq formula.

If one is a fan of this sort of show, then I can foresee it being an enjoyable time.The fights are well animated, and it has the old school guys in rubber suits feel to the combat that harkens back to the days of the first Godzilla's.There are a whole story and characters and all, but none of that really interested me; I just came to see some robot on kaiju action.

I always find the show when looking for Japanese related media, but given the age of the show, I always thought it was a classic from a previous generation similar to Star Trek. A show to be remembered but not to be taken seriously. Well after hearing trigger was doing an adaption of one of the older shows I decided that now was better than never.Story: An underwhelming beginning that seems to lead nowhere, but was that the point? The first episodes can only be described as boring, bland and unstructured. It’s episodic in nature with next...to no development of any kind and the characters couldn’t be weaker. At episode 6 I was willing to drop the show entirely, which is very rare for me especially this far in but by continuing on I was in for a surprise. The next half of the show took an entire 180 approach to the story and really change the perception of where they were going. The story made some really interesting twists and threw the characters into a curveball I did not see coming. I believe the large contrast of the first half to the last half was to subvert the expectations of the viewers and try to appeal to older fans. Trigger knows the “monster of the week” trope doesn’t work in today’s age but at the same time, they can’t abandon the legacy of the show as well. But presenting the show as its original structure then changing the show into a more modern appeal they get best of both worlds(albeit the beginning reception of the show wasn’t the best because of it). The characters also follow this idea very closely and how they develop through the story. Most if not all get flushed out in the second half rather then first because of the above story structuring, except for the main character. Yuta was incredibly shallow and never once showed any significant emotion or progression. While many of the characters were questioning themselves or challenging themselves to do something, Yuta was absolutely hollow. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the main character this poorly written but luckily the rest of the cast picks up the slack and somehow pulls the story along. I would like to state that at times there’s references or mentions of the “predecessor” for Gridman. I have no idea what that means or who that is and it never gets explained at all, because of this I believe I’m missing some critical information towards the plot since it’s apart of the ultra series. Above all else, the story wasn’t drawn out to its full potential but the ending was better than expected.Animation: With it being studio Trigger you can already tell what style animation will be used. Rather here it’s how effective the animation was used. Studio Trigger definitely doesn’t like to have a lot of still idle images in there works, their art style fully shines when in scenes of action and quick movement. The problem is that it's not necessarily used for action scenes of the show but rather some really impressive special effects and what I believe is CGI. But in return when it’s only used for a majority that isn’t quick motions it heavily drags the showdown in quality and feels. It almost seems like I’m watching something out of 2011 rather than the current year and that’s not a compliment. I will add that the show was made by all new animators from studio Trigger so while the typical animation is as sharp the future looks really bright for Trigger.Music: I was ecstatic to hear that Shirou Sagisu was creating the soundtrack for the show and with him being one of my favorite composers of all time I really want to hear it succeed. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected, but wasn’t bad in any regard. The soundtrack mostly composes of EDM and more then half the OST is made up of alternative versions for the soundtrack, meaning there’s not much there to listen to. I did enjoy one song being HumanLove_CH_edm_all which, for the most part, is pretty plain but at least it spices it up with some interesting variations. Overall, it was a soundtrack to fit a type of show rather than be more experiential like Shirou's other soundtracks.Conclusion: If you find joy in watching old style fights and have nothing better to watch then go for SSSS.Gridman but other than that I wouldn’t recommend the show to really anyone. You can find it legally streaming on Crunchyroll with a home release not yet announced. to no development of any kind and the characters couldn’t be weaker. At episode 6 I was willing to drop the show entirely, which is very rare for me especially this far in but by continuing on I was in for a surprise. The next half of the show took an entire 180 approach to the story and really change the perception of where they were going. The story made some really interesting twists and threw the characters into a curveball I did not see coming. I believe the large contrast of the first half to the last half was to subvert the expectations of the viewers and try to appeal to older fans. Trigger knows the “monster of the week” trope doesn’t work in today’s age but at the same time, they can’t abandon the legacy of the show as well. But presenting the show as its original structure then changing the show into a more modern appeal they get best of both worlds(albeit the beginning reception of the show wasn’t the best because of it). The characters also follow this idea very closely and how they develop through the story. Most if not all get flushed out in the second half rather then first because of the above story structuring, except for the main character. Yuta was incredibly shallow and never once showed any significant emotion or progression. While many of the characters were questioning themselves or challenging themselves to do something, Yuta was absolutely hollow.

I didn\'t watch any more until much later. Now that I\'m 4 eps in, I want to write a review. If you are watching this show after it has aired, I should mention something. The show was PANNED its first few weeks but gained a steady following. As I found with my own viewing, it\'s something you need to stick with. That being said, if you don\'t like it after ep2, I say you should drop it.I think...the thing that matters most to whether you\'ll enjoy Gridman or not is your sense of nostalgia. The show\'s charm comes from the fact that its style is reminiscent of past styles. Long shots, cicada background noises, the setting, the monster styles, they\'re all very 1990s and early 2000s. I found myself thinking a LOT of Evangelion, not in the Mecha aspects or the character archetypes, but the way the scenes are displayed. A detailed, expanded shot of mundane things, like a girl mashed an elevator-close button that won\'t work, is similar to long panning shots of, say, Shinji just standing there while his Ramen cooked.Story: 5/10. This is by far the weakest aspect of the show. It really thrusts you into the middle of the events with little explanation or backstory. The ""amnesia"" trope is pretty lame, it lets them get away without establishing any backstory. I\'ll include my thoughts on the fights. From what I\'ve seen so far, they just keep getting better. Gridman starts off pretty lame and slow but just gets cooler as the story progresses.Art: 7/10. I think it\'s pretty well drawn. This is where I\'m least able to critique because I have low standards. I will say the CGI is pretty well-done. The weakest aspects so far are the first few Kaiju, and also the style of the MC. His fire-red hair with two ""hair horns"" looks so stupid. And his best friend has booger-green hair too, wtf. But Rikka really looks good, no wonder everyone is into the thiccness.Sound: 10/10. This show has an AWESOME soundtrack. Not just the OP/ED, but also the fight songs are so good. I\'m watching the dub because I\'m lazy and to me the english VAs are pretty good.Characters: 8/10. Sadly, the MC (Hibiki) is probably the worst character in the show. He\'s boring, he has no backstory since he has amnesia, and he\'s kinda whiny sometimes, but not in the understandable Shinji way (since I mentioned Eva). The cast is really carried by Rikka. She has an interesting personality and to me, sometimes she seems to be more of the focus than Hibiki. The best friend is meh, I don\'t even know his name yet. The supporting characters that show up as the show goes on are great additions, and they help a lot. Gridman himself is interesting but not anything more than that.Enjoyment: 8/10. Despite its flaws, it\'s fun anime to watch. It has hallmarks of mecha, SoL, comedy, and drama. It won\'t blow your mind but I think it\'s worth a shot.Overall: 8/10. I wouldn\'t say ""if you like mecha you\'ll like this"" because that isn\'t true. I\'d say ""if you like old school 1990s anime, you\'ll like this"".UPDATE: I previously had the overall at a 7. I bumped it up to 8 after catching up to the episode (8). This show really gets better and better as you watch. Hibiki is still meh but all the other characters are so great. the thing that matters most to whether you\'ll enjoy Gridman or not is your sense of nostalgia.

I'm not a big Mecca fan but thought I'd try one again after many years and I picked this one. You can tell where they took inspiration from neon genesis for certain scenes and that's about the hight of it. There is very little explanation of the world gridman and co come from and why they are fighting the. . .  Aliens? Some of the fight scenes are great and that is...where the show shines most. Story, characters and everything else is very bog standard and not very memorable. It got a bit more interesting towards the end but not enough to make it a good show.Watch neon genesis instead or code geass of you want decent Mecca and good characters5/10 final score. where the show shines most.

It keeps the familiar tropes and borrows elements from the genre's writing formulas, while also ensuring its...main crowd-pleasers in the form of the titular Gridman and the monsters he fights are familiarly-over the top, making sure that fans of toksatsu and kaiju are given a very nostalgic trip down memory lane.But at the same time, SSSS Gridman makes sure from the first few minutes that the world it inhabits is not as it seems.For all of the ground-level circling panning shots with Gridman and kaiju beating the shit out of each other, there's as many uncomfortable long takes. For every flashy transformation scene, there is tightly-edited conversation reminiscent of trends seen in mumblecore.For every flamboyant tokusatsu element, there is a very subdued, instrospective art house element, which would have many a keen viewer reminisce not of Ultraman and the like, but of Neon Genesis Evangelion.This juxtaposition of flash and long introspection surprisingly works to the show's benefit, lending to the eeriness of this world with something awry (other than the giant mecha and killer monsters lol).One particular element of the show that really solidifies that juxtaposition is its sound design.Most of the show is DEVOID of any music, highlight the background music of a store, the sound of pencil against paper, traffic driving by. That, combined with the realistic handling of dialogue (people talking over another, conversations in the background continuing even when main characters are talking, main characters acting naturally and cohorting with side characters without any restrictions) really lent to the atmosphere of the show and making the world of SSSS Gridman seem realistic, something I would not have expected from a show that features a giant robotman fighting giant deformed monsters.And when there IS music, it's the most hammiest, cheesiest tokusatsu music you can imagine, again just highlighting the intense juxtaposition of what's real and what's stylistically fake.That intense relative realism playing around with the hammed-up intense cheese of the main setpieces was a fantastic stylistic choice that not only kept me engaged, but surprisingly lent itself to the plot itself, leaving clues to the conclusion of all the plot threads and mysteries in an extremely satisfying way that couldn't have been done WITHOUT that intense juxtaposition throughout the anime, from the sound design to the character design, to the shot compositions.Juxtaposition aside, SSSS Gridman really took me offguard.I expected something that was intentionally super-schlocky or some mediocre shonen monster of the week show with horrible CGI, but what I got was this very over the top yet grounded meditation on escapism, the nature of reality, and free will, with colorful and pulse-pounding action setpieces that made me feel like a 12 year old all over again.It's such a unique yet loving homage that I legit feltl nostalgic for Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad and Gridman The Hyper Agent even though I've never watched either incarnation.In the end, I think that's probably the best thing the creators could have asked for....and the fact that Rikka's thighs can probably form a religion.

SSSS.Gridman on the other hand is not like any of those kinds of anime. It instead mainly focuses on one boy doing the fighting with support from supernatural beings instead of actual...military equipment, and it takes place most of the time out of school and the school that is present in this anime doesn't really have a connection to anything mecha related in the anime, it just shows some character backgrounds. military equipment, and it takes place most of the time out of school and the school that is present in this anime doesn't really have a connection to anything mecha related in the anime, it just shows some character backgrounds."", ""Thicc thighs couldn't save this anime.No spoilersDisclaimer: I watched this series drunkI had low expectations of this anime.

But it should've been.Going in with low expectations, I was genuinely surprised of how good the animation and soundtrack was. I thought CGI robots fighting CGI monsters in an animated landscape would suck. It turns out it was pretty great. (At least in the beginning) AND THAT OPENING SONG. That song...slaps, HARD.The first half of the anime was pretty decent. I really enjoyed the fight scenes. The story had enough mystery to keep me interested, but gave me enough insight so I wasn't completely confused.

I don't know if it was because they just weren't as cool as the ones in the beginning or because I just became used to the repetitive similar fights that happened in almost every episode.The story itself became really confusing.

É uma pena que a Trigger apostou mais na nostalgia do que em realmente transmitir uma mensagem. A pergunta que fica é: Isso é algo ruim?A estética e nada maisSSSS.Gridman esteticamente é incrível, não tem muito o que falar aqui, pois todas as decisões estéticas que a Trigger tomou foi muito bem...aplicada aqui, e não estou falando apenas da animação, mas na produção com um todo, desde as trilhas sonoras empolgantes que remetem aos antigos Tokusatsu de certo modo, até o design dos personagens que é muito bem feito, cada personagem nessa obra é único, com suas próprias características estéticas, sabe? A animação então nem se fala, é muito consistente em praticamente todos os episódios, fora a coloração das cenas e dos próprios personagens, enfim, tudo aqui é muito bem feito e consegue nos mostrar que quando a Trigger faz um anime, o mínimo que devemos esperar é o “crème de la crème” da indústria de animes, ao menos, esteticamente falando.A falta de um subtexto nunca fez tanta falta como faz em SSSS.GridmanEsse anime não quer dizer nada, ele simplesmente quer nos mostrar uma história divertida, com um bom visual e músicas fodas, mas fora isso, SSSS.Gridman não quer dizer nada, e isso é ruim? Bom, para mim, sim! Quando consumimos uma obra, seja ela qual for, sempre existirá alguém por trás daquela obra, no caso um autor, e esse autor, em algum nível, foi influenciado por sua experiencia de vida na construção da história ou da estética daquela obra, a questão é que em SSSS.Gridman parece que nada disso importa, a impressão que tenho é que esse anime foi feito por uma inteligência artificial que simplesmente pegou aquilo que funciona e que é “mundialmente aceitável” na indústria e juntou tudo nesse anime. Esse anime é claramente cativante, e sempre tentar parecer bacana e fodão, porém ele faz isso de forma artificial, pois não existe nada por trás, sabe? É com sair como uma garota muito bonita, mas culturalmente pobre, é legal o fato dela ser bonita, mas e depois? Como será a convivência com uma pessoa que não tem absolutamente nada a te agregar? Talvez seria uma perca de tempo, não?Não estou necessariamente dizendo que assistir SSSS.Gridman é uma perda de tempo, mas é fato que a Trigger quis jogar no safe aqui, ela não quis construir um enredo que realmente quisesse falar algo, e tudo bem, se formos muito caridosos dá para falar que ela até trousse uma discussão sobre pertencimento, sobre um grito de socorro de uma juventude presa nas pressões sociais que a cultura japonesa impõe, mas o anime realmente diz isso? Eu acho que não, isso foi somente algo que matutei aqui comigo durante minha experiencia com o anime, mas acredito que essa não foi realmente a mensagem que esse anime quis passar, até porque, pelo que parece, ele simplesmente não quis ativamente passar nenhum valor ou mensagem através de seu texto ou subtexto.SSSS.Gridman não se esforçou, logo, eu também nãoEu não tenho muito mais o que comentar sobre essa obra, é um anime esteticamente muito bem feito, com poucas falhas no geral em suas qualidades técnicas, mas que não traz nenhuma substancia a ser analisada, sabe? Ele não apresenta uma profundidade narrativa e nem trabalha de maneira satisfatória seus personagens, todos ali parecem seguir simplesmente aquilo que foi escrito no roteiro, mas não agem como jovens normais agiriam, eles só seguem padrões para atender as necessidades que autor impões sobre seu trabalho. Mas no final, nada disso realmente importa, porque esse anime é bonito, não é?________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________SSSS.Gridman is more about form than content.SSSS.Gridman is a perfect anime for Tokusatsu lovers, so much so that this anime was ""based"" on a Tokusatsu, by the same people who produced Ultra Man... It\'s a shame that Trigger bet more on nostalgia than on actually conveying a message. The question that remains is: Is this a bad thing?Aesthetics and nothing elseSSSS.Gridman aesthetically is amazing, there\'s not much to talk about here, because all the aesthetic decisions that Trigger made were very well applied here, and I\'m not just talking about the animation, but the production as a whole, from the exciting soundtracks that refer to the old Tokusatsu, the very well done character design, each character in this anime is unique, with their own aesthetic characteristics, you know? The animation is very consistent in almost every episode, not to mention the coloring of the scenes and the characters themselves. All in all, everything here is very well done and manages to show us that when Trigger makes an anime, the least we should expect is the ""crème de la crème"" of the anime industry, at least aesthetically speaking.The lack of a subtext has never been so lacking as it is in SSSS.GridmanThis anime doesn\'t mean anything, it simply wants to show us a fun story, with good animation and very good music, but beyond that, SSSS.Gridman doesn\'t mean anything, and is that bad? Well, for me, yes! When we consume a work, whatever it is, there will always be someone behind that work, in this case an author, and this author, on some level, was influenced by his or her life experience in the construction of the story or the aesthetics of that work, the thing is that in SSSS.Gridman it seems that none of this matters, the impression I get is that this anime was made by an artificial intelligence that simply took what works and what is ""worldly acceptable"" in the industry and put it all together in this anime. This anime is clearly catchy, and it\'s always trying to look cool, but it does it in an artificial way, because there\'s nothing behind it, you know? It\'s like you go on a date with a very pretty but culturally poor girl, and it\'s nice that she\'s pretty, but so what? How are you going to talk to a person who has absolutely nothing to add to you? Maybe it\'s a waste of time, no?I am not necessarily saying that watching SSSS.Gridman is a waste of time, but it is a fact that Trigger preferred to stay in its safe zone, it did not want to build a plot that really wanted to say anything, and okay, if we are very charitable we can say that it even brought a discussion about belonging, about a plea for help from a youth trapped in the social pressures that Japanese culture imposes, but does the anime really say that? I don\'t think so! This was just something I thought to myself during my experience with the anime, but I believe that this was not really the message this anime wanted to convey, because from the looks of it, the anime simply did not want to convey any value or message actively through its text or subtext.SSSS.Gridman didn\'t try hard, so I didn\'t try hard eitherI don\'t have much else to comment on this anime, it\'s an anime that is aesthetically very well done, with few flaws in its overall technical qualities, but it doesn\'t bring any substance to be analyzed, you know? It doesn\'t present a narrative depth nor does it work its characters in a satisfactory way, everyone there seems to simply follow what was written in the script, but they don\'t act like normal young people would act, they just follow patterns to satisfy the needs that the author imposes on his script. But at the end of the day, none of this matters, because this anime is beautiful, isn\'t it? aplicada aqui, e não estou falando apenas da animação, mas na produção com um todo, desde as trilhas sonoras empolgantes que remetem aos antigos Tokusatsu de certo modo, até o design dos personagens que é muito bem feito, cada personagem nessa obra é único, com suas próprias características estéticas, sabe?

The question that remains is: Is this a bad thing?Aesthetics and nothing elseSSSS.Gridman aesthetically is amazing, there\'s not much to talk about here, because all the aesthetic decisions that Trigger made were very well applied here, and I\'m not just talking about the animation, but the production as a whole, from the exciting soundtracks that refer to the old Tokusatsu, the very well done character design, each character in this anime is unique, with their own aesthetic characteristics, you know? The animation is very consistent in almost every episode, not to mention the coloring of the scenes and the characters themselves. All in all, everything here is very well done and manages to show us that when Trigger makes an anime, the least we should expect is the ""crème de la crème"" of the anime industry, at least aesthetically speaking.The lack of a subtext has never been so lacking as it is in SSSS.GridmanThis anime doesn\'t mean anything, it simply wants to show us a fun story, with good animation and very good music, but beyond that, SSSS.Gridman doesn\'t mean anything, and is that bad? Well, for me, yes! When we consume a work, whatever it is, there will always be someone behind that work, in this case an author, and this author, on some level, was influenced by his or her life experience in the construction of the story or the aesthetics of that work, the thing is that in SSSS.Gridman it seems that none of this matters, the impression I get is that this anime was made by an artificial intelligence that simply took what works and what is ""worldly acceptable"" in the industry and put it all together in this anime. This anime is clearly catchy, and it\'s always trying to look cool, but it does it in an artificial way, because there\'s nothing behind it, you know? It\'s like you go on a date with a very pretty but culturally poor girl, and it\'s nice that she\'s pretty, but so what? How are you going to talk to a person who has absolutely nothing to add to you? Maybe it\'s a waste of time, no?I am not necessarily saying that watching SSSS.Gridman is a waste of time, but it is a fact that Trigger preferred to stay in its safe zone, it did not want to build a plot that really wanted to say anything, and okay, if we are very charitable we can say that it even brought a discussion about belonging, about a plea for help from a youth trapped in the social pressures that Japanese culture imposes, but does the anime really say that? I don\'t think so! This was just something I thought to myself during my experience with the anime, but I believe that this was not really the message this anime wanted to convey, because from the looks of it, the anime simply did not want to convey any value or message actively through its text or subtext.SSSS.Gridman didn\'t try hard, so I didn\'t try hard eitherI don\'t have much else to comment on this anime, it\'s an anime that is aesthetically very well done, with few flaws in its overall technical qualities, but it doesn\'t bring any substance to be analyzed, you know? It doesn\'t present a narrative depth nor does it work its characters in a satisfactory way, everyone there seems to simply follow what was written in the script, but they don\'t act like normal young people would act, they just follow patterns to satisfy the needs that the author imposes on his script. But at the end of the day, none of this matters, because this anime is beautiful, isn\'t it?', 'When I first watched SSSS.Gridman, I wasn’t too sure what was going on. I learned that there was a 1993 live action kid’s show called Gridman the Hyper Agent long after that SSSS.Gridman is based on, and I wanted to watch it both to deepen my knowledge of toku stuff and to revisit SSSS.Gridman with some more context.While you certainly don’t need to watch Hyper Agent to understand what’s happening in SSSS.Gridman, I think it will certainly deepen your enjoyment of it. SSSS.Gridman is a show that has a ton of attention to detail in it, and this includes direct concepts, cameos, and callbacks from...Hyper Agent.As for Hyper Agent itself, I think the best way to describe it is charming. Its plot is interesting, its characters are endearing, its jokes are funny, and its jank is also funny. Being a kids show, I don’t expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I did, but I at least recommend at least skipping around. If you want specific episode recommendations based on things that appear in the SSSS…s, I’d say episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 38, and 39 have relevant plot points and miscellaneous things. Unfortunately I don’t believe you can find Hyper Agent without machine-translated subtitles (even the Blu-ray!), but at worst you can understand what characters are saying.Also, Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad is a (gratuitously) American adaption that reuses all of the computer world footage from Hyper Agent while making its own live-action plots around them. I don’t think you need to watch it after Hyper Agent unless you’re curious; the only thing worth noting is that they have separate people pilot the support tools (like the jet and plane).Back to SSSS.Gridman, the plot starts off as a monster-of-the-week affair that you’d expect. However, with the mystery of the city resetting itself alongside a healthy influx of characters and reveals, the pacing of the show doesn’t get stale. In fact, I was surprised how quickly the plot points moved on my rewatch. Plus, the fights themselves are great. Maybe I’m too used to the monotony of Hyper Agent’s fights, but SSSS.Gridman’s fights had consistently cool power-ups…even if they were short. However, the main appeal of SSSS.Gridman isn’t the fights, but instead when the plot opens itself up halfway through and starts getting a bit off the rails. I’m obviously not going to say, but the way the anime blends the cool Gridman kaiju fights with the discomfort of the plot creates an…interesting feeling overall.Unfortunately, the main protagonists of SSSS.Gridman weren’t much. They had good personalities and their moment-to-moment conversations were fun, but at the end of the day they didn’t feel strong enough. The story acted through them instead of the other way around. On the bright side, I liked pretty much everyone else. Even Gridman himself has some more character this time around (even if that’s not saying much)! The antagonists in particular steal the show; Alexis being a more polite Kahn Digifer is very funny.There are voice dramas that you can play after each episode that have fun little scenarios with the characters. They’re charming and funny, but more importantly help flesh out the characters (even side characters) more. Definitely add them to your watch!I’m surprised how invested I was in SSSS.Gridman, both from the overall plot and all the Hyper Agent callbacks. Maybe I’m more sentimental about it than others, but I certainly recommend it! Hyper Agent.As for Hyper Agent itself, I think the best way to describe it is charming.

They are power ranger style, big robot hero with a lot of weapons that gets revealed over the episodes. New bad guys keep showing up with the hero who has to take them on. Battles are fun to watch with good animations, but are fairly short per episode.Story and characters 5Okay the idea is good, but was...just frusrating for me.

It's just.... ahh bad guy shows up.... let's battle!

It approximates something like an adult version of Power Rangers.  If that piques your curiosity, you\'ll almost certainly enjoy Gridman.Story: The series follows Yuta, a high school kid with amnesia that can become a large robot man named Hyper Agent Gridman, and his classmates as they fight off kaiju that attack the city.  It\'s difficult to talk much more about the plot without spoiling several of the plot twists, so I\'ll just say that...it is pretty wild and goes places that you don\'t expect, even with the cliched amnesiac protagonist setup.  It\'s a lot of fun and never boring, but sometimes the relentless pace of the plot leaves it little time to do anything else, especially with so much of the series\' run time consumed by kaiju-of-the-week battles.Audio/Visual: Both the sound and art are excellent here.  The voice work is consistently strong and the sound effects during battles have weight and really get you engaged in the fight.  The music is solid as well, not just the OP and ED, but the little things like fanfare when Yuta turns into Gridman, which really gives it that Saturday morning cartoon feel.  The animation is tremendous as well, it features some of the best integration of 3DCG that you\'ll ever see, the fights are lavishly animated, and the background art and character designs are very good as well.  From an artistic perspective, it\'s a real achievement.Characters: This is probably the main area in which Gridman stumbles.  As mentioned before, the fight scenes and the pace of the plot eats up so much time that the characters have very little time to be developed.  Yuta is a black hole of personality, an almost perfectly generic protagonist.  Rikka is similarly flat, and their ""romance"" has no heat behind it at all.  Yuta mentions that he likes her in the 3rd episode and then it\'s never mentioned again until the last minutes of the finale, so it probably should have just been cut entirely.  The exception here is Shinjo Akane, a very well written character that gets more development and opportunities to shine than the rest of the cast combined.  She really helps to rescue an otherwise terribly uninteresting main cast. it is pretty wild and goes places that you don\'t expect, even with the cliched amnesiac protagonist setup.

Not only is it a good sort of transitional show for fans of both genres in my eyes, it is also just a pretty good show in general. It fantastically uses CGI models and such to present a tokusatsu-like feel in the fights (such as the bouncing shoulderpieces on the titular character), which is an astounding feat in the midst of other shows having static, more solid armor on their characters. Aside...from some weird shots that many others have mentioned before, those can be overlooked when everything just feels bright, with a powerful story such as this one. Being used to many 25-50 episode shows, a 12 episode show like this is quite easy to get through, while also not being too difficult to understand, a show like this a fun one overall. from some weird shots that many others have mentioned before, those can be overlooked when everything just feels bright, with a powerful story such as this one.

Compared to Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, and even Kiznaiver, Gridman\'s animation is pretty generic for about 70% of its runtime. I\'ll get to the remaining 30% later. It doesn\'t have the signature ""TRIGGER energy"" that the other shows made by the studio contain. Most people can distinctly...tell when watching an anime if it was made by TRIGGER, but Gridman could have been made by anyone. Even Dynazenon had a bit of ""TRIGGER-ness"" to its art direction and some of the action scenes, but I can\'t remember a single moment in Gridman that brought me the same level of hype as even the first 2 minutes of Kill la Kill.If you\'re going into Gridman without the expectation of a TRIGGER show, however, I think you\'ll get something out of it, maybe even more than you would from shows like Kiznaiver, BNA, and Darling in the FranXX. That being said, it isn\'t perfect. The pacing is abysmal at times, especially in the first episode. The final battle struck me as lackluster and the ending is a bit excessive with how it overexplains concepts that really don\'t matter that much. That\'s it for my criticism though.The animation, as stated earlier, is pretty basic. HOWEVER, during the fight scenes, we get what I consider to be the most genuine love letter to tokusatsu action that has come out of the anime industry. While I feel that Dynazenon does fit the general hype level of what we thought Power Rangers was like when we were 6, Gridman\'s attention to detail and commitment to that kind of style is a sight to behold. The use of clunky CGI for the kaiju is something so brilliant that I never could have thought of because of my narrow mindset when it comes to 3D animation in general, it works because of how ridiculous it looks, not in spite of it.The story and characters range from serviceable to fantastic, and Akane is the real stand-out. Skip this paragraph if you haven\'t seen the show because I\'m going to go on a spoiler tangent here. Akane is the best villain from a trigger show and it\'s not even close. The only competition is maybe Noriko from Kiznaiver but she isn\'t really a villain so I\'m choosing to ignore her and Kiznaiver has its own problems. Akane embodies the human desire for escapism without it feeling like a lecture towards the audience. In that way, Gridman shares a lot in common with Evangelion, being that they both are trying to say that going outside is good for you and escapism is good in moderation but damaging in excess. It\'s fitting that Gridman shares a parent studio with Evangelion, TRIGGER is an offshoot of Gainax. Eva\'s ending always felt on the nose and very direct compared to Gridman\'s for me, and while I think Evangelion does it better, Gridman is still a different take on the concept. Either way, having a main antagonist with actual motivations and complexity is a breath of fresh air coming from TRIGGER.The sound design is excellent. I can distinctly remember several tracks from the show that stand out as perfect in the way that they are used. The OP and ED are fantastic as well. This is such a subjective category but the review is entirely my opinion so I\'m allowed to say that it\'s good.Overall, SSSS.Gridman is an amazing show that I highly recommend. tell when watching an anime if it was made by TRIGGER, but Gridman could have been made by anyone.

I put this anime to the side as I didn't feel confident in it before watching it. Happy to say, I was proven wrong.The story is very strong and interesting. At a quick glance, you'd think this anime is made for kids. This isn't the case whatsoever. When compared to what it has on display on the surface, the story is very dark, twisted, and deep. From the atmosphere...to the unraveling world around the characters, the story does everything it wants to do and more. The pacing is so well done, especially in the first few episodes where it felt so claustrophobic and stretched which gives off a sense of discomfort. The later episodes all have a different pacing style, but it is still well done. The story CAN feel standard at times, especially since SSSS.GRIDMAN is kind of a spiritual successor to the original Gridman. It delivers the story with confidence and is aware of what it's trying to be. The ending was a bit odd, and to be honest I didn't like it as much. It was implied throughout the anime, but still.The characters are all bright and vivid, and all have their own unique styles that contrast with one another. These characters are all so expressive it's amazing. They all feel as though you could meet them and they would be exactly what you'd think they'd be. From their designs to their poses, they all contribute a lot to this world. The Kaiju and Mechs designs all feel so nostalgic and fresh at the same time. If there is a model kit for this show, I'm definitely snagging them.The animation is superb, which is to be expected from Studio Trigger. The character animations are all fluid, and the use of CGI is extremely well done. The camera work is very dynamic and makes almost every scene seem so significant and bold. The fighting scenes are all CGI, which is good as 2D animation wouldn't be able to achieve what they were trying to go for here.Overall, this is a close second to my favorite mecha anime (the first being Knights and Magic). I absolutely loved every second of it. This anime is very underrated, but this is because it is a mecha anime that not everyone is into and turns it away just because of the genre itself.

I had seen the costume online but that’s been the extent of my knowledge of it.There’s a lot of cool visual nods to the Tokusatsu genre that made me want to watch the show, and I think for that alone it’s worth watching.Studio Trigger again does an amazing job. There is such a great deal of mystery in the show.

Gridman attempts both and while it\'s very fun to look at, the end result is kind of a mess.Owing it\'s inspiration to the 90\'s toku series of the same name, Gridman has a lot of elements that feel familiar if you\'re into that sort of thing. Our main character has mysterious amnesia and uses a computer in the local junk shop to fight kaiju by posing with a wristband to turn into the titular mecha. Most...episodes work a kaiju fight into the third act with generally very good animation.The plot starts to quickly lose any sense of purpose. By the midway point it\'s been pretty much fully revealed that reality is a simulation (not that it hadn\'t been heavily implied from the start), and there were honestly points in the last few episodes where everything felt like a muddled dream. There\'s a specific group of characters who show up in the early episodes with little to no explanation beyond ""oh we\'re here to help."" It\'s a plot that desperately lacks substance behind its cool ideas.It\'s really not all bad though.

I watched this because it was a short series, mecha and from Trigger, knowing nothing about the source material of Gridman.  This isn't the worst anime in the world by far, it's barely watchable.  What it does do decently is it's fanservice mecha stuff.  It has an interesting dynamic between the main chars, which pushed me to finish it.  In the end, a very forgettable anime, but I ended up watching SSSS Dynazenon as well, so I guess there is some charm to its themes and animation.Animation 7/10-  The standard...animation is rather basic, but the mecha, fight scenes etc are better.Sound 7/10-  Decent sound design with the mechs, decent OP/ED.Story 4/10-  Basic, not unexpected for the kind of series it is.Characters 5/10-  Mostly bland characters, but there is some interesting development with Akane.Enjoyment 5/10-  Barely watchable, but I didn't drop it, so there is that.I can't recommend this to anyone regardless of your interests in mecha or not.  This series just doesn't offer enough. animation is rather basic, but the mecha, fight scenes etc are better.Sound 7/10-  Decent sound design with the mechs, decent OP/ED.Story 4/10-  Basic, not unexpected for the kind of series it is.Characters 5/10-  Mostly bland characters, but there is some interesting development with Akane.Enjoyment 5/10-  Barely watchable, but I didn't drop it, so there is that.I can't recommend this to anyone regardless of your interests in mecha or not.

But as an ontological mystery with an amnesiac character trapped in a confusing, misleading world, it\'s excellent and provides all that level of intrigue and cliffhangers you\'re looking for. The characters are really fun and dynamic and the way they react to the mysteries as they unfold makes it really exciting.The main draw for SSSS.Gridman, however, is the amazing direction, using editing and sound design to tell a much stronger emotional story than anime usually ever can....Aside from fight scenes, the series has practically no score--almost no soundtrack, instead leaving it to the beautiful art design and ambient sound to convey the mood. The voice acting is also generally incredible. Many of the characters are Trigger-esque silly-accent gruff characters, but the main cast, especially Rikka, are given amazing voice work. The dialogue is very naturalistic--characters trail off, mumble, and talk over each other in a way anime practically never does. Thanks to this, you never feel like your hand is being held into the story beats, and the entire show evokes a really nice atmosphere of a creepy world in a sweaty summer.The ending isn\'t quite up to snuff in my opinion, resolving the mysteries in a way that is maybe ""too anime,"" if that\'s the right way to put it. Less mecha fighting in favor of more character drama would have won it over for me, I think. But as a whole the show is very good and an easy recommendation for fans of mystery-thriller shows.However I will admit I don\'t ship the main romance (""romance?""). Trigger wanted me to take the bait and I just didn\'t find it interesting at all.

Trigger wanted me to take the bait and I just didn\'t find it interesting at all.', ""This review will contain spoilers for the entirety of SSSS Gridman. You have been warned.SSSS Gridman being a loosely related sequel to a tokusatsu show even people within the toku fanbase have largely not seen or taken an interest in randomly being adapted in 2018 raised very few alarm bells - while Trigger did showcase a short that was done in tribute to Gridman a few years prior, Gridman itself was an anomaly in every respect, with only a few curious eyes wanting to check it out in 2018.Little did people know that what we'd get out of Gridman is the kickstart of a subfranchise...that would critically define Studio Trigger, being the most captivating set of series Trigger has done so far.Gridman's central premise is ironically somewhat hidden in the show's format - playing tokusatsu as well as mecha anime tropes straight albeit as a form of homage - Yuta's the chosen one by Gridman to save the world, Utsumi is the standard friend who cheers him on, Rikka is the aloof love interest and Akane is the popular girl everyone loves who also loves the main character. This betrays a meticulously well-written story about these characters and their relationships to one another - one about their limited agency, self-worth, purpose in their wider world and more importantly, the value of healthy connections instead of blindly giving up on the world in a fit of self-loathing rage.Our apparent trio - Yuta, Utsumi and Rikka - all embody these elements to various levels. Yuta's initially portrayed as an amnesiac, who due to the resets and forgetfulness questions his purpose in even fighting (or existing) before reconciling that with the fact people are getting erased from existence with each reset, putting it onto himself that he must keep fighting as a result. He's a blank slate, robotic man who does the motions of living but nothing more initially, coming onto his own by the end of the series through both his feelings for Rikka and finding worth in what he does as the setting's savior - even despite the twist at the end involving his identity, Yuta retains the lessons learned through the series and chooses to live as free and honest a life as he can, which is relevant to his budding feelings for Rikka - the reality Yuta must face is that he has to embrace the change in relationship that'll come out of any confession he makes to Rikka, with him over the course of the series getting there.Utsumi's role is as the emotional crutch of the group, being a sort of representation for the average toku fan watching this show craving an adventure of his own. In reality, he's just a guy wandering aimless through life, hoping for something to happen to him to ease his boredom instead of assimilate into the mold and be yet another boring person - his entire character arc is ironically about him seeing worth in his own emotional role, and not use his passion for tokusatsu as a be-all, end-all. His bond with Yuta despite Yuta’s amnesia is pretty great and his frequent tension with Rikka (only for them to grow closer together as characters) is worth mentioning – Rikka is someone he bonds with outside of tokusatsu, and it’s relevant to his character arc about breaking out of his shell and bonding with people outside of his interests.Rikka’s role is to act as the disinterested, grounded one of the three – being the one who often points out the absurdity of situations and has no real interest in tokusatsu tropes; in fact, Rikka doesn’t have much of an interest in anything. If Utsumi’s obsession with tokusatsu is supposed to highlight his own tunnel vision involving interests and interacting with the world around him, Rikka’s lack of interest highlights the person she is; someone who keeps a clear distance from everyone around her and lacks explicit emotional attachment to anyone while clearly keeping her distance. Her characterization is directly relevant to Akane’s, for reasons that involve the story’s central premise.Akane is the real main character of Gridman – she created this entire setting as an escape from reality, and all the different main characters reflect elements of her that she herself has, only the trio reflect positive traits (Yuta her inner altruism, Utsumi her passion for her hobbies but in a more functional person and Rikka being her general ideal for the kind of person she wants to be while also reflecting some of her flaws) and improve as people as they gain sentience away from Akane, and Akane herself slips further and further into a downward spiral as the series goes on; this world is her only escape from depression and suicidality that she lives through in her own life. Ironically, the trio gaining sentience – this including Anti, who debatably is her punching bag for the abuse she suffers in her own life, thereby continuing the cycle of abuse – can be reflective of her subconscious desire for someone to save her, and her own personal desire to finally gain the courage to face reality and be a happier person.The series’s themes tie also into the struggles involving growing up at all, and the desire to establish connections during puberty/adolescence. This is a more subtly hidden them, but it ties into every major character’s arc and Akane’s especially, with a central point being that Akane isn’t wrong for seeking bonds, but wrong for seeking them in such a manipulative manner in a way that wouldn’t help or save her. Alexis Kerib – his obvious connection to the original Gridman TV show notwithstanding – can be seen symbolically as her darkest desires in clinging to escapism no matter what and a symbol of such an unhealthy relationship, foiling him and Akane properly to the trio’s more natural and convincing friendship with each other (and later into the series, Akane herself).The side cast don’t get much characterization but are generally pretty fun to see, and the focus largely stays on the main cast (with the exception of Anti, whose characterization as a more humane kaiju with the capability of being a better person through empathy ironically contrasts with what Akane seeks herself). The story’s honestly insanely straightforward, it just hides its best punches insanely cleverly, seeking to lure in the watcher in the last third of the show, which is where everything magnificently comes together.The animation quality is stunning – while the CG during fights between Gridman and kaiju might be grating to some, it was fine to me and felt like a nice tribute to the style present in tokusatsu live action shows. The facial animations and subtle character movements look gorgeous and add a lot of characterization to the cast – small things like Utsumi and Rikka refusing to sleep during episode 3 or Rikka nervously twitching her fingers behind her back while talking to Yuta do wonders to add to the overall cast. The direction is exceptional – this is especially true in the last four episodes, but the show is a marvel of knowing how to drag the viewer into its pace and atmosphere, episode 9 being an obvious standout but more scenes than I can ever bring out are noteworthy too.This show requires quite a bit of patience, but damn is it oh-so-worth it.I strongly recommend it.Thank you for anyone and everyone who’s read my review to the end, any and all feedback would be appreciated. that would critically define Studio Trigger, being the most captivating set of series Trigger has done so far.Gridman's central premise is ironically somewhat hidden in the show's format - playing tokusatsu as well as mecha anime tropes straight albeit as a form of homage - Yuta's the chosen one by Gridman to save the world, Utsumi is the standard friend who cheers him on, Rikka is the aloof love interest and Akane is the popular girl everyone loves who also loves the main character.

I don’t follow anime studios and Trigger is the only one I can name. When I found out they were doing a mecha show, especially one based on a 90s franchise, I was excited. It’s a shame the show is nothing special. The characters are boring, especially the main character. He begins the series with amnesia, and he comes off as a boring blank slate because of it. The fights at the end were better animated than the rest of the show, making me think that they saved all their animation budget for the end. I could be wrong about that....I don’t know. But it made the majority of the episode feel like filler, just waiting to get to the good part. There were some good things. The designs of the kaiju and the fights were both nicely done. They do not, however, make up for the gaping void of nothing that inhabits the rest of the runtime. I don’t know.

.hack//Quantum,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9332/hack__Quantum,"[""I've been a fan of the .hack franchise for quite a long time. I came to it through .hack//Sign in high school and followed it into the games, exploring the other animes as they came out. So when I heard the announcement for .hack//Quantum I was very excited, but after the initial character design shots I was skeptical. Female characters of both Kite and Balmung, to me, screams unnecessary and pandering to fanboys; and adding a character whose literally Blackrose with a different hairstyle really annoyed me as it seemed extremely pointless and lazy. However I eventually downloaded them and sat down one evening to...pound it out, and I'm pleased to say my skepticism was misplaced. Despite the strange choice in characters .hack//Quantum stands out as a very strong addition to the franchise, on the level of both Sign and Roots.For more in depth analysis, continue reading below. To see an overview simply skip to the end.- -Story:The story begins with our three main characters (Asuma/Sakuya (female Kite), Iori/Tobias (female Balmung), and Eri/Mary (different Blackrose)) who are questing in a rather high level dungeon and, through Sakuya's foolishness, cause the death of several guild members who were partaking in a boss fight. After that they retire for the night and we are treated to a bit of exposition where we learn that our three protagonists, and probably the whole of Japan if not the world, has a microchip implanted inside them (that can only lead to good things, right?). After that Sakuya logs in to meet a strange character named Hermit, who appears to be our token cat character for this installment, and through the bounty on her head the two are thrown into a series of events that leads them, as well as Tobias and Mary, into a strange area known as the Pariah Folder. It's here that they can experience the same pain that their avatars do and when Eri is PKed by a random attacker she is sent into a coma in real life. It's then that Sakuya and Tobias decide that they'll do whatever it takes to get their friend back, and they might just have some help along the way.Characters:With only 3 episodes, and with a decent amount of story to tell, there isn't as much character development as in the two high points of the franchise (Sign and Roots), but there's still several bright spots to be found when watching. Though I initially thought the main character Sakuya was rather annoying, after witnessing her friend getting PKed and put into a coma she truly grows up a bit more and becomes a more likeable character. Hermit is another bright spot in the show, introduced as the mysterious cat person he carries the most secrets of the show, rivaled only by one other character. Hermit's mysterious yet playful and childish personality make him one of the most enjoyable characters in the show. It's unfortunate that Tobias doesn't get as much screentime as her foolish friend Sakuya, but as the more mature and reliable of the two we don't get to see her as much, still she does make a decent appearance and is a nice presence in the finale episode. Mary, unfortunately, gets little screentime outside the first episode what with her being PKed at the end of it. There is one other character who I did not hear named, a mysterious character with a young girl for an avatar (the best character design in the show, by far), who is referred to as 'Shamrock' according to MAL (the leader of the guild Sakuya got killed). She possesses a skill longtime fans of the series will know right away and, it's highly possible she is Pi's avatar in this version of The World (especially since she's done by the same voice actress)Art & Sound:It's tempting to simply write 'amazing' and knock off early when talking about the art, but that is the best way to describe the art. As it is an OVA, and much shorter than most other .hack anime, there's a lot of quality in the art; to the point where it is probably the best animated and best flowing of all the others. For only having 3 episodes there's a surprising amount of action, kicking pretty much right from the get go, and it's here that you can really tell that they've brought the A game. The sound is perhaps the weakest area of the anime (though that isn't saying much), since there's not much time to create memorable scores or background music. However it still manages to piece together a very suitable soundtrack, as well as including several sounds from other parts of the franchise for long time fans.Enjoyment:While initially skeptical going into the series, the 3 episode OVA has proven to be another strong addition to the .hack franchise. With all the Easter Eggs thrown in for longtime fans of the series, paired with the great artwork, it was hard not to like .hack//Quantum.- -So overall was .hack//Quantum a worthy addition of such a good franchise? With only 3 episodes to tell it's story it feels as if there are a few bits left out (especially if this is your first foray into the .hack series), but overall it stands on it's own. Being set a few decades into the future gives it far more of a pass regarding the coma aspect than other installments to the series, and the technology used is actually something that might happen one day in our lifetimes. So to those wondering if this is the best place to jump into .hack, I would quickly tell you to check out both Sign and Roots before venturing here but it isn't a horrible jumping on point, you will be confused regarding several things though (such as what Data Drain actually is). But to fans of the series who have not yet watched .hack//Quantum, or to those skeptical about it's moe-esque appearance, don't let that fool you. Underneath lies a well told story, some interesting characters and the best animation you've ever seen in a .hack anime.

Fans of the series, do yourself a favour and watch this as soon as you can."", ""The existence of .Hack//Quantum immediately brings up the question: How many damn times will Namco Bandai rehash the same story in the same franchise?STORY: Once upon a time, there was a video game company that made a really popular online game called The World (Though in the real world, the game that is housed within the game has a very questionable popularity, as in does anyone really care for .hack anymore?), the game was an incredibly flawed game where hacking is the only way to do any cool shit, and strange phenomenons that cause people in real life fall unconscious into a coma like state,...no law suits were filed.Years later, The World R:X is released, where it continued the broken programming of it's earlier version along with player vs player fights being the most prominent way to play, or just go around and kill other players which inspired others to become player killer killers... Go, just go...Just go with it. More queer phenomenons occur and more people end up in coma like states, still no law suits were filed and the The World continues to be extremely popular (In the franchise's world mind you).A few more years later, The World is still very popular and everything seems okay, not much hacking and people actually playing it like any other MMO like World of Warcraft, until a little kitty cat decides to fuck shit up, and the rest as they say is history, and you know what else they say? History repeats itself..Hack//Quantum is exactly that, the usual .hack story retold again but in a more compact space. If you had already played through one of the games, watched through one the anime series or read through one the manga adaptations, then chances are that the feeling dejavu is going to hit you like a brick, right smack in the face leaving a stinging feeling that is all too familiar.But it's time to look past the story rehashing and time to look at what they did with the characters this time around, which to be honest I rather like the central group of characters this time around, Asumi (Sakuya), Eri (Mary), and Iori (Tobias) who's video game designs are, except for Eri her's is more of remixed design, gender swapped versions of existing characters from earlier .hack series. Sakuya is a spunky go getter, something like a typical male shonen lead, Tobias is a knightly fancy looking warrior yet dresses like slob in real life and Mary is a proper like student, the kind that would only play a MMO if invited by a friend. They're nothing exciting, especially alone, but they work well together as a believable group of friends.And the main story they're a part of, other than what I initially criticized it for,  is a pretty enjoyable story centering a character named Hermit, who is a walking talking cat like Mia from the earlier .hack entries, who is involved with a dark area of the game that causes players to fall unconscious and the three players I spoke of have to find someway to save them.There's nothing bad or terrible in particular with this .hack or it's story, and it should be treated as a bite sized offering of what .hack is about, but if you are going into this being familiar with the franchise, then there is truly nothing new offered, and I still can't get over how the in-series game is still around given it's history, I mean if the company regrouped into a different one with a name change, sure, it would have been believable (The perfect real life example for anime fans for this would be ADV's transformation into Sentai Filmworks, it worked for them pretty well), but if they see that story not being broke, then I guess there's no point of fixing it.ANIMATION: I'm pretty sure that Bandai could have had enough money to pay for new writers, because the budget for the animation really shows. Very detailed and clean, this is the best the series has looked by far as animation is considered. Giant dragons, giant magical attacks, oh my! Even the fan service scenes with the hot springs are forgivable with the best snow rendering I've ever seen.SOUND: Absolutely nothing stands out, that's both good and bad. And either language, english or japanese, are just as good to listen to. Though I find it strange that Funimation is the one that pick this up for an english dub, usually Bandai picks them up... Oh right, nevermind.OVERALL:The Good:+ Stellar animation.The Mixed:+/- .Hack in a nutshell. / It's the same story that every .Hack went with for years.+/- The cast is likable. / They're nothing special to write home about.I do like the .Hack series as much as the next guy... Well more than the next guy because he's among the people who stopped caring for the franchise but, there really needs to be innovation with the .Hack franchise or it'll simply be forgotten by time. A video game reboot or something is in order, same old same old isn't going to cut it forever. no law suits were filed.Years later, The World R:X is released, where it continued the broken programming of it's earlier version along with player vs player fights being the most prominent way to play, or just go around and kill other players which inspired others to become player killer killers...

If you had already played through one of the games, watched through one the anime series or read through one the manga adaptations, then chances are that the feeling dejavu is going to hit you like a brick, right smack in the face leaving a stinging feeling that is all too familiar.But it's time to look past the story rehashing and time to look at what they did with the characters this time around, which to be honest I rather like the central group of characters this time around, Asumi (Sakuya), Eri (Mary), and Iori (Tobias) who's video game designs are, except for Eri her's is more of remixed design, gender swapped versions of existing characters from earlier .hack series. Sakuya is a spunky go getter, something like a typical male shonen lead, Tobias is a knightly fancy looking warrior yet dresses like slob in real life and Mary is a proper like student, the kind that would only play a MMO if invited by a friend. They're nothing exciting, especially alone, but they work well together as a believable group of friends.And the main story they're a part of, other than what I initially criticized it for,  is a pretty enjoyable story centering a character named Hermit, who is a walking talking cat like Mia from the earlier .hack entries, who is involved with a dark area of the game that causes players to fall unconscious and the three players I spoke of have to find someway to save them.There's nothing bad or terrible in particular with this .hack or it's story, and it should be treated as a bite sized offering of what .hack is about, but if you are going into this being familiar with the franchise, then there is truly nothing new offered, and I still can't get over how the in-series game is still around given it's history, I mean if the company regrouped into a different one with a name change, sure, it would have been believable (The perfect real life example for anime fans for this would be ADV's transformation into Sentai Filmworks, it worked for them pretty well), but if they see that story not being broke, then I guess there's no point of fixing it.ANIMATION: I'm pretty sure that Bandai could have had enough money to pay for new writers, because the budget for the animation really shows. Very detailed and clean, this is the best the series has looked by far as animation is considered. Giant dragons, giant magical attacks, oh my! Even the fan service scenes with the hot springs are forgivable with the best snow rendering I've ever seen.SOUND: Absolutely nothing stands out, that's both good and bad. And either language, english or japanese, are just as good to listen to. Though I find it strange that Funimation is the one that pick this up for an english dub, usually Bandai picks them up... Oh right, nevermind.OVERALL:The Good:+ Stellar animation.The Mixed:+/- .Hack in a nutshell. / It's the same story that every .Hack went with for years.+/- The cast is likable. / They're nothing special to write home about.I do like the .Hack series as much as the next guy... Well more than the next guy because he's among the people who stopped caring for the franchise but, there really needs to be innovation with the .Hack franchise or it'll simply be forgotten by time. A video game reboot or something is in order, same old same old isn't going to cut it forever."", 'Having followed .hack since the days of .hack//SIGN it\'s pretty safe to say I\'m quite the fan of the franchise. I\'ve seen every anime installment out there and I was actually excited for this. While mixed feelings of Kinmea Citrus taking over from longtime.hack// animation house Bee Train I was wondering how a new studio would take a new anime and I can say it\'s a fun and entertaining watch sure to be accessible to newcomers but may be a bit of a turn off for longtime watchers for my self.Animation and art wise Quantum was certainly sporting production values lacking from some previous installments...and to Kinema Citrus\' advantage they came in on a much later installment to be given a full budget and effort. Animation quality looks high and the character art, while reusing models from the previous installements, do give a new and great twist on some of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto\'s early designs as now we have a female version of Kite and Balmung and a BlackRose with much longer hair and other changed accessories. I really do enjoy the new style and the new characters are a fun mix. Seeing some returns of GU-styled characters also made for a nice mix of World R1 and World R2 styles and features put into this brand new version of the World known as The World R:X.The art direction is as good as ever as the scenic art always captures what a fantasy virtual world might look like overall this is an aesthetically pleasing show to look at.Story wise the story is fun and adventurous but it\'s also a balance of dramatic and light hearted at the same time. It doesn\'t feel too out left field as ""Legend of the Twilight"" did when it first debuted. Unlike SIGN or Liminality which were far more dialog driven and continued to build on it\'s mystery with mood and atmosphere this show mostly features action. A positive and a negative trait at the same time but it feels like the story was balanced enough to make it feel legit. The show offers diverse cast of characters that we get a full look at both within The World and back in the real World making this the first .hack anime to really do that.  And I really enjoyed this new take seeing both the players in and out of their virtual avatars.The plot is very welcoming to first time viewers and doesn\'t really require viewing of past .hack to understand it. Most previous events are talked about briefly enough to not slow down the story and to still give a basic understanding of the universe and past events in it.  The cast is entirely made up of new characters which makes it really easy to jump right in with no prior knowledge of the franchise.One major drawback to the story is while this show is very kind to new viewers who have never seen any .hack before, it may come as a bit jarring to long time watchers as my self. The very idea that CC Corp is still allowed to be in business after two major network crises which caused people to become comatose and other very serious problems within the real world, seems a bit of a stretch by now.  Between the events of World R:1 and World R:2 a fire broke out at CC Corp which destroyed much of the old world which makes it easy to justify how they escape the blame from The Network Crises then.The anime does it\'s best to justify this somewhat by saying comatose victims are in private hospitals controlled by CC Corp but it unfortunately doesn\'t solve other problems with the continued repeat of the coma plot. I get it that to tell .hack you have to use this plot to raise the stakes and I honestly can\'t think of any other way to do it but really the only explanation as to how The World is still a massively popular game as well as how CC Corp. must be that CC Corp has paid off the Japanese government or something.Musically the show fails to capture anything interesting. Ko Otani unfortunately doesn\'t deliver an interesting score and the soundtrack itself isn\'t all that great  on it\'s own either. The franchise has sorely lacked without Yuki Kajiura\'s direct involvement ever since Ali Project took on Roots and failed at it just as much. Yuuka Nanri does return to provide the theme song though this time she is without Kajiura. However the theme song is still a nice one and fits the general mood of .hack.  The Sounds Effects and Japanese acting however are as great as ever.Dubbing wise, this is the first .hack to ever be dubbed and released by FUNimation. it\'s a very solid dub overall with plenty of great performances. I\'ll admit for those who played GU it may be jarring to see Aina speak with a deeper voice as opposed to her more young girl voice from the games but it makes sense in context. It\'s a great dub and release from FUNimation and I\'m hoping with Bandai Entertainment\'s demise they will handle future .hack anime if any even if newer games never get released over here. Although if any past characters ever return I would hope they would try and get the original English cast members back but that\'s for future projects to worry about.Quantum is just fun. It may not have the depth of Liminality or SIGN but it certainly was a lot more fun than Legend of the Twilight was. I\'d put it above Roots in terms of enjoyment and it\'s an overall fun project and one of the few that does not tie directly into a followup game which makes this a pretty solid watch if you are wanting to jump into .hack. If you are long time fan it still may be worth a look just remember you might have to likely check your brain at the door to get past some of the problems with the plot and if you are newcomer to this might be a very easy one for you to get into as SIGN and Liminality are known for their very slow methodical pacing and more talking than action. and to Kinema Citrus\' advantage they came in on a much later installment to be given a full budget and effort.

I will also say this is my first ever real OVA experience which makes me a bit jarred by the necessities of storytelling in that medium.I will say overall I enjoyed Quantum, a fun little, if dramatic and heartfelt journey that may not have left me with any real impression of whether or not I wish to continue with the franchise as a whole but certainly leaving me with a lot of enjoyment for...this tale at least.Another problem I had is I really had no sense of what things were or how they operated, there are many times that mechanics of the game or technology go unexplained though I am almost positive this would be solved for me if I were to watch some more major entries in the franchise like Sign that would have a bit more time to devote to such things.Overall I enjoyed this one, not sure if Sign should go up on my list though.

Oh well."", 'This feels like a general Re/Introduction To the World of .hack (anime wise). If you\'ve not seen .hack and This is a really nice and straight to the point welcome to The World, but it\'s not quite the same as the older stuff. People who have seen .hack before, while the general plot of coma is here, it\'s a motive, different take, and a different way of seeing ""the World"" Half the time you\'re In Real Life. It\'s quite balanced in it\'s approach, it\'s not as...light and...comedy(?) filled as Legends of the Twilight Bracelet and not...overly emotion as SIGN or GU. I\'m Actually temped to...call this a bit more than mediocre (I don\'t want to be easy to give away a ""Good"") but it is pretty good...I guess It doesn\'t really leave me with a strong impression. I have mix feelings, Have People read Twilight Bracelet manga? The World and Hence .hack it self is like a marathon, Characters will have their turn to experience the ""The World"" to change, grow-up, make bonds and have their adventures and stories and eventually pass on the baton to another group/generation, With that so too does the world change (Link pissed me off by bring everyone back, which nullified this romantic concept I had). So I should appreciate what\'s going to happen in in R:X....without an omnipresent...Aura *fetal position*Story: I don\'t have much of an impression of the story, people go into coma, information is scavenged for, and it conjures up some what despairing emotion out of the characters. It\'s .hack that doesn\'t take it self too seriously unlike it\'s canon predecessors(which means I\'m jaded hence; it feels lukewarm). And it\'s script is more or less; well contained in it\'s 3 episode limit.The tone is different from a majority of previous .hack series; mostly due to the evenly spent time within ""The World"" and \'In Real life\'. Which brings about mixed feelings for me - On the one hand: they were able to  squeeze in a humble school slice-of-life, familiarising us with these characters and how the game affects them outside, hence in different point of view. On the other hand: I really like the way previous .hack series only ever allowed us to see what was happening within ""The World"", rarely touching the livelihood of real-life (in Limitality\'s case, the exact opposite) which kept the it enigmatic, therefore pushing the viewer into one extreme; channelling the state-of-mind of being trapped in the game until quests were complete and only knowing what someone was like with in the game; which would then peak the curiosity. I found that Approach really charming.But the Things is, That\'s NOT what this OVA is about, The main characters we follow are not trapped, but are fishing out things from the game, and they\'re are pretty much already friends in real life. While a point of how important the game is to these characters in forming their bonds new&old is made throughout the episodes, it isn\'t as sub-consciously emphasised (as previous .hack). But ONCE again: That\'s NOT what it\'s all about: ""The World"" is almost treated like an important devise for these people to overcome real life problems eg.maintaining Sakuya\'s relationships the others, Hermits need of a donator, and that scientist\'s wish to overcome racism. It\'s important, but it never forget\'s that it\'s a game rather than a place where I worship Aura. It\'s A new view, new staff and it\'s a new world R:X. but people still fall into a coma.Art&Sound: Being an OVA, one expects high production values, and it does just that. Scenery, Landscapes etc are sharp, detailed and (if I may) stunning. While I adore Yoshimi Umino\'s work for previous .hacks and this it\'s as pushy in creating atmosphere like that in Casshern Sins. Yusuke Takeda, GOO(D) JOB!For some odd reason, I took a little extra notice of sound&visual effects, they work really well...what more should I say...Now The Music, one should simply think of it as a nice game soundtrack, it\'s never out of place, nor over-baring and silences are used nicely too.That\'s the thing, while the backgrounds are stunning, beautiful and atmospheric they missing that little things that truly makes them extra-special. So too- no, More so is the Music, It accompanies well with every moment, but never seizes one or compliments one(like colours purple and yellow) Don\'t know what\'s I\'m talking about? go watch .hack//SIGN, Evangelion or Katanamonogatari. So I guess what It\'s missing is a strong mood, yes there\'s atmosphere and you know when something\'s sad, bad, happy or terrifying, but I never felt a gushing mood of despair, excitement or desperate glory of survival. In that sense, that\'s what makes this OVA easy to watch and enjoy I suppose, it\'s pretty down to earth.Characters: These characters are likeable or at least agreeable. They\'re not gender confused or super angst(well maybe Hermit is) or socially disturbed and seeking vengeance(well maybe Hermit is). They\'re like slightly more realistic archetypes of sorts.

It's a solid OVA with likable and funny characters and should be watched by any fan of the series. I think that five episodes would have sufficed for this story because even though it was and OVA, they built a good story from the first episode and the two episodes afterwards felt rushed towards a somewhat incomplete ending.

The emotions portrayed by the plot, were oddly relatable as the voice acting (japanese) was very well done. I would say, however, I enjoyed the action scenes the most, as they were well choreographed and the stayed very close to the ""video game"" motif.

In short, I would say that yes I am interested in the rest of the series.

They see a guild get taken out by a really OP boss monster and the stupid lovable main character girl picks up some unnamed item. They log off. The MC girl logs back in alone the next day to find that, for some reason, she is being hunted by a gang of nameless videogame mercs. While...on the run she meets a furry blue child named Hermit. They get captured but then escape with the help of the other two girls in the trio. Another chase ensues and after fuzzy boy falls and dies some black hole thing erupts and teleports them all to virtual hell. For some reason they can feel real pain in this limbo so everyone freaks out and tries to log off. But before they can, Eri (the nerdy one) gets the magic touch and goes into a coma IRL.

The voice acting and sound design are more than competent. The characters are likable and and their personalities are distinct. The character designs are great, too. So this should be an awesome show right? Let me go heat up my popcorn. Well...Frankly, the story is an absolute mess.

The exposition scenes all feel like they just barely make enough sense to be passable and just sort of fall flat. Many events in the story don\'t really make sense at all and are never explained. Character motivations are often vague (a lot like that statement). The logic of .hack//Quantum\'s reality doesn\'t seem to line up with our own a lot of the time and it just leaves the viewer confused.

I don\'t think I ever will, especially considering I have also heard tell of this being the best .hack has to offer.All in all, I would say .hack//Quantum can be an enjoyable experience if you are willing to ignore the weak storytelling elements and focus on the pretty pictures and cute girls.

It\'s difficult to achieve much with an OVA, but the animation always stuck out to me as far as the overall quality. They took advantage of the feature film length of the series but there was jump in continuity that was rushed. The series would of benefited with pacing with 6 episodes, but that\'s so it could properly flesh itself out.As this OVA ""could"" be shown as it\'s own series, for the purpose of the lore it is vital to watch the original .Hack to understand more about The World....One could retrospectively watch Quantum and go back to watch the original series, but the original series is key to fully appreciate how playing the World is.ART 9/10The atmosphere drew me in. The dungeons were very tall, that\'s the strength I first noticed. Nothing felt confined as far as the backgrounds go. I did appreciate the main city they went to being nostalgic of the original .Hack. I don\'t feel it pulled enough of the digital aspects from it\'s mother series which is the only reason I\'m not giving it a complete 10/10.SOUND 9/10The pacing of the sound with the story was lovely. Taking into consideration the character\'s personal needs for why they played the game apart from when they needed to react. Sometimes a soundtrack doesn\'t have to be ground breaking to get it\'s point across by working with the story. There were wonderful fantasy elements paired with nostalgia that made it feel personal enough.CHARACTER 9/10With the characters being one the of the strong points, I wouldn\'t say they aren\'t perfect. Sakuya was the driving force of the series, she was inspirational and stuck to her good aligned morals. Her friends Tobias and Mary were excellent support characters as they faced their own challenges as the story progressed.*** SPOILER ALERT***Hermit was a much needed exposition, that is a somewhat common theme with the .Hack franchise. There is generally a character that is too involved with the World. It helps guide the boundaries from the real world to the online world as they have different sets of rules.ENJOYMENT 10/10Completed the series in an hour and a half, which is much more appreciated as an adult as it is difficult to finish a full series commonly.OVERALL 9/10It made me more interested in .Hack as I have had previous experience both with some of the series and the video game. It is a great series to bridge together both the older style of the series with a refreshing take in overall pacing. One could retrospectively watch Quantum and go back to watch the original series, but the original series is key to fully appreciate how playing the World is.ART 9/10The atmosphere drew me in. The dungeons were very tall, that\'s the strength I first noticed. Nothing felt confined as far as the backgrounds go. I did appreciate the main city they went to being nostalgic of the original .Hack. I don\'t feel it pulled enough of the digital aspects from it\'s mother series which is the only reason I\'m not giving it a complete 10/10.SOUND 9/10The pacing of the sound with the story was lovely. Taking into consideration the character\'s personal needs for why they played the game apart from when they needed to react. Sometimes a soundtrack doesn\'t have to be ground breaking to get it\'s point across by working with the story. There were wonderful fantasy elements paired with nostalgia that made it feel personal enough.CHARACTER 9/10With the characters being one the of the strong points, I wouldn\'t say they aren\'t perfect. Sakuya was the driving force of the series, she was inspirational and stuck to her good aligned morals. Her friends Tobias and Mary were excellent support characters as they faced their own challenges as the story progressed.*** SPOILER ALERT***Hermit was a much needed exposition, that is a somewhat common theme with the .Hack franchise. There is generally a character that is too involved with the World. It helps guide the boundaries from the real world to the online world as they have different sets of rules.ENJOYMENT 10/10Completed the series in an hour and a half, which is much more appreciated as an adult as it is difficult to finish a full series commonly.OVERALL 9/10It made me more interested in .Hack as I have had previous experience both with some of the series and the video game. It is a great series to bridge together both the older style of the series with a refreshing take in overall pacing.']"
Ace wo Nerae! 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/314/Ace_wo_Nerae_2,"['This is what I would call the pinnacle of dramatic audiovisual portrayal and exploration of an individuals struggle and growth.The story continues mainly from where the original series left off. I\'d say that the engaging part of the series for me is the exploration of the struggle of the main character and the story is more so used to lay out a premise for that exploration.The art style of the series is different from the prequels which had more bright and youthful perspective to the design and colors. The palette for this series is lot darker and portrays more mature and darker approach to...the series. I\'d say that the design and colors are in line with the main characters mindset compared to the earlier series. The vibe of the design is also very ""Dezaki"" looking at Oniisama e... and Black Jack OVA.I\'d say that part of the philosophy of this sequel series is growing up from an innocent childhood to accepting the reality around you and overcoming the struggle. The art and design I\'d say represent this philosophy when compared to the original 1973, 1978 and 1979 more youthful parts of the story.The key character during this season is Oka Hiromi the main character and her relationships with tennis, her friends and the coach Munakata Jin.  I\'d say that these relationships and how their weight reflects on the main character and her struggle is handled exceptionally well in this series.Another key part of the series is the Oka Hiromi growing up through her struggle and moving on towards the future accepting herself and her relationships.As far as enjoyment goes this series is probably the series that I was most engaged in to watching just because of how well the struggle of the character and her growth during the series was handled. If you are not fan of heavy struggle or dramatised portrayal of growth you might not enjoy this season as much.Overall I\'d say that this was one of the most engaging audiovisual experiences that I\'ve have been able to experience. the series.

But Ace wo Nerae! 2 has everything I could've asked for. And not just because I love tennis with all my heart.We see our main character in her transition of a beginner in tennis to a one of the biggest promises of Japan. Oka Hiromi has been working for three years with her coach Munakata. First episode takes place in the final of the National Tournament in her...third year, while Madame Butterfly and Ranko are now college girls. We can see her new abilities and skills and it seems there is no rival for her in high school. This is just a preparation for what is to come in her career.Without making major spoilers, this season has a lot of drama, more than in the previous installments, and also more mature themes. It's not just that but it's better constructed than in the previous season. In the 1979 movie (which I highly recommend before watching this season), we see a certain problem with Munakata in the final scenes. The OVA takes place around those days, and this is where the real drama begins.Ace wo Nerae! 2 gives us a great representation of overcoming serious and personal difficulties while you are trying to improve and be the best in what you do. I really love all the characters' development, especially our main heroine Oka Hiromi, who suffers the transition of being a simple child to an adult who has to face the reality of the world where she wanna lives, where it depends on her to stand up and to continue trying her best.Regarding the style, you will note the typical designs of 80s-90s animes (I prefer these more than those from 73' and 79') and a better direction, mainly scene by scene which I really liked because it gave a better dynamism to the tennis matches, something important to keep you glued to the screen and make you think you are watching a real match.About the music, the OST is very good. The OP and ED are more than amazing and for me both are the best of the franchise. I'm really in love with that sax in the beginning of Endless Dream and also with Moriguchi's voice.I know that the main direction was made by Noboru Furuse and Osamu Dezaki was the chief supervisor, but this clearly has the stamp of a Dezaki work: splendid pastel freeze frames, screen split in two and more.This is absolutely worth it if you enjoyed the first season or the movie, and even if you weren't really convinced by the previous works and wanted to see more of this wonderful story of overcoming serious obstacles in life and trying to live in the sports world. I will be eternally grateful to have found this amazing anime and one of the spokon I have enjoyed the most. third year, while Madame Butterfly and Ranko are now college girls.

The next installment of Aim for the Ace! after a delightful series and movie adaptation. We step into a new and maturing Oka Hiromi now focused entirely on her tennis after graduating and becoming a junior champion with her teammates. Oka has achieved it all, she’s a tennis star, has a great coach, and amazing friends/teammates.Until she doesn’t.For fans of the previous installments, the style shift and VA changes might be quite jarring. As we turn away from the softer palette and character designs (a bit more similar to black jacks ‘93 OVA), Fortunately this does not distract too much...from the beloved tennis and personal drama. We also step away from unorthodox framing and shots to a more direct scene by scene. Sound quality is for sure a step up from the rest of the series as well. Aim for the Ace! 2 offers a look into the more personal trials and tribulations of our favorite characters as they go through loss, grief, and struggle. A more serious take on a sports anime, but absolutely worth it. from the beloved tennis and personal drama. We also step away from unorthodox framing and shots to a more direct scene by scene.

When did this happen? Hiromi's boyfriend was Takayuki.In short, I found the first season more interesting, this one focusing more on drama. ""]"
