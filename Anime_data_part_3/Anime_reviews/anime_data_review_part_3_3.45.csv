Ling Jian Zun 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40062/Ling_Jian_Zun_2nd_Season,"[""You can fix trash cultivation level but you can't fix stupid. I've read the manhua and it is much more entertaining and tolerable than the adapted Donghua, Spirit Sword Sovereign 2nd season is garbage it's no wonder why it's hard to find online.StoryIn the second season, the tournament arc that displays ones martial strength and ability to join one of the 4/5 major Martial halls. Chu Xing Yun shows exceptional talent by winning this tournament and joining Yu Yun's masters Martial Hall as an inner disciple in order to learn about methods to save his beloved from her life threatening ice-blood condition.This donghua has...been very vague in the details since the beginning, the pacing is very fast which leads to a lossy way of plot development and as a result many plot holes.CharactersI get the feeling the characters exist in this Donghua to serve as a stepping stone for Chu Xing Yun because in the Manhua, he treats everyone with respect if they treat him with resect like Poisonous Yan. When Poisonous Yan agrees to follow Chu Xing Yun as a slave, he gets better treatment but throughout this season I haven't seen this treatment and Poisonous Yan's following is one sided. Furthermore,Chu Xing Yun is such a tryhard in the Donghua, he is arrogant and can't back it up with his reincarnated powers. He has the wind attribute which allows him to seemingly teleport but for some reason in his battles this season he decides it's a good idea to use his sword to outwit his opponent head-on which is stupid. Then at the end he magically uses the spirit power absorption and never uses it again it feels like his powers are just used once and never mentioned but replaced with new techniques. He literally owns martial arts techniques and he has trouble fighting people at the same age as him that didn't reincarnate, that's just embarrassing.Art & SoundBad art and bad sound. I could barely find this series online and it had terrible subtitle translations. If it wasn't for the Manhua, I wouldn't be persisting but this is a hit or miss watch. been very vague in the details since the beginning, the pacing is very fast which leads to a lossy way of plot development and as a result many plot holes.CharactersI get the feeling the characters exist in this Donghua to serve as a stepping stone for Chu Xing Yun because in the Manhua, he treats everyone with respect if they treat him with resect like Poisonous Yan.

"Mix: Meisei Story 2nd Season - Nidome no Natsu, Sora no Mukou e",https://myanimelist.net/anime/52614/Mix__Meisei_Story_2nd_Season_-_Nidome_no_Natsu_Sora_no_Mukou_e,"[""tl;dr: Watch if you like the other series made by Adachi. Otherwise I don't see a point in watching this. Start with one of his other series first. Preferably Cross Game (though H2 is my favorite).It's as simple as: if you like Cross Game, H2, Sunny Ryoko, and (especially) Touch, you'll enjoy this anime for the most part, because of nostalgia and all the tricks Adachi usually pulls to mess with our heart; if you don't like the anime/manga mentioned above, then you won't enjoy watching MIX at all, since it's by far the weakest out of the bunch.Adachi pulls exactly the same old tricks...as he did in the 80s and the 90s, which is why stuff like the casual stalking and creep shots can turn people off, however these tricks are pulled in a self-aware fashion. It's fairly obvious that the author and most of the characters don't approve of these actions and find them creepy, and that they're present 100% for Touch nostalgia points.This series has nothing unique going on for it (even more than usual). It's tailored specifically for an older audience and die-hard Adachi fans. Overall, it's lighter on the heart-strings, the romance drama is toned down (so far), the baseball games aren't that dramatic, there are no evil coaches and players, and the characters never really break down completely. I wish the characters were more emotionally unstable, but it looks like Adachi held himself back.The 4th wall breaking is absolutely atrocious though. I guess the author figured that the 80s humor wasn't cutting it in the current times, so he tried to be funny that way, but instead it just breaks immersion and takes away from the little seriousness that's left in the anime.Finally, this anime feels like something that would come out in 2010. There are too many long and pointless conversations, the screen changes very slowly, there are too many repeated flashbacks and jokes. Simply put, it's very easy to find enough stuff to cut out of the episodes to turn this into a 12 episode per season anime, and the quality would actually shoot through the roof thanks to that. The first 4 episodes of season 2 were especially boring and predictable.Recommended and rated at 7/10 because Adachi is my favorite author. I obviously have bias and enjoyed this way more than most people would. as he did in the 80s and the 90s, which is why stuff like the casual stalking and creep shots can turn people off, however these tricks are pulled in a self-aware fashion.

One Piece: Mezase! Kaizoku Yakyuu Ou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2490/One_Piece__Mezase_Kaizoku_Yakyuu_Ou,"[""This is basically one of those movie specials you get to see before the actual movie. Kinda like Pokemon vacation before the Pokemon Movie started in the 90's.In this short special. The Strawhat Pirates are on another island this time playing baseball against Arlong and some other Characters from the show Like Hachi.The game as you can imagine is crazy and to extreme for normal baseball. But its still enjoyable to watch. As the crew uses their special techniques to score homeruns and get strike outs.During this time Mr 2 Bon Clay and Buggy are commentating. And during this whole time you only hear these...two speak. They even read out the dialogue for Luffy as he calls out his special home run Gom Gom attack.Overall its really enjoyable to watch how the animators and artist got this special to work. two speak.

Kaizoku Yakyuu Ou ReviewStory (7/10) GoodThere's really nothing to be said he's it's just a little what if clip of the Straw Hat Crew if they played Baseball against certain villains of their past. It's not badArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good...For a 5 minute clip the art style and animation was very good and it better be! It's only 5 minutes! If toei made this look bad then you would have to give up the little little hope you still have left for them.Sound (7/10)The Sound was good but the fact that they had none of the voice actors playing their characters just the voice was Buggy and Mr. 1 (I think) commentating in the background AND also doing the voices of the actually other characters felt odd. But since it's only 5 minutes it's not to the point where it's something to complain about because by the time you realized this is happening it's basically over lolCharacters (10/10)The only reason I gave this section a 10 is because it's just show casing all of the straw hat crew's personality through a baseball game is it did it well. It reminded me of that one Sonic X baseball episode where they did the exacted same thing it was entertaining and short.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodLike I said entertaining and short the only thing that may bother you is that the voice of Buggy the clown and Mr.1 is voice everything but the fact that it's only 5 minutes doesn't make it an issue it took me longer to write the review than to watch it honestly lolOverall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.80/10) Good+Short and sweet to and extent it's so short you can't really hate on it.

We see the strawhats play baseball against the fishman pirates all in their own unique fashion. This is all narrated by Buggy and Mr. 2 who provides all the voices for the strawhats, meaning that you don’t hear any of the strawhats speaking themselves which sadly diminishes a lot of the funniness of the entire short. Nonetheless a true one piece will still enjoy this little funny short. ', ""I gave this an 8 overall because I felt that it didn't live up to it's expectations. I enjoyed it, it was funny but I felt like it wouldn't matter if this special was not made. Now OP fans don't start hating me because I am a big OP fan myself but it was like tehy made this on their free time.Story2 teams battle it out for the cup. Team Luffy vs team Fisherman. Both teams battle for the cup using their abilities to get the upper hand and the fisherman using underhanded moves. We have mr 2 and buggy as the announcers who...play their part in making you laugh and the special end with biggy nicely.I would compare this to the foxy arc because of the game theme and what followed. Anyway hope I didn't discourage you and enjoy the special. play their part in making you laugh and the special end with biggy nicely.I would compare this to the foxy arc because of the game theme and what followed.

Murder Princess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1696/Murder_Princess,"[""For a short series with non-stop action and an adventure with a twist, there is no need to look further than Murder Princess. Personally, when I heard about the title, I was thrilled because the idea of a killer princess is something new and different when its brought upon a series. No doubt, instantly I knew it was gonna be a good series just from the title itself. What was your thought when you first heard about it?Anyway, in moving along, as summaries in the synopsis, Princess Arita just witnessed  the death of her king and now fleeing from unknown assassins, she accidentally...ran into Falis, a famous bounty hunter and with a twist of fate, they switched souls making Alita the maid and Falis, the princess instead.As the series moves on, you get to see how Falis adjust her new life in being the princess of Foreland as well as savagely slashing her enemies away with her great bounty hunter skills in order to protect the land and the citizens of Foreland, a promised made with Alita. In additional, there are many mysteries throughout the storyline to keep you entertained other than just slashing and shooting throughout the series like for example the mystery of the dark knight and the past of Princess Falis as known as Alita into why she became a bounty hunter. Ideas like these makes the storyline more captivating.In regards to the OP theme, beginning it with heavy metal rock music gets you into the mood at the beginning of each episode. It's like, you know you will get to see some action and they just want you to gear up for it. Ideas like these just makes the series more enjoyable in my opinion.Overall, a short, fast, action pace series full of adventures and thrills. As specified by the title, it does deliver a 'killer' good series. ran into Falis, a famous bounty hunter and with a twist of fate, they switched souls making Alita the maid and Falis, the princess instead.As the series moves on, you get to see how Falis adjust her new life in being the princess of Foreland as well as savagely slashing her enemies away with her great bounty hunter skills in order to protect the land and the citizens of Foreland, a promised made with Alita.

I noticed the genre tab didn't include shoujo-ai but I believe there is a decent dose of that thrown in with all the fun action. Regardless, when I first heard of the title I thought it was going to be about a renegade princess more than a warrior princess, as murder is typically associated with bad people. The show's storyline would actually tell otherwise.Being an OVA, the show spares you from the &quot;unecessary&quot; details and goes with a &quot;this is how this universe works so...deal with it for now approach.&quot; It focuses more on the fighting and drama more than details and common sense. Although they do try to tie up some loose ends with what small time frame they have. But that's what makes this show so entertaining and fun. For you seasoned veteran anime watchers, the story line and plot twists are very standard and you'll most likely be able to predict what happens next fairly easily. Fortunately, that doesn't mean that this show is boring at all.As for the characters, they are a very unique bunch considering the setting of the anime. But in typical anime fashion, there is no reason why they're there but definitely make for a fun viewing experience. It'll take a minute to figure out what most of the wierd characters are but they're of pretty generic types. None of them are very memorable. Theres no real depth to any of the cast with the exception of the princess and her companion, the only source of drama in the show.When somone thinks of music in an action flick, you generally would assume a smashing guitar rift medley of the hard rock kind. That is exactly what you get from this show. The interesting thing I noticed was that each 'guitar intrumental' was different everytime they played it, as opposed to using the same song over and over and over again. The OP and intrumentals all sound like something that should belong in a video game, but somehow they fit this show perfectly. Another strong point is the character seiyus. All though it took me a few episodes to accept Romi Paku's (Hitsugaya Toushirou from Bleach) rough voice as the princess, but like Hitsugaya, she grows on you as well (especially since the princess is pretty hot). But in my opinon, Chiwa Saito, steals the show. Pay attention to Yuna to find out why.With so many high quality anime being released in rapid succession, it's hard to say that the art and animation of this show looks great. For what it's worth, the art is done very well, but like most of the show it's drawn with average quality. No real high depth and detail to any of the artwork but its all just fine at best. I would also have scored this show a little higher in the art and animation department if they didn't skimp (leave out) so much on the action scenes. Theres alot of cookie cutter techniques in the fight scenes, like the famous &quot;blade swipe in the black,&quot; or the &quot;blurry punch&quot; technique, and even the &quot;jump to lightspeed&quot; background. Is all used here. Of course they're all standard cheap action techniques, but the fight scenes do have an above average blood content. Limbs fly off, blood spatter flies everywhere, and even organs occasionally get exposed. The violence may be cheap but at least its graphic.Overall, this is pretty much another average anime to add to your &quot;completed&quot; list. If you don't mind lack of depth in your story and just want a pretty fun action experience give this one a shot. If that doesn't sound like your thing WATCH IT ANYWAY. It's 6 episodes long and this show does bring a fun experience.

There was a lot of potential to have good character development and an interesting story, but six episodes just didn't do it.  The synopsis of the series sounded compelling, but the &quot;magical accident&quot; is little more than a one-line myth designed to explain away something the writers clearly couldn't think of a better reason for.  The same with the story between Cesilia and Falis.  The connection between the two is weak and cliche...which is something I found myself saying about the plot in general as well.  It was very predictable....By half-way through episode two I felt it was pretty clear what would happen and it wasn't exactly an innovative plot hook.  Other than the first episode, the fight scenes were repetitious and really left something to be desired.  The princess who seemed so strong in the first episode really stop being a strong fighting character pretty quickly as she is swatted around numerous times and spends a lot of time (for a 6 episode series) on her back.While my review may sound a touch harsh, I didn't find the series completely terrible.  It just wasn't great, either.  I thought the music was good and really helped moved scenes along.  The idea of a killer princess is kind of misleading in this series and has been done better elsewhere.  Murder Princess is ok for a one-shot, but really, it could have been better.

Princess Alita escape from the castle and on the way for escape she finds an infamous bounty hunter called  Falis. For some reason, when they fall thanks to Alita pushing her by fear after being attacked by a monster, they exchange body and Falis now becomes the princess of the...kingdom with all her skills of being a bounty hunter.

During that tail end of the manga's run, it was adapted into a six episode OVA. Which was produced by Marvelous Entertainment, a company primarily know for video games, and animated by Bee Train, the company behind a good chunk of the .Hack anime franchise. This is one you may or may not have heard of since it's not obscure but not really well known either. So, is it worth looking into?Story:Our story opens with a coup. In the kingdom of Forland, a scientist under the monarchy's employ decides that it's time to...take things over for reasons that are a spoiler and I shan't get into. During the coup, the king sends his daughter, the Princess Alita, out through a hidden passage to safety. She and her escort are attacked by monsters in the forest and she barely manages to escape and meet the bounty hunter, Falis. The two fall from a cliff which causes their souls to swap bodies because... magic. Alita entreats Falis to save her kingdom, offering herself as collateral. Admiring her determination, Falis agrees, not completely realising what she's getting herself into.On the positive side, the narrative is compelling. It keeps several mysteries throughout the main story that keep your interest and the eventual payoff for them is pretty good. This is also one of those rare series that manages to combine sci-fi and fantasy elements in a sensical way that adds to the world instead of having the world suffer from the clash between the two as is often the case when you combine advanced technology and magic. The pacing is very close to perfect with the plot moving very smoothly and steadily. It's never rushed or slowed to a crawl. The ending is great with some real emotional substance.Now, to the problems with the series. The main problem is with the body switch. There are some good story reasons for it, but they don't do much with it. Falis has no trouble adjusting to fighting in Alita's body, which is apparently as well trained as her body was contrary to all logic. Neither one has much trouble adjusting to their new role either. Alita easily falls into a subservient role for the “princess” and Falis only has minor troubles adjusting to aristocratic comportment. It also bothers me that everyone consistently refers to Falis, in Alita's body, as “princess” when she does act as the queen for a time. It's, admittedly, a minor issue but it's annoying to me when a work of media calls the land's ruler “princess” when she's doing the duties of a queen and it happens all the time. Whether it's the Mushroom Kingdom, Mobius, Equestria or the Moon Kingdom.Characters:The primary characters in this, Alita and Falis, are really well developed and fleshed out characters. They also get some great interactions both with each other and with the secondary characters. The supporting characters vary a lot more. Dominikov and Pete are pretty good characters, Dominikov especially. But a lot of the other secondary characters are not very interesting. The antagonists have incredibly flimsy motivations. Then we have the characters who are there more to serve a function than to actually act as characters; Jodo, Ana and Yuna being prime examples.Art:The art is pretty spectacular. The character designs are all pretty creative and interesting. The action sequences flow well, in spite of the occasional motion lines scene, and have a very dynamic feel to them. The details are very nicely done in terms of backgrounds, background objects and the like. I also like that the series is pretty subdued about showing violence. It shows what it needs to, but keeps the more graphic parts off-screen. The only criticism I really have for the art is that some of the designs do look a bit cheesy.Sound:Our main protagonists are voiced by the impeccable Paku Romi, in one of her rare roles as a female character instead of a young man, and the talented Koshimizu Ami, who also played Kallen in Code Geass and Claes in Gunslinger Girl. They also got some really talented people in secondary roles like Namikawa Daisuke, Toyoguchi Megumi and Saito Chiwa. The music used throughout the series is really strong.Ho-yay:There is certainly some les-yay in this series between our two main characters. Which is odd given that they've swapped bodies. Although, to be fair, the scenes that show chemistry between Alita and Falis focus on the emotional connection between them and how they're drawn to one another on an emotional level rather than a physical one. Which does help their relationship not seem narcissistic. And the dynamic between them is quite adorable. The ho-yay factor is going to be a 7/10.Final Thoughts:There are a lot of things to recommend Murder Princess. The narrative is compelling with a lot of unique facets. The main characters are really well written. The art and acting are both superb. It is held back somewhat by weak antagonists and some issues with the story telling, but it is a good watch if you're looking for a good action adventure series. My final rating is going to be an 8/10. Next week, Chokotan. take things over for reasons that are a spoiler and I shan't get into. During the coup, the king sends his daughter, the Princess Alita, out through a hidden passage to safety. She and her escort are attacked by monsters in the forest and she barely manages to escape and meet the bounty hunter, Falis. The two fall from a cliff which causes their souls to swap bodies because... magic. Alita entreats Falis to save her kingdom, offering herself as collateral. Admiring her determination, Falis agrees, not completely realising what she's getting herself into.On the positive side, the narrative is compelling. It keeps several mysteries throughout the main story that keep your interest and the eventual payoff for them is pretty good. This is also one of those rare series that manages to combine sci-fi and fantasy elements in a sensical way that adds to the world instead of having the world suffer from the clash between the two as is often the case when you combine advanced technology and magic. The pacing is very close to perfect with the plot moving very smoothly and steadily. It's never rushed or slowed to a crawl. The ending is great with some real emotional substance.Now, to the problems with the series. The main problem is with the body switch. There are some good story reasons for it, but they don't do much with it. Falis has no trouble adjusting to fighting in Alita's body, which is apparently as well trained as her body was contrary to all logic. Neither one has much trouble adjusting to their new role either. Alita easily falls into a subservient role for the “princess” and Falis only has minor troubles adjusting to aristocratic comportment. It also bothers me that everyone consistently refers to Falis, in Alita's body, as “princess” when she does act as the queen for a time. It's, admittedly, a minor issue but it's annoying to me when a work of media calls the land's ruler “princess” when she's doing the duties of a queen and it happens all the time. Whether it's the Mushroom Kingdom, Mobius, Equestria or the Moon Kingdom.Characters:The primary characters in this, Alita and Falis, are really well developed and fleshed out characters. They also get some great interactions both with each other and with the secondary characters. The supporting characters vary a lot more. Dominikov and Pete are pretty good characters, Dominikov especially. But a lot of the other secondary characters are not very interesting. The antagonists have incredibly flimsy motivations. Then we have the characters who are there more to serve a function than to actually act as characters; Jodo, Ana and Yuna being prime examples.Art:The art is pretty spectacular. The character designs are all pretty creative and interesting. The action sequences flow well, in spite of the occasional motion lines scene, and have a very dynamic feel to them. The details are very nicely done in terms of backgrounds, background objects and the like. I also like that the series is pretty subdued about showing violence. It shows what it needs to, but keeps the more graphic parts off-screen. The only criticism I really have for the art is that some of the designs do look a bit cheesy.Sound:Our main protagonists are voiced by the impeccable Paku Romi, in one of her rare roles as a female character instead of a young man, and the talented Koshimizu Ami, who also played Kallen in Code Geass and Claes in Gunslinger Girl.

That said, Murder Princess is an extremely fun OVA that went directly from a boredom viewing to being one of the most fun series I\'ve seen since Black Lagoon.Story; 9. Body transfer isn\'t entirely new to the anime world, but you definitely see it a lot less than you do ninja clans or warring robot factions. The balance of action and story is perfect, with much more action to start and substance to follow. The plot itself also carried a decently cool twist, however it was...admittedly on the slightly cheesy side. But aside of this one fact, the story flowed just seamlessly for what this was, and kept me genuinely interested from start to finish. And speaking of finish, the ending for this is PERFECT. I was a bit worried, but they wound up wrapping it up exactly like I hoped they would, I can\'t stress enough how great the ending was.Art; 9. While there is no particularly new or breathtaking artistry, Murder Princess had clean and fluid animation not only most of the time, but all of the time. I cannot recall one hideously drawn scene, which is delightful, because even the best series seem to have at least one hastily frame that sticks out in memory. The colors were vibrant, and character models were a lot of fun. Quality art, even if nothing new, is always helpful.Sound; 9. If you were asked to soundtrack a show who\'s general premise was a bloodthirsty princess, what would you pick? Well, heavy metal of course. The opening (while vocally agitating) is supercharged, as are the battle themes. The slashing guitars went perfectly with the flawless fight animations, giving this show a great kick.Character; 9. Falis is the coolest damn princess ever. Gone is the stereotypical Zelda who requires rescue upon rescue from a strong male lead. A powerful, angry female isn\'t necessarily the newest idea ever, but an aggressive and hot tempered princess definitely is. Alita was very kind, and her relationship with Falis developed stunningly well in a mere six episodes. Dominikov and Pete had some pretty sick character models, and Dominikov specifically was just a very ""cool"" character in general. The character models didn\'t all look like they all belonged in the same show, but it somehow just worked; it gave the princess tale an edge besides the murder part, which only served to make it even more awesome an entry to the sea of endless fairytale princesses.Enjoyment/Overall; 9. This is a must for fantasy fans, a must for action fans, and a must for anyone else who loves aggresive female leads. There is enough action here to sate the swords of even the most hardcore action fanatics, yet also enough substance to keep those looking for more than guts and glory a reason to stick around. Quality art, quality characters, and quality storytelling; I think the final word on Murder Princess should just be quality, because that is what this OVA is.

Fun, quality anime.', ""For a 6 series OVA I didn't expect much from this series really gave me an enjoyable surprise!Story - 7/10.Although the premise of the story is not a new one (Body swap + fighting to protect something) Murder Princess managed to keep its head above water for the entire duration. It didn't lose track of the direction it was taking or what it wanted to portray to the viewer. I, as is my preference, enjoyed that it wasn't fanservice-centric. In fact, there was little to none. Although not a massively original story, the delivery is excellent, and I didn't find myself getting bored of it...at any point. The plot twists and small mysteries add a lot to the series too, though the actual plot is simple it has little nuances which make it deeper.Art - 8/10.Fights and action scenes are well animated and nice to look at - I found the art style slightly dated (in some of the characters' expressions especially) but that did not detract from my overall experience. Character designs were pretty standard for the most part - the blonde, long-haired, beautiful princess and the dark, short-haired bounty hunter were the two main characters, pretty stereotypical designs there. However the side characters had some pretty unique designs (Pete and Dominikov). The only designs I didn't really like were the loli androids, but at the same time their design was sort of fitting for them.Sound - 8/10.The OP to this OVA got you straight in the mood for some epic action. I didn't really notice much background sound as I was so focused on what was actually happening, though I didn't notice anything wrong with it when it was used. The characters' voices are fitting too - the sheltered young princess and the more rough-and-ready bounty huntress were portrayed well.Character - 7/10.Character suffered slightly due to the length of the anime, a mere 6 episodes, however despite this the development of the relationship between hime-sama and the bounty hunter is done pretty well - to start off with, the bounty hunter dislikes and resents the princess for the body swap, and throughout the series this develops into deeply caring about the princess (verging on falling for her, or at least that is how it is depicted). Their characters are, generally, pretty stereotypical for their roles, though.The prince is also worth a mention, though he rarely appears - he is still quite mysterious, even after the anime finishes - we learn of his motives, but he obviously still loves his sister.Enjoyment - 8/10.Clearly I enjoyed this anime highly - it is pretty gripping for being only 6 episodes long, and it deals with the issues it presents to the viewer well. I was disappointed that it ended so soon and I would have been intrigued to see more of a developed plot with the characters and relationships presented to us.So all-in-all a very worthwhile anime to watch, exciting fights, a beautiful murderous princess and a plot that is deeper than it looks at face value. at any point.

Murder Princess is fairly generic and fairly predictable yes.  Why am I raving about it?  Because it's just a boat load of fun.   This truly works very well as a short OAV series as opposed to a longer TV series as you don't feel overwhelmed nor do you have to waste time with pointless fluff and nonsense found in some other action series.  Basically Murder Princess...could be likened to a two-hour-Hollywood summer film that you go buy pocorn and just kick back and enjoy.  And you will enjoy it.The non-stop bloody action makes this Bee Trains most enthralling and adrenalin pushing yet also with out a doubt a well budgeted one with Marvelous Entertainment producing.   The adaption from the manga is spot on (though there are a few things I wish they had done)   and the music while a bit atypical metal fits so well for this.  Even in the rash bash head baning metal you feel a lot of heart in the musical score and it only enhances the film further.  Though despite the hectic pace of the plot it's still very easy to continue following the story.   Compared to Bee Train insanely sporadic adaptation of Blade of the Immortal, Murder retains the charm of an intelligible but easy to understand plot but throwing you on a roller coaster compared to the slower moving series like my personal favs .hack//SIGN, and  MADLAX.    And it still takes a little time out for the audience to catch their breath.The animation being the best yet I've seen, beautiful designs, great effects pointless bloody mesh maybe yet not laid on as thick as Blade's violence or a senin violence would normally be.  Granted this is probably aimed at Teens more so than Adults like with Blade or others in that genre.   A very nice color pallet but seemed heavy  rather than the lovely color pallet by Studio Road in Tsubasa Chronicle and .hack//SIGN.  Or maybe it's just my imagination, but regardless the beautiful color pallet takes you into the fantasy world of Foreland along with the overall art direction and composition.Acting for the dub was unique and amazing from a FUNi all star cast including Monica Rial and Caitlin Glass alternating between umm...well themselves?  Well anyway the dub made a clever move by retaining internal thought with the character's personality.  Okay I'm sure that made no sense, well the commentary makes so much sense so watch that if I lost you.Not much I can say about the Japanese as I haven't seen it in Japanese though with talents like Romi Paku I'm sure it's brilliant.If you ask me Murder Princess is a hidden gem.  Not just a hidden gem among Bee Train's arsenal of shows but among many action anime out there.  It's a fun two-hour OAV adventure with non-stop action and is great to kick back with a bowl of popcorn or bag of chips or whatever your snack of choice be, and just enjoy. could be likened to a two-hour-Hollywood summer film that you go buy pocorn and just kick back and enjoy.

The anime really isn't much different from others of its type, and it really doesn't try to deviate from its main goal which is delivering an over the top action romp. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is solely up to the viewer. Fortunately though, it does pretty well in the action department and fans searching only for that will more than likely be satisfied.Murder Princess is produced by Bee...Train whose other works consist of Noir and Madlax, so despite being an OVA, I can imagine an anime fan familiar with the company coming into this expecting some nice visuals, and they won't be disappointed either because the anime does look nice. The artwork can be very good with some nice character designs at times. Falis has a cool, yet sinister look when her white dress is drenched in blood during battle, along with her fiery red eyes and long blonde hair. One of the main antagonist, which happens to be a man wearing jet black armor has a nice appeal to him as well. Some of the monsters on the other hand are lacking some variety, and I do feel that the choice of two cute, chibi characters kind of hurts the look of the show, no matter how dangerous they can be. In any case, these gripes aren't very big since the anime never takes itself seriously.There are also some stunning backgrounds, blanketed with beautiful shades of blue during the night time, and the use of lighting during these segments brings out the best in the scenes. Now for the action scenes, despite the occasional sword swipes and static backgrounds; the action has moments of coolness with decent choreography here and there along with some bloody moments, plus there are some good sword exchanges. Murder Princess also boasts a pretty good soundtrack, it's nothing I would consider to be ground breaking, but the guitar riffs complements the style of the anime. Even though it kind of feels silly with the fantasy setting made up of knights, peasants, and maids.Although it's very linear, and eveyrthing in regards to the plot can be seen light years away. The plot is fairly good with some nice pacing and there are traces of character development. Falis and Alita are likable characters who break their molds at some point and I feel their relationship was well developed. The rest of the cast are fairly decent and fill their roles for the most part. At first, the sci-fi elements which mainly involves androids, cyborgs, and advanced technology will feel pretty awkward in this setting. I recommend being patient to those who may feel this is just way too out of place, because this story element is all tied up by the end.Besides predictability, there are several things that take place in the plot that really needed some explaining. At least one plot device concerning Falis really needed some background, because it feels way too tacked on, and this will prove to be an issue for those who prefer air tight stories. The mystery concerning this change in behaviour just doesn't work at all, especially since it plays too heavy of a role in certain scenes. In addition to this, the explanation involving the initial story is silly at best.In closing, Murder Princess is a decent action romp that ties up quite a bit. Those who are heavily sold on the main characters will probably be hoping for a sequel. Personally, I had a bit of fun with the title, and it's nice to binge on those simple shonen anime once in awhile. Recommended only to those whom are not looking for high art.Highs: Cool action scenes and visualsLows: A few plot issues here and there Train whose other works consist of Noir and Madlax, so despite being an OVA, I can imagine an anime fan familiar with the company coming into this expecting some nice visuals, and they won't be disappointed either because the anime does look nice.

It’s somewhat funny seeing a sweet and loveable princess is turned into a warrior maniac though. The true princess is actually rather strong in some aspects, as she had to see her father and her best friend die. Throughout the show, I had a great feeling of Yuri coming from the relationship of Alita and Falis. It’s really a strong feeling because Alita’s always looks up to Falis a lot for her strength and power. Though one big question I have is that how can Falis...have enough strength and agility within Alita’s body. Alita’s body isn’t made for fighting but it was able to not get a broken bone in her body when smashed into the wall.I do have a little problem with the ‘kawaii’ little characters being the bad guy robots. Dr. Akamashi must have had some sort of fetish for little girls because I have no idea what other reason he would do that to them. It doesn’t help that his head looks like an onion but he seems to have the brains of one for a moment. And not to mention that one girl is the cute innocent personality and the other is a rather dark and mean spirited personality.There is a strange base to the time period in time where rockets are old technology. It’s strange because most of this is set within a more medieval period with the addition to magic. To have technology over all makes things a bit odd. I’m a fan of some of these shows but not when the technology is so far advanced that it feels out of wack. They do give us a strange reason for it, but I still don’t get why we need the kawaii kids though.Animation is nicely done though it seems that some of Pete Armstrong, the purple person, his scar seems to move around a bit around his mouth. The demons seem a bit interesting in their design but I seriously think that they don’t ALL need horns. Almost every demon I saw had horns of some kind on there body. I’m not really bothered by the fact that Dominikov doesn’t really move his mouth when he talks, because he doesn’t seem to hinder the anime in any way.Oh my god the English voices! The little robot girl’s voices sound like they had been smoking a million packs a day! For crying out loud, why does there voice have to be so gravel-ly? Some others are a little high pitched but overall it seems alright. I don’t think we really need the stupid narrator though. It tries to make it more epic then it actually is.In the end, I guess it was pretty good and I have to say I give it props for a anime that you will not guess how it ends.

Seriously, you would probably not be able to guess.', 'I got a feeling with anime that involves princesses, the people behind the shows and/or movies want to use their princess characters for more than just to look pretty, useless, or a damsel in distress….then again that might happen only once or twice around in anime as far as I know. However, this one I’m reviewing today is not like most princess stories or anything involving the word, “Princess”.In the land of Foreland a coup d’état has occurred and the princess, after witnessing the death of the King, is on the run. She meets with battle-hungry bounty hunter Falis, and with a twist of fate...they both switch souls, making Alita the maid of the now princess Falis. Named for her bravery in confronting the enemy as ‘Murder Princess’, Falis must continue to be the princess as well as confronting any new opponent that comes to her way.To me, this is what happens when you mix in “The Prince and the Pauper”, only you would replace prince with princess and it has the look and feel of an low-budget action flick plus the basic style of any Bee Train produced (or inspired) girls-with-guns/assassins show (i.e., foreign land or settings, two main female leads, mild yuri undertones) and yet this is the show that would appeal to me and I ended up liking it and the OAV coming in total at 150 minutes does manage to not waste any time with unnecessary backstories or characters that you wouldn’t bother to remember or give a shit about.For characters, I felt like it had some decent likable characters thrown into the mix but along with some minor annoyances. The relationship between Falis/Alita & Alita/Milano was decently developed with how the one looks up to the other for protection, although if they switch bodies, did they switch brains or abilities and also some things you ought to expect when you trade places with a princess and a maid. Then you have the sidekick characters of Dominikov & Pete Armstrong, who worked with Falis and they were OK, basic sidekick characters to one of the main characters and then there is Ana & Yuna, robotic bodyguards to Dr. Akamashi and they are the “moe” characters with weapons and they really nerve no purpose aside from being all “kawaii” and crazy, in other words, I guess the doctor must like little girls…..and now it’s pretty damn creepy.BEE TRAIN!!!! Yeah, after I mentioned them many times in this review, yes, they did the animation for this and it was good. It was a bit more like El Cazador de la Bruja and a bit of Noir but thankfully less like .hack//sign & Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom as there was plenty of action animation to not be missed but it doesn’t overshadow most of the plot. Musically, it almost felt a misplaced with the opening theme as well as I enjoyed it a bit, it really doesn’t fit within some of the tone of the series, although the ending was nicely done.And last but not least, The FUNimation dub was an enjoyable dub to say the least with great performances by the two leads Colleen Clinkenbeard (she’s the one who voiced Yoko in XXXHolic) and Monica Rial although for a negative, as much as I don’t mind Carrie Savage’s voice and her as a voice actress, hers was specifically annoying voicing the two androids. For the rest of the cast, they handled their roles very competently and the dub overall was adapted well from the original Japanese version.FINAL VERDICT: Out of all the Bee Train shows that I have watch so far that they made, this is definitely one OAV that actually deliver what they got in a short amount of time and it’s also something that really appeals to me and my taste in anime and yes, this is an anime that has a taste that appeals to me. In other words, if you like this kind of anime, get it and watch it. they both switch souls, making Alita the maid of the now princess Falis. Named for her bravery in confronting the enemy as ‘Murder Princess’, Falis must continue to be the princess as well as confronting any new opponent that comes to her way.To me, this is what happens when you mix in “The Prince and the Pauper”, only you would replace prince with princess and it has the look and feel of an low-budget action flick plus the basic style of any Bee Train produced (or inspired) girls-with-guns/assassins show (i.e., foreign land or settings, two main female leads, mild yuri undertones) and yet this is the show that would appeal to me and I ended up liking it and the OAV coming in total at 150 minutes does manage to not waste any time with unnecessary backstories or characters that you wouldn’t bother to remember or give a shit about.For characters, I felt like it had some decent likable characters thrown into the mix but along with some minor annoyances.

You would get Murder Princess!Story - 5/10The story starts off with a coup d'etat against the royal family of Forland, and in the process, the king is killed.  During the chaos, however, he has his only daughter (he has a son who is away), Princess Alita Forland, escape.  During Alita's escape, she runs into a bounty hunter named Falis.  A series of events causes them to switch bodies.  Alita, now in the body of Falis, begs Falis to save the kingdom.  At first,...Falis (who is in the body of Alita) refuses, but after Alita offers to be her servant and let Falis take the throne, she changes her mind.  They then storm the palace and take back the throne.The story isn't exactly a stand-out one - it's not terrible, but it's not great, either.  Besides, when you're watching something like Murder Princess, you're not watching it for a deep and complex story - you're watching it for balls-to-the-wall action.Art - 7/10The animation was done by Bee Train, whose other notable works include Noir, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, and .hack//Sign (I cannot comment on those works, since as of writing this review, I have not seen them), and it's actually rather visually pleasing - it's not the best animation I've seen, but it is good for what it is.  It's also rather colorful - in fact, watching this has actually made me want to watch other Bee Train works.Sound - 8/10This is a case where it's just easier to hear it for yourself instead of to have someone describe it for you.  The OST fits the mood perfectly, and it's one of those things where I can't really think of the OST without thinking of the scenes that accompanied a track.  The dub is also very good, with Colleen Clinkenbeard (Rin Asogi, Monkey D. Luffy, Nice Holystone, Ran Mouri) playing Falis, and Monica Rial (Haruka Shitow, Shiro, Chane Laforet, Stocking Anarchy) playing Alita.Character - 7/10While Falis and Alita are somewhat typical for their roles (Falis is a basic hot-blooded bounty hunter, and Alita's personality is similar to Princess Peach), they do manage to come across as likable - they aren't played to complete stereotypes, and we do get to see their characters get fleshed out a bit.  Plus, Alita undergoes a lot more character development then you would imagine.Enjoyment - 10/10I love action anime.  I was not disappointed after I finished this show.  I wouldn't exactly call this a guilty pleasure.  This is one that I would say that you should watch at some point (the next time you feel in the mood for a short action-heavy show, consider watching this).Overall - 9/10This is easily one of my favorite OVAs, and I'll definitely be rewatching this in the future.RIYL: Black Lagoon, Scrapped Princess, Needless Falis (who is in the body of Alita) refuses, but after Alita offers to be her servant and let Falis take the throne, she changes her mind.

So you would think that I would been ignorant to its shortcomings and enjoyed it. Wrong. Even as a rookie anime viewer, this anime left me beyond pissed and haunted me for a good month. Why was I pissed? Short story: Murder Princess gives you false hope and then crushes it.Story: 3With only 6 episodes, it is a rather short story. Therefore, I can cut it a little slack. But since it is still a story, Murder Princess needed to have been a comprehensive and complete unit - much like a movie or...a fairy tail. I\'ll elaborate on that later. Concept wise, there is nothing original. This is not necessarily a bad thing as long as those concepts are either dealt with differently or executed in an effective storytelling manner. What got me interested in Murder Princess to begin with was the body-switching and a royal trying to defend his/her homeland tropes. These two tropes complemented each other, especially with the contrasting personalities of the two main characters, and were the best part of the show. You wanted to see the characters overcome these obstacles. Now here lies Murder Princess\'s greatest sin - most of the obstacles are not resolved by the ""ending."" The ""ending"" feels more like the end of a story arc than an ending to an independent story. Sadly, even the manga ends there so this cheating the audience was intentional. Other than the gaping ending, other problems with the story include: sloppily introduced and uninteresting sci-fi elements, painfully predictable plot points, weak ideas, and plot holes.Art: 5It was nice enough, but average. It didn\'t hamper or boost the anime.Sound: 7The OP is excellent. The rock style, heavier guitars, and fluid rapping supporting vocals created a great effect. The ED is also pleasant. As for the OST and voice acting, neither stands out to me as excellent of bad.Character: 6Overall the characters are stereotypical and bland. Most of the supporting characters could have been cut from the story all together and it wouldn\'t have impacted the story at all. You have your evil with scant motives villain, the brainwashed sidekick, the gruff warriors, etc. I did like the relationship between the bounty hunter and princess though. Although the princess was rather plain and devoid of a strong personality, she contrasted with the bounty hunter\'s stronger personality to make their interactions at least interesting to watch. The bounty hunter was the best character in the story because of her stubborn, driven, and yet secretly sympathetic demeanor. Watching her have to live a princess life and then proceed to trample all over its customs was rather entertaining.Enjoyment: 2Despite my fondness for the main characters and certain tropes, the clumsy and unnecessary story elements and bland supporting characters inhibited my enjoyment of Murder Princess. However, these things would have just made me rank it as average. The nail in the coffin for Murder Princess is its lazy and empty ending.

Just an entertaining 6 ep OAV run of what would happen in such a scenario, complete with a medieaval-esque world overshadowed by ""old technology.""Not much to say. Princess Alita\'s brother wants to control superweapon of the forgotten old technology, enlists hot sorceress chick, there\'s an evil doctor...and some moe girls. So Alita swaps bodies with Pharis, a bounty hunter with two cyborg/demon pals, and Pharis deals with all of these things in a typically brutish way--characters aren\'t what/who they seem tho in the usual predictable plot twists.Simple anime. Simple outcome. It\'s fun, as advertised so therefore nothing to dislike about it.Alita is cute and Pharis is typically tomboyish. Not really rocket science.More like Aperture science. and some moe girls.

We join in to witness a Coup d\'Etat and the death of Forland\'s dear King. In other words, the kingdom is violently taken over by an insider, Dr. Akamashi, one of the kingdom\'s scientists. Because of this the kingdoms\' princess, Alita Forland, is sent out to search for the heir - prince Kaito. During princess Alita\'s escape into the forest she is attacked by the forest guardian. As she is running for her life she runs into...a beautiful and skilled bounty hunter named Falis. Through a shared near death experience the two young women switch souls. Falis is now the humble princess while Alita becomes her chambermaid, Mirano Entolasia. Mirano pleads with Alita to protect the kingdom at all costs which binds the women together through this very short series. Alita, unable to restrain her thirst for battle gains the title ""Murder Princess"" due to her bravery.The story does not have a strong plot which causes the characters to be believable up to a certain point. Due to the shortness of the series we unfortunately are unable to get a real close look at the characters. This aggravated me a bit during the climax of the series.A lot of time you see shows where it looks as if the character design and execution were rushed. This is not the case with Murder Princess. Yoshimitsu Yamashita and team do an awesome job with the character design. Falis\'s two henchemen Pete Armstrong and Dominikov are nicely put together. My two favorite characters, as far as character design, were the androids Ana and Yuna. They were cute without overdoing it. The series does not blind you with an overuse of color. The colors and animation flow wonderfully throughout the series and helps push the storyline along somewhat. The design teams style of animation does a wonderful job adding to the realness value of the series. It\'s done in a way that does not draw away from the characters. But actually draws you, the viewer, to them.The voice acting was right on target. I was not forced to listen to high-pitched female voices! One of my favorite actresses, Romi Paku does an excellent job as Falis/Alita while Ami Koshimizu is spot on as Alita/Mirano. Although the timing seemed a bit off at times; overall the quality was good. I also found some of the side characters hard to understand at times. But this may be due to my habit of drowning out idle chatter. The music used during the climatic scenes are a pretty good fit. Not too annoying - just enough so you know something is about to go down.Back-On provide us with a very catchy opening song, Hikari Sasuhuo; The Lights Shinin\' My Rhyme So Tight. Even though I am not a huge fan of rap mixed with pop this song grew on me. Romi Paku also lends her voice to the closing song titled Naked Flower. Her voice is beautiful and soothing.If you are looking for an in-depth story then pass this one over. The show is only six episodes long and is very cut and dry. This is the situation and this is how it gets taken care of. I felt that more could have been done with the storyline. There were times during the series when I found myself asking about backgrounds of the different characters. For me it was a great way to pass the time away while on a short vacation from school.

I'll start with the story. To be honest it has been a while since I watched this series but from what I remember the story was good, it really was. I'm not sure why but I felt like there should've been more to the story at parts. For the most part the story was complete with some holes. The art style to which the anime is made in is my favorite so that gets high points for that. Perhaps people may not like it but I very much enjoy the style it is made in. The...sound is good, nothing really to it. Now the characters, the characters are great. The main protagonists are Alita Forland (later Milano), Falis (Later Alita), Dominikov, and Pete Armstrong. Alita assumes the name Milano later in the story for reasons you will learn about, she isn't the main character but she is close to that role. She is dedicated and I love that. Falis is strong and fierce. Falis, Dominikov, and Pete are all a team that Alita joins in for a mission Falis is reluctant to do but in the end does. Dominikov has earned his way into my heart which might be because he is similar to me. I hope there is another series (with some unfortunate character changes of course) but the entire anime would've gotten a 10 but there were a few flaws like the feeling of things being incomplete and the end leaving the viewer wanting more and wanting an actual resolve which I do not believe there was a true ending. I recommend it, I really do. I found enjoyment from it and I hope you will as well. sound is good, nothing really to it. Now the characters, the characters are great.

When the kingdom of Forland is attacked, the young Princess Alita Forland is forced to flee for her life. During her escape, she encounters the infamous bounty hunter Falis. A magical mishap leads to the two women switching bodies. With no other choice, Falis, now in the body of the princess, agrees to protect the kingdom while Alita, in Falis\'s body, takes on the role of her loyal guardian. This setup creates a dynamic and unique narrative where both characters must adapt to their new roles and work together to save the kingdom from...various threats.Characters:Falis (in Alita’s body): As the main protagonist, Falis is a fierce and skilled warrior. Her transition into the princess\'s body brings an interesting dynamic to the royal court. She’s tough, pragmatic, and unyielding, bringing a breath of fresh air to the often docile and refined royal image.Alita (in Falis’s body): Alita is gentle and kind-hearted, initially overwhelmed by her new situation. However, her determination to protect her kingdom and her growing bond with Falis make her a compelling character.Dominikov and Pete: Falis\'s loyal companions add depth to the story with their unique abilities and unwavering support.Animation and Art:The animation quality of ""Murder Princess"" is solid for its time. The action scenes are fluid and engaging, showcasing the intense battles and the protagonists\' martial prowess. The character designs are distinct and memorable, fitting well within the fantasy genre. The backgrounds and settings are beautifully rendered, bringing the kingdom of Forland to life with rich detail.Music and Sound:The soundtrack complements the anime\'s tone perfectly, with dramatic and epic scores that enhance the action scenes and emotional moments. The opening theme, ""Hikari Sasuhou (shijunban)"" by Back-On, is particularly noteworthy for its energetic and catchy tune.Themes and Execution:""Murder Princess"" explores themes of identity, duty, and sacrifice. The body swap premise is handled with surprising depth, allowing for character growth and introspection. The bond between Falis and Alita is the heart of the series, and their evolving relationship is both touching and believable. Despite its short length, the anime manages to deliver a complete and satisfying story, though some viewers might wish for more episodes to further explore its world and characters.Conclusion:""Murder Princess"" is an underrated gem that offers a refreshing take on the fantasy and action genres. Its strong characters, intriguing premise, and well-executed action sequences make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. While its brevity might leave some wanting more, the series succeeds in delivering a thrilling and heartfelt adventure that stands out among its peers. various threats.Characters:Falis (in Alita’s body): As the main protagonist, Falis is a fierce and skilled warrior.

It's to be good practice for the animators. And this stuff is consequently nothing to write home about. The characters are mostly one-note aside from being subtle (as a truck) lesbians, but they can't actually get together because this was the 00s.Nonetheless, I can't say it's a BAD show, necessarily. It's perfectly adequate in being so subpar. I picked it out because it was dubbed and I wanted something for background noise. The story hit the most basic notes that it needed to hit. I've seen worse. "", 'Murder Princess follows the story of protagonist Princess Alita when, after her family is killed in a coup, she accidentally swaps bodies with aggressive bounty hunter  Falis. With Falis now in the Princess’s body, the pair set out to regain the Princess’s Kingdom. Murder Princess follows both Falis and Alita as protagonists. Falis, either in her own body or in the Princess’s, in fact, particularly in the Princess’s body, is a unique and entertaining protagonist. Her uniquely violent and uncouth manner is quite entertaining and a welcome break from more the more pacifistic princess’s usually found in fantasy stories. Despite her violence Falis remains...sympathetic enough that she never becomes unlikeable or come across as mean spirited. Her co-protagonist, the aforementioned Alita (who renames herself Milano over the course of the story) is basically a generic pacifistic princess, the very kind I referred to earlier. Outside of the usual all-loving princess stereotypes she has almost no personality. Her one single saving grace is that the contrast between her and Falis works rather well.As a result of Falis, Murder Princess is a rather fun and entertaining however the other characters are a tad one-note and the same can be said for the story. Whilst fun in its own way, its rather fast paced. For example, in the first episode, Princess Alita’s father and household guards are killed by a taciturn doctor ad his murderous mecha-loli minions, Alita goes into exile in a forest but encounters Falis and, after then encountering a monster, manages to yeet both herself and Falis of the side of a cliff during which the two swap bodies. After this, the two, now in each bodies then agree to help retake Falis’s kingdom from the Doctor and his murder-loli’s- which they do before the end credits. All this takes place in a 24 minutes. Needless to say, Murder Princess is comparatively fast paced, although to be fair this is likely due to the series rather small 6 episode long runtime. In general, the story really could have benefited from being strung out a bit and having at least 12 episodes.Overall, Murder Princess is a rather fun short anime series with a great protagonist (Falis) but a rather generic cast of supporting characters and a fast paced story that could have benefited form being a bit longer. sympathetic enough that she never becomes unlikeable or come across as mean spirited.

With only six episodes to adapt a similarly short manga that was forced to a rushed conclusion because of the publication it ran in, I knew to not expect everything to be fully fleshed out but I\'m still disappointed with how little substance there really is.If you took the story beats and characters on paper, in a vacuum, this story is fine, with great potential to be enjoyable.  Not much in the way of complexity or novelty, but still a solid framework for a fun romp through...a fantasy setting.  Now just develop this over the 120 minutes or so that you have and it should work.  Sadly, this happens so little in Murder Princess, telling only the minimum needed to get from A to B to C and so on.  Characters have almost no depth to them at all, only a handful of traits, simple and shallow motivations (if they even get them at all,) very little interaction between characters outside of propelling the plot, and surprisingly little in the way of levity.  You very well could count on your hands (maybe, maaaaybe your toes) how many intentional jokes or moments intended to be humorous there are over the entire run time of the series.  The plot is bare bones and especially in the last two episodes sped up to the point that ass pulls and deus ex machinas are dropped on a by-the-minute basis.  Exposition dumps make up half the dialogue: tell, don\'t show is the reigning paradigm here.  Compounding these issues are numerous oversights in basically every department.  For example, characters addressing others by name when they haven\'t even been introduced to each other.  Sure, you could excuse it and say ""they got to know each other off screen,"" but having to constantly cope and do the heavy lifting for the show does not make for an enjoyable experience.All this is to say nothing of the poor ""animation.""  This is a very stiff show, lots of slideshows and panning, flashes and cuts.  Fights VERY often being one swing and it\'s over.  Sparse sets and little detail make this a very  un-stimulating visual experience, so it\'s going to be up to you to make yourself pay attention, and when the plot, characters, and all the little things that fill in the gaps are in large part MIA, it\'s very likely to be a chore.Ultimately, my time watching this was mostly spent trying to excuse things on its behalf and the other part lamenting how much better it could\'ve been with only more competent, passionate hands.  It may seem easy to excuse a 6 episode OVA for not accomplishing a lot in its run time but 120 minutes is actually quite a lot to work with to tell an engaging story.  Even ignoring the entirety of filmdom, there are even SHORTER OVA series that still manage to make what they\'re given to work with into a compelling, enjoyable experience that far outlives its runtime in the hearts and minds of those who view it, and this is not one of them.PS (Actual postscript, lol): I went and read the manga to see if any of that potential was realized better.  There two are almost entirely different plotwise, save for several key points.  I\'d actually say the plot in the anime is more complete but the characters in the manga feel marginally more developed, or at least a couple of them, and it\'s more humorous.  The fact that you can breeze through the manga in an hour or two makes it feel much less like a chore to get through, but ultimately both are unsatisfying with how little anything gets fleshed out. a fantasy setting.

It is a nice extra but nothing special.The anime on the other hand is amazing, the story is a nice and short one. The Characters are a big fun, especially the main character. We see monsters, magic and knights fighting. There is...a lot of blood witch is a nice extra if your watching the fights. And we see cute robot children who are fun to watch. The anime also has a lot of humor in it, witch is a great plus. After seeing the main character beat the shit out of monsters the size of 3 buildings, she finds herself having trouble being a princess in public. Witch is a nice contrast.Personally I really liked this anime, I love the Europe Medieval style. We don't see that in many anime. So it's nice to see a anime with knights castles and princesses. The only complaint I have is that the anime is only 6 episodes. I mean the story is not that special and it is truly over after 6 episodes. But I fell in love with the main character of the anime. A brutal girl who is extremely talented with the sword who doesn't care for money or wealth she just likes the thrill of bounty hunting. A girl witch looks amazing and fierce she is everything, and she also has a soft side so she doesn't seem totally inhuman.Verdict:The anime is short and not that special, but the anime provides us with enough fun the entire 6 episodes. It has a nice (not to special story) but again fun to watch. We see the medieval Europe style so if your a fan of that than this is anime is a must see. The battles are amazing and the humor is fun two. The ending is nice and also a bit sad so that's a nice twist to the feel good genre of the anime. Overall it's nice to sit a afternoon watching the 6 episodes and to just lay back and enjoy the show.Cheers Lucid a lot of blood witch is a nice extra if your watching the fights.

Go watch it now. The hardest decision is to binge-watch it all at once or save it for several viewings. It\'s six 25min Sword Lesbian episodes. No comphet distractions. A few fanservice-y moments (episode 2), but they work for wlw-watchers and not just for boys. As with most wlw-leaning pieces, it could be stronger and more explicit (i.e., dykier), but it\'s impressive for a 2005 piece and holds up 15+ years later.As much as I love this, I find it hard to write a 500-character review of. It\'s cool, medieval steampunk-y, female-led, well-paced....Tropedia breaks down all the archetypes jammed into the short series, but it\'s larger than the sum of its parts. It broke my gay little heart out of joy. There\'s no ""oh too bad women can\'t be together"" shit like Canaan or From the New World.I plan on coming back to this OVA many times over many years.

I thought, ""Murder Princess is one of the most on the nose and cheesiest names for any anime I\'ve ever seen and it\'s only six episodes, so it can\'t be THAT bad. There should at least some entertainment value here."" This has to be some of the most boring and soulless 2 hours of my life. This anime was so boring that I couldn\'t even watch it all in one sitting which is really saying something for the minimal content present.The anime starts with a bounty hunter searching for her...mark while the Forlund Kingdom is undergoing a coup from the scholar, Dr. Onion (not his real name), and his two robot lolis. The princess who escaped before they arrived in the keep runs into the bounty hunter causing them to fall off a cliff together and somehow switch bodies?? Yeah, I have no idea either, but ok. Don\'t expect this to get explained well or rectified in any way. Milano (the name the princess in bounty hunter\'s body eventually goes with) makes Alita (bounty hunter in the princess\'s body claiming the princess\'s original name) promise to protect the kingdom seeing as Alita is much stronger than Milano could ever be. The remaining five episodes follow the two as they adapt to their new lives and thwart the plot which runs deeper than they originally thought. While unoriginal there was still potential for the plot to be interesting despite the anime\'s short length. However, nothing really happens. There\'s the coup plot sure, but we have basically no motivations for anybody involved. They\'re just doing things either because they\'re being forced to or are good/evil. The big episode four plot twist was stupid, made zero sense, wnd was never fully explained. In one episode Dr. Onion and lolis attended a ball ""undercover"" without any disguises. Who is just letting these terrorists in? To top it off the world building was stuffed into three minutes of episode five. It felt like we got the first and last three episodes of a show but are completely missing the middle 5-6.The characters are completely lifeless. I\'ve already said how nobody has any real motivations and how people are just doing things. There are no real personalities for anybody, they\'re all two dimensional. Milano is shy and cowardly but stands up for what she believes in only if it\'s in front of Alita. Alita is strong and kills people with a somewhat good moral compass. Pete and Franky (not his real name, just voiced by Franky from One Piece) are the friends of Alita when she was a bounty hunter and want to protect bother her and Milano. The lolis kill people and love their creator Dr. Onion. The main antagonists are evil just because. The only somewhat interesting character dynamic was between Milano and Alita who were a little gay for each other which is shown a few times without being explored deeper. I can confidently say I\'m not going to remember a single character name a week after writing this review.The animation was cheap. It looked acceptable but was clearly the bare minimum for what they needed to do. There\'s errors in layering from time to time. The battles were especially boring which is terrible for a show called ""Murder Princess."" It was slow with minimal choreography other than a few punches and slashes before its over. Very dissappinting.The music sounds like it was chosen from a library of action shows and movies from the 2000s. It was fine but sounded like every other action sequence you\'ve heard in your life. The opening was good but the ending was a snooze. The voice actors were clearly in it for the check with only the main female leads putting forth any effort. I love Kazuki Yao, but he was really phoning it in with this one and giving his vocal cords a rest.If you couldn\'t tell, I really didn\'t enjoy Murder Princess. I don\'t get why they needed a body swap plot line if they were never going to do anything with it. These types of plots only work when we have a sense for the characters and their dynamics. One Piece and Futurama have terrific body swap episodes and actually do something with the concept. Just make the show called ""Murder Princess"" about a Princess who goes to battle or something. You don\'t need to overcomplicate it with this much nothing. I believe the reason this is six episodes and not just a movie is because the studio wanted to spend as little money on this property as possible and try to turn a quick buck. If you really want to watch it, go ahead. It\'s not like I can stop you.

Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12175/Koi_to_Senkyo_to_Chocolate,"['At first, I was trying to find some mediocre romance comedy harem anime, which can give me tons of boobs and laugh for example, Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao or Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica to name a few. I mean it\'s Christmas now, and I am still single, watching anime at home. All by myself.......... I needed anime to comfort me. :(Anyway, I then came across this oddly under rated anime Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate :3Story:At first glance, the plot might be one of your normal, slice of life school anime. I first thought so too, but then...the 1st ep just cracks me up. I won\'t go into those spoiler details but I can say, I immediately got hooked by this anime. At that moment I knew that this is my destined one. I give HUGE credits to anime which can piqued my interest this much right in the first episode, only a few could do this to me. eg. Sakurasou.Anyway, this anime is based on a VN, and from the past few years anime adopted from VN hadn\'t been satisfying. I wouldn\'t say its bad, but a lot of them are rushed or just focused on the wrong heroine - for example: Angel Beats, I mean I love AB a lot, I cried watching its last few eps too, but overall it just felt a bit rushed. It left a lot of things unexplained i guess.However, I believe this is adaptation had done an excellent job.I think it had a pretty steady pace. At least, I didn\'t feel its rushed, like AB does. So, I think it did a great job here.Character:Well, here the good part. We have a very diverse and intriguing character casts here. They all have different personalities and motives and such that it didn\'t feel like they are cardboard cut out characters or at least most of them.I mean we have have 2 oppai girls ( Shinonome Satsuki, Shinonome, Hazuki)A super kawaii pentako (Michiru Morishita)A bit annoying tsundere, childhood friend girl (Sumiyoshi  Chisato)A kouhai full of feels (Aomi Isara)At last, but not least the ultimate, always cumming yaoi kouhai (Yumeshima Oboro) ""Senpai, I want your stick!""With these characters, I bet you\'re gonna have a lot of fun watching this anime. The reason why I love this anime is because of its diverse characters. The interaction between the characters intricately weaved out the whole story. Most of the characters have been explained properly, and have pretty well development. Moreover, it totally didn\'t feel as confusing as Angel Beats were (in the last few episodes :/ ) . Everything nice and good.Art:Well, I don\'t have much to say about Koichoco\'s art. The animation was fluent and clear, nothing super fancy extravagant like Fate Zero or Kara No Kyoukai, but I was satisfied with it. It\'s got a bright colour and overall gave a cheerful atmosphere. It kinda feel like Amagami SS i guess.....Sound:I am not much of a soundtrack guy, so I will keep it short.Sound is good. Voice-acting good too. OP & ED good good.Enjoyment+Overall:After watching Koichoco, it lifted my mood a lot and I really really enjoyed it, I don\'t know why it is so under-rated but I think it should rank higher and more people should be watching this.I recommend this to anyone who are looking for a good romance, comedy. And I promise, you\'re gonna laugh so much in the first ep (at least, I did)I think you guys to give this a shot, you might be surprised. :)I hope this review helped you and that you guys would like Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate :3 the 1st ep just cracks me up. I won\'t go into those spoiler details but I can say, I immediately got hooked by this anime. At that moment I knew that this is my destined one. I give HUGE credits to anime which can piqued my interest this much right in the first episode, only a few could do this to me. eg. Sakurasou.Anyway, this anime is based on a VN, and from the past few years anime adopted from VN hadn\'t been satisfying. I wouldn\'t say its bad, but a lot of them are rushed or just focused on the wrong heroine - for example: Angel Beats, I mean I love AB a lot, I cried watching its last few eps too, but overall it just felt a bit rushed. It left a lot of things unexplained i guess.However, I believe this is adaptation had done an excellent job.I think it had a pretty steady pace. At least, I didn\'t feel its rushed, like AB does. So, I think it did a great job here.Character:Well, here the good part. We have a very diverse and intriguing character casts here. They all have different personalities and motives and such that it didn\'t feel like they are cardboard cut out characters or at least most of them.I mean we have have 2 oppai girls ( Shinonome Satsuki, Shinonome, Hazuki)A super kawaii pentako (Michiru Morishita)A bit annoying tsundere, childhood friend girl (Sumiyoshi  Chisato)A kouhai full of feels (Aomi Isara)At last, but not least the ultimate, always cumming yaoi kouhai (Yumeshima Oboro) ""Senpai, I want your stick!""With these characters, I bet you\'re gonna have a lot of fun watching this anime. The reason why I love this anime is because of its diverse characters. The interaction between the characters intricately weaved out the whole story. Most of the characters have been explained properly, and have pretty well development. Moreover, it totally didn\'t feel as confusing as Angel Beats were (in the last few episodes :/ ) . Everything nice and good.Art:Well, I don\'t have much to say about Koichoco\'s art. The animation was fluent and clear, nothing super fancy extravagant like Fate Zero or Kara No Kyoukai, but I was satisfied with it. It\'s got a bright colour and overall gave a cheerful atmosphere. It kinda feel like Amagami SS i guess.....Sound:I am not much of a soundtrack guy, so I will keep it short.Sound is good. Voice-acting good too. OP & ED good good.Enjoyment+Overall:After watching Koichoco, it lifted my mood a lot and I really really enjoyed it, I don\'t know why it is so under-rated but I think it should rank higher and more people should be watching this.I recommend this to anyone who are looking for a good romance, comedy. And I promise, you\'re gonna laugh so much in the first ep (at least, I did)I think you guys to give this a shot, you might be surprised. :)I hope this review helped you and that you guys would like Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate :3', 'Hey, you ever been to a party and noticed that there is all the food you want in the world but somehow, some way it just doesn\'t satisfy you? That\'s sort of the same feeling I got when I finished watching this series. No, I don\'t mean it in a way that is unsatisfying. I mean it as the series missing something. Like the chocolate is missing an ingredient or the series itself is lacking something. However, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate does have some of its good flavors. So, let\'s break this down, shall we?Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate/Koichoco (also known as Love, Election,...and Chocolate) is an anime series produced by AIC Build (Haganai, Oremio) and directed by Tōru Kitahata. The anime is also based off an adult visual novel developed by Sprite. Now what a minute. Did I see the word “adult” in that statement? One might expect some ecchi or or specifically, “adult scenes” in this series, right? Well, not all the case because  in the anime world today, censorship and limitations holds this series at its limit.Judging by the title of the series, it can be quite easy to predict what the anime may be about especially the given three parts. First, we got the four letter forbidden word: love. From there, one can imply that the series will have romance. And you\'re right because Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate does have that especially between the main male and female protagonist in the series. The second part, election consists of what the drama takes place at the school in the series. Election is for leadership, to lead a student body, and more importantly to represent themselves. Finally, we have the chocolate. Beyond the sweets and flavor, the chocolate here seem to symbolize the sweetness of life. It is every moment of  life that the students at the academy enjoy with their friends and the memories they create to make their lives worthwhile.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate takes place at the setting of Takafuji Private Academy, a rather large school composed of over 6000 students. Within these group of students is the Food Research Club (Shokken) and here we are introduced the main protagonist, Yuki Ojima of the series. The club doesn\'t do much during their everyday boring lives till the shocking news of that their club will be abolished. Anyone hearing that sort of news definitely wouldn\'t be happy. Well, the FRC definitely has a few things to say about that. As such, Ojima takes the election of the title and runs for president.Now, Yuki Ojima seems to be the type of guy who is lazy and avoids doing work. It\'s bothersome for him and like some of us, tries to procrastinate and put things off as long as possible. His childhood friend, Chisato is there for him though and the two duo makes a strange couple of sorts in the series. The problem here is that these two seems to have a weak chemistry at first. They don\'t seem to connect and neither do their personalities match. It seems that Yuki is more compatible with some of the other characters, well almost anyone except that guy with the yaoi stick. I mean, that\'s just not right. But all jokes aside, Chisato and Yuki starts off the series in a bizarre way. With the election coming up, it\'s time to kill that laziness and say hello to some responsibility.Being part of a large school also means allies, friends, and rivals. Satsuki seems to serve as the sort of antithesis in the series who not only play as Yuki\'s main opponent in the election, but also sort of his outer image. She is like the vanilla flavor of a chocolate and becomes an obstacle of the FRC.The story itself have a lot of drama in them. From the very beginning, there is a head and run and later on follows a similar fashion. And of course, election is all about drama especially for those who can win the favors from the students at the academy. It is strange though that in this series, the drama depicted often shifts to different focuses. It intertwines drama between the characters or personal relationships occasionally but at other times, focuses on the topic of elections. Employing this style of story is risky but thankfully in this series, it works out somewhat well. Drama is never easy to employ and with an academy of over 6000 students, just imagine all the possibilities.The artwork of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is pretty generic to say the least. There is a lot of stereotypes here including Hazuki oniisama who is portrayed as an older woman with tits and the bossy attitude. The school setting itself is also normal despite its large size. The outer settings are those of at typical school in the modern ages and nothing special about that. In fact, the series doesn\'t take place at much elsewhere besides school. After all, school is where love, elections, and drama are born. On the characters\' design side, there seems to be some similarities between this series and Amagami SS; even the drama is there.As for the music, the series employs a rather soft melody of school like tunes. It employs both soft rhythm (during calm and comedic scenes) to more dramatic music during scenes that are more emotional. It does mixes in well though and some might even give some credit to Elements Garden, the folks responsible for orchestrating the themes. The OP song, ""Signal Graph"" by Annabel is orchestrated peacefully but also with feeling that depicts the drama in the series. The montage of characters are shown in sequences and even little bits of drama between Yuki x Chisato and what\'s to come later. Don\'t forget the election part though as that\'s what keeps the drama in within the series. The ED song ""Kaze no Naka no Primrose"" by Ceui follows a similar fashion and presents that school like feeling courtesy of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate.This series is actually not bad and has plenty of interesting points. The elections are one of the major themes and throughout the series focuses on it quite well with minimal fillers. Even when the fillers are present occasionally (that are usually short), they still stick with the overall drama theme and how people develop relationships, form bonds, and overcome obstacles together. Like the large cast of school, there is a large cast of characters who each (although some less than others) get their own little spotlights. The oniisama Hazuki, the competitive Satsuki, the black haired loli Michiru, the hyper genius Non-chan, and even that guy with the yaoi stick all get their little moments in. It\'s amusing and in some ways wants us to be there with them to join the fun and help with the election wars.Ultimately, this series is peculiar. In one way, it\'s generic and so predictable of the eventual outcome. In another, it is entertaining to watch with all the characters and the drama going around at the huge academy. Just imagine yourself there and trying to become a leader of a student body of that magnitude. It would be like a living hell to handle that sort of responsibility. Despite this though, the series does adapt well and presents drama at its finest with both the elections and personal relationships. The music and artwork focuses on the typical school life and that each day we get by is another day to learn about the world around us. The content of the story has little fillers so it can all be watchable at once in a marathon for those who are fans into that sort of thing.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is a series to enjoy like an extra curricular activity and not stress over yourself of the eventual outcome. School is filled with drama so loosen up a bit as elections are not never easy. To enjoy this series at your fullest isn\'t easy either but just look at it like a drama play. and Chocolate) is an anime series produced by AIC Build (Haganai, Oremio) and directed by Tōru Kitahata.

The plot is broken and feels  rushed to say the least. The score is lackluster and the characters are little more than boring stereotypes. Almost  everything about this show screams 'average'. To be honest, I would've been happy if it was indeed average. But i was terribly disappointed.The biggest problem with Senkyo is it's setting. it is simply put, laughable. Students control EVERYTHING in Takafuji Academy from staff appointment to budget management. in fact, there is no sane adult to be seen during the course of...the entire anime. It really is preposterous to even assume that 17 year olds have the requisite knowledge to manage a large educational institution. As if this were not enough, the politics surrounding the student council elections is grossly exaggerated. Backstabbing, scheming and attempted murder are what this show considers 'real politics'. Wait a minute, did the writers forget that the story is set in a high school?The plot doesn't do anything to ameliorate the boneheadedness of the setting . in fact there is almost nothing apart from the dull politicking to the plot. of course, it is dull because it isn't done right. We don't see Oojima making  valid points to support his cause, instead we see him giving supposedly inspirational speeches while forgettable music plays  in the background. To be fair to the anime, it is worth mentioning that it does bring to the fore serious issues such as student harassment. But it doesn't go anywhere with it. No solutions are provided to the problems the show points out. I'm inclined to believe that the writers never even tried to come with any solutions. This is because the show turns into  a lame thriller around the 10th episode. It seems as if all the drama was placed there just so that the anime could avoid discussing the more serious issues that it had brought up.Most of Senkyo's characters are boring one-dimensional stereotypes of the worst sort. There are several females surrounding the protagonist as is to be expected from a harem. But only two of them are worth writing in any detail about. Chisato, the childhood friend is probably one of the most self-centered,  whiny and psychologically unstable females in anime I've had the misfortune to witness. Unfortunately, she is the main heroine of the show. It really is a shame because Satsuki, Chisato's competitor and Oojima's political rival is so much better than her in every conceivable way. Satsuki's back-story although cliched, is incomparably better than chisato's, which is laughable to say the least. Speaking of back stories, did I mention that they are the only form of character development there is? And to be absolutely honest, these little splashes of character development feel quite prefunctory and often have no bearing on the plot whatsoever.The art, animation, ost and voicework are all pretty average. Nothing much to write about here.Some people might excuse the myriad flaws of this horrendously blighted excuse for an anime due to the fact that it is a mainstream harem. But there are a lot of mainstream anime out there with a more cohesive plot and better fanservice. the entire anime.

But there are a lot of mainstream anime out there with a more cohesive plot and better fanservice."", 'Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate.The story of a boy yearning for true love and a girl hating chocolate.When I first caught a glimpse of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate, I was deeply intrigued by its title. Love and chocolate are all very well in anime nowadays, but elections? Seriously, how could anyone spin a good yarn out of an election?Due to me having limited time, and also because there were many other anime titles seemingly worthy of my time and attention, I initially put KoiChoco on my on-hold list. However, as the pretenders faded away from my attention, I decided to give KoiChoco a try,...to see whether the anime could possibly be good enough to expound upon the dark, deep world of politics, yet be able to maintain the audience\'s attention over the span of a 1-cour show.The premise that the anime offers us is an interesting one. There are few anime which can delve into politics and still come away with a decent fanbase. However, I can confidently say that KoiChoco succeeds well in that aspect.Let me begin with our protagonist, Oojima Yuuki. He\'s not exactly the type of perfect person everyone loves to hate, yet he also isn\'t the whiny loser that has recently become a common occurrence in anime. In other words, one word can describe Yuuki. Decidedly average. He has a childhood friend, Sumiyoshi Chisato, who is the president of the Food Research Club, of which he is a member of. He goes to the prestigious Takafuji Academy, where the student body is responsible for autonomy, but slacks off with his fellow members of the Food Research Club and Chisato, spending their free time in the club room enjoying snacks rather than getting involved in any useful activities. Heck, the entire club is so laid back that even their advisor gets into the act, guzzling beer whenever she has a chance to sneak into the club room.Yuuki\'s comfortable school life with the FRC could have continued interminably until their eventual graduation, but no. Fate conspires to throw them the prospect of dealing with the disbandment of the FRC. A radical candidate, and the overwhelming favourite for the school council presidency announces her intention to disband clubs that do not carry out any activities that could be deemed useful. At first, the future looks bleak for our FRC members.That is, until someone manages to come up with a brilliant yet outrageous idea. Yuuki should run for the student council presidency himself! Rather than waiting to be crushed by the iron fist of the school council president, the members of the FRC proactively decide to support Yuuki\'s campaign and try their best to prevent the FRC\'s disbandment. However, Yuuki\'s campaign team face a mountain of difficulties. Yuuki practically has no acquaintances outside the FRC which he can rely upon, he does not have any political manifesto, ideologies or affiliations and has absolutely no ambition or desire to become one of the leaders of the school council. And here\'s the ultimate clincher. Yuuki isn\'t even willing to run for the post himself!Enough of that. If I write any more I\'ll be revealing the whole plot of the anime. We don\'t want to spoil people that have yet to watch KoiChoco!Rating this anime is kind of tough, as it is a jumble of concepts that are so radically different as to be almost irreconcilable. One would be forgiven for thinking that KoiChoco is an anime series that tries the impossible and fails miserably in the process, leaving the viewer with a bitter taste. However, I can guarantee that the story is actually quite well presented and executed throughout the anime. The premise of an election is surprisingly excellently done, with a set of rules governing the election that are actually feasible instead of a load of claptrap, and the show manages to convey the suspenseful atmosphere of an election to the audience very well. An added bonus is that KoiChoco is able to do a fantastic presentation of the dark, murky side of elections.  Throw in a couple of well placed plot twists and cliffhangers and you have the framework of KoiChoco. When I finished watching the show, the first thing I thought was ""Wow. Elections sure are serious stuff.""Nothing is completely flawless though, and KoiChoco is not an exception to the rule. One major mistake that the studio made is trying to convey too many concepts at once without giving a thought for the overall continuity of the anime. One example being the transition between the first and second half of the anime. The first half is completely geared towards the FRC\'s preparation for the primary election and their recruitment for help. Smooth sailing so far, up to this point. But after the primaries are over, the anime violently transitions to a romance story, with hardly a mention of the elections that were looming.This particular fault made the story seem unreal, disconnected; it could have been two different arcs of two different anime, yet is melded and shaped into the form that is KoiChoco. Frankly, I feel the anime would have merited an even higher score if the studio had competently handled this portion of the anime.Another problem is the excessive focus on the Yuuki-Chisato pair. The supporting characters are quite the diverse bunch, but they all fade into the background while the limelight shines on Yuuki and Chisato. Essentially, they are there merely to provide support for Yuuki in his election campaign, as they are all pictured doing their bit to help Yuuki win and so prevent disbandment of the FRC. A couple of the supporting cast actually do play an important role in the course of the anime, but those are few and far between. Granted, the anime is a adult visual novel adaptation which focuses on the Chisato arc of the game. Taking into account the time constraints presented by a 1-cour show, it is indeed logical that the studio turn their attentions and energies to one particular arc rather than trying to adapt everything and end up with a half-assed story.The artwork in this anime is very solid and excellently done. Given that KoiChoco is a school-oriented anime, we shouldn\'t expect dazzling graphics or breathtaking scenes of snow-capped mountains and lush green meadows on par with the likes of 5 Centimetres per Second. For a school setting, the art is comparable to the best, and frankly, there are some scenes that are breathtaking in its own way, such as the bridge in the OP which features prominently throughout the anime.The studio certainly deserves some measure of praise for their handling of the  sound portion of the anime. They have got an intuition for the types of music that fit the mood of the anime and are likely to resonate with the viewer, thus enriching the experience even more. For example, when a supporting character is rushing to try and prevent Yuuki from committing a potentially election-ending blunder, the slow piano piece that is played in the background complements the scene and brings out the emotional undertones that are hinted at. On the other hand, the OP of KoiChoco, signal graph, smacks of a plain and generic song. The performance from the singer, Annabel doesn\'t improve it any further either. The ED, Kaze no Naka no Primrose by Ceui, makes a better hash of things, as it is deeply emotional in nature and able to touch viewers with its enchantingly beautiful melody. I have been told that my taste in music deviates wildly from the opinions of many, so feel free to disagree with me on this count.Oh boy. Next up is the Achilles\' heel of KoiChoco, which is sadly its characters. Normally the meat of an anime that complements its story, KoiChoco has let the audience down very badly here, especially considering that it\'s a harem story. Among the wild variation of characters, we have among others a chocolate hating girl, a guy that is openly gay for Yuuki (comic relief?), a chibi inventor who seems to have a few screws loose, an undercover spy for the student council and a dude whose face is a henohenomoheji. Well, that isn\'t a major problem on its own. The real trouble with the characters of KoiChoco is that it gives its primary focus to the couple of Yuuki and Chisato. As mentioned above, the supporting cast are simply along for the ride with the exception of a couple of them. Moreover, Chisato morphs from a great character in the first half of the anime into a whining crybaby that hankers after Yuuki for no reason other than Yuuki being admitted into hospital for outpatient treatment. She literally refuses to let him out of her grasp, even going so far as to cling on Yuuki in his own home. I understand the logic behind the studio wishing to portray Chisato as being reliant on Yuuki. It\'s explained further in the anime. However, I think they could have at least altered the story a bit to prevent Chisato from degrading into such an annoying character. Even if the adaptation were true to the original source material, I feel that this is one example where a measure of artistic licence should be applied in order to prevent the characters from becoming sub-par. The majority of the supporting cast barely get any screen time, and when they appear they\'re either doing things to help Yuuki in his election, lazing around the FRC club room or making subtle advances towards Yuuki. There are certainly exceptions to this, but their appearances are relatively sparse compared to Yuuki and Chisato. The lack of organisation in allotting screen time to the various characters becomes a major failing of KoiChoco.Well, for all my criticism I have to admit that I enjoyed KoiChoco very much. From the interesting interactions between the characters, the fresh breath of air that was its premise of elections, and the marvellous art and character design, I can honestly say that KoiChoco is an anime that I have enjoyed very much in comparison to the other titles in the industry. Although it certainly does not reach the dizzy heights of some, KoiChoco can certainly hold its own against other generic anime that have flooded the anime market in recent years. Moreover, it offers us a more in-depth view in the world of politics, something which I have never seen in an anime before, excepting the odd student council election that isn\'t the main focus of the anime. Since I enjoyed all the aspects of KoiChoco fairly well, I will say that KoiChoco has afforded me great enjoyment, particularly because I retain a certain interest in politics.In conclusion, KoiChoco has its share of flaws and failings, however I can safely conclude that it is a decent anime which manages to capture the audience\'s attention and hold it through its airing. If you are intrigued by the premise of KoiChoco, I would certainly recommend that you give it a spin. Who knows, you might be amazed by what KoiChoco brings to the table. to see whether the anime could possibly be good enough to expound upon the dark, deep world of politics, yet be able to maintain the audience\'s attention over the span of a 1-cour show.The premise that the anime offers us is an interesting one.

A radical candidate, and the overwhelming favourite for the school council presidency announces her intention to disband clubs that do not carry out any activities that could be deemed useful. At first, the future looks bleak for our FRC members.That is, until someone manages to come up with a brilliant yet outrageous idea. Yuuki should run for the student council presidency himself! Rather than waiting to be crushed by the iron fist of the school council president, the members of the FRC proactively decide to support Yuuki\'s campaign and try their best to prevent the FRC\'s disbandment. However, Yuuki\'s campaign team face a mountain of difficulties. Yuuki practically has no acquaintances outside the FRC which he can rely upon, he does not have any political manifesto, ideologies or affiliations and has absolutely no ambition or desire to become one of the leaders of the school council. And here\'s the ultimate clincher. Yuuki isn\'t even willing to run for the post himself!Enough of that. If I write any more I\'ll be revealing the whole plot of the anime. We don\'t want to spoil people that have yet to watch KoiChoco!Rating this anime is kind of tough, as it is a jumble of concepts that are so radically different as to be almost irreconcilable. One would be forgiven for thinking that KoiChoco is an anime series that tries the impossible and fails miserably in the process, leaving the viewer with a bitter taste. However, I can guarantee that the story is actually quite well presented and executed throughout the anime. The premise of an election is surprisingly excellently done, with a set of rules governing the election that are actually feasible instead of a load of claptrap, and the show manages to convey the suspenseful atmosphere of an election to the audience very well. An added bonus is that KoiChoco is able to do a fantastic presentation of the dark, murky side of elections.  Throw in a couple of well placed plot twists and cliffhangers and you have the framework of KoiChoco. When I finished watching the show, the first thing I thought was ""Wow. Elections sure are serious stuff.""Nothing is completely flawless though, and KoiChoco is not an exception to the rule. One major mistake that the studio made is trying to convey too many concepts at once without giving a thought for the overall continuity of the anime. One example being the transition between the first and second half of the anime. The first half is completely geared towards the FRC\'s preparation for the primary election and their recruitment for help. Smooth sailing so far, up to this point. But after the primaries are over, the anime violently transitions to a romance story, with hardly a mention of the elections that were looming.This particular fault made the story seem unreal, disconnected; it could have been two different arcs of two different anime, yet is melded and shaped into the form that is KoiChoco. Frankly, I feel the anime would have merited an even higher score if the studio had competently handled this portion of the anime.Another problem is the excessive focus on the Yuuki-Chisato pair. The supporting characters are quite the diverse bunch, but they all fade into the background while the limelight shines on Yuuki and Chisato. Essentially, they are there merely to provide support for Yuuki in his election campaign, as they are all pictured doing their bit to help Yuuki win and so prevent disbandment of the FRC. A couple of the supporting cast actually do play an important role in the course of the anime, but those are few and far between. Granted, the anime is a adult visual novel adaptation which focuses on the Chisato arc of the game. Taking into account the time constraints presented by a 1-cour show, it is indeed logical that the studio turn their attentions and energies to one particular arc rather than trying to adapt everything and end up with a half-assed story.The artwork in this anime is very solid and excellently done. Given that KoiChoco is a school-oriented anime, we shouldn\'t expect dazzling graphics or breathtaking scenes of snow-capped mountains and lush green meadows on par with the likes of 5 Centimetres per Second. For a school setting, the art is comparable to the best, and frankly, there are some scenes that are breathtaking in its own way, such as the bridge in the OP which features prominently throughout the anime.The studio certainly deserves some measure of praise for their handling of the  sound portion of the anime. They have got an intuition for the types of music that fit the mood of the anime and are likely to resonate with the viewer, thus enriching the experience even more. For example, when a supporting character is rushing to try and prevent Yuuki from committing a potentially election-ending blunder, the slow piano piece that is played in the background complements the scene and brings out the emotional undertones that are hinted at. On the other hand, the OP of KoiChoco, signal graph, smacks of a plain and generic song. The performance from the singer, Annabel doesn\'t improve it any further either. The ED, Kaze no Naka no Primrose by Ceui, makes a better hash of things, as it is deeply emotional in nature and able to touch viewers with its enchantingly beautiful melody. I have been told that my taste in music deviates wildly from the opinions of many, so feel free to disagree with me on this count.Oh boy. Next up is the Achilles\' heel of KoiChoco, which is sadly its characters. Normally the meat of an anime that complements its story, KoiChoco has let the audience down very badly here, especially considering that it\'s a harem story. Among the wild variation of characters, we have among others a chocolate hating girl, a guy that is openly gay for Yuuki (comic relief?), a chibi inventor who seems to have a few screws loose, an undercover spy for the student council and a dude whose face is a henohenomoheji. Well, that isn\'t a major problem on its own. The real trouble with the characters of KoiChoco is that it gives its primary focus to the couple of Yuuki and Chisato. As mentioned above, the supporting cast are simply along for the ride with the exception of a couple of them. Moreover, Chisato morphs from a great character in the first half of the anime into a whining crybaby that hankers after Yuuki for no reason other than Yuuki being admitted into hospital for outpatient treatment. She literally refuses to let him out of her grasp, even going so far as to cling on Yuuki in his own home. I understand the logic behind the studio wishing to portray Chisato as being reliant on Yuuki. It\'s explained further in the anime. However, I think they could have at least altered the story a bit to prevent Chisato from degrading into such an annoying character. Even if the adaptation were true to the original source material, I feel that this is one example where a measure of artistic licence should be applied in order to prevent the characters from becoming sub-par. The majority of the supporting cast barely get any screen time, and when they appear they\'re either doing things to help Yuuki in his election, lazing around the FRC club room or making subtle advances towards Yuuki. There are certainly exceptions to this, but their appearances are relatively sparse compared to Yuuki and Chisato. The lack of organisation in allotting screen time to the various characters becomes a major failing of KoiChoco.Well, for all my criticism I have to admit that I enjoyed KoiChoco very much. From the interesting interactions between the characters, the fresh breath of air that was its premise of elections, and the marvellous art and character design, I can honestly say that KoiChoco is an anime that I have enjoyed very much in comparison to the other titles in the industry. Although it certainly does not reach the dizzy heights of some, KoiChoco can certainly hold its own against other generic anime that have flooded the anime market in recent years. Moreover, it offers us a more in-depth view in the world of politics, something which I have never seen in an anime before, excepting the odd student council election that isn\'t the main focus of the anime. Since I enjoyed all the aspects of KoiChoco fairly well, I will say that KoiChoco has afforded me great enjoyment, particularly because I retain a certain interest in politics.In conclusion, KoiChoco has its share of flaws and failings, however I can safely conclude that it is a decent anime which manages to capture the audience\'s attention and hold it through its airing. If you are intrigued by the premise of KoiChoco, I would certainly recommend that you give it a spin. Who knows, you might be amazed by what KoiChoco brings to the table.', ""Well this is my first review, so I hope you would be satisfied.Well firstly, this is your typical ''club and student council'' type of anime.The art is well done,very similar to amagami ss.So far the series is going pretty well and yes there's some romance and a bit of harem here and there,There's also a dash of comedy which makes it enjoyable.The story itself isn't unique,since there are some anime with the same concept,of student coucils and clubs.The chocolate-candy concept is kinda new though.Hopefully, this series wouldn't turn into  your typical ''harem''. "", ""A big problem with visual novel adaptations these days is that most of them stick to this formula where nothing really happens, there's a lot of attempts at humor, they explore each (or most) character(s) and the protagonist picks a girl. Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is different, although it still shares some similarities with most visual novel adaptation, it separates itself by having a pretty interesting plot, which makes the series enjoyable.What really makes the plot interesting is the twists and turns that happen along the way. The plot may seem simple at first, the main character trying to win an election to be...student body president so his club would not be disbanded. But as the series progressed and as they started to give us a deeper look into the election, a number of darker and more serious things start to surface. For a 13 episode series it does a real good job at making an interesting plot because it has depth to it.The series does leave some things unexplained and the series certainly has it's flaws but given the time frame, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate executes the story really well.The art was nothing too spectacular but it is really well drawn. The animations are very fluent and there's no major errors.The sound was good too, the opening is very lighthearted and has a very happy mood, which fits the series very well. The ending is a very soft song, which has this farewell feel (if that makes any sense at all), very fitting for an ending. The voice acting is also done pretty well as they make the feelings of the characters believable.For the short time frame that this anime was given, the series did a fair job with the characters. The main male protagonist Yuuki Oojima is a lot like many main male protagonists in other harems, except he isn't useless. He doesn't really get much development but instead he helps the other characters develop. He is also very likeable much like many of the other characters. The girl he ends up with, Chisato Sumiyoshi, is not very well received by others, but personally, I don't hate her. She goes through some nice development such as finally overcoming the loss of her brother which is more than expected from a series of this length. The supporting characters get little development, some get some development and others aren't even touched. However they are still all likable and you will almost always be finding yourself rooting for somebody.As a whole Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is one of the more enjoyable harems for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is because it has an interesting plot. Another reason may be because of it's comedy, which is well-placed at some times but misplaced at others but when the comedy is well-placed, it can be down right hilarious.Overall Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is a nice change from many other visual novel adaptations these days because it can be very entertaining.

This also shows that not all harem animes are that bad."", ""To start of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate looks like your typical slice of life anime where the club is having problems. However, this one is different because it incorporates 3 elements that I feel make it unique or special. The first element that I liked was the drama because on the outside you have the typical slice of life vibe, but once the action gets going especially towards the end that is where drama is released. Dialogue is the second element that makes this Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate different because with having presidential elections one would expect to have a lot of dialogue...to present their points or objectives. the third element which is comedy incorporated well since it was kept at a minimal level and mostly done from the side or supporting characters.Story: The story was ok, but I feel like it was rushed. There was some parts during the story that just felt ignored or not fully explained. Still what makes the story have a higher score is the drama part because it is nicely done. The last couple of episodes really make up for the lack of drama at first. Comedy wise that didn't hurt the story, and the characters all brought the story together even more.Sound: The OP and ED are very nice and worth watching every time. Not much to say here besides saying that during those serious scenes the background music really enhances the scene even more. The main song that is the highlight of this anime is the song played by one of the characters who use a harmonica.Character: The score really doesn't reflect on most of the characters but rather on some of them. Chisato from my perspective had a very complex personality that helped relate or understand her. Michiru another character is one that I liked the most based on how she behaved. Her appearance really makes her stand out from the rest of the characters because she carries that mysterious presence whenever scene shows her by herself pondering.Enjotment/Overall: I sure wish this anime had a second season because some things could be explained better there, and it would be nice to see maybe time skips of how the school is doing as well. Overall I really enjoyed Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate and the ending really helped bring the number up even more. Despite the low passing score that the story has the characters make up for that and really help make the anime worth watching. the comedy also made me burst into laughter at times so that also incorporated into the overall score.I'd say for those who want to watch an anime that will make you laugh, yet have a serious tone then Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is one to watch. Just be prepared for the moderate dialogue.

The main protagonist Yuuki Oojima has the option to run for an election to save his precious club, he starts his election after hearing similar words from people around him.At first I thought Choi to Senkyo to Chocolate would be your typical school club romance type anime. For me it ended up becoming so much more. It starts out with a dramatic event that honestly makes hardly any sense until you get quite a ways into the anime. Once things start to make sense though...this anime seems too really shine. One of the things it portrays is that politics aren’t always what they seem on the surface.  There is always a struggle behind the scenes and this is one of the topics this anime tackles in a very interesting fashion. Throughout the anime it confronts the things that happen on the surface and behind the scenes in politics.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate also has the drama and romance to go with it that makes it all the more intriguing. Each character has their own story and their own reasons for doing things. They are all unique and make the story come together wonderfully.As for Koi to Senkyo to Chocolates flaws, it definitely does have them, though most are easy to look over. One of it’s biggest flaws I think is that it sometimes feels rushed sometimes. I would have liked to see this anime more around 23 episodes. It also has it’s cliché’s like most anime, things seem to always work out for the better. Oh and they never explain some things like how Oojima seems to see some people in a strange way, though it’s easy to make speculations.Overall I was very impressed, especially considering I wasn’t expecting much of anything of this anime. It has all the factors to make it a very enjoyable watch. I also don’t know of many anime’s that present politics and romance in the way this anime does, which made it even more enjoyable.  Either way whether you enjoy drama, romance, or politics this is a good watch! this anime seems too really shine.

There\'s a boy, he\'s part of a club, and that club is going to be disbanded if they don\'t do something! When I see a story like this what it comes down to typically is how enjoyable the characters are to watch. Coming into this I knew the anime wasn\'t my typical selection: It\'s not in the top 1000, and it\'s rated 7.4. But I found the anime to be enjoyable overall.If you\'re trying to decide whether or not to give this a try, I\'d say be ready to accept a certain amount...of tropes and cliches. I\'d say it\'s not a masterpiece, it\'s not great. It had a lot of flaws. But I found it enjoyable, and it has a happy and romantic ending.To begin, this is based off of a visual novel by the same name. As such, it suffers a quite a bit from ""all sorts of females are inexplicably in love with the main character"" syndome (ironically not so much the club members). It feels very scatter brained because you can tell where there would\'ve been multiple routes for different heroines in the visual novel; however these are not pursued in the anime. This leaves the Main Character feeling rather weak and indecisive at times. For the majority of the episodes though you have a slice of life show about a guy trying to get elected, with occasional bits of drama sprinkled in. The plot and drama really heat up in the last stretch of episodes, and this is when the show is at it\'s best in my opinion.The art/sound were both well done but nothing to be amazed at. They don\'t detract from the storytelling, and the music does a good job of setting the mood at the right times (mostly).The anime would\'ve been better if it had focused on one primary female heroine, and if the main character felt a bit stronger and decisive. It did feel like the story had gaps, it was as if there was too much story to fit into 12 episodes (again, probably because it\'s based on a visual novel in which all of this could be explained in more detail). Still, it did something I find few animes doing these days and that\'s end happily. And I liked the fact that it didn\'t try to spring a new romance into the fray mid way through. Despite the fact that the M.C. feels pretty weak in his convictions (towards potential romantic interests) at times, the anime ended romantically as I think it should\'ve.Based on enjoyment alone I\'d give it a 7, but I think overall I have to go with a 6. I by no means feel like this was a bad show, but you\'ve gotta be ready to accept it for what it is: a nice little story about a club trying to get their friend elected president with a little bit of plot to intensify the romance at the end. of tropes and cliches.

I think that\'s the textual english translation for this title. And it pretty much sums the whole anime up. That\'s it for this review, see you in the next one! :DThat\'s what I would really had liked to say because of the first impression this anime gave me. It has all the elements that make it look like your typical harem - slice of life - high school anime. It even has all of the archetypical characters, and most of them have to be female, of course. However, this anime achieves a lot more than what you might think.The setup is...a rather large private school, composed of about 9999 (or all of the 9\'s you can imagine for a single number) students, and thus, the student council is taken pretty seriously. You could say that the students themselves are the ones who rule this academy. It\'s kind of an utopic school, where the democracy has a huge roll and it\'s executed perfectly.Enter our main character, Yuuki Ojima: A rather lazy student who attends to this school and belongs to the ""food research"" club that does virtually nothing more than eating. He belongs to it just because there\'s something that tells him that he must be in a club, and of course, to be with his childhood friend, Chisato Sumiyoshi.As the student council gets serious about clubs literally wasting and throwing money away in order to keep doing nothing, our main characters and the rest of the club decide to protect it, and the only way is that one of them becomes the council student president.As our main character becomes more and more popular every time because of the elections, he starts to realize that there\'s a lot more to do than saving his own club. He starts to develop selfless-ness, and he becomes some sort of a pro-active guy, caring about what happens around him, leaving his laziness behind. And this is where the well executed drama (specially with his childhood friend, Chisato) begins.I never thought I\'d say this about an anime, but there\'s a honorable mention that I want to give to the comedy aspect. which was not abused nor it was totally absent either.

It just comes naturally, and even if you dont think it\'s funny, it helps you to recover your pace and catch some air. Alright i\'m exaggerating :DI give the story a solid 8, as it  has different ""areas"" where it develops itself, but it does in a pretty convincing fashion, without losing any of its focus.I would say 12 episodes weren\'t enough, as the development kind of required some more depth to it.

Nothing was rushed nor over-extended either.The characters, as I mentiones before, are nothing that blow your imagination away, for they are these archetypical characters. However, the characters\' development is notably one of the strong point of this anime. It was really good to see these people not hesitating to take mature decisions to support the ones they care about, as well as leaving some stuff about their regretable past behind. When you start do develop some sort of love/hate relationship with one or more characters, that\'s the moment you will know they were well executed and have an impact.The art in this anime was ok. it reminded me a lot of Amagami SS, specially on the characters design (although this aspect is a little more exagerated in Koi to Senkyo). Everything was pleasant to see and is well detailed too.When it comes to the sound, i found it awesome for an anime of this type. I was really immersed into the general feeel and atmosphere of each scene because of the background music solely. It really invites you to become one with the plot.Voice acting was also good enough. Not outstanding, but it was well done for my taste.

Some may think this anime is like any generic and stereotypical anime about schools and how any stereotypical characters interact with each other. Well you\'re half right but you are also wrong. This anime is more than that, it doesnt follow the general dogma as some of you might say it and it will drawn you into a world of politics, revenge, violence, discrimination, and dramatizations. If you are into school, comedy, romance and drama, this anime is just...for you.Art/graphic -  The art is beautiful, all I\'d have to say is its better than most anime I\'ve seen so far including the more recent ones. Although I do feel that they could have done so much more with the art, I think this amount of work was the right choice for this anime.Sound - This one is especially my favorite, I was instantly hooked with the OP as well as the first song in the beginning of episode one.Character -  I\'m not going to talk about the character because people have different interpretation on what is a good or what is a horrible character.Story - This is what really drawn me into this anime. Unlike any other orthodox   short series comedy, romance anime where the plot (or no plot at all) come after 6 or 7 episode of the anime. (I know how frustrating it can be) The plot in this anime immediately present itself after one or two episode. Although this anime have many characters, it seem only to revolved around the main protagonist and his girl. Although this anime have a harem feel to it, it definitely going a different path than what it was meant for. What really makes me loved this anime was that the ending unlike any other thousands of anime, did not have a half ass ending. Im sure many of you have encounter many of these anime where the main character do not end up with anyone or the ending wasnt to your satisfaction. Well, I wont spoil any ending but the main character actually do choose a girl at the end and had over come many obstacle to be able to achieved his goal and love life unlike other protagonist where they are too ""pussy"" or weak and had to let the girl do everything.This anime definitely caught me off guard as I was looking for something enjoyable to watch in my spare time.Enjoyment - 9 for you.Art/graphic -  The art is beautiful, all I\'d have to say is its better than most anime I\'ve seen so far including the more recent ones.

Ok, so this sweet anime has ended and I glad that it becomes a Yuuki X Chisato arc, so let\'s get down to business:Story: Good 7.I say even though the story is a mixed up arc, I like the way where is was going,co\'z everything about this anime revolves around love, elections and chocolate. The love part are the occasional arcs where the muchacho (Yuuki) encounters, though it still has that guy is oblivious to girl\'s feeling kind of thing. The story kinda misdirects us audience as to whom will the muchacho (Yukki) will end up with, even...if the muchacho (Yuuki) has told the chiquita( Chisato) that he\'ll never leave her side, we sort of ignore it hoping that it\'ll be whom we hope for. Needless to say that the ""Love"" thingy of this anime\'s title refers to Yuuki X Chisato\'s arc, in fact the romance genre revolves around it. The ""Election"" thingy of this anime\'s title is more of a  mystery genre that surround the bureaucracy of the student council in particular the "" Public Safety Commission""  and the Katahira Faction, and as for the ""Chocolate"" thingy ( I love chocolate), that is where the drama genre is and it is all about the chiquita\'s (Chisato) hatred  of chocolate and Daikin her hermano (brother).Art: Fair 6.Ok for the girl\'s school uniform, I really can\'t dig the illustrator\'s idea as to why most students don a 4 layer dress, which btw is the cropped jacket which the 4th layer and worn by most girls and why do some girls only have 3 layered uniform, wtf do I mean? Ok most girls have the follow layer of school uniform which is compose of the following; camisole, shirt, skirt and cropped jacket....btw the ribbon is not included. on the other hand Michiru, Ai Ki, and Isara don a 3 layer uniform, which only includes the camisole, shirt and skirt. If this is the illustrator\'s way of distinguishing the freshmen from the older students then that is a a very cheesy concept. I\'d rather see them girls wearing an ordinary sailor\'s outfit than having to discriminate certain character\'s outfit.Sound: Good 7.I like the both the opening and ending theme, but I mostly prefer the opening theme. Which is titled "" Signal Graph"" sung by Annabel:Signal Graph, English translated:My hand can reach you as you stand smiling in front of me.But although I’m so close to you I can touch you,I put up a front and close off my feelingsand pretend I don’t notice the emotions flowing out of my heart.But even beyond the cloudy sky blurred by my tears,the bright blue sky spans across.“The signal telling me I can change.”I’ll raise my hands high upso take me from the past I fearedand into the future I thoughtI’ve let go.I just noticed you and thatwhich shines brightly within you.I’ll look straight aheadand walk forward together with you.I knocked down one of my dreams I thought I could reach.And I sat there looking out the window…When our eyes meet, I can’t say anything.So I smile hoping my smile will convey these overflowing feelings.Accepting each other is not because of weakness,so teach me how to have a stronger heart.“The signal telling me I can change.”Speeding up my pace along with yours,I’ll take the tailwindand go towards the future I thought I’ve let goone more time.I keep the strength you gave me deep in my heart.One day I’ll be sureto shine brightly and shine overothers and the roads they take.The bright light, gives me a push on my back, and spreads far.I’ll raise my hands high upso take me from the past I fearedand into the future I thoughtI’ve let go.I just noticed you and thatwhich shines brightly within you.Let’s walk forward holding hands.“Given enough time, everything will change.”I won’t ever say that anymoreand go towards the future I thought I’ve let goone more time.Even against the wind raising its speed,I won’t close nor avert my eyes.I’ll look straight aheadand walk forward together with you.Walk forward.Character: Good 7.Yuuki Ojima- The thing about him, is that he\'s a kind of guy who is aware that the girls have feelings for him, but seems to be of a block head as what to do next, ok so he\'s a bit of a Mr. Heroic when he tries to save Isara from being builled and when he also mends Satsuki and Hazuki\'s differences. But he kind looks like this soon to be reluctant philandering husband where he searches for love only to find out that his real heart belongs to Chisato.Chisato Sumiyoshi- everyone kind get\'s irritated when she seemly dominates Yuuki and seem to relies a lot on Yuuki for emotional support. But it is that emotional dependence  that gives her character that dramatic climax.Mifuyu Kiba- Well, if you were to ask me, she actually my 2nd choice if ever the Chisato X Yuuki arc didn\'t come about, I like the way she has that gentleness about her, but I can never understand as wtf is a big deal about Japanese teenage girls on being insecure about having a scar? When in her case she had it co\'z she had underwent surgery, now it is not like that she lost her virginity co\'z she was raped or something.Isara Aomi- I kind pity her, and I could have wish that she wasn\'t being buiiled.Michiru Morishita- If only if this anime wasn\'t being censored, I would have seen her panty. But I can never understand as to why is she sooo passive and yet sooo deadly. I really hate it that she\'s an S-agent though, but she one moe that you\'ll find interesting.Satsuki Shinonome- Whoa, she one hell of a refine lady with both beauty and brains.Nozomi Edagawa- or \'Non Chan, ........I have nothing to say.Ai Sarue and Kii Monzennaka- I guess if this anime should have a tsundere character, they are it.Oboro Yumeshima - Yaoi? EEEEWWWWW! ( No offends to the members of LGBT society)Hazuki Shinonome - What I like about her is that she\'s one Milf that everyone will love............to be Yuuki\'s cougar that is.As for the rest of the cast, If there will be a character that best describes as the mystery genre of this anime, then it\'ll be Yakumo Mōri and Kana Ōgibashi and as the antagonist it\'ll be Moheiji Tatsumi in which I can never understand as to why he has to be in a henohenomoheji-like mask and Yuina Ōsawa. I really find it irritating that teens like them seems to be in control of  Takafuji Academy.Enjoyment and overall: Good 7.Well, if one is to enjoy watching this anime, then it is really enjoyable to watch, especially when one is hoping for someone to be Yuuki\'s love interest, in which I\'m glad that it ended with Chisato. Overall I find it irritating that  Takafuji Academy seems to be controlled by the student council and the student council itself in embroiled in such bureaucracy where such mystery genre  was formed in particular as to who ran over Kana, what anomalies does each commission of the student council is in to and why does the Public Safety welds such authority not only over the students but also with the faculty and the school administration. Such things are ill fitting to the overall of this anime, but it does provide such curiosity as to how things will go about, so it is only limited to have a 7 for its overall score.I love chocolate. if the muchacho (Yuuki) has told the chiquita( Chisato) that he\'ll never leave her side, we sort of ignore it hoping that it\'ll be whom we hope for.

To a good extent, the anime essentially milks the typical cliches and archetypes of dating sims, harems and high school-based anime, which include even a student council that has more authority over school issues than the staff to go along with its ""election"" premise.It does have some refreshing story elements to its dating sim roots. Yuki isn\'t made into a hapless lead dealing with unwanted attention from the girls surrounding him as he...is a level headed guy trying to get a handle on all the situations surrounding him in the school as he runs for student council president and has clear thoughts on the feelings he has for the girls surrounding him within the club or around the school. While the anime has some fan service and double-entendre moments, they don\'t pop up often nor do they get in the way of developments with the show\'s plot. The first half also has some potential with its election plot as Yuki tries to gain support for his electoral run and understand the ropes of being a student council leader.The series quality starts to degrade in the show\'s second half when elements to the show\'s dating sim roots start to rear their ugly head. The sub-plot that Yuki is dragged into involving hostilities between two characters got decent focus and genuine drama out of the affair. However, Love Election and Chocolate\'s attempts at adding romantic developments in its second half are rather underwhelming as they are rather unconvincing and poorly mixed into the ongoing developments Yuki has with the election. The election bits even degrade in quality as well when things get way too overly serious over the stakes of the election when things such as secret groups, conspiracies and scandals get added to the mix with such students treating the election as if they were trying to win a campaign to run a country. It\'s perhaps the poorest example I\'ve seen of the ""Absurdly Powerful Student Council"" trope getting milked from an anime to date.Visual quality for this is a bit on the plain side for a 2012 title. There are sharp details and bright colors incorporated for character designs and scenery to compliment the cheerful mood the anime wants to give off. However, nothing with it particularly stuck out in comparison to other impressively visual titles animated from that time such as Eureka Seven AO and Fate/Zero\'s second half.Much like many other dating sim knockoffs I\'ve come across, I\'m rather indifferent towards Love, Election and Chocolate. Despite having some decent elements to its premise, the series still mostly milks off story cliches and character archetypes typical of the genre and the election story gets rather ridiculous in its second half when it tries to act like its making a statement about politics. Unless you\'re a sap for dating sims, I\'d pass on this. is a level headed guy trying to get a handle on all the situations surrounding him in the school as he runs for student council president and has clear thoughts on the feelings he has for the girls surrounding him within the club or around the school.

Unless you\'re a sap for dating sims, I\'d pass on this.', 'One of the most common ailments of VNs-turned-anime is that it\'s easy for the romance to overwhelm the story.  Integrating a game with multiple routes with multiple leads into one single storyline often ends with a anime that, at best, seems like a harem anime that lacks the courage to actually make it a harem (Clannad) or, at worst, a mess of routes that fails to flesh out characters well and butchers the plot (i.e. Studio DEEN\'s adaptation of Fate/Stay Night).  Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate manages to find a tenuous, if workable balance, between plot and characters in this adaptation of the...original Eroge.=Story: 9=At the beginning of the season, Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate started out near the bottom of my priorities list, fulfilling the spot of stereotypical-harem-with-a-plot that just manages to stay good enough to avoid being dropped.  The first episode certainly reinforced it, with a club with seven females and two males, one of whom is also apparently heads-over-heels over the other, the protagonist.  The originally chilling prologue of the first episode seemed to have been completely forgotten, and the whole election was going to be a happy but uninteresting frolick of cuteness and relationships.  However, KoiChoco (Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate is a bit too much of a mouthful) does in fact develop from a harem with a plot.As is the case with apparently all Japanese High Schools, the Student Council holds vasts amounts of power.  In the case of Takafuji Private Academy, an academy whose finances are almost completely managed by the students, the Student Council controls the (as mentioned in Episode 11, ""tens of billions of yen-strong"") expenditures of the  school.  The Preisdency usually is fought over by three major factions within the school: the Finance Committee, the General Affairs department and the Public Safety Commission.  With the current incumbent plagued by allegations of corruption, the projected winner, Finance Commissioner Satsuki Shinonome, campaigns on a platform of austerity, starting with the elimination of clubs that do not appear to be doing anything productive with their funding.  Into this is thrown protagonist Oojima (often mistaken as Ooshiima due to the Kanji) Yuki, who is nominated by the members of his club (the Food Research) to run as a third-party candidate in order to save his club, all the while confronting the many interpersonal issues that emerge through the course of the campaign.Don\'t get me wrong, KoiChoco does not neglect the character-side of the story--much of the election (and much of the routes in the VN) are bound to interpersonal relations--the past traumas of Election Manager, Club President and Childhood friend Chisato Sumiyoshi, the family struggles of Finance Commissioner Satsuki Shinonome, the personal struggle of Isara Aomi, a beneficiary of a controversial financial aid program, and the enigmatic motivations of Yuki\'s backer and incumbent president, former Public Safety Commissioner Yakumo Mori. However, what makes KoiChoco an exceptional adaptation is its focus also on the main plot.  Through the story, Yuki and the Food Club must confront many of the problems faced by Third Party Candidates in a field dominated by large, well-funded parties, while also delving into the behind-the-scenes politics behind Yuki\'s backer, the Public Safety Commission, and the two other commissions.  Sometimes I found that the actual story at times seemed more appealing than the interpersonal struggles of the characters, though the opposite also occurred.  Overall, KoiChoco\'s best point was its ability to both bring out the interpersonal interactions of the cast while also maintaining an interesting and absorbing main plot.=Art: 7=While nothing bad can be said of the art--it is certainly cute, and there are no major drops in animation quality, the art comes off as unexceptional--good but not much different from anything else out there.  The anime frequently uses soft, pastel-like colors that help maintain a warm atmosphere to the anime in general, which does contribute to the atmosphere, but not in any noteworthy way.=Sound: 8=KoiChoco\'s Openings and Endings start out generic, but grow on you very quickly.  Signal Graph, the OP by Annabel, a departure from the generally soft, rather quiet Ending themes the Artist usually does (as in Sankarea, Canaan and Another\'s Endings), is an upbeat, enjoyable song that conveys the mood of the anime quite well, while the ED, Kaze no Naka no Primrose by Ceui, is also pleasant, but not quite as noteworthy.  The soundtrack music is certainly good, with a lot of synth, string and piano themes that would be expected of a romantic anime.  While nothing is lacking in the OST, there is nothing that would really come out as exceptional.=Character: 8=The main issue with many of the characters in KoiChoco is that they seem underused.  Many of them (Chisato and Yuki\'s friend Mifuyu, Michiru, Satsuki), while itneresting and well-fleshed out characters, do not seem to be used to the best extent they could, for the very reason that adapting their whole route into an anime of only twelve episodes would be difficult.  Other characters that probably held much more potential (i.e. the abrasive and strange Moheiji Tatsumi, whose mask apparently only Yuuki can see, Satsuki\'s sister and Yuki\'s adviser Hazuki, and Aomi) are also left seemingly without much elaboration.  Once again, the limits of a twelve-anime show should be brought into consideration, but the underutilization of some very interesting characters was a bit of a disappointment that reduced the score from 9 to 8.  On the other hand, other characters seemed pointless and unimportant--the cutely generic child genius Non-chan, Ai Sarue and her other-colored-twin Kii Monzennaka all seemed forgettable, with no seeming purpose apart from filling the club with people.  While that, too, should be expected of minor characters, they could have been replaced with less generic characters.=Enjoyment: 9=For me, KoiChoco was a pleasant surprise in that it simply broke my expectations of a generic harem show and turned out to be a not-quite-riveting but certainly very interesting story that combined both interpersonal relationships with some of the actual politics and pressure behind an election.  The fact that at times my heart did race is certainly enough to elevate it to a 9.=Overall: 8=KoiChoco should honestly be deserving of a 9 - I really do want to play the Visual Novel now, and its plot probably covered most of the spots that made me dissatisfied with the anime.  The characters were pleasant, the story was excellent, and though the arts and sounds were unexceptional, they were certainly not detrimental to the story.  The only obstacle to getting a 9 in my book would be unavoidable specter of the 12-episode limit, which probably prevented many of the scenes from being employed to their best effect.  Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed KoiChoco in its 11-episode run, and look forwards to the last episode. original Eroge.=Story: 9=At the beginning of the season, Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate started out near the bottom of my priorities list, fulfilling the spot of stereotypical-harem-with-a-plot that just manages to stay good enough to avoid being dropped.

While that, too, should be expected of minor characters, they could have been replaced with less generic characters.=Enjoyment: 9=For me, KoiChoco was a pleasant surprise in that it simply broke my expectations of a generic harem show and turned out to be a not-quite-riveting but certainly very interesting story that combined both interpersonal relationships with some of the actual politics and pressure behind an election.  The fact that at times my heart did race is certainly enough to elevate it to a 9.=Overall: 8=KoiChoco should honestly be deserving of a 9 - I really do want to play the Visual Novel now, and its plot probably covered most of the spots that made me dissatisfied with the anime.  The characters were pleasant, the story was excellent, and though the arts and sounds were unexceptional, they were certainly not detrimental to the story.  The only obstacle to getting a 9 in my book would be unavoidable specter of the 12-episode limit, which probably prevented many of the scenes from being employed to their best effect.  Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed KoiChoco in its 11-episode run, and look forwards to the last episode.', 'This series might have some solid stuff. The series is made intellectually pleasing but tries to keep other kind of folks interested too by the usual harem school club setup and it has worked decently though not brilliantly. The art doesn\'t help out much in favor of ma king it anymore attractive. The strong points of the series are I think, the characters and the dialogues. The first episode gives the air of an espionage thriller and political feel which has been heavily normalised for a high school setting and how the author uses this theme creatively is to be seen and I would like...it to work out well since it seems very interesting and hoping it wont lose its momentum and become just another excuse for a harem. I can draw parallel to the series ""Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon"" which was just too brilliant in story and style. Considering the fact that there are a lot of double meanings and that it uses a serious topic such as election politics, censoring and that too the just mild ecchi contents is very irritating and counter intuitive. it to work out well since it seems very interesting and hoping it wont lose its momentum and become just another excuse for a harem.

The issue with Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is that it tries to be romantic, when it can't be, needed a R rating to be a good anime, and it feels rushed and quite lacking in the main characters communication, more of a blockhead than many people that could possibly exist.Not to mention this show feels like it is missing something to it that would make it actually really good, and that would be, better pacing and more character development, both are lacking quite much, inevitably ruining...the feeling of the show. These issues are not even mentioning the mid tier ending that feels rushed, the episodes before it were great, the pacing near the end (2 episodes before the ending) is what the show really needed for the whole series, otherwise it felt good.Artwork is amazing though, really pleasant on the eyes.Sound is mid.Characters have persona's but they needed some development.in all though I have seen way worse.(7/10) the feeling of the show.

Please forgive me for any grammatical errors and awkward wordings.Anyways, the main reason I'm writing this review is to defend the low rating/low popularity, and to also encourage other anime lovers to enjoy this anime.The main problems others state for this anime are excessive amount of characters and plot rush. However, I don't really blame the anime for that. First of all, this anime bases off of Visual Novel, so the amount of characters can't really be blamed. The plot kind of rushes because of the length of the anime. I believe if the anime has...more episodes and focuses more on main characters' past, then the anime can be as emotionally powerful as popular anime such as Clannad and Little Busters.-Story- 9/10The story is really great. The idea of student-governing school is really refreshing. The plot progresses well and the anime does not lack emotionally powerful stories. You would want to watch the next episode after each episode. The political struggles within the student government really interest me. Just as I mentioned above, if the anime has more episodes, this anime can easily get 10/10.-Art- 10/10Really great art. The characters are beautiful and designed well. The setting is really great, so does the environment in the anime.-Sound-  10/10Really love the OP and ED. Soundtracks are not bad as well.-Character- 9/10Characters have different personalities and roles, with different back-stories. The amount of characters is a problem though; however, I don't really blame the producer for that. The main male lead progresses throughout the anime. The relationship between main male lead and main female lead progresses as well.-Enjoyment- 10/10This anime can really move people. The stories are great and the interactions between characters are interesting.-Overall- 10/10Really good one for me. Reminds me of clannad and little busters. I really love these emotionally powerful anime, especially if they revolve around school. I would gladly recommend this anime to anyone who loves Clannad/Little Buster or anyone who loves anime with school, romance, and slice-of-life settings. more episodes and focuses more on main characters' past, then the anime can be as emotionally powerful as popular anime such as Clannad and Little Busters.-Story- 9/10The story is really great.

I can\'t say whether you\'ll enjoy it or not, but it\'s worth to see nevertheless.One can easily list multiple stories, novels, movies, which portray how elections work (or more precisely, not work). Most of them ironically portray an incompetent, money-driven candidate who running his unfair and corrupted campaign.Love, Election, Chocolate! portrays Ojima Yuki, a member of the Food Research (a.k.a. Eating) Club, which, of course, gets school funds for its activities. However, the elections for Student...Council president are approaching, and the popular candidate wishes to disband clubs that don\'t deserve their funds, including Yuki\'s. Not knowing anything about politics and PR, Yuki decides to run against her.Then what\'s the difference, then, between Love, Election, Chocolate! and all the other works you mentioned above? Once again we have an incompetent candidate who\'s running for president for money!Unlike other similar political shows or novels, there\'s no irony in LEC! Instead, Yuki is the person who is about to lose the club, which is the place at school he really belongs to, and simply tries to protect it. We are also shown interesting personal dramas of the other members of the Food Club and the opposing candidates, political (and not only) intrigues by the people who currently have power, and much more.For this unique approach I give the story  8/10 (which is good, coming from me), despite the filler and supposedly comical silly scenes.The art, however, I didn\'t like. While its quality is good, I care a lot more about character designs than the quality of the art. And them didn\'t like: strange hairs, big boobs, and a face which looks like a mask. Thus I give 3/10 for the art.The music was OK. I liked the opening and ending a lot, and the the soundtracks were good and appropriate.As well as the character designs, the characters themselves also draw the show back. While appropriate (for example, we have Yuki\'s opponent, the perfect, honest, fair candidate; we have two comical relief characters), they are nothing special or original.Characters which are ""nothing special"", bad art, fuller scenes, manages, in my case, to ""compensate"" for the unique approach to the story, and thus I give 5 for enjoyment. Nevertheless, I do recommend you to give a try to this series.PS: Could you send me some feedback if you find thid unhelpful?

Don't you love it when that happens?The Short Version:(+)The art is alright for the time.(+)The main characters are a bit more tolerable than the normal given the genre.(-)There’s way too many characters for this show to focus on.(-)The shift of tone towards the end is so sudden it’s jarring.(-)The sound, save for one part, is easily missable.The Story (6/10): The story is about the main characters trying to stop their club from being...disbanded, and they think up that the best way to do this is to have the male lead run for president, because on the day a new president is founded they immediately get to allocate the budget for all the clubs instantly. Because that’s totally how that shit works. One of the things that I really didn’t enjoy with the story is that the first 5 minutes are entirely misleading, then at the end of the show they bring back that tone for some reason. I was so confused towards the last 4 or so episode because the show changes from a light-hearted rom-com thing, to a drama piece that has something to do with political movement for the presidency. That is not a good shift of tone for a show like this, if it kept the feel from the first half of the show I probably would’ve enjoyed this just a bit more.The Characters (6/10): I’ll say this quickly about the characters, there’s way too many for a show this small. You want to know why? Because it’s a VN adaptation, that’s why there’s something like 10 characters all in the club room at any given time, 24 characters over the entirety of the show, that’s way too fucking many for a 24 episode show, especially when you’re trying to tell the backstory to one of the main characters but keep cutting back to the side characters because hey, club members are important. Now take everything I just said about the characters and accept it when I say that the main characters aren’t that bad, not as bad as you’d think they’d be for a VN adaptation of a rom-com, speaking of mains.Yuuki Oojima: The main guy of the show and the one running for the presidency.Satsuki Shinonome: Yuuki’s biggest opponent for the chair and not the biggest asshole of the show.Chisato Sumiyoshi: Childhood bestie to Yuuki and the one who is mildly damaged to say the least.Michiru Morishita: Let’s say she’s ‘loyal’ to a particular someone and the pandering character.There are other characters listed as main on MAL but these are the one’s you’ll be spending most of the show with, and again they’re not as unbearable as you’d think. And don’t even bother getting invested in any of the romance, because it doesn’t get any sort of conclusion.The Art & Sound (6/10) & (7/10): Considering this show came out in 2012 the art is pretty standard, everything isn’t eye gougingly bad, but it’s so standard to the point where the only real response I have for it is, “meh.” It’s not bad yet not great either.The sound is mostly the same across the board, the voice acting, OST, OP & ED, they’re all fine. “But you rated the sound higher than the art.” Yeah I did, because there’s a scene with a harmonica at the end that’s just so damn good, also the violin was exceptionally good.What do you think of this show?It’s not necessarily a horrible show, it just trips over itself towards the end.Would you recommend this show?If you’ve played the VN or want to kill some time yeah, otherwise nah you don’t really need to bother with this.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next. disbanded, and they think up that the best way to do this is to have the male lead run for president, because on the day a new president is founded they immediately get to allocate the budget for all the clubs instantly.

It...follows the happenings in a student-reigned school where the Studen Council basically reigns it like a small state.Story: 9/10If you have already read the synopsis, you know that the story is something fresh and new. Running for student council president normally is not part of the ideal Anime MC character, so it's interesting to see something new. Apart from this main plot a big part of the series is also the romances and relationships around the male MC, to an extent that sometimes almost make it seem like youre watching a harem series, but these are minor appearances. It is almost impossible to analyze the story without spoilering it all, but in the end, it fades out to have been a very complex storyline with important and diverse subplots, which make the biggest of the good part of the series. I would have given a 10 if it werent for some unnecessary exaggerations, but its still good. You will never be annoyed or not pleasantly surprised.Art: 8/10The art is nothing special, but good nonetheless. Sentai Filmworks is a good studio and clearly lives up to the expectations. Sadly, I only gave an 8 because of often very unnecessary and out of place fanservice, which mostly just ruined the scene. Nothing to complain about the art though, the girls are diverse and beautiful, animation is well done.Sound: 10/10The OP isnt generic but still awesome. ED is extremely fitting to the vibe that the episodes emit, well chosen. ANd the background music is just perfect. I have seen few anime whose background sound was just so perfect, especially when there are so many different styles to chose music from, since the story subplots are so different. The voices are mostly very good.Character: 10/10This anime does not at all have your generic dere-character types. Most characters appear to have so in the beginning though, but then receive decent to great parts of character development which explains their diverse and unique characters to the viewer. The way they act appears very realistic and understandable because of their characters. The life crisis and psychologial problems of the single persons are also well executed. It creates a remaining bond to the viewer which makes this show so good.Enjoyment: 9/10Coupled with an complex and intriguing story, excellent character portrayal and well executed comedy scenes here and there makes this show extremely enjoyable. After overcoming my post anime depression of binge-finishing this series yesterday I still think its awesome and heavily underrated. Everyone who watches this will be pleased by the diverse storyline and the appealing circumstances. Its worth watching this, believe me.Overall: 9/10If it werent for the sometimes out of place scenes - as mentioned before - I would have given this show a 10. It also is while realistic in some aspects, extremely unrealistic in some others. The displayal of childhood love, post-traumatic problems, teamwork and even touching important aspects of modern definition of democratic state systems, the show makes a staying impact on the viewer. This all coupled with good comedy really made this show for me.Forecast: There wont be a second season, since the story is more or less finished. There were some OVA's that add a lot to the romance and battling over Oujima's love, plus a whole bunch of fanservice - if youre a fan of that, go ahead and watch them.**This is my second review, so please keep that in mind.

It was funny, there was a little bit of romance, some drama between the main character Oojima and his childhood friend Chisato whose brother died at a young age.But at the eleventh episode things started to get way out of hand, it turned unrealistic and melodramatic, and I kind of sat there with a ""WTF"" face.Other than that it has a great story :)Art:Fantstic art, I loved everything about the art. The outfits were cool and I love how they draws the faces. The eyes remind of the characters...from Tsuritama and I think that\'s really cool.Sound:The opening theme is very pretty and matches the anime well, it\'s sort of peaceful like something you would fall asleep to, but at the same time it\'s kind of fast-paced.The ending is great as well.As for the character voices, they did a fantastic job on voices matching the characters, unlike some other animes I\'ve watched where they are completely off.Character:I think Oojima is awesome, he is fair, kind, and overall a nice guy.Chisato on the other hand is sometimes whiny and confusing. I liked her a bunch, but sometimes I just wanted her to shut up and stop complaining and being so clingy.Another character, the last President at the highschool almost never opens his eyes. And usually in animes like Gin in Bleach or Lao from Kuroshitsuji, I don\'t mind and it matches their character, but for some reason every time I saw this characer it really made me mad that he always kept his eyes closed apart from a couple of occasions.Enjoyment:Other than the big melodramatic climax where I was seriously wondering why it was so dramatic when it was only highschool, I enjoyed it very much. Especially the green haired club memeber, Yume, who was a great comedic relief from all the drama and always tried to get with Oojima and made \'Yaoi Sticks.\'Overall:Even with the pretty strange storyline and dramatic scenes that shouldn\'t have been so dramatic and some unexplained envents, this anime was pretty cute and if you\'re a fan of harem or romance animes you should watch it. from Tsuritama and I think that\'s really cool.Sound:The opening theme is very pretty and matches the anime well, it\'s sort of peaceful like something you would fall asleep to, but at the same time it\'s kind of fast-paced.The ending is great as well.As for the character voices, they did a fantastic job on voices matching the characters, unlike some other animes I\'ve watched where they are completely off.Character:I think Oojima is awesome, he is fair, kind, and overall a nice guy.Chisato on the other hand is sometimes whiny and confusing.

When you put too much stuff into one thing, it never ends well.Story 6/10: This series is a drama, I do like dramas but the drama presented in this show is almost laughable, like a really bad soap opera. At the beginning of the show they show you some kind of car accident, which is interesting, but that is actually not what the show is about. Instead, you are presented with the story of a boy who runs for student body president to save his club from being cut. Ok, I'll go with...that. But as the show goes on, the plot gets way over-complicated. There is some random bullying, super-secret stuff, suspicious alliances, secret hospital visits, traumatic experiences, weird backstories, a strange aversion to chocolate, and a season finale that is so ridiculous you would never guess it. It will leave you asking yourself, what happened to the simple story of a kid running for president to save his club?Art 7/10: Not too shabby if you ask me.Sound 8/10: Can't complain about the music either, opening song is pretty catchy the ending song is pretty.Character 6/10: I don't think the characters were all that well-done. Most of the characters didn't really have any depth to them. Some did have potential but they didn't quite cut it, at least not for me anyway. The main girl, Chisato, I just kind of thought she was crazy, and she was supposed to be the character with depth. Also her relationship between her and Oojima seems pretty forced, I actually was more interested in the relationship between Mouri and Kana, for some reason, even though they were supporting characters. The other characters, particularly the girls, bothered me. The page for the show doesn't say that it's harem, but that is the vibe I got from this show. Oojima is basically surrounded by a bunch of girls, most of which fight over him! Even a guy character (Yume) has a thing for him! By the way that Yume guy constantly flirts with Oojima, at first I thought he was just trying to be funny but then I realized he was serious. I was mad, the characters could have been so much better.Enjoyment 6/10: I mean the show is ok, and will entertain you for a while with it's ridiculousness, but I just felt that it fell a little short of what it could have been. Also, the page doesn't really say it is ecchi either, which I guess technically it isn't, but I kind of got a weird ecchi vibe off of this show.Overall 6/10: This show kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.

Also, the page doesn't really say it is ecchi either, which I guess technically it isn't, but I kind of got a weird ecchi vibe off of this show.Overall 6/10: This show kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.

This isn't a detailed review, so if you're looking for one just skip this. However, if you're reading this review, wondering whether or not you should watch this show, I'm hoping that I can get you to ease your mind and give this show a chance.Story= 8The story wasn't anything special, but it was very enjoyable in my opinion. I failed to understand why winning the school election was so important that the antagonists would do what they were doing, which is the only thing that bothered me. However, I never found myself bored watching this...show.Art = 8The art wasn't amazing, but it's very difficult to give a 2012 anime anything less than an 8 unless if the art bothered me. Very close to giving it a 7, but I felt that it wouldn't be doing the show justice.Sound = 7The sound was good. It never really made any impact on me. The only reason I'm not giving this show a 6 in the sound department is because a certain character's harmonica playing made me actually want to buy a harmonica.Characters = 8The characters were great. I felt that certain characters needed more show time and revelations, but I don't think it would've been possible with the shows limited time. I feel that the main characters had great background stories to them.Enjoyment = 8Like what I have stated in the beginning, this show doesn't deserve its low score.

But when you start seeing the depth to the characters and when the story starts to develop, you really start to see that this apparently cute and funny anime is more than just about saving a school snack club.Story: 8/10The plot is pretty standard, Yuki being an ordinary guy (whose only good trait is that he's good at baking lol) running for school president to save his club; and...the story focuses on how he rises to that challenge. Whilst the main story might be simple, I think the other characters really add to the drama of the series and make the elections super fun to watch. There are hints of romance between pretty much every character and Yuki (even the only other guy in the snack club is in love with Yuki), and it's just hilarious to watch how Yuki reacts to it.Character: 7/10Although I honestly did not like Yuki's character at the beginning of the anime (he seemed so lost and dependent), as I followed Yuki's journey through the election process and his interactions with all the different characters, I could see him grow into a character with more definition and purpose, which made me like the anime even more. Overall, I just really enjoyed the concept of the story and discovering more about all the characters, particularly because even the supporting characters in the club and some of Yuki's rivals in the elections are well showcased and important to the story.Art: 9/10I think the art in this show is typically girly, and the characters all look very cute, which for me is important when I watch this type of anime (if the anime is supposed to be cute/funny, I prefer cute-looking characters). Plus, Chisato (the president of the snack club) is sooo pretty!Sound: 8/10Didn't really pay much attention here, but the mood/music was fine the whole way through.Overall Enjoyment: 7/10I think the winning part about this story is that in one episode, I'll be laughing my head off over the silly things that the club members do in order to get votes for Yuki, but in the next episode, I'll be sympathising with the same characters and their background stories. This mix of emotions as a result of the characters and plot is what makes me think this anime is worth a watch.For those people who like watching or have experienced some sort of election process, for those people who like light-hearted shows with slightly bitter-sweet undertones and for those of you who like harem-style anime, I'm sure you will end up liking this show, so definitely give it a try! the story focuses on how he rises to that challenge.

It may seem light and funny at firtst, but towards the second half it gets more serious in a really enjoyable way.What I liked about this anime:- The character development was really well handled for most characters. I would say it is the main thing going on in this anime.- The humour and drama were well balanced. It started off as nice and made me laugh sometimes, but once the drama started to kick in it got me really interested.- The slow development at first...(I would say nothing really happens before the second half) made me care about the characters and want to know more. It may not be an action-packed anime from start to end, but you actually care about what happens later on the story, something some animes lack.What I disliked about the anime:- It started off with a really slow pace to be replaced by episodes full of action and I felt like that part was rushed. This anime should have had 25 episodes to really tell the story well- Because it is so short, some things like a deeper look in the main character's past were overlooked and I would have liked to know more. There are a lot of great characters in this anime and it's a shame we couldn't learn more about them.- There was some fanservice in this serie and I feel like it didn't need to have it. It was kept to a minimal though.Overall: I really enjoyed this anime. I found it didn't go deep enough for some parts because of its shortness, but other than that it was really fun.

Generic protagonist with a generic character design who somehow manages to make all of the girls horny for him, stereotypical female characters with childish personalities, dumb excuses for fan-service, failed attempts at comedy… And despite that, I’m still going to write a review to explain in detail why this anime is terrible.--- The premiseThe protagonist and his friends are all members of the “food research...club”, a useless club where they do nothing but eat food at the expense of their high school’s budget. Enters a girl whom I will refer to as “serious girl”, because who cares about the names of stereotypes. Serious girl is a candidate in the election for the next student council presidency, and she wants to reform the high school and disband all of the useless clubs including the “food research club”. To save his club, the protagonist has no choice but to run as a candidate for the election and win it. But as it turns out, the electoral campaign is just a bad excuse for the usual visual novel crap of learning about various girls’ backgrounds and traumas.--- High school politicsThe whole high school politics thing is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. After a few episodes we are told that the high school is actually its own little nation composed exclusively of students, with the student council being its government, and as such there are elections, electoral campaigns, budgets, manifestos, reforms, bribes, conspiracies and even spies… Goddamn it, this is high school, a place where people aren’t older than 18. On top of that most of the characters don’t act mature at all, they act like children rather than people who are supposed to participate in politics. In such conditions, how can you take this seriously? And yes, it is supposed to be serious, at least most of the time. There are even murder attempts and abductions for political motives. There are some moments where it tries to be satirical, but it just ends up being unfunny.In their electoral campaign, the “food research club” gets advice from the current student council president. He explains them how campaigning works, which could have been interesting. But it turns out that to win an election you just need pretty girls politely asking guys to vote for you, along with cosplaying and yaoi role-playing in front of horny girls. Media apparatus? Why would we need that?--- Standard visual novel stuffThis is what the show is actually about. After a few episodes the show starts diving into the girls’ personal problems and traumas, one girl at the time. The vast majority of adaptations of visual novels do that, as they try to glue together all the character-specific arcs (“routes”) in one story. Every character-specific arc finishes when said character’s personal problems have been fixed by the intervention of the protagonist, after some boring flashback involving childhood traumas, childhood promises and the like. But the problem is that since the series is only 12 episodes long, character-specific arcs are rushed. Hard to care about characters when their character arcs are wrapped up in less than two episodes. Hard to care about characters who barely even appear on the screen before the time for their character arc has come.As in any visual novel, the “comedy” is childish. It is irritating rather than funny. There are also dumb excuses for fan-service like showing panties and thighs (le funny camera angle has arrived), groping boobs and... sniffing armpits.--- The characters are all stereotypes… stereotypes such as the “kuudere”, the “tsundere” childhood friend, the serious girl, the not very serious teacher who drinks a lot of beer (how uncharacteristic!), the energetic (energetic meaning annoying) short girl, the gay dude who is constantly sexually harassing the protagonist, et cetera. Yes, the only gay character is a sexual harasser who can’t help but remind that he’s gay (“yaoi sticks”, “I’ll take the bottom” [emphasis on “bottom”, in case you didn’t get the allusion]) and wants to have sexual intercourse with the protagonist every five minutes: “You were so cool I almost came”, “his body already belongs to me”… bruv calm down your hormones. Seriously, there are “jokes” like these in almost every episode, sometimes several times. It’s not fucking funny. It’s just sexual harassment on top of being homophobic since it’s picturing gay people as harassers.The characters’ motivations? They are dumb. The whole anime is about preventing a useless club from disbandment, so that the club members can keep hanging out and eating food in the club room, when they could be hanging out in the cafeteria or after school like everyone else! How is the viewer supposed to root for them when they have such stupid motives? And why would the teacher help them?By the way there are also too many characters to remember about. There are eight members in the “food research club” and two of them are clones of each other. Not only this, most characters all look the same, with hair color and haircut being the only way to tell them apart.The serious girl may be the only decent female character – by decent I mean not utter shit – since she has a reasonable objective, and is not childish or overly cute. But she alone can’t save the show.--- Average visual novel protagonistThe protagonist has a generic character design seen hundreds of times in recent anime and visual novels. Take any visual novel made in the last ten years, there’s a 90% chance that it’s the same character design. What about his personality then? He’s a visual novel protagonist, what do you expect?   He has no charisma, no personality, he is lazy and passive. He does practically nothing on his own, most of the time he is forced by other people to do things. Despite that, all of the girls around him – his teacher included – want his dong, but of course he doesn’t do anything about it. He helps cute girls because he wants to bang them and says that he likes bumping into pretty girls, but he doesn’t notice his childhood friend who is basically throwing herself at him. In short, he is a terrible protagonist that you can only hate.--- The romanceThis anime is an adaptation of a visual novel of the dating simulator type and as such, its main purpose is romance (and the H-scenes, of course!). Since the characters are utter garbage, it comes as no surprise that the romance between these characters is also of low quality. The worst thing is that the plot-writers didn’t even pick the best – or should I say “least worst” – girl and went for the psychologically deranged one instead.--- Not saved by the production valueThough there aren’t any big face inconsistencies or things like that, the animation isn’t great. I have already mentioned how generic the character designs are. The art-style is not ugly but pretty unoriginal. It reminds me of Katawa Shoujo, you know, that visual novel where you bang disabled girls. The backgrounds look like your typical soulless visual novel backgrounds, but less detailed. Some don’t look good and are very basic. Ugly CGI is also used for cars, machines and moving objects.On the sound department, it’s even worse. The background music is standard visual novel stuff. It is not very well placed, and doesn’t always fit the situation. The voice-acting is exaggerated. Most female characters have irritating high-pitched voices, making them even more annoying. The opening is generic and deserves to be skipped.--- VerdictThis is a very bad anime series. The story is standard dating simulator bull-crap mixed with high school politics that you can’t possibly take seriously. The characters are stereotypical and annoying, the protagonist in particular.

I\'ll give you the rundown.It has so much going on all at once, in fact, I would argue too much going on. They rushed a 24-26 ep anime into 12 episodes. All the romance and drama elements were done extremely well, but they didn\'t have enough time to formulate. Also, they created too many ""potential"" love interests. It was like they wanted it to have the sense of a harem but it was clearly not happening. There were too many tragic backstories in too short a period of time....I\'ll reiterate, the characters are well designed and their stories worth telling but the stories are all chucked in the middle of the anime and are half-forgotten by the time the main story is put into action. This could\'ve been much better if given more time to actually appreciate each individual character and their depth. I will say that the way the tied together many of their backstories into what was going on was pretty well done but AGAIN, NEEDS MORE TIME.TL;DR Characters and Story have depth and are done well but aren\'t given enough time to fully develop.

This anime however, has already met many of my 'criteria' to keep me coming back. In this case, i think i'll have this serve as a prediction, or educated guess if you will, of things to come. So far, i've observed the following:1. A mysterious event, resulting in murder2. Modern Japan3. The protagonist being woken up by his female childhood friend in bed with him4. A high school5. Schoolgirls6. Panty-shots (censored, so not ideal, but dvd's will remedy that)7. A random...hot looking teacher that begins the school day by drinking beer in front of students, and proclaiming 'if it was a problem, they'd have fired me by now'8.

The anime in itself is about a couple of students trying to save their beloved club. Their ""Food club"" was going to be disbanded because they didn\'t get any achievements done and therefor wasted the schoolfunds. Oojima Yuuki and his friends wants to prevent this from happening, so they decide to enter the school president election.Coming this far into the plot i just thought...it was gonna be your average typical school/slice of life anime, but boy i was wrong! When the drama kicked in i got so hooked and excited i almost fell out my chair. I wont spoil anything from here, but you will understand me after you watch it. The drama is so intense, and filled with emotions. I marathoned the entire thing, spent an entire day watching all of the episodes because of this. It\'s been a long time since an anime got me on the hook like this. It\'s really something special, and differs a bit from other animes(Atleast what i can tell from my experience).Summing it up, the story is really really awesome and truly admirable, and if you ask me, it has a lot of aspects for those who enjoy romane/drama. But give it a few episodes, because it starts kinda sloppy. Trust me, it\'s worth it.Characters: The character development was really something. the character background was really good. Yuuki and his childhood friend Chisato go back to a certain accident that kinda traumatized Chisato, i wont go further than that. A bit of a dark past, and it\'s really something to see them develop through the show, and how they get past all these obstacles to find harmony. As for the other characters, there\'s quite a detailed background for most of them, but not as much as with Yuuki and Chisato.With all the mixed characters that has so different personalities i really think you will enjoy getting yourself indulged in all of it, there\'s even a pentako, extra cuteness points!Art: Well i\'m not an expert, but i thought the animation was good, i felt like i didn\'t need to get used to it, because some animes requires that you get used to the not so good animation, well it depends on how you like it. But i enjoyed it and it felt like it didn\'t need many improvements at all.Sound: I liked it, the voice actors were good, the sound effects on certain objects were completely in sync and sounded cool, and the interaction between characters had no sound problem at all(referring to when someone for example grabbes another person or such.)Enjoyment/Overall: This anime is really underrated, i dont understand why, because i loved it. This anime is definetly one of my favorites, it had many things i look for in an anime. It had a lot of romance, and when you combine that with the drama, it\'s really intense and really interesting. As i said before, i haven\'t been this excited about an anime for a long time, so i really hope you take your time and watch it.Well that about concludes my review, i hope you found it helpful and i also hope you enjoy this anime. thanks for reading! it was gonna be your average typical school/slice of life anime, but boy i was wrong!

Both were written by Sprite.  And both are fairly enjoyable.Now, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate, a.k.a Love, elections and chocolate.  As the title suggests, all three things are involved in this show.  But they all seem to conflict each other.  There is no love in politics, and it\'s definitely not sweet. (Unless it\'s dark chocolate). So how can this work?Very simply, it\'s an adaptation of a VN, so it will work itself out somehow.  And trust me, IT works.  I\'m about to...watch it again, for the 4th time.Story.  THERE IS A PLOT!!!  And no, not ""plot"".  You can actually take this show seriously and still enjoy it as much as you want.  It has quite an original plot despite it\'s insanely common setting, a high school.  What do you do when something precious to you is about to be taken away from your everyday life?  Naturally, you\'d fight and protect it as much as you can.  And following the anime tradition, this show does not hesitate.  And the drama involved definitely enhances this show a lot.  And there is something for everyone in this show.Art.  Fairly simple, but effective.  Not like moe or Love Live like.  Just simple.  Kinda like SAO, but simpler.Sound.  If you\'ve read my Ao no Kanata review, then it\'ll be more or less the same.  This show was adapted from a VN, and naturally, it would re-use its osts from the VN itself.  And there\'s no problem.  It has heart-breaking osts, cheerful osts, calm but happy ones.  The lot.  (Annoyingly, they don\'t exist any more on Youtube)Characters.  Again, very VN tradition.  The childhood friend with a scar, the one out of your reach by will some how make its way, the quiet one and the friendly one.  I like them all.  But they\'re not very memorable characters, which is a bit disappointing.  Like, when you watch it, you will have your favourite, but when you finish the show, they tend to fade away.  Other than that, they are very unique and well designed characters.Enjoyment.  Very enjoyable, but it\'s like a B-list / C-list celebrity.  You know they exist, they are very good actors/ actresses, but no matter how they try, they can\'t jump out of that pool.  That\'s what this show is like.  Maybe it has something with the plot/characters/art.  I don\'t know.  But it will be the best show in its class.You can compare this with, maybe Nisekoi, but ultimately, Nisekoi is the A-list celeb, so that will get noticed before this does.  But if you comapre this to like, maybe Rakudai Kishi, then it stands a chance in being the superior anime.  (In terms of plot, not ""plot"")And again, this show can be taken seriously or light-heartedly, which is one reasons why I love this show.Overall, it is possibly the best VN adapted anime in its class.  Very cool plot, fair art, fantastic sound, great characters and very good fun.  And I would recommend people to watch it.

At the beginning, this anime seemed to be a typical boring slice of life anime with a stupid plot, but actually turned out to be an interesting show to the point I felt the need to right this review. Reason I write reviews is for the people out there like me who are indecisive about starting a show and wasting 4 hours of their lives without knowing the potential of whether it's good or not because ratings can be deceiving. Well let me tell you, it's not a bad show, very different than...any other school drama, and in my honest opinion worth a watch. I'm surprised no one compared this to an anime version or House of Cards. It's basically the political aspect of the show with a lighter anime tone to it. My only wish was that the ending was a little more fulfilling I guess? is the best way I could put it, but that's just me personally. any other school drama, and in my honest opinion worth a watch.

However, like any anime derived from a ""route"" system, none of the girls ever are fleshed out in their entirety. This has come to be expected from a 12 episode series but even with the episode restriction, the plot and interrelations come off as convoluted and unwarranted. While for a choice few main characters, it...is hard to pinpoint why Oojima is a likeable person besides him being shown as caring, charismatic, and driven by his ideals. As a show that attempts to take itself seriously, Oojima\'s appeal does not make itself apparent with each girl and as a result makes it difficult to be emotionally invested into the character. Many shows can make the main character appear to be powerful and attractive beyond belief as the reason for their harem, but as a show with an emphasis on the character\'s believable personalities, the show definitely falls short.The short\'s elections element is proven to be interesting and unique to separate this show from the pack. The elections and its backstory try to emulate real political strife with underhanded tactics within a show focusing on a boy scoring quite a few ladies. Here, Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is just as laughable as it sounds in that regard, with the dark tones and gritty story failing to leave an impact on the audience if we see the main character both trying to stop the corruption within the student governing body as well as make more ladies that he can count fall for him. Not to say that a innocent looking show cannot exemplify dark or more mature themes but the manner in which Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate does this is poor at best.Finally Chocolate is meant to display Oojima\'s relationship with Sumiyoshi (Chisato) and how he tackles his identity and relationship with her throughout the story. Cliche as it is, I felt that this portion of the story was honest and quite well done comparative to the rest of the story. It is a shame that some of the gem within the anime were overshadowed by the comically bad mis-mash of story arcs.Art: 7AIC build produces yet another well made artwork reminiscent of what they had produced in Oreimo and Haganai. Although the art was well done, it was uninspired and unoriginal with no redeeming value besides aesthetic. I cannot distinguish this anime for many others I have seen which is not helping in Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate\'s case in becoming an anime that breaks the norm.Sound: 6The ambient soundtrack proves to be fitting and true to the scene with nothing appearing out of place. The lyrical portions sang during emotional events in the story were able to pull heartstrings however briefly before they appeared forgettable. Many of the failings in the sound department were due to the joke of a storyline, for which it sadly takes damage for.Characters: 5Character Archetypes are cliche as your usual harem style anime.Oojima is remarkably adept and self aware but his role in the story makes him appear jarring as his switches from one female character route to another. I can however speak to his integrity as a character, which proves above average for the usual male main character.On the other hand the female characters all are predictable and overdone, coming at exactly face value. What you see is what you get.Sumiyoshi, Chisato: Needy Childhood Friend who faces the future of her relationship with main characterShinonome, Satsuki: Proud Confident President to beMorishita, Michiru: Standard Moe Character who has an edgy streakKiba, Mifuyu: Strong silent type who struggles with her feelingsShinonome, Hazuki: Drunk and wild teacher (A teacher we never had growing up)Aomi, Isara: Kind girl with a golden heart.If character can be described so easily in an anime where the story tries to be serious, your characters have failed to be immersive and make it even harder to empathize with when they only have one memorable trait.Enjoyment: 4Honestly speaking, quite awful. I feel that if either the story chose to be a gritty school government thriller (hard to do but can be pulled off) or a usual school harem, it would have been a good anime. Nothing likely to rise to greatness but would definitely make it a diamond in the rough. The story, characters, and media translation all had a few positive points, but they were barely enough to keep me watching, much less entertained.Overall: 5Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is a story that tries to have it all, but in the end has nothing. If you choose to watch this anime, try to take the story as seriously as you can (and hold in the laughs when the tension becomes comical) and try to enjoy the few things it gets right. If you expectations are not held too high, the lovable nature of the food research club and its many members begin to rub off on you, and you cannot help to have a good time.Recommended?: NoRewatched?: No is hard to pinpoint why Oojima is a likeable person besides him being shown as caring, charismatic, and driven by his ideals.

Also, this is a spoiler-free review.I originally found this anime from a clip on YouTube. I thought it looked interesting, so I decided to pick it up. With a rating of 7.0, I was not expecting much. At first glance, I thought it was just another silly romantic comedy series. On the contrary, however, the series is actually much deeper than it appears.Story: 8/10In my opinion, the story in Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate was pretty good. As stated in the title, the...major aspects of the story include love, chocolate, and elections. Even though these aspects are not really correlated with each other, the series manages to tie them together to form an interesting story. Personally, I found the conflict intriguing. Although it starts off as a slice-of-life type of conflict, it turns into something much darker and serious. Furthermore, the serious and emotional scenes in the story caught me off guard. When I first saw this series, I was expecting most of the story to be comedic. There were, however, some scenes that were pretty sad and depressing. Also, unlike many of the anime I have watched, the ending of the series is satisfying.Even though I enjoyed the story, I did have a few issues with it. Firstly, the power of the school’s student body is very unrealistic. Even in a school with 6,000 students, the three committees that run the school should not have the power that they have. Not only do they seemingly have complete control over the school itself, but the committees also have power over other facilities in the city. Honestly, this kind of turned me off the plot. In addition to this, the story felt kind of rushed towards the end. Although the information presented in the last few episodes was necessary for the plot, many of the details that were provided only raised new questions. Certain concepts were never fully explained. Overall, however, I did enjoy the story.Art: 8/10Although other viewers may disagree, the art in the anime was great. It is not as beautiful as the art of some recent animes, however, considering it's a 2012 anime, I found the art pretty attractive. The characters were designed nicely, and the bright colors made each scene appealing. There were a few moments where a character's mouth did not move as they spoke, however, I had no other problems with the art.Sound: 7/10The voice actors in Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate were great. Each voice was clear and appropriate for a high school student. Unlike other animes that I have watched, there were no voices that annoyed me. With the exception of the talented voice actors, however, the sound in the series was pretty average. The soundtrack, opening songs, and ending songs were not terrible, but they were not memorable either.Characters: 5/10Out of all the parts of this series, the main issue that I have with it is the characters. For a series with only 12 episodes, I felt that too many characters were introduced. Most of these characters belong to the high school's Food Research Club, however, there are a few outside characters. Aside from the main characters, we are only given a little bit of information about the personalities and traits of the other characters. In my opinion, this was kind of a shame, as there were a few side characters that I wanted to know more about. As a result of this, there were some questions about the characters that were left unanswered. For example, Mifuyu’s feelings were never resolved. Also, the origins of the friendly relationship between Yuuki and his teacher are never fully explained.Enjoyment: 7/10Although there were a few issues with the story and characters, I did enjoy the plot. I enjoyed the smooth mix of serious/emotional scenes and comedic scenes. The role of chocolate in the story was also very interesting to me, as was the close relationship between the two main characters.Overall: 7/10According to MyAnimeList, a score of 7 represents a “good” series. I believe that this is an appropriate rating for Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate. Although many aspects of the anime seemed average, I did enjoy the series. The serious and dramatic scenes kept the story interesting, while the comedic scenes put a smile on my face. Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a romance series that is not too serious but not too comedic. major aspects of the story include love, chocolate, and elections.

So how can I talk about this anime, well one thing is that the anime is exactly as what you would expect from a romance, drama school life anime. Obvious love with the two main characters obvious melodrama and all that other shit. This anime was so far so good from episode 1, it made me think that this anime wouldn’t...be so bad, but was I so wrong. From episode 6 to episode 8 this anime fell flat, not flat like falling to the floor flat on its face but Blanc’s washboard chest flat. It had many moments that should have just been skipped over, leaving a dry taste on your mouth as thanks to the, oh so fast way it went to end all the problems.The story is very simple two childhood friends who have feelings for each other but some traumatic indecent is stopping them from realizing it. With a lot of side characters that are constantly around the main characters, but have had some episodes to explain more about their stories, but the producers decided that that was unessacary and just put stupid and unessacry episodes only developing them slightly. Many of the characters including the main and the side characters with not much of character development made me want to bitch slap most of them majority of the time.This anime story was so simple and could have been done easily, but they had to include complex and dark sinister plots into it. This anime includes the Prison School: School problems in it with the common happy fun times atmosphere. A school, where scandals, shady people and bargains and the crazy committees in this school group up.This anime tries too hard to make it seem like under all the happy daily school life is dark and dangerous activates are happening. Well this anime fails at it, in fact the anime does it so poorly that I no longer cared who was on the bad side or who was good all I cared about is Oojima is running for student council president. The opening was good as well as the ending. One of the reasons the anime fell flat was because it was trying to juggle with two main plots while it added another plot to it making it hard for them to balance it all out. One was Oojima running for student council president to save his club, and the relationship and tensions between Oojima and Chisato and the third was the fight between the student council committees. The anime was doing well  until this third plot came in and became another main plot, then the anime started to fall apart. It couldn’t handle it so they had to end the first and third plot as soon as possible, which made the plot with their relationship also fall apart. In fact it made the anime very bland and uninteresting. So yea pretty much this anime falls flat on its face due to the unessaceary plots and development. be so bad, but was I so wrong. From episode 6 to episode 8 this anime fell flat, not flat like falling to the floor flat on its face but Blanc’s washboard chest flat. It had many moments that should have just been skipped over, leaving a dry taste on your mouth as thanks to the, oh so fast way it went to end all the problems.The story is very simple two childhood friends who have feelings for each other but some traumatic indecent is stopping them from realizing it. With a lot of side characters that are constantly around the main characters, but have had some episodes to explain more about their stories, but the producers decided that that was unessacary and just put stupid and unessacry episodes only developing them slightly. Many of the characters including the main and the side characters with not much of character development made me want to bitch slap most of them majority of the time.This anime story was so simple and could have been done easily, but they had to include complex and dark sinister plots into it.

DUH DUH DUH, love, or rather several different loves, for one guy... YES A HAREM, HOW AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC, o but wait, you see this harem is different, the lucky and wonderful young man who is in the center of this harem, has actually..

(!Possible Spoilers!)Now this review is not going to be long. The anime is good, compared to other Romance Anime, this one actually reminds me of Golden Time. The Art was OK, I'm not an art expert, so take that with a grain of salt. The Sound was also OK, but I'm also not a sound/music expert. All the music fit in fine to me.The story is great. Romance, and an election. Kudos to the writer that pulled...this off. But this does not mean I agree with the story specifically in the anime. The anime was basically a mixture of the Satsuki Route in the beginning of the anime, and then it uses the Chisato route in the end of the anime. This confused me and I really hated that since they started off with Satsuki route (Best Grill).Now this is where I get mad. This is actually one of the few anime that adopt the Childhood Friend Route of the Visual Novel. But, I HATE Chisato. She has some sort of Physiological issues. After playing the VN, I can only support this claim more. If some of you were like me, and wanted a Yuuki x Satsuki, I highly recommend you play the Visual Novel.TL;DR: All in all the Anime Adaption was good, 6/10 for sure. I didn't like how they used the Satsuki route in the beginning of the anime, and ended with the Chisato Route. Chisato has some obvious issues. If the anime issues the Satsuki Route, 8/10 for sure! this off. But this does not mean I agree with the story specifically in the anime.

I really had a great time watching it!Overall score: 8', 'I\'m just going to start off by saying that this series, Love, Elections and Chocolate, is fairly underwhelming. I actually came in with normal romance expectations and came out a bit disappointed. I wasn\'t... satisfied. This series started off on a great note; Good characters, a somewhat unique twist on the slice of life genre, and some good and light-hearted comedy mixed in there. I\'d say starting around episode 10 is where it started to go downhill for me. Things were starting to get extremely ridiculous, to the point where I began feeling stressed out with this show because of what it was doing. Or,...I should say, what the characters were doing.Story: 7Love, Elections and Chocolate is about a club named the Food Research Club who\'s activities involve eating snacks, such as Yaoi Sticks. Enter main character, Oojima Yuuki. Not to be mistaken with Ooshima, Yuuki and his childhood friend, Chisato, are part of this Food Research Club, and devastating news arises as they learn that with the new presidential election for the Student Council, one candidate is deciding to cut the Food Research Club due to funds and pointless activities. Yuuki and the others will not stand for this! Thus, Yuuki is chosen by the clubs to run as Student Council President himself for the sole purpose of avoiding the loss of the Food Research Club. There you have it.Now, I have no issue with the basis of the plot whatsoever. None at all. I do have an issue, though, with how this election is portrayed. Understand that this is a Student Council Presidential Election, not an actual presidential election for the entire country. Students are running everything, only one teacher is in sight and she\'s a drunkard who slobs around in the Food Research Club all day! What could possibly happen? Apparently, students and the student council have much, MUCH more power than you\'d expect. This gets to the point where it\'s extremely ridiculous and kind of, well, stupid. Things like espionage, ""Governmental"" cover-ups on events that could negatively effect the president\'s campaign and impression, or even death threats involving hostages. Yes, this presidential campaign is taken to the extreme, despite the fact that it\'s all for the mere student council.This may make the show sound more exciting... but it\'s honestly not. Actually, it\'s more aggravating than anything. Why do the students have so much power over everything? Why are they the security for a hospital, believing they can control what nurses can and can\'t do there? Why didn\'t the main character call the police when a certain someone is taken hostage and he\'s being threatened with death by said kidnapper? The student council doesn\'t control the police too, right? Right? It\'s not like calling the police won\'t work on them because the student council has more power, and what they\'re doing isn\'t illegal, right? It\'s just... stupid. Why is it taken to such extremes and why isn\'t the police called when you can easily fix everything by doing so? It bothered me to the point where I just really didn\'t care what happened with the election anymore. I just wanted to see the romance, which in itself wasn\'t too satisfying either. There\'s almost no closure in the end whatsoever. It just kind of... ends. I can\'t say how it ends, obviously, but I\'ll tell you right now it was barely satisfying. And I\'m all for romance, too! Romance is one of my favorite genres! This show was great until the end. Really that\'s all I should have said. I have too many complaints about how ridiculous the measures taken in this story was. Let\'s move on.Art: 9The animation was great and the art style was extremely appealing. Honestly, the art is one of my favorite aspects of the show. It\'s smooth and detailed nicely. Emotional scenes, although there aren\'t many, are emphasized as they should be. Other than that there isn\'t much to say about it.Sound: 8Not really much to say here, either. The soundtrack was nice and fit well. I like cello and piano. It\'s a nice mix. Didn\'t care for the opening or ending, though, as they were kind of... bland. The main character\'s voice actor did an outstanding job, though, as he always does. (He\'s very recognizable... he did Kyousuke in Oreimo, Gray in Fairy Tail, and so on and so forth. He\'s great. That\'s all you need to know.)Character: 9This is one of the better aspects of the series. As you get a group of characters together for the main cast, you\'d at least hope they\'re all enjoyable. Really the only character I can point out is the main one, Oojima. He\'s not painfully dense, and he doesn\'t show a hint of denseness whatsoever. He actually shows romantic interest in certain girls and actually takes the chances he can get to get closer to them. He\'s not afraid to confront certain characters on issues, and he knows exactly what\'s wrong. He slapped a girl once and yelled at her about a certain issue. That was refreshing.The other characters range from fun to bland. The main love interest was cursed by trauma, afraid to eat chocolate and very attached to Oojima. I didn\'t really care for her, she didn\'t really have anything interesting going for her. Honestly, I liked Satsuki more, who was a rival candidate against Oojima. He spends a lot of time with her and her character development is much better than Chisato, who was the main love interest.Enjoyment: 7You already know my woes with the storyline. The extreme measures that are taken and the stupid choices the main character makes near the end. (Seriously man, get the damned police!) Though, for the first 9 and a half episodes I really enjoyed this series. The ending was O.K. but it needed more. I won\'t be watching the OVA seeing as it most likely doesn\'t continue the story and I didn\'t enjoy the series enough to really care for the OVA. I\'d say to just try it out. If you don\'t like it, fine. I want to tell you now, don\'t expect anything amazing. Don\'t expect the following;Emotional drama that is complicated (In a good way) and done very well as seen in shows like Toradora, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Golden Time, Honey and Clover, Hell, even Waiting in the Summer! I understand those are all J.C. Staff and this is not, but they\'ve basically set my standards for romances like this. And I have seen great romances that meet their levels by other companies, but J.C. Staff still does it best.Don\'t expect anything hilarious either. The humor is good but nothing more and nothing less.Again, just give it a shot. If you don\'t like it, fine by me. It honestly wasn\'t really worth watching, in my opinion, but I suppose I had a good time... most of the time. I am disappointed, but it certainly was a... different, experience and twist on the romantic comedy genre.

Okay yeah they didn\'t follow everything that happened in the VN and changed some of the events. But if they did follow exactly the same, i think it would hinder the pacing. So i understand why they feel the need to change some aspects. Too bad i didn\'t finish the game until the end considering i lost the game data and save file. Oh well i got pretty far though at least until just before the final election, or around 10 hours of gameplay,...in the anime it\'s equivalent  to around episode 9/10.Ok so maybe the story is kinda hard to catch to those who didn\'t play the game considering so many details they left out. But then there\'s a reason to play the game yourselves. Plus you get to see some H-sce-.Moving on[Story]IThe amount of plot conveniences in this anime is SO many. I\'m not gonna get into detail because that would lead to some spoilers. Some things just didn\'t make sense but that turned into the comedy aspect of this anime. Things like ""wtf how does that work lol"", so i don\'t mind little things like this.But the general story of a school, a prestigious school SO big, of over 6000 students (?), in one city, having an official fully fledged presidential campaign run by highschool students? Even one of the biggest Japanese highschools irl only has ±1800 students.Billions of yen run through this school and they entrust all that money to the students? a HIGHSCHOOL students in their teenage years handle that amount of money and handle the scale of the campaign? It\'s almost like Takafuji is not a highschool, but an entire town/nation.Not to mention the dark side of campaign like bribery, threatening, abduting, taking hostage, spies, even harming others to the point that they are hospitalized. All of that done by highschool students?Please correct me if i\'m wrong but this aspect doesn\'t make sense to me. But i still liked the story of an election. It\'s definitely not your typical romance anime.[Art]I feel like i talked too much in the story & adaptation aspect so i\'m, keeping the rest short. The art is not the best, but it does the job. Moving on.[Sound]Good sound, good op/ed. I noticed they add a lot of little sound effects like when the characters move their head, or their eye twitches. Kinda overdid it to be honest but meh. Didn\'t ruin the experience.[Character]Hmmm, i wanna talk about this part too, but it\'ll make this review too long. The character i feel like they are too focused on Chisato and Yuuki and didn\'t touch the other characters. So if you want to know about the others you\'ll have to play the game and get their route. They are all charming to say the least, and very lovable.[Overall Enjoyment]Hmm, this anime certainly made me smile. It has some fan service here and there but coming from a company that made an R-18 game, it\'s understandable. It\'s one of those anime where in the end you feel like you want to watch more. And the game do is there to do just that.All in all, i liked this anime and the game.

The dramatic situations simply do not work in most part of time. To be honest, works for me only once. Some characters are complexed without a good motives, or a really small motives, that are not enough to justify all this drama....If were just one more harem ecchi romance, would be better. Some good situations and characters were wasted.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate isn't terrible. In the end, its funnny. If were just one more harem ecchi romance, would be better. Some good situations and characters were wasted.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate isn't terrible. In the end, its funnny."", ""I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and after seeing how many users watched Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate I just had to watch it despite it's somewhat low rating. And to my surprise, I enjoyed this anime. It's based on a visual novel so I knew that with 12 episodes this anime would definitely feel very fast paced and I was right. The main flaw of this anime is just the fact that many details and relationships are really fast forwarded. We get introduced to many different characters and the anime spends maybe 10 minutes on them and we get introduced to another character.Story:...The story is about a school based on a democratic system that students are the ones who make the important decisions regarding budget, security, and etc. It's basically a tiny America within a school. And to go off on that, to put it simple the MC decides to run for president because his club will get shut down if he doesn't. The story premise is nothing out of the ordinary but it definitely is interesting because there are a lot of secrets within the school and as you progress through the story you find out what they are but other than that, I liked the relationship between the characters the most and I believe that is the strong point of this anime but I will discuss that more in the character section.Art: I'm not a fan of the big eyed character art, in fact I really hate it but the background art and just the setting makes me give this art a 7. The school is really pretty and ignoring the fact that they have big eyes, the art really isn't bad. It's not bad nor is it special in my opinion so I give it a solid 7.Sound: I really like the opening and ending. All the characters sound fine to me and nothing really nags me about the sound so I give it a solid 9.Character: Now the characters are what makes this anime special BUT we only really get to know maybe 2 characters really well in this anime. I enjoyed many of the side characters and wanted to know their whole back story but as I said before it's based on a visual novel so unfortunately they can only do so much in 12 episodes.Overall this anime isn't anything too special. If you like romance and a good ending this this anime is for you. Although I'm sad that they didn't make this anime adaptation follow the best girl route I still enjoyed it. It's a solid anime but no more than that. The story is about a school based on a democratic system that students are the ones who make the important decisions regarding budget, security, and etc. It's basically a tiny America within a school. And to go off on that, to put it simple the MC decides to run for president because his club will get shut down if he doesn't. The story premise is nothing out of the ordinary but it definitely is interesting because there are a lot of secrets within the school and as you progress through the story you find out what they are but other than that, I liked the relationship between the characters the most and I believe that is the strong point of this anime but I will discuss that more in the character section.Art: I'm not a fan of the big eyed character art, in fact I really hate it but the background art and just the setting makes me give this art a 7. The school is really pretty and ignoring the fact that they have big eyes, the art really isn't bad. It's not bad nor is it special in my opinion so I give it a solid 7.Sound: I really like the opening and ending. All the characters sound fine to me and nothing really nags me about the sound so I give it a solid 9.Character: Now the characters are what makes this anime special BUT we only really get to know maybe 2 characters really well in this anime. I enjoyed many of the side characters and wanted to know their whole back story but as I said before it's based on a visual novel so unfortunately they can only do so much in 12 episodes.Overall this anime isn't anything too special.

It's a solid anime but no more than that."", ""OK. After playing through the visual novel I decided to watch the anime.And I have to say. I was severely disappointed.If you like the characters after the first episode I'd HIGHLY recommend playing the VN instead.If you don't want to or don't have the time to go through all the routes, but want to experience the story that is in this anime I'd recommend to at least play through Chisato's, Satsuki's, and Michiru's routes(those are the top 3 routes in my opinion anyway (not in that order)) .The characters and just the plot itself is much better developed, built up, and explained.The anime is...pretty much just following a checklist of events and CG-s with not enough buildup and little to no emotional impact.It's still not a bad anime don't get me wrong. but instead of it being 7-8-9/10 (depending on the route) it's a 6 at best. pretty much just following a checklist of events and CG-s with not enough buildup and little to no emotional impact.It's still not a bad anime don't get me wrong. but instead of it being 7-8-9/10 (depending on the route) it's a 6 at best."", ""This is not anime that will set the world on fire. This is actually more of an anime that you watch to broaden your reference base. That 7.3 composite score should be an indicator of that. Figure out what you like or what you don't like. It's a filler show. Not every anime can be a Soul Eater or a Fullmetal Alchemist or a Familiar of Zero, a game-changer.Let me start with the characters:The main guy: Yuki Ojima is nothing special. He runs because he wants to keep his club from being shut down. Along the way, he learns some stuff, yadah, yadah, yadah.The...main girl: Chisato. Best friends since childhood with Ojima. Are you seeing anything familiar?The rest of the club fills out archetypes. You've got your small girl and your brainiac. (Who happen to be the same character.) The duo of comic relief. The older-sister type. The weirdo. The 'proper lady' who happens to be Ojima's running rival. The teacher that dotes on our main character. Etc.You're wondering why I gave the characters a 9 when they're all so generic. Because they strike a chord and resonant with the audience. It's the archetypes in motion as they're supposed to be done. Done well, and they can be satisfying to watch, even for a short span of 12 episodes. But the main engine is the interpersonal relationship between Chisato and Ojima, and well, you have to watch the show because if I were to say here, it would ruin the impact.The weakest element of this show is the story. It's not a very strong premise, but there are no loose ends. The sound is okay.Moving onto the animation...clearly there must have been a very small, very dedicated group of animators working on this show because while each frame individually looks gorgeous and well put together, the actual motion is disjointed. Often times, the only motion will be lip-flaps. But since this show isn't a big-budget action anime, it can get away with it. It's a unique characteristic of this show that I've never seen before.

Like the girls that he is around aren't annoying and i really like all them. The girls are kinda funny at...times and they all have some unique traits. Then the main guy character isnt just some pervert or annoying guy. He has a wonderful personality and he is really sweet/caring. Then he has a few funny moments as well and i just really like the male protagonist.Then the art work and sound of the story are both superb. In my opinion the art of a romance anime is pretty important and the sound that is played is great.In the end i really enjoyed this anime and it has became one of my favorites.

Especially when one needs to squeeze 4-5 haremettes into 13 episodes while managing a coherent plot. To get around the limited airtime, many series either focus on the individual haremette\'s tale making the show an character omnibus of sorts with a weak or non-existent central plot; or drive the story with the key conflict in the harem but in so, sacrificing much of the remaining cast. Both routes resulted in their share of rotting carcasses littered in the memory of harem history. Which was why I was so delighted to have stumbled upon KoiChoco.The premise of KoiChoco is, unsurprisingly,...the election which surprisingly grew with importance as the series progressed. While this would have crowded out the \'romance\' aspect in a lesser harem show, KoiChoco rises above other harem pretenders with excellent amalgamation of the central plot (election) with consistent character growth for almost all the haremettes. Such symbiosis of plot and character development allows for the simultaneous development of story and character giving the series a shot at a satisfactory closure for all story fronts. And KoiChoco is one such example of symbiotic writing.I came away marveling at how the key characters matured, overcame their romantic hurdles and generally became stronger/wiser people because of the election. The primary romance was also not comprised of the run-of-the-mill ""She loves you/he loves you not"" haremic-filibusters but a multi-faceted relationship with a tinge of darker elements. Despite juggling all that, I love how coherently the series was wrapped when the final credits rolled; even though it had become somewhat predictable - a small kink in an otherwise masterful storytelling.In conclusion, borrowing from the dessert reference in its title, KoiChoco is like a well-made fruitcake where the individual ingredients meld together to give an exquisite taste that is greater than the sum of its parts. A true gem amongst harem offerings. the election which surprisingly grew with importance as the series progressed.

Don\'t worry, there isn\'t a lot of stupid harem drama here. The MC is kinda bland so it;\'s hard to get behind the girls since it\'s hard to see what they see in this guy though. Thankfully you do see the relationship Yuuki (MC) and the girl he does pick in the end develops through the show.  Still, there\'s nothing too special about the love story here itself. Through the harem routes  in this show you also get...development for the different characters you probably would not have gotten otherwise which is kind of rare, and a big plus. The love drama is made even more complex/ intriguing as it\'s mixed in with the show\'s central conflict: SENKYO!Election:So I\'m sure you saw that this show has ""Election"" in it\'s title and if you read the synopsis you\'d know that there is, indeed, an election in this show, and it is the central driving force for most of the show\'s conflicts.  This is also the area where the show surprised me the most. Going into this show, I was just expecting a simple election where each candidate makes a simple speech and then ballets were submitted and the rest of the show would center around Yuuki\'s self journey through the short process . I was correct about the latter part but blown away at just how elaborate this election turned out to be! This election was like a miniature version of an election for a political office in a country. You had primaries, fundraising, bribing, scandals, and so much more, all being ran completely by high school students! This was insane and incredible at the same time! The political party analogies were awesome and the way the Food Research Club, the club our MC is trying to save by running , overcomes the odds stacked against them was really crazy and so fun. This is a full on game of strategic politics with each side having their own agenda- handled by high school students. Handled in a similar fashion to how real high schoolers would handle things.  You\'l find at least one character to love here, and the direct and satirical humor found here is some of the best.There is a bit of a suspenseful conflict thrown in at the end which isn\'t so realistic for high schoolers however it was still fun to watch through out, and got a bit motional toward the end too.ChocolateI can\'t say too much about this part because it\'s spoiler territory but how this chocolate is used in this story as a catalyst  to push the relationship between certain characters was very interesting and, -sigh- sweet. -Escorts self out the door now-  Through the chocolate and what it means to one of the characters,  you get a bit of psychological drama here and get into some dark and psychological themes which was pretty cool.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate takes all three of the things in it\'s title and blends them all together to give you a fun crazy heartfelt tale about a ragtag bunch of friends teaming up to stand up for what they believe in and earn what they want. You\'l encounter some surprises along the way too. The show has a slow start however it picks up gradually and you\'ll be glad you stuck with it by the end.Well that was my first review. It\'s format is a bit unconventional  . .. Hope you got something out of it. development for the different characters you probably would not have gotten otherwise which is kind of rare, and a big plus. The love drama is made even more complex/ intriguing as it\'s mixed in with the show\'s central conflict: SENKYO!Election:So I\'m sure you saw that this show has ""Election"" in it\'s title and if you read the synopsis you\'d know that there is, indeed, an election in this show, and it is the central driving force for most of the show\'s conflicts.  This is also the area where the show surprised me the most. Going into this show, I was just expecting a simple election where each candidate makes a simple speech and then ballets were submitted and the rest of the show would center around Yuuki\'s self journey through the short process . I was correct about the latter part but blown away at just how elaborate this election turned out to be! This election was like a miniature version of an election for a political office in a country. You had primaries, fundraising, bribing, scandals, and so much more, all being ran completely by high school students! This was insane and incredible at the same time! The political party analogies were awesome and the way the Food Research Club, the club our MC is trying to save by running , overcomes the odds stacked against them was really crazy and so fun. This is a full on game of strategic politics with each side having their own agenda- handled by high school students. Handled in a similar fashion to how real high schoolers would handle things.  You\'l find at least one character to love here, and the direct and satirical humor found here is some of the best.There is a bit of a suspenseful conflict thrown in at the end which isn\'t so realistic for high schoolers however it was still fun to watch through out, and got a bit motional toward the end too.ChocolateI can\'t say too much about this part because it\'s spoiler territory but how this chocolate is used in this story as a catalyst  to push the relationship between certain characters was very interesting and, -sigh- sweet. -Escorts self out the door now-  Through the chocolate and what it means to one of the characters,  you get a bit of psychological drama here and get into some dark and psychological themes which was pretty cool.Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate takes all three of the things in it\'s title and blends them all together to give you a fun crazy heartfelt tale about a ragtag bunch of friends teaming up to stand up for what they believe in and earn what they want. You\'l encounter some surprises along the way too. The show has a slow start however it picks up gradually and you\'ll be glad you stuck with it by the end.Well that was my first review. It\'s format is a bit unconventional  . .. Hope you got something out of it.', 'What I thought I was watching was mediocre rom com where a guy does something to save their club and his friends along with it... But then.. I\'ll just tell you in the review so here we go..Story 8/10: So this \'rom com, slice of life\' series ended up turning into an Illuminati series of some sort to the end. I got very confused at some points in the series.. My main questions were like ""Why are they going through all this just so save a club where you taste food for fun? Why would anyone vote for these guys? When did this become so...confusing? It\'s looking like a james bond movie now? Where the hell did this person come from and who is he/she?"" Towards the end was like playing a game which you\'ve never played before and no one\'s explained the rules.. You never know what\'s going to happen. All together I thought the plot was good.. even though they were trying to save a food tasting club I still followed with it and still enjoyed it. I can see why they\'d want to save a club.. But a food tasting one? Who am I to judge right? Even though the plot got messy at sometimes I still found it enjoyable all together.Art 9/10: I enjoy art styles like these in animes and didn\'t really find anything that stood out as to painfully obvious to judge.Sound 9/10: Music and sound seemed to be in the right place and it all sounded good together.Character 9/10: I enjoyed these characters alot better than some of the other ones.. There wasn\'t constant arm waving at embarrassing/romantic moments, the MC wasn\'t to awkward with females, He even could of had a great harem.. Maybe one day >:) Overall characters were really fun to watch as it carried on.. I didn\'t really care much for their backstories as they seemed generic at sometimes though.Enjoyment 8/10: Enjoyed the series and would watch again.. I enjoyed some parts a little to much and it was a really nice watch altogether confusing? It\'s looking like a james bond movie now? Where the hell did this person come from and who is he/she?""

Compare it to real life and the results show that they look identical.The music is great, on comedic/relaxing scenes, a smooth violin melody brightens up the mood.

Its intricate plot, endearing characters, and stunning visuals make for a truly rewarding viewing experience."", ""Koi to Senkyo to Chcolate (Koichoco) is a feel-good save-the-club tale couched in a school election drama that follows independent underdog candidate Yuuki Oojima as he attempts to ascend to school president in order to stop the disbandment of the Food Research Club and other clubs like it. If you enjoy a good underdog story and a tale of a group of friends growing together to beat the odds, you'll enjoy Koichoco.One of the things Koichoco does well is that it gets the main story rolling quickly and stays focused on that story early on without distracting or interrupting itself with too many subplots. This...does eventually happen, to some extent, but it's rather minimal compared to other visual novel works. The nice thing is that we quickly get a lay of the land in the first episode without wasting much time. We meet much of the cast, have our inciting incident, and explore the cast's camaraderie in the first episode without dawdling on excessive exposition.  Some other subplots do get started, but the series chooses to expound on those in the second half. Takafuji Private Academy has a somewhat... ridiculous student government with a lot of underhanded deals, conspiracy, and shady politicking, so there are instances and hints of this going on throughout the whole series. The show doesn't drop this all at once and keeps the puzzle pieces relatively light so there isn't an inordinate amount of things to keep track of and you can gradually figure out what's going on as the story progresses. The plot itself is paced well, at least for the first half (we'll get to the second half later) so we can always look forward to the efforts of our inteprid candidate.The nice thing about our MC is that he's definitely a guy you can root for. Yuuki's a bit of a fool, but not a complete buffoon and can stand on his own. The main guy in an underdog story should be likable, and Koichoco succeeds here. Yuuki does leave himself to the mercy of his surroundings and the other cast, but he has his own aspirations and isn't a complete pushover.Koichoco almost feels like a harem when it starts. However, while there are competing love interests, the good thing is that Koichoco doesn't keep circling around this for cheap laughs. The core cast of characters (including the members of the Food Research Club and some others in the school government) are recognizable and fill niches and archetypes much in the way other harem animes do. Different hair, different personalities, different idiosyncrasies... we've got the childhood friend, the quiet feline one, the mad scientist, the one with the mandatory boob envy, and even the drunkard club advisor. We've seen these types of characters before, and they're not particularly unique or memorable, but Koichoco does keeps them entertaining through their comedic interactions. The character interactions are also more fluid and organic instead of dedicating entire episodes to single characters. Artwise, Koichoco does look pretty flat, which makes for somewhat expressionless faces, but overall it is passable.Koichoco opens up a few dramatic threads in the first six episodes that eventually get resolved more completely in the final six episodes. Because Koichoco focuses a lot on the school election in the first half, it does end up having to take a break from the action to close these loose threads. This puts the election by the wayside and ends up compressing the pivotal final days of the election, which was pretty disappointing compared to what the series' first half set up. This tradeoff between fleshing out the characters and maintaining the intensity of the story was somewhat unfortunate but made for a more well-rounded cast and gave answers to the unanswered questions from the first six episodes. However, things did remain unanswered, and various oddities remained unexplored. One wonders what they could have done with more airtime, or whether they should have focused on the main election story given the 12 episodes they had. does eventually happen, to some extent, but it's rather minimal compared to other visual novel works.

I think this is the first anime that gave me headaches. I am a bit conflicted as to whether this is a nice or a bad anime. I guess it depends on your past experience. Or maybe its a marketing thing: a wrong ending to make us check the original source. If you wanna know what this anime is about, read the synopsis. I wont copy/paste it just to make the review feel bigger.Story: __. Well, this is the part that troubles me. I wont be able to go into specifics because spoilers. I loved this anime since first episode. Lots...of funny scenes. But also, here is where the ""weird"" part starts. As the story unfolds, you start to like this anime more and more. And at the same time you\'ll start feeling angry. You can\'t fully enjoy it because of the periodic brakes. Or at least thats how it went for me. And I think thats because they shipped the wrong girl. I would say that the story was oki for the most part. I mean the idea behind it. The pacing, too, for the most part. But if you try shipping a lousy girl, thats a no-no for me. What else? Its a story about mental trauma i guess. I\'m sure they meant it as a character\'s background, but c\'mon... Depending on the level of intensity you could say there are 7 characters having some kind of a mental distress. Sure, by the end all of them are ""cured"", but still..Art: 7. The visuals are oki, with the usual bright colors. The animation and the 3D spacing are a bit off (you know, like talking to the MC but the eyes are watching somewhere behind him), but it wont impact the viewing experience.Sound: 7. It was oki, I guess. The voice acting was pretty good. It delivered the scenes. I don\'t remember the OP or ED, but nothing out-of-place. I\'d say the average OP, ED, background musical pieces you\'d expect from this kind of anime.Character: 8. Apart from the annoying loli and the annoying tsundere childhood friend, the characters were pretty much oki. As a bonus, you even get a beer drinking hot young teacher. Or is it the extremely funny yaoi? Take your pick :) Even if the motives are retarded, the characters\' developments are well done. I may not agree with what they do, but I can understand where it comes from. And I\'d say thats an important trait.Enjoyment: 5. The story is really nice for the first eight episodes. Or nine, if you wanna include a panties-shot. I\'m saying ""nice"", but don\'t forget about the equally growing shit-storm for every passing episode. It helped me understand where that ""flipping table"" meme comes from.Overall: 3. It all boils down to your life experience: if you were in the same situation, then you\'ll click with its ending, you\'ll be rooting for them. Maybe. Eight nice episodes and then the pacing gets rushed, the story starts to fail, idiotic logic just for the sake of closing the plot.So: will you stop watching after 8 episodes? Then this is a nice anime. Are you the kind of person (like we all are) that needs to see it to the end? Too bad then.. Disappointment on the way. of funny scenes.

Disappointment on the way.', 'Let me start off with stating that i will be making this review as spoiler free as possible, i will be reviewing this in way for someone to read and get an idea whether they wish to watch the show or not.note: This anime is based on a game(Dating simulator)First off the story: In the very beginning we have a very basic structure, normal students that are spurred into action do to a shocking event that will ""rock their world"" or change something important to their life. As stated in the synopsis this event is the closing or threat of closing of their club named...the ""Food research club"". The Club amounts to a group of friends eating snacks of any kind for free at the schools expense. Logically it makes sense for it to be closed down. But for the sake of friendship and bonds and the like the Main character spurs into action to prevent this.Overall that sort of beginning is pretty generic and nothing overly special.  You can get a similar ""call to action"" from any anime within arm\'s reach.Progression of the story - Pacing wise the story seemed to get off its buns and start walking at a good pace, there was no needless time really wasted and all scenes and interactions show had some sort of meaning. Now On that same point, there are very important aspects of the story that are mentioned, ignored and then re-visited when it is their time. They are not built on, justifying this as ""behind the curtains"" events. BUT there is some redemption, i say some very loosely.Story Overall - It seemed interesting enough in the beginning and continued to offer good entertainment value, the story continues to a point where one could say it begins to shine and break tropes and normal storyline patterns, for me this was very refreshing. But the studio reminds us that this is a Dating sim and ultimately backtracks(somehow) to a very generic, expected and just unsatisfying ending. The story also has its twists that come out of no where but are expected simply because when everything is going great, something needs to ruin the party. BUT if you are thinking of not watching it because of what you just read. WAIT.Characters - This is what makes this show more entertaining, a specific cast of characters(and a specific number of them) that fit their role. They say the actor makes the play and this holds true for this show, the plot being what it is becomes MUCH better because of who is in the roles.Characters by name: Brief overviewYuuki Oojima(Ooshima -> in show run on joke) - This is the main protagonist. As if by law this story starts with him in his club with nothing but pretty cute girls(and on guy who is obsessed with making him eat his ""yaoi stick"" which is a snack product he made, more on this later) As a character he comes of in the beginning as very normal,polite and kindhearted BUT what sets him apart is that when push comes to shove, unlike most Main characters he SHOVES back. He has a backbone and grit not seen very often. This trait is seen in many aspects of the show as it continues. The studio screws him over though and him take the fall for their choice, i will not elaborate on how or why but my advice is remember him as who he was not for who he became/how he ended.Chisato Sumiyoshi - This character is the MC(Main character)\'s childhood friend, we see early on that they stick together like glue, although you can see early on the Main character is independent of her but not vice versa(this will develop into something i personally loved about this show)  She follows the mold of her character to the T, annoying, needy but with a twist of having a trauma that dictates most of her actions(apparently). My issue with the twist is that is doesn\'t effect her character at ALL until suddenly it becomes like a plague. one second normal then BAM. Not a fan of this or her character because she was very forced and scripted, unnatural and it seemed like she was just a cut out. This is the main female lead.Satsuki Shinonome - This character is the most redeeming character in the animated show and not because of character design, if that was a criteria the aforementioned childhood friend could fight for best character but she is ranked very lowly.  As a character with a story she is well written, i wouldn\'t go so far to say superbly written but you can feel authenticity from her and her actions. She an important member of the school council and also a rival for the protagonist who is running for president. This could lead to very cliched moments of ""you are my enemy but you have shown me the error of my ways"" but those never happened and not because the protagonist didn\'t try but because the character stayed firm on her ideals. The development of her character did feel slightly off but her personally overall makes up for it. I also can\'t claim that she is generic or cut out since she has her unique points unlike many of the other characters. She strangely enough receives the MOST legitimate development in the series. Unlike the forced development other characters get.All the other female characters recieve very little exposition and have other minor details that are added in for a few shots to give a way for the plot to advance. Specifically coincidences like OH this and this because of that person. I would write about them but they receive very little screen time or noteworthy backgrounds, mostly acting as comedic relief for the audience and gears to keep things going.Art: The art was very normal, nothing special, as well as the animation, very basic and some places looked rough, some places had bad frames but it was run of the mill and normal. The opening animation was enjoyable to watch but again the animation or drawing was nothing special.Sound: The sound is very easy to miss, in fact if you aren\'t paying attention you will not catch any of the music actively. For this reason i can say the sound was subpar because it did not compliment the show but rather stuck in the far background . Almost as if the studio was like ""well...music needs to be in anime for ambiance i guess..."" And threw something out there.Enjoyment - It was fun to watch which is whats important, the interactions were interesting, again nothing outstanding or unique but they will give you your laugh or moments of WTF face as you fail to comprehend the foolishness of the situation. For better or for worse...Overall - i give it a solid 6 fair rating, i think rating it any lower would be brutal and undeserved. It did its job, it entertained me. They made bad decisions on where to take the story in my opinion but just because my own wishes were not met does not mean i will rate it lower. This show could have earned a much higher rating if not for the few final episodes where everything quite literally flipped on itself. the ""Food research club"". The Club amounts to a group of friends eating snacks of any kind for free at the schools expense. Logically it makes sense for it to be closed down.

They are not built on, justifying this as ""behind the curtains"" events. BUT there is some redemption, i say some very loosely.Story Overall - It seemed interesting enough in the beginning and continued to offer good entertainment value, the story continues to a point where one could say it begins to shine and break tropes and normal storyline patterns, for me this was very refreshing. But the studio reminds us that this is a Dating sim and ultimately backtracks(somehow) to a very generic, expected and just unsatisfying ending. The story also has its twists that come out of no where but are expected simply because when everything is going great, something needs to ruin the party. BUT if you are thinking of not watching it because of what you just read. WAIT.Characters - This is what makes this show more entertaining, a specific cast of characters(and a specific number of them) that fit their role. They say the actor makes the play and this holds true for this show, the plot being what it is becomes MUCH better because of who is in the roles.Characters by name: Brief overviewYuuki Oojima(Ooshima -> in show run on joke) - This is the main protagonist. As if by law this story starts with him in his club with nothing but pretty cute girls(and on guy who is obsessed with making him eat his ""yaoi stick"" which is a snack product he made, more on this later) As a character he comes of in the beginning as very normal,polite and kindhearted BUT what sets him apart is that when push comes to shove, unlike most Main characters he SHOVES back. He has a backbone and grit not seen very often. This trait is seen in many aspects of the show as it continues. The studio screws him over though and him take the fall for their choice, i will not elaborate on how or why but my advice is remember him as who he was not for who he became/how he ended.Chisato Sumiyoshi - This character is the MC(Main character)\'s childhood friend, we see early on that they stick together like glue, although you can see early on the Main character is independent of her but not vice versa(this will develop into something i personally loved about this show)  She follows the mold of her character to the T, annoying, needy but with a twist of having a trauma that dictates most of her actions(apparently). My issue with the twist is that is doesn\'t effect her character at ALL until suddenly it becomes like a plague. one second normal then BAM. Not a fan of this or her character because she was very forced and scripted, unnatural and it seemed like she was just a cut out. This is the main female lead.Satsuki Shinonome - This character is the most redeeming character in the animated show and not because of character design, if that was a criteria the aforementioned childhood friend could fight for best character but she is ranked very lowly.  As a character with a story she is well written, i wouldn\'t go so far to say superbly written but you can feel authenticity from her and her actions. She an important member of the school council and also a rival for the protagonist who is running for president. This could lead to very cliched moments of ""you are my enemy but you have shown me the error of my ways"" but those never happened and not because the protagonist didn\'t try but because the character stayed firm on her ideals. The development of her character did feel slightly off but her personally overall makes up for it. I also can\'t claim that she is generic or cut out since she has her unique points unlike many of the other characters. She strangely enough receives the MOST legitimate development in the series. Unlike the forced development other characters get.All the other female characters recieve very little exposition and have other minor details that are added in for a few shots to give a way for the plot to advance. Specifically coincidences like OH this and this because of that person. I would write about them but they receive very little screen time or noteworthy backgrounds, mostly acting as comedic relief for the audience and gears to keep things going.Art: The art was very normal, nothing special, as well as the animation, very basic and some places looked rough, some places had bad frames but it was run of the mill and normal. The opening animation was enjoyable to watch but again the animation or drawing was nothing special.Sound: The sound is very easy to miss, in fact if you aren\'t paying attention you will not catch any of the music actively. For this reason i can say the sound was subpar because it did not compliment the show but rather stuck in the far background . Almost as if the studio was like ""well...music needs to be in anime for ambiance i guess..."" And threw something out there.Enjoyment - It was fun to watch which is whats important, the interactions were interesting, again nothing outstanding or unique but they will give you your laugh or moments of WTF face as you fail to comprehend the foolishness of the situation. For better or for worse...Overall - i give it a solid 6 fair rating, i think rating it any lower would be brutal and undeserved. It did its job, it entertained me. They made bad decisions on where to take the story in my opinion but just because my own wishes were not met does not mean i will rate it lower. This show could have earned a much higher rating if not for the few final episodes where everything quite literally flipped on itself.', ""This show follows the typical thread of visual novel anime of going off the rails pretty quickly. It adds in a flair of conspiracy and danger that defines the source material it comes from. If you're not down for that, I can see why you wouldn't like this show. But having watched a number of visual novel anime, I have to say, this one was much better than it had any right being.The character set is pretty par for the course, but the characters aren't unlikeable. Just nothing special. They work well together, but they're not memorable. They do perform well with the premise, which...is not one that is commonly the centerpiece of a show's story.The biggest issue is that the show relies on too many tropes to stand out from the crowd, as is the norm for harem anime. This show didn't explore the characters as strongly as it could've, instead looking to toss in some fan service and dash of conspiracy to keep things consistent but spicy. This makes for a show that can be unpredictable sometimes, but not enough to make you yearn to see the conclusion.Ultimately, this show is just another drop in the bucket of harem anime. It's better than most, hence my rating, but certainly isn't special. It's one that you should probably only watch if you're a fan of the genre. is not one that is commonly the centerpiece of a show's story.The biggest issue is that the show relies on too many tropes to stand out from the crowd, as is the norm for harem anime.

These elements would have a larger presence as the story goes on, and I can't help but be not as invested in the story when they take over almost completely.I also found that the supposed main relationship (it's very obvious which one it is) is the...least successful part of the story, and I would rather see many of the other characters' stories being given more screen time instead (Mifuyu-san especially comes to mind).

Altogether, the story was good and touching just the right way, and not hurried for the sake of progress.This is one of the rare times when the new side-characters in the movie weren't disappointing; they were well made and introduced, and you actually cared about what happened to them.

Everyone more often than not loves to reminisce about when they were young and this is usually connected to an aspect of their childhood whether it be a game, movie, or tv program. Nostalgia more often than not implements A positive bias in us. This is definitely the case with this movie but I can't really give it a good score due to all of its problems.Destiny deoxys is a Pokemon movie that is connected to the advanced generation story which is basically gen 3. When looking at Pokemon movies...in general you have to consider that they have no real effect on the plot and just serve as side stories for Pokemon fans to enjoy. The only different the generations are is the people ash is actually traveling with as well as setting. However like always ash is the main character.The story of destiny deoxys had massive potential. I felt that it had a very fascinating concept and I really wanted to know more about deoxys and why it's here, and what it's doing here. The expansion of these concepts are really only half done unfortunately. The story does fall apart as the movie goes on and many dull plot devices are used in conjunction with bullshit Pokemon logic that really makes absolutely no sense. The timeskip present destroyed the story's momentum before it can even get on the correct track.The characters are probably the most dissapointing part of this movie. Despite the relationship between tori and ash being very good, the characters themeselves weren't strong enough to make me care. The pseudo romance between Sid and May was also appreciated but once again Sid is such an insignificant character that the relationship only supplies some hollow laughs when it could have been so much more dynamic and interesting. If the characters who only appeared for this movie had some meaningful characterization I would have enjoyed them much more.The voice work and music actually weren't bad in this movie. The animation was pretty well done despite some rather ugly CG. I've seen both the English dub and the Japanese and both versions are fine as the seiyuus portrayed their characters fairly well it didn't really come across as poor or low quality. And THAT SING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE THOUGH.In the end this movie is something I enjoy out of pure nostalgia. It's not that this was a particularly bad movie but nostalgia alone cannot save it.

Still, compared to Jirachi, Deoxys achieves much more.Destiny Deoxys flaunts an interesting futuristic city, as expected for a film set in the Battle Frontier. The city is filled to brim with CGI elements and I'm happy to say that they don't seem out of place. Rather, they enhance the setting. The film is heavy focused on plot, thus it can't cash in on the atmosphere completely. Nice to the eyes, art style and animation remain the highlights of the film. There are a...few unfortunate moments in which Rayquaza isn't to scale, though. It distracts from the action when a superstar looks two to three times smaller than he should be.Plotwise, the film is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the film is driven by the Deoxys hunting squad. But on the other, it's really about the character of Tory. While the two are combined in a satisfactory manner, neither of the two plots gets resolved in a completely satisfying way.On the upside, the character development of Tory was natural and believable. The film establishes his character twice. First time in the opening sequence and the second time after he meets Ash. The film uses visual language of Tory's white hair, eyes and clothes to signal viewers his personality - namely, he's a socialy inept introvert. The problem with the opening sequence is that his personality and design are based on what he becomes after the opening sequence due to its consequences. Honestly, the kid ruins the opening sequence by looking badly out of place. It's not a good first impression.Even though Tory's character development was done well, the film takes too much time to establish him and then wastes time thematically rethreading his conflict again and again in the most inapropraite situations. There are multiple scenes forcing the plot to a halt so characters can talk about the dangers of the situation just to force Tory in a room with Pokemon he fears to create more drama. Yet his character development happens in a few loosely related subtle scenes. As a result the movie often undermines the feeling of urgency and danger it tries hard to establish for little gain.Tory is not a very complex character and chemistry between the show's cast and film-only cast isn't very good. This often leads to boredom until the plot picks up. Some of the scenes are saved by fun Pokemon interactions. Munchlax is notable for having his own miniplot that is well interwoven into the film.Basic structure of the plot is fine and Deoxys is given lots of menacing things to do. The problem lies in the fact that the things Deoxys does are cool, but too removed from the film's focus. Often time you'll get a feeling that the scenes are happening out of time and space, since Deoxys is doing nothing and appears only after a character scene is wrapped up.Rayquaza and Deoxys have a servicable clash near the end of the film and while Rayquaza was misused during most of the film, he ends up being a fine addition to the cast at the end. We're also treated to one of the best action scenes involving humans in a Pokemon film - Ash practicing parkour over the city's haywire defence systems. My only complaint is that it took less than 3 minutes in total. Still, brevity is a virtue. Better leave us wanting more than ruining it.So, what's the verdict? A neat premise, great art, some interesting character moments and a memorable (albeit short) action scene. Film drags on, misses plot oportunities and is often unengaging and boring. It narrowly avoids falling flat and can be worth a watch if you like Pokemon films. few unfortunate moments in which Rayquaza isn't to scale, though.

This is also my first review of an Advanced Generation movie, a series that I'm not as familiar with as the original, but I'll give it my best shot. Personal biases aside, let me tell you why this is one of my favorite Pokemon movies.Story: While the story isn't as well told as something like Pokemon Heroes, it's still really well done. Something that really surprised me is that this movie doesn't focus on Ash as much as it focuses on Tory and Deoxys. While Ash is still our main protagonist and...as such handles the more heroic side of things, the story likes to keep its focus on Tory's and Deoxys' stories, which I find really interesting since they're such a great characters. However, there is one element of the story that I don't quite understand, that being Rayquaza. Granted, I watched the American release of the film, so there's most likely deleted scenes that I'm not taking into account since there's really no reason to unless you're the type of person that researches every last little bit about an anime before actually watching it, which I'm not. My gripe with Rayquaza is that he serves little purpose in the movie. The only part in which he actually affects anything going on is in the beginning. After that, he's just kinda there except for the last 10-20, which I felt the film could do without.Art: I'll try to make this be the last comparison I make to another Pokemon movie, but, while the art is great, it's not quite up to scale with Pokemon Heroes. Granted, that's most likely just my own tastes in art speaking and not an actual problem with the film. So I'll at least say that the art is really creative, especially when animating thousands of little blocks all at once. There's also the beautiful scenes of inside this Greenhouse that shows off the talent of the artists behind the film.Sound: This is where I believe Destiny Deoxys shines the brightest. The soundtrack for the film is unbelievably good. Even though it doesn't have any form of remix of the show's theme, there's still a lot of songs that are sure to get stuck in your head. The other little sound clips I also really liked since it made the movie feel more like an alien movie with a lot of the little sounds that Deoxys makes along with several other subtle music tracks.Character: Besides the usual characters and background characters, most of what's left are Tory, Deoxys, and Rayquaza. Since I already talked about Rayquaza earlier (seriously why did it need to come back after 4 years? Deoxys didn't go back up into the ozone layer, so why is it still threatened?), I'll skip over him. As for Tory, he's actually a pretty cool character. He has a fear of Pokemon, but it's not some irrational fear of these things eating him, I mean most of the time that you see him afraid are around Plusle and Minun and those two wouldn't hurt a fly. His fear is perfectly explained early on and it's pretty reasonable. He's also not too afraid of them to actually help them out as shown several times throughout. So it's not like he's heartless or anything. Then there's Deoxys, who I just love. Most of the movie is spent trying to figure Deoxys out and exactly why it's here. Once it's figured out, Deoxys isn't really seen as a villain anymore. It's more like Pokemon 3 where there is no villain, but just a big misunderstanding, which I actually like more than just throwing in another member from whatever evil organization that the current season focuses on for the fourth time in a row.Enjoyment: As stated at the beginning, this is one of my favorite Pokemon films, right behind Heroes and Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. So of course I really enjoyed it, despite its minor flaws. as such handles the more heroic side of things, the story likes to keep its focus on Tory's and Deoxys' stories, which I find really interesting since they're such a great characters. However, there is one element of the story that I don't quite understand, that being Rayquaza.

Deoxys didn't go back up into the ozone layer, so why is it still threatened?), I'll skip over him. As for Tory, he's actually a pretty cool character. He has a fear of Pokemon, but it's not some irrational fear of these things eating him, I mean most of the time that you see him afraid are around Plusle and Minun and those two wouldn't hurt a fly. His fear is perfectly explained early on and it's pretty reasonable. He's also not too afraid of them to actually help them out as shown several times throughout. So it's not like he's heartless or anything. Then there's Deoxys, who I just love. Most of the movie is spent trying to figure Deoxys out and exactly why it's here. Once it's figured out, Deoxys isn't really seen as a villain anymore. It's more like Pokemon 3 where there is no villain, but just a big misunderstanding, which I actually like more than just throwing in another member from whatever evil organization that the current season focuses on for the fourth time in a row.Enjoyment: As stated at the beginning, this is one of my favorite Pokemon films, right behind Heroes and Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. So of course I really enjoyed it, despite its minor flaws."", 'I think this might actually be the best Pokémon film so far. Reading the reviews I\'m surprised they\'re not more positive, it\'s definitely better than those before it.This film scared me as a kid, Deoxys was genuinely weird and terrifying. The fact that it\'s an alien with weird tentacles and a cold, unemotional face was scary. The damage it causes and how it put a city into evacuation and shut down all the electronics, creates dark chase scenes that terrified me. Obviously I\'m older now, but taking a step back and re-evaluating the film I still think it is the best and rather harrowing when...compared to the previous films. The CGI is much better in this film, and while it is noticeable, it never distracts from the enjoyment or is bad like in the Jirachi movie. Obviously this is due to technological advancements, but it\'s still something to be appreciated.While the plot follows the formula set out by previous films (new city, new legendaries, new characters) it\'s a lot more believable than previous entries. This is because life and personality has been added into this futuristic city that sets apart from those before it. Things such as futuristic hot dog stands, bins, passports, and walkways add a charm to the city. The general architecture is rather nice and is a good contrast to the rather dull, boring areas we have explored previously. Pokémon live and breathe throughout this city, Plusle, Minun and Munchlax - while there to sell plushies - add much needed character that is lacking through Team Rocket. The trio of Pokémon are much more enjoyable to watch and makes much more sense than the producers trying to shoehorn in Team Rocket anyway they can. I\'m surprised they haven\'t done something similar to this before.The thing that sets this film apart from the others is that Ash really isn\'t the main character. Yes he steps in and saves the day at the end, but this whole film is Tory\'s. A child suffering from PTSD after experiencing a near death experience of being crushed by Walrein\'s is an interesting concept. We hardly see people in the anime that have had bad experiences with Pokémon and Tory fills that gap. I like his development throughout this film, he understands the Walrein\'s didn\'t mean to scare him (and that they were only reacting that way due to Rayquaza and Deoxys fighting), but he can\'t look past his bad experiences in case something like that happens again. You can see how he wasn\'t always scared of them (as he finds a Spheal cute in the beginning), he was simply just in the wrong place at the wrong time at an impressionable age that has shaped his development. I also like how his ""friend"" was a Pokémon the whole time, he has been appreciative of Pokémon since his trauma, just in his own special way. If Pokémon were real, these things would cause fucking chaos, and we would have a lot of Tory\'s throughout our world. I\'m glad we have a film were this is explored and his appreciation for Pokémon comes back after the events of the film.Obviously this film is much more enjoyable if you\'re a Pokémon fan (as Rayquaza is one of my favourites), but I\'m convinced you could show this to a non-Pokémon fan and just maybe, they wouldn\'t think it was dogshit as I believe they would with the previous ones. compared to the previous films.

But this was the best movie since the third.The storyline took a while to get going and was mostly an excuse to do fun stuff in Vancouver. But when it did get going, it was excellent, more sci-fi than fantasy and all for the better. In particular, it reminded me a lot of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and given that I really liked that movie this made me happy.There was nice comic relief throughout and the action scenes, while not QUITE as good as some other movies, were great and intense.Above all though was the FANTASTIC...animation. The backgrounds, and whole atmosphere of the city was extremely well done, not quite as good as Alto Mare but pre close. Pretty much every scene was lovely, and the direction was excellent. The first 10 minutes, in particular, were amazing, and like the beginning of the first movie didn't feel like Pokemon at all, but was better for it.

"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!: Motenaishi, Nazomeite Miru",https://myanimelist.net/anime/20449/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui__Motenaishi_Nazomeite_Miru,"[""Great little episode. If you already watched the original show then you already know what your gonna get with the ova. Lots of comedic and cringing scenes from the lovable outcast Tomoko and amazing voice work from her voice actor. The story doesn't really progress anything but still enjoyable to see Tomoko again and to catch some of the anime references strewn about. This episode does give a Chuunibyou feel from it, to anyone familiar with that series. All and all nice little bonus episode to watch and relive Watamote's funny and sad feels that it gives off. "", ""Watamote. A popular anime and manga around the Internet despite being all about an unpopular Mojo girl who suffers from acute Social Anxiety.Before I'll review this OVA, I'd tell you a little about Watamote's first rise to success, and I'll cover about Kuroki Tomoko's character as I wished to do it for a long time now, and then of course, I'll review the contents of this 13th Anime Original episode OVA.-Prologue-Watamote (Shortest way to call it, so I'd just use that) started out as an unknown little manga that featured a very unique female protagonist, a Mojo, meaning a very gloomy unsociable girl. When I...first lay my eyes upon a random 4chan thread back in 2011 featuring Tomoko , I immediately knew this manga is going to be something special.As one who enjoys unique portrayal of protagonists, and even better, something closer to home, a more realistic one, someone you could relate to easily, I knew I had to try it out.So I read the first chapter that got scanlated by an Anon, and I was immediately intrigued.How did Watamote managed to rise to success so easily?It was with the help of those 4channers themselves, which stands out as a very nice story. 4channers promoted the manga in many threads, and even helped the mangaka financially so she could write more chapters by buying as many copies as they could. So instead of Japan, we got the West to support Watamote's first rise to success.4chan is a controversial home to various people who enjoy social interaction through image boards, troll each other, and generally spread the Internet phenomena of Memes. Through the years it had its ups, downs, and as one who used to follow threads daily for years, 4chan indeed earned its name on the Internet.So those 4channers who many of them themselves suffered from social alienation, enjoyed Watamote the best. And after the manga became enough popular, a 2013 anime adaptation adapted the manga story, shone Tomoko in different light, making her come to life with great visuals, sound, and endless attempts for Tomoko to become a popular sociable girl, which always resulted in utter failures.-Kuroki Tomoko-From what I read in reviews on MAL, Kuroki Tomoko is a character you could easily relate to if suffer from similar societal anxieties, or you could just throw her existence as a loser who can't learn from her ways, and have a clear lack of empathy for her, even clearly feel pain from what she goes through, to the point you feel awkward when you watch the show.Her life portrayal in a dark comedic show is something that can be very unfunny to some, while some would laugh and then feel guilty about it.When I watch Kuroki Tomoko in action, I don't see a loser girl that clearly. Tomoko is someone that tries her best, and fails. Then tries again, then fails. A loop that will occur in the whole show.Why does that happen to her? Why is she so different from other people surrounding her? Is this her fate? Is this how she supposed to live her whole life?My own answer is, her state of mind, which over the years, strayed afar from a healthy one, into one ridden with such social anxieties.Tomoko in Middle School was more sociable than in her teenage years, that's when the social anxiety attacks harder. While some who suffer from SA can live with it, some clearly, can't.As one who knows what it's like to feel such heavy anxiety, despite not suffering from clear SA but something different, I'd tell you, even on one sunny day, things begin to change.Sometimes you won't feel it right away, won't understand why it's happening, that you're in this mess, but after a few years, you won't remember how it even happened.You'll be so delusional you'll think your whole life was this way, that you amount to the lowest human being.And when one thinks he will fail, he's prone to failures much more than others. When one is in unhealthy delusional state of mind caused by anxieties, traumas or a mental illness, he will see the world differently, sometimes live his daily life through his hobbies, will fail to see the world as it itself works in reality like others without such anxieties, see them as clear as the sun.Then it can be a life long suffering.The worst thing is, that many or even most people around you will see you as a lower human being than their standing. And when many, or even every person acts hostile towards you, you'll make generalizations about this world, and build up years of hatred towards many of your peers, despite the problem lying deep in yourself.It can be an lifelong cycle of hatred, that can bring you to make drastic measures. Shut yourself in? Lose friends one after another or never have a close friend at all? Succumb to the state of mind until it becomes a lifelong illness? Much is possible.Can one go out of it? With kind help from others, a change in environment or even with years with good Rehab, and the right medications, one can slowly come back into a healthy state of mind: A healthy soul in a healthy body.But such thing may never happen to many people, and they will succumb to it, lose themselves in it until it breaks them, and simply tears them apart from the inside.They can easily lose their sanity, or meet an early demise.This is not a matter someone can brightly joke about.Kuroki Tomoko however, is in a dark comedy anime. The show name can be used in two ways: No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Unpopular!/ It's Not My Fault That I'm Not Popular! which clearly expresses the delusion Tomoko is living in. Can Tomoko break out of it?I didn't follow the manga to recent chapters yet, but I heard that recently she shows more of her social side, so there is some change. But clear change can take years of serialization, or...May never happen at all.It's time for me to review the OVA itself.Story: 6This OVA feels, looks, and is an original story. The story also feel much more lighthearted compared to the main show.It starts with a prologue that hints about a possible second season. The prologue is about Tomoko wanting to change the series completely for the second season, then snaps out of it by Kii, her cousin, with the flashy entrance of the OP, which I really grown to love.It manages to portray a more sociable Tomoko, in 2 halves:One is through the eyes of a regular Chuunibyou middle school kid Aomatsu, which sees her as a cool girl who can change his boring daily life, just like in the anime he enjoys.This part doesn't really feel like the regular Watamote, but more of a homage to many anime that cater to Chuunis. We see a cool Tomoko, with a cool voice, appearance and demeanor, spouting some chuuni remarks which the guy finds oddly intriguing.The second part is from Tomoko viewpoint, which actually shows what happened in reality, and not through the help of Chuunibyou vision.So it's basically half an episode covered in 2 viewpoints.What I liked about it, that Tomoko feels different while she was in middle school, even if the Original Story setting required her to act different.She was even unbeknown to me and to the other viewers, taller in her middle school years than her high school years, which clearly ignited the guy's Chuuni Mentality.They both met a few times on the school rooftop, a setting to many Chuuni-inspired stories.Tomoko just wanted to create a cool setting for them to meet frequently, but sadly, it didn't go anywhere in the end.After 3 years, he couldn't even recognize her anymore despite bumping her once. Tomoko managed to change so much just in 3 years, with her additional social anxiety silent behavior.So in the end, this was a refreshing Watamote story, through if I look at it overall, it was nothing that special.I did enjoy it more compared to Yahari's original story OVA (a similar protagonist show) which I felt was more lacking, and not as refreshing.-Art & Animation: 8-The art is the same as the main series, which is perfectly understandable. Silver Link made the simple manga's art into something that looks way more grim and flashy at the same time. No complains here.Sound: 9The OP and ED are the same as the main series, and the sound is just as great.While some hate the combination of J-Pop and Screamo Metal in the OP song, I really found it to be the killer combination, perfectly fits the show theme of regress.I missed the ED as well, and hearing it again in the episode after such a long time sure feels nice.Kitta Izumi is back and great as ever. She carries the show without any flaw with her portrayal of Tomoko, a voice that she never uses in other shows, which it makes her most special role.Character: 9Tomoko, Tomoki and Yuu-chan return, with the addition of 2 new characters, Aomatsu and Komiyama Kotomi, a friend of Tomoko is her middle school years. They don't play a big role as a whole, but for a show with so little characters, every addition is welcome.Enjoyment: 9I enjoyed the main series and this OVA in the same way. They both have the same Watamote feel, despite the OVA being an original story, which shows the director's ability to produce good Watamote episodes even if they are not adapted straightly from the manga.I also enjoy Watamote's anime more than the manga, because of great directing, and of course the addition of voice acting, music, animation, better art, and it's just better as a whole for me.Overall: 9Despite this review was more about Watamote as a whole and not only this Stand Alone OVA, I said pretty much everything I wanted which was pent up about the show, since there was not much to review on this episode as standalone. So it's basically a Two-in-One review.I recommend Watamote and this OVA to every person who enjoys dark comedy, different protagonists to the norm, and those can relate to Tomoko more easily because of their circumstances.This is not a show about beating Social Anxiety so far, but one that just portrays it. Something that is avoided a lot in more of an Escapist (But not only) Mediums such as Anime and Manga. Please keep that in mind.Enjoy Watching, and I hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it.

They both have the same Watamote feel, despite the OVA being an original story, which shows the director's ability to produce good Watamote episodes even if they are not adapted straightly from the manga.I also enjoy Watamote's anime more than the manga, because of great directing, and of course the addition of voice acting, music, animation, better art, and it's just better as a whole for me.Overall: 9Despite this review was more about Watamote as a whole and not only this Stand Alone OVA, I said pretty much everything I wanted which was pent up about the show, since there was not much to review on this episode as standalone. So it's basically a Two-in-One review.I recommend Watamote and this OVA to every person who enjoys dark comedy, different protagonists to the norm, and those can relate to Tomoko more easily because of their circumstances.This is not a show about beating Social Anxiety so far, but one that just portrays it. Something that is avoided a lot in more of an Escapist (But not only) Mediums such as Anime and Manga. Please keep that in mind.Enjoy Watching, and I hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it. (:"", 'I waited for a whole year and finally we have the OVA.The episode can seen from two perspectives: Aomatsu\'s and Tomoki\'s. These play out with the exact same scenario.A big thing to note about this is that we are finally able to see how Tomoki actually looks and sounds like to other people. Generic MC-kun\'s version of Tomoki is tall, mysterious, and has a voice you can totally have the hots for. This isn\'t groundbreaking, but I definitely like this interesting take on our usual chibi-fied and raspy-sounding MC we\'ve kept track of for 12 episodes.Even if it wasn\'t noticeable, a new character is also...introduced, which is Kotomi Komiyama, a friend both to Yuu and Tomoki back in middle school. She eventually becomes a character who\'d constantly ""hang out"" with Tomoki in the current manga, so seeing her in this OVA made me happy.There aren\'t a lot of cringe moments in this one, but this will definitely make you laugh and facepalm one way or another. The artwork is still the same, but there are some quirks in the animations that reminded me of Shaft (which isn\'t a bad thing).  The OP and ED were amazing as always.Overall, I think it\'s a good OVA and it just makes me crave for another season of this show. introduced, which is Kotomi Komiyama, a friend both to Yuu and Tomoki back in middle school.

That reminds me a bit of Yamato Nadeshiko, where we have a girl who thinks herself ugly although she is actually really beautiful. Kuroki due her own misconception about herself thinks little of her,...reflecting on how she looks (to herself) but when we saw her through the eyes of the guy, she is actually pretty cute, as well as strong.

I only give this rating when a show is not only perfect, but expands my horizons with regard to what I think is possible with the medium.I\'d never thought it was possible to relate to an anime so much as I did with WataMote. The few characters that are featured are written with a brutally realistic depth, and the show is the only example of what I might call ""Slice of True Life"". The realistic juxtaposition of narcissism and depression incarnated in Tomoko Kuroki belies a character depth and understanding...of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals. There was never a choice made with regard to the writing that I didn\'t find believable and, on a fundamental level, correct for the character. Lying to people relentlessly, cheating, mentally insulting strangers, every bit of it was exactly who I was in middle school. The way she is utterly alone in her pain is almost never expressed in anime, but this show treats loneliness like an old friend, joking with it, laughing as it dies inside. This is so much closer to the reality of being a lonely but narcissistic kid. The meta-commentary never ceases to be hilarious, which at first I thought might just be unintentional, but in the beginning of the OVA they pretty much spell out that they understand the metacritical implications of their storywriting. Some people say this show is too cringey, but I usually hate schadenfreude comedy and I love this show. It feels less to me like they\'re trying to get the audience to laugh at her than it feels like the audience is laughing at her despite the author\'s wish to engender sympathy, which of course is icing on the metacritical cake.I could write an essay on WataMote, so I\'ll stop here. Suffice to say I think this is the best Slice of Life anime ever, and that I\'d recommend this anime to absolutely anyone. of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals.

The concept of this OVA has two perspectives in the school rooftop from Aomatsu's (Tomoko's soon to be friend), then Tomoko's, which, in my opinion, was well-handled. I like the new character introductory of Tomoko and Yuu's friend from the middle school and her interaction with Tomoko. I wish we had more interaction with her and the other girls, though but one was good enough.Aomatsu and Tomoko's meeting on the rooftop was a nice touch despite not seeing face-to-face but, it was nice to see someone actually talking to Tomoko and find her...attractive for a change. She's a pretty teenager with a good sense of humor and imagination.I give the OVA a 10 for everything it stands for. And I hope we will get a second sometime in the future. attractive for a change.

And she makes things interesting for him again.And Tomoko gets herself in some trouble..There's not much of a plot or a point, it's just Tomoko being her usual self for us to enjoy.It does hint a couple of times at there being a second season, so we'll have to wait and see.

It expressed social anxiety in a way that was very accurate and hilarious at the same time. And although social anxiety isn't something to that to laugh at in particular, it was still refreshing to watch and makes you want to extend a hand to those who don't fit in.That being said, I didn't much care for this OVA. It involves Tomoko meeting a boy on the school's roof in very odd ways with the episode featuring both character's perspectives of the encounters. To me, it was very boring and hard to watch.

I didn't enjoy it much at all and I was honestly just waiting for it to be over so that I can move on to a different anime.I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad OVA but after watching the whole series and enjoying every second of it and then watching this episode, it left me in a very off putting way and I kinda just walked away from it.

Princess Princess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/907/Princess_Princess,"[""To watch Princess Princess you have to keep in mind, it's a bit weird.First off, the story. If we're really being honest here, it's kind of something out of a fangirl's mind. A prestigious all-boys school where a 'lucky few' are picked to dress up as princesses. Yes, you did hear that right, boys dressing up as princesses is the basic idea of this anime. And is there any more story than that? Not really. There's a bit of character development, one actual relationship involving one of the main characters and a teeny bit of shounen-ai to make the fangirls, who are undoubtedly watching, happy....So the story gets a 6 from me, it's not terrible but it kind of makes you go '...really?' to accepting the fact that, not only would this happen, but that anyone would agree to it (thought the perks the princesses get are nice).Don't be fooled by the anime's picture. The art is decent enough, but it's nothing special. I do have to give props to whoever designed the princesses outfits, at times they were really cute. Character design was alright, but it's all something you could find in any other anime, nothing is particularly unique. It's simply good and nothing more.As for sound, I'm a big fan of Romi Paku who does Yuujirou's voice and the other voice actors are good enough. The music was so-so. Usually I love or hate OPs and EDs, Princess Princess didn't give me much feeling either way. Sometimes I half-listened to them, other times I skipped them. I don't actively seek the songs out to listen to them, but they weren't bad, just not anything that stuck with me.The main characters are nothing special, but it's unlikely that you'll dislike them. They all have their own quirks and backgrounds which, for a series of only 12 episodes, were explored adequately enough to leave you hoping for, but not needing, more. So, the characters were handled well, but there honestly wasn't much to work with. They were pretty much average.But when it comes to enjoyment? Well, that's a 10. Despite all its flaws and drawbacks Princess Princess is a fun watch. If you're looking for a blatantly yaoi/shonen-ai series, that's not what it is. And if you're looking for something mind-blowing and new, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something that's short, sweet, and simple, then you're in the right place.

While not as a funny as &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; or using offbeat humor like &ldquo;School Rumble&rdquo;, &ldquo;Princess Princess&rdquo; still delivers solid comedy.To really enjoy &ldquo;Princess Princess&rdquo;, you do have to accept its somewhat ridiculous premise, an all-boys school where the most effeminate and pretty boys of the first year students get designated as 'hime' (aka princess) and cross dress as girls in order to...boost the morale of the boys all round the school, much like some sort of cheerleaders. While the princesses have many chores and duties, they do get benefits so one could view it as a paid part-time function.Then again, such a premise isn't all that silly if we look at that of &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; for instance. Anime series have their share of silly premises one must accept to enjoy them.&ldquo;Princess Princess&rdquo; focuses on Shihoudani, Mikoto and Tooru, how they live their year as princesses and reconcile with this rather peculiar job.Even excluding the comedic scenes, Tooru and Shihoudani are brought forth as a possible romantic pairing and part of the plot is spent on their relationship which may be more than friendship. It is never explicitly stated they are or will become involved, but it's a clear possibility. Even those who are not into the yaoi/shounen-ai genre will not mind it one bit as it's handled well.With the main plot focus being on Tooru's character development and past, Shihoudani's character is also sufficiently fleshed out so they're less two-dimensional and their respective past experiences helps in set up the believability of their mutual understanding and bond.Mikoto's character provides a nice contrast, being the most effeminate of the three yet also the one who opposes his job as a princess the most, and who has a heterosexual relationship. Regardless, he does seem to fantasize about wearing matching female attire with his girlfriend Megumi. (No one would mind, they'd definitely look gorgeous together.)Other than that he gets little background for his character, one could say even Sakamoto, a friend of the three, gets more character development than Mikoto.The student council was another matter, they were so blatantly gorgeous, perfect males and aimed at the yaoi/shounen-ai fan demographic that it did bother me at some times and put off some of the comedic aspect of the student council presidents shenanigans and plots. But one might rack them up as pure fanservice.Sayaka's character is another matter entirely, largely used as plot development vehicle for Tooru, it's hard to try to understand her perspective. Even though one could imagine her parents' dire situation in how to deal with a daughter's predicament like Sayaka's, often you wonder why they simply do not get her professional help.Speaking of fanservice, all the scenes of  Shihoudani, Mikoto and Tooru cross-dressing as girls are off course, purely aimed at that. One mustn't fear to recoil at seeing cross-dressing males appear on-screen, in those scenes Shihoudani, Mikoto and Tooru are simply drawn as girls in typically frilly, gothic-esque girl attire. And yes, they do look very cute as girls in their princess appearances.The animation in &ldquo;Princess princess&rdquo; is decent, most budget and effort clearly having been put into the above mentioned fanservice scenes. Other scenes are visually unremarkable, backgrounds are very simple and plain. The lackluster animation will not put off enjoying the series, but it does not add positively in any way either.The same applies to the soundtrack, which is unremarkable, standard fare as well.One will no doubt enjoy &ldquo;Princess Princess&rdquo; as a comedy, and if you're into yaoi/shounen-ai, then you've probably already watched this series. boost the morale of the boys all round the school, much like some sort of cheerleaders.

freedom to disregard common sense is beautiful. i love this anime to death and everything it stands for.for this review i guess it might be nessecary to point out that i am a straight male (ok not 100% but i swear anime made me slightly bisexual).this anime is largely a yaoi fanservice anime, focusing mainly on genderbending. kinda like harem/ecchi but for girls, or just anyone who is a bit curious and confused. i don\'t know what i am so i...guess i\'m confused.genderbending was a concept that i barely even knew existed until maybe a year ago, now i love that shit and i don\'t know why. i love traps, i love reverse traps too. and at this point i don\'t know if i\'m a virgin because i like this shit, or if i like this shit because i\'m a virgin. but somewhere in my brain it feels inherently logical to equate sexual desperation to an increase in sexual perversions.anyway lets get down to it. our protagonist tooru kouno transfers to an all boys high school, where there\'s been a secret and several decades long tradition to take the most attractive male students and dress them up as girls to become the rest of the schools mascots/eyecandy. this is sort of an inevitable perversion in an environment where there are no females around and just a bunch of pubertal teens going rampage. which is actually quite similar to my own life situation, except i\'m not pubertal and it\'s just me alone in my college dorm room where only other guys live, and i very rarely go outside.but enough of my self deprecation. so this school has also found that making these attractive people crossdress impacts the school as a whole in a very positive way, due to the ""princesses"" cheering etc their sports teams are doing better than they ever would have if not for the school\'s princesses cheering. they also resolve conflicts with their effeminate mannerisms so everything is peaceful. in return these princesses also get cash money from the student council.the characters themselves have an exceptional amount of depth for being a yaoi fanservice, seeing shihoudani and tooru on their summer vacation gives you a taste of what their ""non-professional"" personalities are like, and their family problems etc.so much praise from my side but here is some criticism. i feel like they could have made this anime into something much more profound by for instance involving parts where the main characters go through identity crisis. due to all their acting, they start to forget who they really are/were, become confused and/or uncomfortable with their gender roles and have no idea what to identify as anymore. something like that, you get the picture.the concept of vanity is also a large part of this show, quite rarely seen in anime due to most characters being way more attractive than the average 3D person. but in this show the contrasts are vast. the regular people look unappealing and the princesses+sakamoto have big kind looking eyes and shit. and generally are better looking and more effeminate than most 3D women out there (jesus christ since when did i start comparing people in anime to real life people, i have become a monster).that is enough. just go watch it right now and become a more fucked up person than you were before. guess i\'m confused.genderbending was a concept that i barely even knew existed until maybe a year ago, now i love that shit

instance involving parts where the main characters go through identity crisis. due to all their acting, they start to forget who they really are/were, become confused and/or uncomfortable with their gender roles and have no idea what to identify as anymore. something like that, you get the picture.the concept of vanity is also a large part of this show, quite rarely seen in anime due to most characters being way more attractive than the average 3D person. but in this show the contrasts are vast. the regular people look unappealing and the princesses+sakamoto have big kind looking eyes and shit. and generally are better looking and more effeminate than most 3D women out there (jesus christ since when did i start comparing people in anime to real life people, i have become a monster).that is enough. just go watch it right now and become a more fucked up person than you were before.', ""First of all, I want to specify that this is MOSTLY NOT yaoi/shonen-ai. There are no boy/boy relationships whatsoever. Nevertheless, they are implied and there is a scene that might be concidered shonen-ai.Nothing even slightly hardcore so I'm pretty sure others (more girls, I guess) can enjoy this anime without being freaked out.This is a simple anime. It stars with a lame excuse of a plot but then proceeds to develop each of the characters background, which is quite interesting for the most part. After the character development, the story comes to an end.The latter fact left me with an empty feeling; why come to...know these characters if we're not going to hear more from them?The problems that pop up are quite repetitive at that, so I'm at a loss to say if making it so short was a good or bad thing.All I can say is this series is to have fun! I actually laughed at how exaggerated and ridiculous the characters and situations are.I loved the art, the protagonists were really beautifully drawn. Their costume designs were cute but were also quite the same (except for some).Sound? as for most anime, whatever.I wouldn't watch this again, the jokes are good for a one time thing but perhaps I would one lazy day when I want to look at pretty bishonen. know these characters if we're not going to hear more from them?The problems that pop up are quite repetitive at that, so I'm at a loss to say if making it so short was a good or bad thing.All I can say is this series is to have fun!

Especially since the manga is one of my favourites of all time --  (I mean, who can resist Taishi Zaou\'s humour? It\'s just FABULOUS) -- and let\'s face it, Studio Deen is a great studio in itself too. There are so many elements to this that could have made it great.The story starts out OK, presenting the same premise...that the manga had shown, with some minor tweaks. The corner room in the dorms is now the P-room, the head of the dorm is apparently a senpai and... I don\'t recall Mikoto showing up in a dress at the very beginning? Since it\'s something only done for events and the like, but whatever.Everything would have been fine if Studio Deen didn\'t decide on mixing up story lines and arcs just to fit every good moment they wanted into the anime. It\'s understandable, but surprising and didn\'t do the anime well. Characters get minimized or exaggerated as the story goes on and certain events lose their meaning in the progress.[--- SKIP THIS PART IF YOU DON\'T WANT TO READ SPOILERS ---]Examples of this are:Sayaka\'s episodes are over the top and that says a lot, since she was an extreme character already. Why does she threaten to throw herself off a hill? How did she get to accepting Tooru and Yuujirou together if only days/moments before she was tormenting Yuujirou endlessly for being Tooru\'s ""boyfriend""?Why did Yuujirou\'s family unexpectedly show up at the school festival? Why not make Tooru come along with Yuujirou to visit them at his home? The fact he traveled so far at Yuujirou\'s request in the manga made it extra significant. Heck, even Yuujirou\'s mom wondered in an extra comic if Tooru was his boyfriend because of that. ""Do you think they are dating...? No one would travel that far for just a friend, right? And lately Yuujirou has been sparkling --"" [a reference to the princess smile] ""... It\'s what love does to someone, I suppose...""And I can\'t believe how flat Tooru\'s decision at the end of the anime was (episode 12). Why was the whole school there to cheer? Why did all the other characters even know and meddle with this? And how come Studio Deen missed out on a chance to incorporate the Very Gay Scene™ between Tooru and Yuujirou if they skipped various story lines to get there? They could have animated Tooru telling Yuujirou ""I wanted to hear it from you the most... that you would miss me.""Anyway, enough about how Studio Deen tried to gay it up and hecked up in the progress. I could talk about it forever.[--- SPOILERS END HERE ---]Continuing, I thought the art of the anime wasn\'t great. It might have been decent for a 2006 anime, but it still had a lot of still scenes, chibis and lack of action. Maybe it\'s not fair to compare it to BONES anime, but I thought FullMetal Alchemist (2003) and Ouran High School Host Club (2006) were a lot better in terms of animation in that time. Not that I expect a lot of budget for an anime like this.Which brings me to the genre: shoujo. I was okay with the mangaka calling the Princess Princess manga a shoujo because it was acceptable. Okay, it felt a bit fake, but it wasn\'t like she was particularly aiming for it to be shounen-ai. Gay moments aside, of course.But Studio Deen? MAN, THEY UPPED THEIR GAME. ""This is a shoujo anime"" they whisper, as they show the ending with only Tooru and Yuujirou, while dressing them up... can I just say ""gay"". I screamed ""WHAT THE F*** IS THIS"" when the ending first came up because it was so random and ... gay. I have no other words to describe it. And let\'s face it: Mikoto would be relieved to be left out of that ending. If Tooru and Yuujirou are just going to be sexy photoshoot models pretending to be a couple, then Mikoto wouldn\'t want to be a part of it.Poor Mikoto is always left out. Do I even pity him or feel relief for him in this anime? I don\'t know anymore.Either way, the music of this anime was okay. I don\'t even know what to say about the opening and ending songs anymore. I just experience second hand embarrassment with those. The songs are pretty good though, really. I just can\'t believe they were put with this anime.Characters are... decent? They had strong source material to back them up, if that makes sense. As much as was possible with the jumbled story lines, the characters were as OK as they could be in that situation. Aside from Sayaka, I don\'t feel like they deviated too much from the manga. Though Yuujirou acted out of character in a few occasions too, but whatever.Let\'s just end this review and say I didn\'t enjoy this anime. I\'m not even funny. I just wanted to whine and complain about a failed adaption of a manga I liked to bits.Please do read the manga though. I promise it\'s great and more consistent and logical. If you like the idea of BL, then it will be GREAT as well. Because who doesn\'t think Yuujirou is into Tooru? And if you don\'t like BL... then that\'s probably fine too.

However saying that it\'s completely hetero seems a little off too, there are a lot of moments and bonding between Yuujiro and Tooru. And even though a lot of those moments are a lot more homo out of context, it\'s still there. I like them together, and I wish they actually had more moments like that, but to completely honest, it\'s really only shounen-ai if you have shipper googles (for example when Mikoto is asking them why they don\'t have girlfriends and...they just kinda get awkward and look at each other, to a shipper that\'s homo subtext, but to anyone else they just simply don\'t have girlfriends and that\'s that, nothing more). So, you probably shouldn\'t go into this expecting a full out confession.It\'s just... a bit too hetero for the people who want them to date, and a bit too gay for the people who don\'t, y\'dig?As for the other, more important aspects of the show, it\'s really one of the best I\'ve seen in a while. And I\'m totally not just saying that because damn do I love boys in dresses and pretty clothing. It\'s very funny and I really enjoy all the self-aware jokes they make. The plot is a little odd, because there kind of isn\'t one. Them dressing up and cheering on the other boys are actually unimportant to the shows climax, which is weird. Like, the same thing could have happened without the pretty clothes. Really though, it\'s very easy to over look that flaw because of how much I love the characters and their interactions, which is very important to me. this anime tosses a few tropes out the window, for example this is the animes I\'ve seen yet where the main protagonist isn\'t the facing some internal turmoil about being forced into a thing and slowly accepting it, and it\'s one of his friends instead.

The guys in this program have fairly high status and dress up as girls to add beauty to the all-boys high school.Okay, so the premise is awkward, but the thing with this anime is that it recognizes how weird the premise is and basically deals with each character's feelings on the subject.Our blue-haired main character, Toru, will totally steal your heart, as will his best friends,...Yuujiro and Mikoto, though I was shipping Toru/Akira.

Biohazard: Vendetta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31853/Biohazard__Vendetta,"[""A few preliminary items:If you are unfamiliar with the Resident Evil franchise and its characters this film will not clarify anything for you.If you are hoping for a horror film, this is not that film. It is a pure action thriller with mild horror elements most of which are in the first 20 minutes of the film.If you want to see something that has mindless enjoyable action and lots of stuff blowing up, this film is for you.Vendetta is a perfect popcorn movie. Its well paced, well acted, and there's a solid mix of action and plot setting. If you were able to see...it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos sound all the better because the sound design was really stellar.That said there are a few major issues with the film. The story is very weak, there is little depth and I often found myself stifling laughter during scenes which were meant to be dramatic but came off as high camp. The uncanny valley is very much at play here and while the models look good for the most part the textures are eerily off especially glass objects and wood (which shines so brightly it seems like a thousand maids had polished it for a thousand years). The level of animation is not as good as something like Gantz: O but it still (mostly) visually pleasing and well done.An enjoyable experience if you want to sit back, relax, and turn your brain off for a couple hours. it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos sound all the better because the sound design was really stellar.That said there are a few major issues with the film.

You've got a mansion (RE1), arcade shooting, and OTT action (RE6). The story is ofcourse absurd and has quite a few plotholes, but you won't mind too much.This movie isn't too scary, though I suppose RE hadn't focused on this aspect recently up until RE7 came out. There's really only one scene near the beginning that is horrific but even then I found myself laughing at the setup. This movie is more for fans of the RE6 action-horror setup.The CGI ranges between bad and pretty okay. A few scenes...look very PS3-ish in terms of quality, while others, especially a few of the action scenes, look adequate enough.

It doesn’t have the extremely photorealistic animation that Infinite Darkness has, or the compelling side characters that Damnation had, but it more than makes up for it with some of the most insane-balls to wall action in the entire franchise. The main villain, Glenn Arias, is that he’s so down bad for Rebecca Chambers, that he’s literally willing to infect the entire planet with a virus just so he can smash. This is due to the fact that Rebecca is identical to his deceased wife, who somehow is identical to Chambers sans the blonde hair. None of this is explained.Glenn’s villainous plot is also aided by his two surviving wedding guests, Diego & Maria Gomez. Except Diego has been transformed by the A-Virus, turning him into a Hulk-like monster with superhuman capabilities and transformations. Maria on the other hand, just wears latex and jiggles around. None of this is explained.During the final battle, Chris is aided by is BSAA team and they pull up to fight a transformed Glenn in a military chopper. Nadia, one of the team members, opens the back hatch to reveal that she has the same railgun Jill Valentine once used to defeat Nemesis back in Resident Evil 3. In a moment of pure-fan service, she charges up the weapon and blows a hole through Glenn’s chest…except the beam keeps going and immediately tears through the five skyscrapers behind him, blowing up and no doubt killing thousands off-screen. None of this exp-Do you see what I’m getting at? This entire film is packed to the brim with such pure and utter chaos that it makes Resident Evil 6 look like Barney & Friends. Characters will pull off such insane stunts to the point where it’ll feel like you just gave Michael Bay your Resident Evil action figures plus Red Bull then told him “Go Nuts!”. Leon Kennedy drives his motorcycle up an entire skyscraper elevator just to drive it at the final boss, then flip off of it, and THEN shoot the engine in mid-air to blow it up. Chris Redfield gets an entire Oldboy-esque sequence where he fights with a M4A1 Carbine bayonet combo and absolutely wastes an entire platoon of zombies without breaking a sweat. Rebecca Chambers gets to make o-faces while drinking mocha lattes and gets damsel-ed for the entire second half of the movie. Poorly written female characters?

It just sucks. Terribly.The story is the most outdated BS out there. Bad guys have a Bioweapon, good guys want the Antidote the bad guys have... For some reason. Bad Guy leader is crazy, and has a room full to prove how much he deserves it. He steals the Bond Girl, and wants to make a new wife with her.The artstyle is barebones at least. It\'s just models from a videogame moving a little more than usual. And the animation is ridiculously outdated too....CGI Movies and Shows have proven you CAN move your characters more natural and fluid, and hide your extras moving all in the same manner a little more. My example is the typical ""running in fear and stumbling a little then running"" animation can be seen on everyone, one after the other, in the same scenes, taking you out of it as it looks choreographed instead of feeling any sort of fear for the situation.The sound is the best quality of this movie... But isn\'t even that good. Just enough to get a pass. No track is memorable at all in this, and there are too many scenes in total silence to generate any sort of tension, but failing completely. The zombie sounds and gunshots are recycled and repeated a lot, no matter the setting.Characters are not really developed, because you are supposed to know them, but I already know them and still don\'t know why they act like idiots half the time, very unlike themselves. Like... You have confronted this shit before, why are you sweating like is your first time at the beginning of the movie knowing you might find trouble, and then realize by the end ""Oh, yeah. I can shoot stuff"". Chris Redfield is supposed to be the main character... But for me the real Main Character is Professor Chambers, as I feel like I spent more time with her than anyone else. But she does everything she is supposed to do in the first half an hour, and just goes with the flow for the rest of it.To wrap up, some of the worst scenes for me are ""I will give you my blood for no reason other than I will walk out from the room, and get kidnapped... But that ""Importance of my blood vial going to a safe place""-monologue goes nowhere in the movie anyway"" and ""Chris steals the kill after not doing anything for the entire movie, with a weapon he didn\'t ever use before"".

It just seems overall like an exaggerated bit of humour which could of been taken from the show and is overall pretty enjoyable.If you're a fan of the show it's simply one of those item's that can just help round off and add to the whole Chobits experience (and plus you get to see the cuteness...of Chi again, :D lol). of Chi again, :D lol)."", ""Chibits, a very very VERY cute anime.

Dr. Slump,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3312/Dr_Slump,"[""I have been curious about this version of Dr. Slump since I watched the first op when I was still a kid. I had already read the manga, and at first I thought the change in character design of a few characters in this version was weird, especially Arale's... Honestly, Arale having dark brown hair instead of her iconic purple hair is the only change that still bugs me a bit in this version. Much later I learned that this version didn't seem to be very popular... But after I started watching it and now that I finished it I can say for sure: this...is pure, unadultered Dr. Slump!• Story - 6/10Well, Dr. Slump is not well known for its complex plot. It doesn't really have a story. As a gag/comedy anime that is totally character-driven, the series is pretty episodic with a few short arcs here and there. We basically see the characters, mostly Arale and the chosen lucky ones of the episode, getting into weird, funny and WTF situations. If very dumb humor and poop jokes make you laugh, you're gonna enjoy this show! On another note, if you're a Dragon Ball fan, the longest arc in this version happens between episodes 56~59, which is basically an extended version of that Dragon Ball episode where Goku arrives in Penguin Village in the middle of General Blue's arc. I really enjoyed to see Goku interacting with Arale and other Dr. Slump characters for a little longer!• Characters - 10/10Dr. Slump shines the most when it comes to its characters. Who doesn't love a robot girl who has absolute no filter, no common sense and no shame!? That's Arale in all her glory. Then we have Senbei Norimaki, the scientist who created Arale. He's a bit of a pervert, but not one of the worst ones; There is Gatchan, the... alien? Angel? That was born from a dinosaur egg and can eat ANYTHING; Then there are Arale's classmates: Akane Kimidori, a tomboy, delinquent girl who in this version has red hair; Taro Soramame, that instead of having a pompadour, in this version has bleached hair (understandable since in the 90s in Japan, a young man with bleached hair was seen as a delinquent); Pisuke Soramame, Taro's younger brother, who is... very short; And, of course, miss Midori, the teacher in Arale's school, and the love of Senbei's life. These characters are the main cast, but as the episodes pass we get to see more regular characters, like a pair of aliens with literal butt-heads; Suppaman, who is a parody of Superman; a delinquent wannabe 5 year old girl; a very unusual Chinese family... It's a very interesting cast.• Art/Aniamtion - 8/10It's very 90s! Everything, from animation and art style to remade character designs, is very, very 90s. If you like 90s anime, I don't think you'll dislike anything here. It's not a masterpiece of animation but it was a job well done from a time when Toei still animated most things decently.• Sound/OST - 5/10The OST is very forgettable. It does its work but it's nothing remarkable, not something you'd want to listen later, separated from the anime. The only song I really like is the 1st opening theme. 2nd one is alright, but the 3rd (and last) one is very annoying.• Enjoyment - 6~9/10It's a very episodic series with focus on multiple characters and situations, inevitably some episodes will be more enjoyable than others. There wasn't any episode that i thought that was bad, but there were a few that I thought that were less funny than usual. It's a fun series overall and it can be a good introduction for someone who's not familiar with Dr. Slump. And if you are familiar with the series, with either the manga or the 80s anime, I'm sure you can also enjoy the 90s version if you accept the changes in character designs! is pure, unadultered Dr. Slump!• Story - 6/10Well, Dr. Slump is not well known for its complex plot.

If you like 90s anime, I don't think you'll dislike anything here. It's not a masterpiece of animation but it was a job well done from a time when Toei still animated most things decently.• Sound/OST - 5/10The OST is very forgettable. It does its work but it's nothing remarkable, not something you'd want to listen later, separated from the anime. The only song I really like is the 1st opening theme. 2nd one is alright, but the 3rd (and last) one is very annoying.• Enjoyment - 6~9/10It's a very episodic series with focus on multiple characters and situations, inevitably some episodes will be more enjoyable than others. There wasn't any episode that i thought that was bad, but there were a few that I thought that were less funny than usual. It's a fun series overall and it can be a good introduction for someone who's not familiar with Dr. Slump. And if you are familiar with the series, with either the manga or the 80s anime, I'm sure you can also enjoy the 90s version if you accept the changes in character designs!""]"

Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1045/Elf_wo_Karu_Mono-tachi,"[""The decision to watch Those Who Hunt Elves was made during my viewing of the brilliant but intense Monster. After a 74-episode psychological drama/thriller laden with emotional extremes, I needed contrast. Those Who Hunt Elves definitely provided it.The premise is simple and silly: three total strangers from modern-day Japan are accidentally summoned to a fairly standard fantasy world populated by elves and the like. An attempt to send them home goes awry and the relevant spell is split into five pieces and imprinted upon the bodies of randomly selected elves across the land. So the three Japanese visitors - one famous actress, one gun-obsessed...tomboy and one martial artist - set off in their...er...tank...to find the spell fragments in the only way they can think of: by stripping every elf they come across.That's about it. At best, an appealingly daft plot; at worst, a nauseatingly stupid one. Which side of the fence you fall on might surprise you. You see, contrary to what you, like I, might expect, the silly plot and the situations it brings about aren't really the point of this series. Of course, the elf-stripping adventure is the focus to an extent, but really only as a vehicle for the characters. Those characters are the thing that shifted me from 'this is going to be bad' to 'this is actually quite fun'.Though there are only three Japanese 'guests' in the fantasy world, the core group of characters actually consists of four; the High Priestess (or something of that nature) of the elves, Celcia, rapidly decides that the only way Those Who Hunt Elves (as the party are known to the public at large) are going to get anything done is for her to help them out. This is pivotal to my enjoyment of the whole series, since it's really Celcia's constant bickering with martial artist Junpei that provides the most entertainment. It's not unusual in any form of TV to have two companions who are always squabbling; it forms the crux of many sitcoms, including the respected likes of Red Dwarf. In some cases, this revolves around witty repartee, but in those Who Hunt Elves, wit is replaced with sheer gusto - and it works surprisingly well. Celcia and Junpei casually mock and insult each other at every opportunity, much like siblings, and where this can often seem stale and forced in many series, in this it just seems perfectly natural, and all the better for it. The other two characters in the group, Airi and Ritsuko, have their share of amusing activities but, for me at least, the Celcia/Junpei dynamic is the highlight.The other source of entertainment in Those Who Hunt Elves is the inversion of the various elves encountered along the way. In general, the elves here are the traditionally haughty and dignified type, but it doesn't take much to crack that facade. Simply watching the elves being sarcastic and irritable is entertaining in itself.Other elements of this series are more mediocre. On the visual front, it's fine but not exceptional. Everything is appropriately colourful, the characters' various expressions are suitably over the top, and the animation is adequate. In fact, 'adequate' is a good word to describe the visuals in general. Unremarkable but adequate. The incidental music made no impression on me at all, which usually means it's neither good nor bad - just adequate. The opening theme is a curious retro-synth-pop ditty that fits the tone of the series very well. It annoyed me every time I heard it, but I missed it when it was replaced for Those Who Hunt Elves II. Annoying or not, it was silly and unsubtle - perfect for the series.One more note on the audio aspects: the English dub is essential. Even if you don't usually watch dubs, please watch this one. Not because it's spectacularly well acted (it isn't) or because it features memorable vocal performances (it doesn't, though I must admit to a newfound fondness for Celcia's voice actress, Jessica Calvello). No; you must watch the dub simply because the sub only gives you a fraction of the jokes. Maybe the humour is more evident if you actually understand Japanese, but the English subtitles are fairly straightforward and sensible, most of the time. The translators for the dub of Those Who Hunt Elves have done something that seems to happen surprisingly rarely in anime; they've not just translated but reinterpreted the translation in a way that captures the intended spirit. I say it one last time: do not miss the dub.Overall, then, Those Who Hunt Elves is a disconcerting proposition. It promises little, and on the technical side it delivers nothing out of the ordinary. The concept is a little more promising, but could easily go horribly wrong. I had nightmare visions of another Negima!?, but fortunately Those Who Hunt Elves has an ace hidden up its sleeve: character. Not well developed, not well rounded, but very entertaining; the characters, combined with flagrant destruction of elf stereotypes, make the entire series. The dialogue is hardly the height of wit, but it's blunt, direct and effective, and in the cases of Junpei and Celcia it's delivered with something that seems to be genuine enjoyment. I was warned before I started watching this series that I would probably never rewatch it. Only time will tell, of course, but I think I will probably watch it again at some point, for the same reason that I've rewatched the early episodes of Trigun more than once: it's simple, fun and easy to watch. It makes no demands. Those Who Hunt Elves is almost the definition of 'light entertainment'. If you seek gravitas, look elsewhere; if you seek a break from the gravitas, Those Who Hunt Elves should be both stupid enough and amusing enough to make you chuckle without killing too many brain cells.

Or walk into a Red Lobster bathroom to find a couple awkwardly fucking each other on the mildew infested tiles?That\'s kind of what it feels like watching this anime. You feel like you\'ve just stumbled into or have unwittingly become part of an embarrassing situation and you\'re only options are either to slowly back out gracefully or watch it play out to it\'s illogical conclusion (that couple by the way, didn\'t really mind me being there, I just wanted a breath mint). ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is an anime...that dares you to sit through every single one of it\'s episodes while you brutally suppress the urge to go watch something better.The story, that seems to have been begrudgingly inserted into this anime is that the world is on the verge of peak magic with mercenaries, pirates and George W Bush roaming the countryside looking for that next fix to fuel their oversized killing-machine vehicles. The only people who have possession of that sweet, sweet merlin juice are the elves (who of course are all female) which are made apparent by the tattoos on their body. And how do those groups find out if they have these tattoos? By ripping their clothes off of course. Yeah, because giving perhaps a monetary incentive for the elves to come forward or maybe just asking would be too simple. In fact that\'s how most of this anime plays out: The characters running around the countryside ripping the clothes off of every elf and Vulcan cosplayer in sight.The characters who I won\'t bother mentioning because lets face it: you wouldn\'t give a shit anyway because you want to see some elf T&A and that torrented hentai copy of ""Viper"" isn\'t playing on your computer. All you need to know is that their is a buff dude who instigates most of the sexual assaults in this anime and probably by the end of it has a rap sheet long enough to serve life sentences of every criminal in the U.S prison system. A woman who\'s fond of swords and suffers from an eating disorder. A girl who fires long range assault rifles while in a school uniform (I suppose because she couldn\'t afford to drop the extra cash on body armor). And a talking panda bear (who is obviously there to help close the diversity gap which this anime badly needed to do) who I couldn\'t help but call toilet-paper-panda throughout the series the drunker I got watching this shit show. This crack team of idiots in every episode basically drive around in a tank fighting the Street Sharks and hurling elves Team Rocket style into the sun while their clothes rip off so they can get more of that merlin jizz. *sigh* just...just roll with it okay?So, why does this quad-squad of crap go through the motions of collecting all this magic? Because they\'re actually trying to use it to get back to Japan. They\'re all stuck in this weird ass parallel universe and the only way they can get back is ripping the clothes off elves to find tattoos to collect magic dust so they can snort it up and wake up from an acid-trip coma and be back in the real world again.

""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is a shining example of why I didn\'t readily take to it: the humour is too goofy, and is over-reliant on randomness and exaggeration rather than wit.The ""plot"" of ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" involves a martial artist, an actor, and a female military otaku with a tank (please don\'t ask me to explain) being summoned to a fantasy land with elves and stuff. Unfortunately for them (as well as for me, as it meant...I had to watch this crap), the spell to send them back misfired, breaking up into small fragments in the process. The spell fragments scattered across the land and tattooed themselves onto the skins of random elves. Naturally, in order to collect these spell fragments and go home, our ""heroes"" has to go around stripping any elves they come across.The above synopsis pretty much speaks itself, but allow me the luxury of being explicit - if I were to sum up this show with a single word, that word would be ""stupid"". ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is all about stupid actions from stupid characters in stupid situations resulting in stupid comedy. The comedy is so forced that the show often make no sense unless you go all meta on it: why do they only strip female elves? (Meta answer: because the makers thought the show would be funnier with sexual assault undertones). And why do the other characters never rein in Junpei (the martial artist with more brawn than brain), and instead allow him to go around stripping elves with all the aggression of a serial rapist? (Meta answer: because about 90% of the jokes in this show would disappear if the female characters just asked the elves nicely instead.) Even Junpei himself doesn\'t seem to have an ulterior motives for stripping elves - he seems more interested in curry than naked elf chicks.It\'s hard to think of another show with so much goofball comedy - in one of the episodes the characters actually comments on this themselves. So if you\'re not one of Those Who Hunt for Goofy Comedy, is there anything in ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" that\'s worth seeing? The answer is not much. The show may be also classed as a fantasy, but Those Who are Hunting for Good Fantasy will find this lacking. Fantasy elements are used in the settings, but there\'s not much beyond that. And though there is also some action in the show, it\'s lousy at best.As far as archetypes go, Junpei pushes the stereotypical ""stupid brawler"" kind of character to subhuman levels of stupidity, although the constant banter between between him and Celsia (the elf responsible for summoning the outsiders into her world) can be quite amusing - it\'s probably the highlight of the whole show. Occasionally, the shows tries for some more serious character development, but due to the insane humour of the show, these attempts failed miserably with no exceptions.I do find the character designs in the show to be quite attractive, but the visuals looks pretty low budget in general. The sound production isn\'t great either; the background music is very quiet compared to the voices, and when I turned up the volume, I found the music flat and not worthy of attention.To conclude, ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is made by people with a poor sense of humour, for people with a poor sense of humour.

While some of the recurring gags are actually funny, the story is completely contrived and repetitive, and the characters are rather unlikeable. Add annoying opening and closing songs, and the eye cancer that is late \'90s anime design, and the end result is the kind of series that one watches because they\'re bored and have nothing better to see.The positives here are cartoony violence and seeing the inept characters deal with bizarre situations before they strip the female elf of the week.

If this all doesn\'t appeal to you though, then don\'t even bother with this series. elves, but if you\'re into that kind of thing, well, there\'s plenty of elf nudity to satisfy your desires, as well.

It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over.Lets talk about the characters, shall we? There is a young high school girl named Ritsuko who seems to have a tank and tons of guns and ammo. How a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Her character is a bit duncy and slightly annoying at times because she is a...natural high school student with a military fedish. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he takes the cake. All he seems to care about is food and his high and mighty actress, Airi. He always fights Ritsuko and just… I can’t deal with him. Airi is so high and mighty about being an actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well for the comedy that they are trying to keep.Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2. Seriously, I just feel they did what they did at the ending to make more money with the second season.The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously.The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I don’t know but it feels way too serious for what it actually is. I love the dubs script since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script a lot. The voices on the other hand really fail at times making characters hard to take seriously when they need to be or just plain annoying. Sometimes characters seem to of been given given new voice actors who have no idea how to actually act. Many times they end up yelling way too loudly. They seem more like Bible Black in some aspects but luckily they don’t go into sexual stuff… well, not that badly.It’s fun to watch, but trust me that it isn’t the best. It’s rather laughable that works with the comedy but they can’t do a serious scene when they really need it.

The anime adaptation was handled by Group TAC. Yes, the studio behind Arashi n Yoru ni & Shinigami no Ballad. It came out in the mid 90s and has been largely forgotten. I've actually seen this one before and, from what  I recall, there's a good reason for that. So, I'll re-watch it and go over the tawdry details.Story:Our tale takes place in a fantasy world where a trio from our world, Ritsuko the high school girl with a bunch of gun, karate maniac Junpei & the actress...Airi. After a ritual to get them home fails, they find themselves looking for the fragments which have made their way to the bodies of various elves. Naturally, this means they have to strip attractive elven ladies to search for them. Because class is something completely foreign to this series.Now, I could point out the obvious flaws with the narrative. Like that they know a respected elf elder and could easily organise a non-obtrusive screening to find the fragments or that Ritsuko shouldn't have a bunch of guns and tank since she's Japanese, not American and the Japanese don't sell that shit at the nearest Wal-mart for “hunting varmints.” But it's a comedy and the obvious response to that would be “who cares if it's funny?” Therein lies the problem. This series isn't funny.  It's humour is based around three things. Yagami indulging his fetish for elves being stripped, rampant stupidity & lamp shading the tropes that they use that are characteristic of terribly written fantasy. The first just comes across as juvenile & crass. The second as juvenile and the third is just terrible writing. Lamp shading can work when it's paired with some kind of intelligent critique or strong parody but this series wouldn't know intelligence if it danced in its face and its parody aspect is, at best, the vague “this is a thing that gets used sometimes” type. Consequently, it fails at that variety of humour as well.Characters:The cast in this is just a bunch of dull, one-dimensional archetypes. Which, to be fair, could work for a comedy if they meshed well together for comedic purposes. Unfortunately, this series can't be bothered. Their interactions mostly consist of “how do we strip this elf?” “let's do this thing” and some petty bickering that's not entertaining.Art:The obvious issue with the artwork is the heavy emphasis on Yagami's fetish. That, however, isn't the only issue. The action sequences are slow and boring. The attempts at exaggerated comedic expression are just obvious and over done. I guess I can give it some credit for the character designs being decent, but that's about it.Sound:The series did get some good actors. Mitsuishi Kotono, Tomizawa Michie, Miyamura Yuko & Seki Tomokazu are the major characters. So, we've got Moon & Mars. But their performances in this are decidedly of the “barely competent” variety. Which, to be fair to the actors, is kind of inevitable when you have characters who just have nothing to them and the direction demands comedic exaggeration for humourless drivel. Then we have the music. This is the one area where I can give the series some actual praise. The opening and ending theme tunes are genuinely good. The incidental music is just mediocre but those theme tunes are worth checking out by themselves.Ho-yay:There's one scene where an elf thinks that Ritsuko & Airi are trying to hit on her because they're checking her out in a bath house but that's about it.Final Thoughts:Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi is trite rubbish. It's designed to appeal to young, heterosexual teenage boys who don't know any better and people who have an elf fetish and can use the supposed comedy as an excuse to indulge it. If neither of those describes you, I can't recommend it. Just look up the theme tunes. I give it a wag of my finger and a 2/10. Next week, Cowboy Bebop. Airi.

Like that they know a respected elf elder and could easily organise a non-obtrusive screening to find the fragments or that Ritsuko shouldn't have a bunch of guns and tank since she's Japanese, not American and the Japanese don't sell that shit at the nearest Wal-mart for “hunting varmints.” But it's a comedy and the obvious response to that would be “who cares if it's funny?” Therein lies the problem. This series isn't funny.  It's humour is based around three things. Yagami indulging his fetish for elves being stripped, rampant stupidity & lamp shading the tropes that they use that are characteristic of terribly written fantasy. The first just comes across as juvenile & crass. The second as juvenile and the third is just terrible writing. Lamp shading can work when it's paired with some kind of intelligent critique or strong parody but this series wouldn't know intelligence if it danced in its face and its parody aspect is, at best, the vague “this is a thing that gets used sometimes” type. Consequently, it fails at that variety of humour as well.Characters:The cast in this is just a bunch of dull, one-dimensional archetypes. Which, to be fair, could work for a comedy if they meshed well together for comedic purposes. Unfortunately, this series can't be bothered. Their interactions mostly consist of “how do we strip this elf?” “let's do this thing” and some petty bickering that's not entertaining.Art:The obvious issue with the artwork is the heavy emphasis on Yagami's fetish. That, however, isn't the only issue. The action sequences are slow and boring. The attempts at exaggerated comedic expression are just obvious and over done. I guess I can give it some credit for the character designs being decent, but that's about it.Sound:The series did get some good actors. Mitsuishi Kotono, Tomizawa Michie, Miyamura Yuko & Seki Tomokazu are the major characters. So, we've got Moon & Mars. But their performances in this are decidedly of the “barely competent” variety. Which, to be fair to the actors, is kind of inevitable when you have characters who just have nothing to them and the direction demands comedic exaggeration for humourless drivel. Then we have the music. This is the one area where I can give the series some actual praise. The opening and ending theme tunes are genuinely good. The incidental music is just mediocre but those theme tunes are worth checking out by themselves.Ho-yay:There's one scene where an elf thinks that Ritsuko & Airi are trying to hit on her because they're checking her out in a bath house but that's about it.Final Thoughts:Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi is trite rubbish. It's designed to appeal to young, heterosexual teenage boys who don't know any better and people who have an elf fetish and can use the supposed comedy as an excuse to indulge it. If neither of those describes you, I can't recommend it. Just look up the theme tunes. I give it a wag of my finger and a 2/10. Next week, Cowboy Bebop."", 'Have you ever seen those kids that hit other for no reason, throw stones at cats and then laught like it is fun somehow. Its called sociopathy and that is the whole point of this show.Basicaly 3 people drive around and attack women making them strip publicaly (no real nudity in this show) even tho there is no reason to make it publicly, they hit women in this show like its the most natural. They get in fight sometimes but those are always look like they beating people up and that is super boring.But there is no drama and that is a plus.. well...that is if you dont think that that elf got blown up in episode 3. I mean they just show her steping on a bomb, then explosion, and our heroes drive away because aperently nobody cares what happen to that elf. Then other episode they strip an elf naked in cold, bind her to a tree and throw into a river.. and that all is posed as a joke.. disturbing.I know there enough sociopath around for this show to survive, but i personaly find this show disturbing.

I thought the 1st episode was decent fish people let you know they were in a alternate world, but then why is this lady camping on a mountain with a machine gun? Or a tank with the 2nd episode. Where does it come from? The male main character must have a boner every minute because he's always imagining females naked being a puppy dog to airi their 3rd companion. I think it had a lot of potential, but celsia's the only main character pushing the storyline....If they didn't include Junpei I could stomach it. But for some reason he's super strong, well also being the reason they are where they are. And only Celsia seemed to care. If they didn't include Junpei I could stomach it.

Hime Chen! Otogi Chikku Idol Lilpri,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8206/Hime_Chen_Otogi_Chikku_Idol_Lilpri,"[""This review is based off watching the Cantonese DubArt - 10 pointFor art, I give FULL 10 points. The main girls are Lilpris (Little Princesses) Ringo (Apple), Natsuki, and Layla. The girls are CHIBI CUTE! Their cuteness are off the meter. The girls also have a shoujo form they can transform into with magic, turning into singing idols. They look PRETTY, whole lot better than your average shoujo girl, even if I prefer their Chibi form. As for the supporting cast, they are all divese, wonderful characters mainly from Fairyland.Story - 9 pointThe story is extremely enjoyable. Embrace yourself into a fairy tale, shoujo story....To begin, Fairyland is in trouble and disappearing from the world. The Queen sent the magical animals Sei, Ryoku, and Dai to Earth to find 3 girls that can restore Fairyland. They found and became pets to Ringo, Natsuki, and Layla, granting them the magical power to be Lilpris. From there, the girls can collect Happiness Tones from humans to restore Fairlyland by transforming into Lilpri singing idols which cheers everyone up. They do a dance with a song which gives off a charming, magical power that spreads the idea of love and peace. Quite fairy tale don't you think? :D The dance is childish and girly, but cute. The song they sing is great too. I like it! The girls go on lots of fun, from slice of life, to magical adventure and are widely accomodated by the supporting cast. They come across all kinds of people and activities they cheerfully engage with. The girls are so cute you'll love whatever they do. I particularly love the Little Red Riding Hood episode. You got Chibi Red Riding Hood, everyone was adorable, and it was funny. You get a good experience with each episode.Characters - 8 pointThe girls are pure, cute, and adorable. That's all that really matters here. All the characters each have their own personality and I enjoy seeing their interaction.Sound - 8 pointI liked the opening and endings especially Opening #2 Idolulu and Ending #2 Vira Vira Virou! I've watched the Cantonese dub for this anime and the VAs are fantastic. Who said dubs aren't good? I give my Hong Kong VAs A+ for doing such a good job! The girls' voices are so cute, made me want to watch this anime even more.Enjoyment - 9 pointI liked watching it! I never thought I would enjoy or EVEN watch a shoujo. Sometimes I ask myself what the hell is wrong with me? This is for kids and girls. This is like boys playing dolls. I really was hesitant at first. It was hard for me to accept, but I'm glad I selected to watch this anime.BEST CHOICE I made this summer! To begin, Fairyland is in trouble and disappearing from the world.

But I wanted to watch something light and happy and cute and that\'s what I got. It provided me with a light wind down and made me giggle and think ""That\'s so cute!"" because there are no innuendos or overly sexualized characters. Its for kids who wouldn\'t care nor understand the concept of moe, so its not any thing close to Yui from K-On although there is a klutzy one.Its very Powerpuff Girls-esque  that its just three girls that instead of saving Townsvill they sing songs and dream of being idols. On that...note I did not enjoy the kid of CG performances form the characters which looked obviously three dimensional compared to the rest of the 2-D show. And the fact that there is no real antagonist as of yet, its a fun show that I hope will develop as well as the Puricure franchise. note I did not enjoy the kid of CG performances form the characters which looked obviously three dimensional compared to the rest of the 2-D show.

Oh, did i mention the animation is top notch?Less speedlines, still images & great action scenes.', 'Jinzou Ningen Kikaider: The Animation\xa0is based off of a live action tokusatsu series from the 70s. The anime version came out nearly three decades after the live action. Which might seem weird, but if you think about it, Hollywood does the same thing all the time in terms of mining old properties to make a quick buck off of the fanbase. It usually goes very badly. Let\'s see if Radix, the studio behind Divergence Eve & Haibane Renmei, did better.Story:We open with Doctor Komyoji working in his lab in a scene reminiscent of Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen.)\xa0 Meanwhile, his children are reading the story of...Pinocchio, which I\'m sure will not tie into anything that happens whatsoever. And if you buy that, I can sell you some prime subaqueous real estate for low, low prices. An explosion happens when he tries to bring his creation to life. His daughter discovers notes on what he was doing, trying to create a sentient android. Shortly afterwards, his children encounter Jiro, that selfsame android, and their adventures together begin.My biggest problem with the series is the pacing. Jiro meets the siblings at the end of the first episode and then he takes off by the end of the second but we\'re supposed to buy into the idea that they managed to really bond in that short time. They couldn\'t have skipped the useless recap episode and just given us one to illustrate that bond before he gets driven off? Why is there even a recap episode in a thirteen episode series? Maybe because this series has a general issue with trite, lazy writing. The romantic sub-plot is another example. We have two characters who barely get to know one another before becoming romantically entangled. But it\'s obvious that it\'s going to happen because every event unfolds in precisely the most clichéd way possible.But I can\'t be too harsh on the series for that since the live action was made for children and it\'s obviously trying not to age things up too much. Although it does go for a more teenage audience and probably should have put a bit more effort into the writing to reflect that.I will give the series some credit for addressing difficult questions like ""what makes a soul?"" or ""why is it important to feel things like sorrow?"" And the series doesn\'t address them badly, this isn\'t Detroit. There\'s an actual degree of competence to it. It still handles them in a kind of simplistic and non-challenging way, but it\'s pretty adequate for the target audience.Characters:There isn\'t much to say about the characters in this. The protagonists are basic archetypes, the antagonists are pretty much evil for the evils with a few exceptions who they try to be sympathetic with, but they execute it in completely obvious, unimaginative ways. At least none of the characters are awful. The one who comes closest is Masaru because he\'s the child character who\'s there to get into sticky situations and yearn for attention. And that type of character is always annoying when written by the trope.Art:The artwork in this is just very low effort. If I hadn\'t looked up basic information beforehand, I would\'ve thought the anime was made maybe three years after the live action ended. It looks like an anime from the 70s with stiff movements, awkward facial expressions (with dull surprise being the most common emotion on display), a bunch of slow, panning shots and reused animation to cut down on costs. Did Radix have literally no budget for this or did they think that making it look like an old anime would be appropriate since it\'s based off of an old show?If the series had wanted to pay homage to old anime by using the general art style, I\'d be fine with that. I think you could make it look good. Osomatsu-san\xa0managed that pretty well. But when you include all the lazy, cost cutting tropes all you do is make it look horrendously outdated. And give the impression that you decided that quality was just too expensive to bother with.Sound:The actors get into the spirit of the series pretty well. They have those somewhat over the top, bombastic performances that are so commonplace in those tokusatsu series like Kamen Rider or Super Sentai.\xa0Which I\'m completely okay with although maybe Kikaider is more subtle and this aspect really annoyed the fans. I haven\'t seen the live action, so I don\'t know. They got some pretty strong people for this as well. Like Horie Yui. Kosugi Juurouta & Seki Tomokazu. Wada Kaoru\'s music is pretty good. Maybe not as strong as what he did for 3x3 Eyes, but still good.Ho-yay:There is none to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. Replace the Recap episode with an episode between the first and second. Like I said, Jiro\'s dynamic with the siblings doesn\'t work particularly well as is and I think you could greatly improve it by giving us even one episode to build it up.2. Remove the romantic sub-plot. Honestly, it adds nothing of value and it\'s poorly executed. You might as well just let the characters develop a strong friendship instead of adding pointless romance.3. Give the animation some budget. Like I said, having a modern anime with a 70s style can be good. Having one with all the shitty, cost-cutting measures and such included is always going to look bad.Final Thoughts:Jinzou Ningen Kikaider\xa0is not a bad anime. Yeah, it has some serious problems but, ultimately, they\'re problems that don\'t make it difficult to watch or annoying. They\'re problems that lead to it being bog standard and a bit dull. Which is what we end up getting. A series that\'s predictable, not very compelling and just very mediocre. Which is why I give it a 5/10 If you\'re a huge fan of live action Sentai shows and the more solo-oriented variety like Kamen Rider\xa0you might have a grand time with this in spite of the various issues.

Bakuten Shoot Beyblade G Revolution,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1668/Bakuten_Shoot_Beyblade_G_Revolution,"[""(Second review! Eeep!)Story: Though the story for this season is a bit overused, it holds true to its constant surprises and keeping people wondering what will happen next. Finally gaining some more depth than season one or two, many things happen to show that everything has changed and that life goes on whether they like it or not. Some Shonen-ai hints,generally almost non-existant,  might be detected both in the Japanese and English versions, but this is more of a best friend thing compared to anything serious,turning out to be quite touching. I also found the speeches that Takao (Tyson) gave more realistic and down...to earth. Story gets an 8.Animation: A definite improvment from season two and a 200% improvment from season one, the characters finally look their age, although at the end they are drawn considerably more mature. The battle scenes are smooth and bring a huge impact, even though some do repeat themselves. But that is compenstated by the great attention to detail, both on the Bit-Beasts, on the characters, on the blades and on the background. This is even more impressive as the show is Shonen so it deserves its 10.Sound: New tournaments, new music. The standarts haven't dropped from the previous two seasons. A variety of new sound brings some freshness into the show, adding impact to the various scenes. Deserves a 9.Character: The biggest surprise is how much the charecters have matured, both physicaly and emotionaly. I was also pleased to find that none of their characteristics were too drastically changed, from the brooding/dark Kai to the happy-go-lucky Takao(Tyson). More about them is found out throught this final season, about regrets that never seemed to be there, a new wave of overprotectivness and the discovery of lost family members. This final season brings out the best in all of them, though at first you might find cheering for those you never thought you would. A 10 all the way!Enjoyment: It gives you that feeling of wanting to find out more. More often than not you might find yourself standing with your fist raised in the air yelling 'YESS!!' so that your brother or sister look at you strangely. More exciting than real sport and more magic than in any normal-kid anime this is definitely something you should check out.Overall: A very nice, full ending to the whole series, this final season brings everything to a close while at the same time leaving quite an open- ended ending, so at the same time you get that feeling of satisfaction and dissatisfaction which brings a pleasant mix of emotions. Many things complement each other and you just can't help but feel that yes, this series is awesome!If you like competion, sports, friendship, rivalry and and a bunch of cute guys this anime is fo you^^  And so a 10 is granted.[When I say shonen-ai hints, I am refering to one of the love/hate relationships that is considered by many Japanese magazines as Canon. Please do not bash my review because of this.] to earth.

Though in my opinion the story could of been better, it still contains many breathtaking moments whilst is goes way more in-depth than it did with the first two seasons. The dialogue has also improved quite a bit in this...season, along with more emotional moments being included.Animation/Artwork: To be honest, I\'d say this season has the best animation out of all the original series; it just looks pretty damn stunning. I really can\'t see how they could improve the animation from this show in all honesty (ok, they kinda did for the metal saga, but that\'s a different story). As for artwork, I could say exactly the same, apart from certain character designs which I\'m not really a fan of (key word: certain... as in some). You can read more about my character opinions down below, though.Sound:Sound Effects: The SEs in this season in my opinion are a huge improvement over the first two seasons; they sound way more realistic etc.Voices: Not really much different from the previous seasons, and to be honest, I prefer the original voices better, as they just suited each character in my opinion. This doesn\'t mean I don\'t like the voices in this season; I still think they\'re pretty great, just not as good :PMusic: Now the music from this season is arguably the best from the series. With tracks such as ""Rise Above the Storm"" and ""I\'m Not Going Down"", this show has tracks everyone of all ages will love! Also, may I add that every song plays at the exact right time and fits in with the scene they play in perfectly.10/10 for sound.Character: Personally, I\'m gonna have to rate the characters overall an 8/10. Why? At first I was gonna rate the character a solid 10, but looking back to how the creators made certain characters weak in this season (such as Lee, Tala, Michael and so on), the fact that some of the good characters from the first two seasons were left out (or us rarely being able to see them), and that certain characters\' designs suck compared to previous seasons (but it isn\'t a major deal, I guess). I could go on about negative points about some of the older characters, but bleh. Again, this is just my opinion.As for everything else however, I have no problem at all; most characters, if not all matured quite a lot by the end (and not as annoying as previous seasons (for example: V-Force\'s Tyson)) and even more! Apart from some of the characters being made weaker, this season definitely tries its best to bring out the best in each character.Again, an 8/10 for character.Enjoyment: Very enjoyable show, and honestly I find it way better than just watching your average sport on TV. 10/10. Nothing else to really say here, apart from go and look at the other segments of this review for more information and opinions (saves me repeating stuff, etc).Overall: This was, in my opinion, an almost perfect ending, if not a perfect ending to the original Beyblade series. Great story, good enough characters, amazing soundtrack, it has it all! I really do wish they\'d make a sequel to this season, but judging by the pretty much perfect ending, I doubt it\'d happen.As for other general negative points about this anime... I really can\'t think of anything, haha.Overall I\'d rate this season (and probably the whole series, actually) a 10/10.If you\'re into competition, sports, friendship, rivalry, want a lot of lovable characters and a lot of action, then this anime is definitely for you!Could have made this review quite a bit longer if I wanted to, but I figured it\'d be way too much to read, so I\'ll leave it at this.Oh and did I mention... Original Beyblade is still one of my favorite anime to date :3 (...I just find it too nostalgic to let it drift away from me ok?! ;~;) season, along with more emotional moments being included.Animation/Artwork: To be honest, I\'d say this season has the best animation out of all the original series; it just looks pretty damn stunning.

Original Beyblade is still one of my favorite anime to date :3 (...I just find it too nostalgic to let it drift away from me ok?! ;~;)', 'Story 8/10This season does away with the generic subplot of ""badguy tries to steal bitbeasts"" that Season 2 and the end of Season 1 was about and instead focuses on what made the Beyblade series as a whole an enjoyable watch: watching very likeable and realistic characters that you feel emotionally invested in participate in a sport that they are passionate about while developing as people. Throughout this season, there aren\'t really any ""bad guys"" - just conflicting views and different personalities, which makes the season as a whole very unique in comparison to similar anime.The first arc takes up two thirds of the season...and follows the World Tournament circuit, with Tyson as the main focal point. This is a nice change, since Tyson, as likeable as he was, did not receive much explicit character development in the first two seasons. The main characters from the season prior go their separate ways which allows for interesting new developments in their character arcs. While I was happy with the finale of this arc, I think that it would have been even better if the outcome was the opposite, as it would have rounded off the character arcs very nicely and given some pretty useful life lessons to both the characters involved and the viewers.The second and final arc sees Boris return and supposedly tries to turn a new leaf by establishing a professional beyblading organisation, BEGA. The gang suspect something fishy and end up having to battle BEGA\'s top bladers to save the day. Stakes get high during the final battle. I thought that this . arc, while short, was pretty well done thanks to the addition of characters Brooklyn and Garland, but I was left puzzled by Hiro\'s actions and Boris\' true motivation.Art 8/10The art and choreography significantly improves in this season, and gets even better as it progresses and battles become even more intense. Character designs, in terms of art, are very good and makes each character feel more personable as opposed to the gimmicky artworks of many characters in Season 1 and the generic designs of Sesaon 2. Compare Brooklyn\'s design to Zeo\'s. Zeo\'s design is generic and boring, whereas Brooklyn\'s really has the subtle aura and represents his character very well. They  put a lot more effort into the art in this season, and it paid off well.The battles are much better in this season. The Bitbeasts\' abilities seem a lot more creative like in Season 1, but have the updated graphics to make them better. Even the clashing of the beyblades themselves feels both more realistic and more impactful. There was a weird part at the end of the first arc and the whole of the second arc where it seemed that characters were also fighting with their beyblades, but I interpreted this as just how it seemed to be in the view of the battlers.Sound 8/10While a lot of the soundtrack from the previous seasons were reused in this season, there were new songs added which were a welcomed addition. Voice acting seemed to improve from the first two seasons too. You can tell even through their voices that the characters have matured throughout their ordeals in the past and they do a really good job at portraying how the characters are feeling.Characters 9/10As said before, the characters are what makes this show as good as it is. This season does what season 2 did not, and focuses mainly on the characters and their growth as people. It was great seeing many old characters from the White Tigers, the All Stars and the Demolition Boys in this season with their own roles to play and updated. However, it was strange how characters from season 2, such as Zeo, Kane\'s team and the Saint Shields, never returned outside of the ending song in the final episode - let alone even being mentioned. I will go into detail on characters which I felt were important to discuss.Tyson: Throughout the first arc, Tyson deals with the pressure of being the World Champion and the strain that it begins to have on his performance. Tyson doesn\'t understand the actions that his friends took at first, most likely due to underlying abandonment issues, but through time gets to realise why they did what they did. He begins to realise that he needed his old friends not only for their skills, but also to keep him in check. Last season taught Tyson not to slack off and get lazy, and he doesn\'t, but this season is all about Tyson maturing as a person - which he does by the end of the first arc thanks to the support of his new teammates.  G-Revolution is basically Tyson learning to stand on his own and be a mentor and friend instead of constantly acting like a champion.Kai: Kai\'s character arc in the first arc is him dedicating everything towards being the best - and he achieves it. With the exception of Ray (who he defeats anyway) and Tyson (who he only narrowly loses to while being handicapped), Kai easily defeats all of his opponents. I think that Kai begins to miss the Bladebreakers, though he never admits this, as seen through his interactions with them when they battle in the tournament. In the end of the second arc, Kai really displays how much he\'s grown as a blader and in spirit.Daichi: Most people dislike Daichi because he can be loud, obnoxious, and they would prefer Tyson just team up with his old friends again because Daichi is new. While I don\'t particularly like Daichi that much (I don\'t mind him), I think he was a good addition to the series. It means Tyson has to step up as a mentor, and we see this through Daichi\'s development as a character. He also makes a contrast between the other characters to show us how much they have grown.Max: Max\'s character arc in this season takes his development of confidence and skill from the previous seasons and puts him in a new team where he has to step up as the star player, while being the only person to put his foot down and talk back to Rick, who is (for lack of better words) a dick. The Max we once knew grew up and begins acting like a leader and this was very heartwarming to watch. He also learns some things from Rick too, and the two form a sweet bond.Rei: Unlike Max and like Tyson, Rei has no one to contest him on his team because he is easily the most skilled. He tries to act out of character as a strict and tough leader, which probably stems from his lack of self-confidence as he tries to behave like someone he isn\'t for what he thinks is the best for the team. Rei learns his lesson throughout the tournament and by the end of it reignites his bond with Lee and the rest of the team, who feel more like a family than any other team. By the time Rei finally gains full confidence, he is able to put up incredible battles against Tyson, Kai and Crusher.Brooklyn: Brooklyn was a great addition to the series. He is a born genius that became the best through natural talent and his overpowered bitbeast Zeus. My theory is that either Zeus corrupts or lives inside Brooklyn (like Naruto and the Kyubi), or that Brooklyn is actually Zeus in human form. Brooklyn\'s design tells a lot about him: he wears white and gold which are known to be colours of divinity and purity. This represents Brooklyn\'s god complex, and when comparing it to his black and red blade, colours that represent rage and despair, can show the internal conflict within Brooklyn that we see later in the series. The main characters are supposed to be the answer to help Brooklyn. During his 2nd battle with Kai and his battle with Tyson you can see that they are being overpowered yet they are always getting up to which Brooklyn reacts maliciously as if he is denying his own freedom. During his final battle with Tyson, Brooklyn becomes insane and shows his true colours. We find out what he really is aiming for: freedom. Depression was shown during his childhood and acceptance is shown when he finally calms and enjoys his battle with Tyson. TL;DR, OP character done right!Tala and Hiro: Tala and Hiro were perhaps the only characters who I think were wasted. I expected Tala to play a bigger role in both parts of the season, but he took a more back-seat approach and being used as a benchmark to observe other blader\'s progress in skill. He is still a respectable battler, but the cold, fierce, overpowering Tala from Season 1 is not present here. I expected him to battle in the final part of the season, and while he does contribute, he is again used to show how powerful the opponents are. Hiro had a lot of potential as Tyson\'s brother, and while he does help Tyson with a lot of personal development in the first arc, his actions in the second arc make absolutely no sense.Enjoyment 10/10While I am personally biased as I loved beyblade as a kid, I can honestly say I loved G Revolution still today. Watching these characters develop and solve realistic problems while keeping up with what makes them passionate is very relatable, and really makes the viewer emotionally invested. Easily the best season of the series.Overall 8/10 and follows the World Tournament circuit, with Tyson as the main focal point. This is a nice change, since Tyson, as likeable as he was, did not receive much explicit character development in the first two seasons.

Watching these characters develop and solve realistic problems while keeping up with what makes them passionate is very relatable, and really makes the viewer emotionally invested. Easily the best season of the series.Overall 8/10', 'The pinnacle of the first generation of the Beyblade anime.I started watching Beyblade again solely out of nostalgia.  I watched the original season of Beyblade as a kid and thought it would be nice to go back to and I\'m glad I did.  What started out fine but nothing special with the first season, became kinda bad with the second season, actually ended on a high note with this third outing.For those who don\'t know, the ""first generation"", more commonly known as ""gen 1"" or ""plastic gen"", is the collective name given to the original three seasons of the Beyblade anime.  Namely,...Beyblade, Beyblade V-Force and Beyblade G Revolution.Having now watched all three, I can firmly say that G Revolution is the best of them all and a fitting end to the OG run of the anime.In G Revolution, the forever main character, Tyson, is excited to enter a new Beyblade tournament with his team of friends, known as the Bladebreakers.  However, when it\'s announced that there are going to be some rule changes in the tournament, his friends decide it would be best to leave the Bladebreakers, and join their old teams for the purpose of battling Tyson themselves and proving how good they really are.What follows is one large tournament arc and to be perfectly honest, that\'s what works best for a Beyblade story.  When it tries to delve into lore or introduce a big bad villain/end of the world scenario, it\'s just not very interesting.  Thankfully, G Revolution steers clear of that.While you may think that a show spanning tournament arc would not leave any room for character depth or development, it actually does a pretty good job of conveying those aspects of the story quite well.  There is some actual, believable character growth here and it was nice to see.  Not just main characters either, some side characters get their fair share too.  It was also impressive that these side characters had their own motivations and back story.An anime such as this, lives or dies on the quality of the battles.  I\'m pleased to say that G Revolution has by far the best battle in gen 1.  They are flashy, well animated and because characters are physically active participants (they control their Beyblades with body movements etc.), there are actual steaks and consequences, beyond simply losing a match.Don\'t get me wrong, G Revolution isn\'t perfect by no means.  The overall story is a very simple one and the tried and tested ""power of friendship"" trope permeates pretty much every aspect of the anime, although, not egregiously so.All in all, for an early 2000s anime with a young target audience and the purpose of selling spinning tops, it\'s remarkable that it\'s this enjoyable and fun.  Well worth a watch.

Back Street Girls: Gokudolls,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36873/Back_Street_Girls__Gokudolls,"[""This anime is critically underrated.  Perhaps it's just my twisted sense of humor, but this was a classic for me.  It goes right along in the same vein as anime like Prison School, Detroit Metal City and Magical With Punie Chan.  It's hilarious torture comedy.  I do understand that the weirdness of it will turn off many, since the plot surrounds manly Yakuza being turned into idols under threat of death, but people should really give it a chance, because it is hilarious.Another thing that probably turns people off is the poor animation style, which even I didn't think...was all that great, as it looks kind of like a cheaply drawn animated manga, more than anime, but if you get past that, the jokes will have you dying.  Especially in later episodes.  In fact, this is probably the only idol related anime I've ever watched to completion and gave a high score to.It's definitely dirty, raunchy, vulgar comedy, strictly for adults, but if you enjoy that kind of comedy, then you will love this anime.

I was instantly excited to see how everything would unfold in the show and I actually got what I had expected and a little more.For a sketch comedy, the story was good in that it was entertaining and a lot of the skits had an inter-connectivity to them and a lot characters that appeared early on aren\'t just there to serve the purpose of the joke being portrayed in that particular sketch alone. One drawback to the story is that there...isn\'t a strong conclusion to the season although it isn\'t too detrimental given the nature of the show. Also comedy is subjective and there are definitely some jokes that may be hit or miss depending on who the viewer is.When it comes the art and animation, the art is actually fine and it lends itself well to the comedy of Back Street Girls: Gokudolls, especially when it comes to what is done with the characters\' facial expressions. However it is the animation of the show that is actually atrocious to the point where one almost wants to think it\'s intentional. Even if that was the case, there is not much excuse for the amount of shaky camera use I saw used in the show.The sound for the show is pretty standard with a small exception in that because this show is based around a cast of Idol ""girls"", the insert songs you would hear the main characters sing were interesting, catchy and the lyrics were actually very funny as well. Also the Opening and Ending songs for the show ended up being some favorites of mine from the current season.The characters will definitely be a draw for many people when watching Back Street Girls: Gokudolls. Whether it is the three former yakuza now turned idol girls, their boss Inugane or the many side characters that end up affected in some way or fashion by the Gokudolls.In conclusion, Back Street Girls: Gokudolls is a show that I think will probably stay underrated. However I wholeheartedly enjoyed it despite its flaws and would encourage anyone reading this to give this anime a try! isn\'t a strong conclusion to the season although it isn\'t too detrimental given the nature of the show.

Instead of...forcing our trio to commit subaru, sudoku and seppuku, he gives them one last chance. All they have to do, is go to Thailand, cut off their penises and become j-pop idols. I am not sure if this is a popular outcome in the East. I do know in the West, they tend to become speedrunners for Games Done Quick. After this, the downhill starts.Turns out our main dudes turn literally into cute idol girls. I was expecting some type of muscular male-girl hybrids, such at the show from last season 'Mahou Shoujo Ore', introduced. The design alone was a letdown.Our characters personalities are not much better.. or behavior if you prefer to as they don't really have personalities. In the public, they act like idols, and in private more like the yakuza dudes they once were. Occasionally they mix these two sides of them to each others and can make a cute anime girl sound when they were supposed to act manly. Detroit Metal City was massively successful when it came to dealing with 2 different personalities under personal life and show business. Back Street Girls is the combination of meh and eh.The events center around some sort of parodies. For one, it introduces shonen training arc cliches to show how these dudes became idols. Unfortunately, all of these are mainly just ideas and have no content or actual jokes to backup any of it with. Practically every event that occurs can be labeled with one word, not because words that perfectly describe these events exist, but because there simply is nothing more to the events itself.Not a single thing in the series is as over the top and absurd as the settings and synopsis make it sound. This is just shitty comedy which settings only exist so more people would watch it. It fooled me, so do yourself a favor and skip this one. forcing our trio to commit subaru, sudoku and seppuku, he gives them one last chance.

For years it\'s given us many enjoyable shows such as all three entires of the Love Live franchise, Bang Dream, D4DJ, Revue Starlight and Zombieland Saga. So what happens when three members of the yazuka become idols? Well you wouldn\'t want to know, because Backstreet Girls: Gokudolls is complete and utter transphobic garbage!The premise has already been stated, but I\'ll restate it since so it\'s fresh in your mind: three yazuka get surgery to become idols because they let down their boss. Throughout this show there are only two jokes, the first one being that all of the...girls in this anime are actually men because isn\'t transphobia just the funniest thing in the world? There\'s one scene where one of the girls is with someone who she knew before transitioning and he tells her that she\'ll always be a man to him and she THANKS him for it in earnest. Then in another scene later on in the show one of the executives drops a girl off when he realizes he can use teenagers instead. He says, and I shit you not, ""Though they made you look pretty through surgery you\'ll never be as pretty as a real girl."" I shouldn\'t have to explain why that\'s a disgusting statement to make, and what\'s worse is that is played for comedy. This show attacks a marlizinated group for the sake of a punchline and it\'s not even remotely funny. Hell in the opening the faces of the men who the girls used to be are plastered on their new bodies. Again, very funny. Hating on trans people is SO funny isn\'t it? Laugh please!But wait this show has another joke, and that\'s the fact that these cutesy idols are saying such crude things. At first, yeah seeing these girls say super inappropriate things was kinda funny but it got old fast. This show has a problem with repeating it\'s humor and using it to much to the point where it just ends up falling flat on its face. Instead of using it\'s comedy sparingly this show beats it\'s two jokes down to the ground with no room to breathe. Say whatever you want about something like Konosuba, at least that didn\'t only have two jokes and one of said jokes wasn\'t incredibly transphobic.The ""animation"" if you can even call it that is as ugly as the show. There isn\'t even any animation, it\'s just a slideshow with some lip flaps moving, which is made worse by the fact that the art in said slides isn\'t even pleasant to look at. If this is the quality that Gokushufudou fans are getting for the upcoming anime I feel terrible for them. The voice acting (dubbed) is really good but that\'s to be expected from all three of the main actresses who all have very impressive resumes. The music is very forgettable and bland, and nothing to write home about.All in all Back Street Girls: Gokudolls is a disgusting anime that fails both as a comedy and as an idol anime. If you want an idol anime that does things differently please go watch Zombieland Saga or Revue Starlight instead.

It's a very divisive show and even though I gave it an 8/10, I can see something as low as a 3/10 being totally reasonable.Art and Animation: 8/10Yeah. You saw that right. Now, I concede, this anime doesn't look incredibly pretty and the characters are continuously off model. However, whenever I watched this show, I never felt awkward looking at it. For me it felt more like an intentional style that made this show distinct. I could totally be just weird and not be able...to see when something sucks, but the art never bothered me and more or less adds to the charm overall.Those who say the animation team wasn't trying may be entirely missing the point. The people who made this show were doing what many amazing shows of the past have done, perfectly encapsulating what made the source material charming, and expanding it to make it something even better. The original manga has such an odd style to it that this anime adapts perfectly!Character: 6/10Each of the main Yakuza idols feel like real people with a comprehensive past, even if it's rather difficult to remember which one is which at times. This story could have easily kept them as simple and flat, but it decided to expand them all out giving them separate pasts and personalities.When it comes to the supporting characters, it can be slightly hit or miss. People like the agent and the Boss were both a great time. Aside from them, there are a few other funny joke characters, but no one else too notable. After watching, it's easy to forget who is who at times, and that does reflect badly upon the supporting cast. All out it's not bad, but nothing extraordinarily note worthy either.Sound: 5/10What really holds this down is probably the lack of an interesting soundtrack, but it's by no means awful, simply nothing noteworthy. However, what really saves this category is the raw personality of the voice acting, and the weirdness to all the music. While I said the soundtrack isn't notable, that doesn't mean it doesn't have personality. For example, there are several insert songs all sung by the idol gangsters and they sound great. Just like the animation, everything is dripping with so much flavor and I love it.Comedy: 6/10I found this show hilarious, but a lot of the humor is dumb shouting and very brutal. Some of the humor could be incredibly well constructed and thought out, with a punchline that hits its target several times after the set-up, but all of that is for naught if the viewer doesn't find any of it funny. But for me, I found the over the top humor and intense facial expressions to be just up my alley way and perfect for my crazy sensibilities.Overall: 9/10This anime is incredibly hard to judge, but your enjoyment of it, like most comedies, really comes down to if you find it funny or not. I personally can't stop laughing and it really get too old until the end. This show has a really good focus on the Idol culture of Japan and merges it in an amazing and comedic way with the Yakuza. Honestly, if you don't like episode 1, drop it right away, it won't grow on you. But for me, this show stands as a secret gem in the Summer 2018 anime season. to see when something sucks, but the art never bothered me and more or less adds to the charm overall.Those who say the animation team wasn't trying may be entirely missing the point.

Welcome to anime, where fucking yazuka idols exist. Quite the premise to take in when reading about this show.When I first heard about it, I thought it was so stupid.And after finishing it, it's still so stupid.But I still wanted to make a short review on my thoughts on it, so here they are:Comedy (1/10)...Back Street Girls takes overexaggerated humor to the max and way past that to the degree that the jokes can get played out really quickly.It's just screaming with dramatic sound effects in the background and that's your comedy. That's just it. Because of that, the show just became a drag to watch by how unfunny it became with the amount of repetitive humor that the show provides (especially in the middle portion). It got old really fast.Characters (2/10)The sex changed idols were... interesting to say the least on paper. They all had some eccentric personalities to say the least, but no one stood out that much nor were likable whatsoever in the long run. Same really goes for the supporting cast as well. Pretty flat overall.Art & Animation (1/10)J.C Staff's art looks like every episode was drawn in 5 minutes. It looked horrendous.Sound (4/10)The OP song was pretty catchy, not gonna lie. Better than I expected for a show like this.The voice acting was decent but the overusage of sound effects like shocking thuds, was absurd. Felt really cheap listening to it with those stock sound effects playing over and over again.Enjoyment (0/10)It got incredibly repetitive, unfunny and stale really quickly with the obnoxious presentation and delivery of the humor. Reading the synopsis is probably the sole entertaining element about this anime.Back Street Girls: Goku Dolls was a disappointing comedy due to overdoing its comedy and underwhelming in its production. It sounded better on paper compared to how it was delivered, that's for sure.It's a shame since the same studio made Prison School, and they nailed that show's comedy and production.Score 1/10 Back Street Girls takes overexaggerated humor to the max and way past that to the degree that the jokes can get played out really quickly.It's just screaming with dramatic sound effects in the background and that's your comedy.

Back Street Girls: Gokudolls is pretty much the same formula, only that if it ever existed in the face of the Yakuza.The story starts with the main Gokudolls Kan, the 3 men (Ryu, Kazu, Big Bro) who have disobeyed their boss, Inugane-sensei, and from his mouth he demands that the Kan are forced go to Thailand for a sex change, transform their lives to be Gokudolls Niji! Oh dear God, that one hell of a chance taken to be idols-cum-yakuza in disguise taken well. As a certain someone phrased it that if this method exists in the East,...but things are different in the West, it\'s true.How this series of events turned into the next...I have absolutely no idea, credits to mangaka Jasmine Gyuh that this series stands out due to things that Japan is still considering every idea that the West would throw out in a jiffy. The story afterwards is a faithful adaptation of the manga: over-the-top and overboard characters in relation to the 3 sex-changed men. Aside from all this, the other characters are an eyesore, especially the fans of the Gokudolls, drooling and spitting their faces all over the idols, of which the girls (ahem, sorry, Yakuza men) try to scrutinize their situations to impress everyone around. And get this, even Inugane-sensei is NOT spared from his divorced wife\'s Natsuko\'s ideals, trying all sorts of ways to bring down the Gokudolls...and he immediately becomes a pet in front of her (while claiming he still loves her and whatnot). My impressions? A lot of wackiness and the usual chuckles of vulgarities hurled, but nothing more.The art and animation...oh good God are they awful: Still shots and lots of shouting commentaries and such everywhere, but that\'s what the manga did with the aesthetics and I\'m still glad that J.C.Staff has director Chiaki Kon aboard to sorta test-bench this series around, and indeed it is controversial. Not her best directed series, but it\'s passable, I guess? Nonetheless, both aesthetics here are really an acquired taste, so it\'s either you love or hate it to the grave.The OST is the only good thing about this series, as it sounds appropriate for the series. I\'m not just talking about the stellar presentation of the OP and the idolish feel of the ED, but the songs made by the Gokudolls, courtesy of Inugane-sensei, as is strange as it comes, but it\'s meh. Whether that sounds good or bad to you is up to your tastes.One thing to clarify though: Do you realize MAL\'s tags of Ecchi, comedy and Seinen? The fanservice is over-the-top too, not giving a care about the surroundings, and that might be the only thing I do like about this series. The comedy is a mixed bag though, like it is there for filler.So, this thirst-inducing series that features idols, transgenders with the Yakuza twist, as unique as it is (I applaud for the producers\' experimental trying), it is chock-full of clichés that exists as the main selling point of the show, so if clichés are your thing, try this show out.To everyone else, please skip this atrocity of a show. This is one of those polarizing shows where the ""there will be lovers, there will be haters"" argument will forever last.

I checked it out in the original Japanese and found it quite enjoyable without being extraordinary.After Netflix released the English dub, this was a game changer. The dub is so much better than the sub. The jokes are funnier, dirtier and the language is much stronger. Although this doesn't always work for anime in this case it makes it much easier to watch.If you're looking for a quick anime to binge and like silly jokes and a lot of swearing I'd suggest watching the dub for this anime.Story: 9Art: 6Character: 9Sound: 8Enjoyment:...10Overall: 9 10Overall: 9"", ""I think it was one of the best comedy anime that I've seen. I liked the story unlike many other people, three yakuza people who have to become idols for the mistake they've made. But to be honest it's more like famous sitcoms, in the episodes there is no such a palpable development on the story it was more like ten episodes that you can watch with very similar bases and laugh. I have laughed so hard on some episodes, and I think it was pretty good and funny for a comedy / idol anime. I would recommend it to people who want to laugh...and doesn't expect a very detailed story. and doesn't expect a very detailed story."", 'Most anime fans are so tuned into fancy gimmicks and special effects for their anime, but for Gokudolls this anime was very nostalgic for me. Brought me back the vibes of shows like Excel Saga & Great Teacher Onizuka. People giving it bad scores for quality likely are fans that started anime in late 2000\'s which is nothing wrong but older anime watchers should feel right at home here in terms of quality in the art when animes felt like they were ripped from the mangas.That said... the story can be very hit or miss for people cause it tackles a very sensitive topic in...today\'s society regarding transgenders. The fact they are forced into sex changes really strikes a nerve with the LGBT community.

They do a really good job of using the humor behind their situation for some witty jokes that could not have been done without this kind of story setup.Overall I loved it!!! I watched it from start to finish and it\'s unlikely there will be another anime like this giving the moral hate by the subject matter by people who are overly sensitive to these topics and take things too seriously in a show.

However, this show despite the premise blew me away completely, and not for all the right reasons.I think it's also important to address a lot of the criticisms of the show because a vast majority of them are completely idiotic. The premise of the show is to do with Crime and the Yakuza. Criticising the show for it being raunchy, vulgar, and filled with an unlovable cast is like criticising a chef for seasoning the food they made. The point is, that it...was completely intended. It adds not only character and charm to the show, but also promotes the main message of the story, which is 'do not judge those based on appearance' and that 'people are much more complex than their caricatures'.Story:To start, the story is brilliant. The premise drew me in, while the story kept me entertained and made me want to continue watching, which is quite rare with Japanese comedy. The story is simple enough, but the premise makes it work. Due to this, I wouldn't even consider it a slice of life, but that's the best way I can describe such an outlandish premise and story.7/10.Characters:Without spoiling the plot, the main cast starts as selfish stereotypical Yakuza members. Throughout the story, we actually find out that the characters aren't as one dimensional as we first thought, and because of this it allows for greater character development to occur. This is a key strength to the story, as the author understands people are complex and do things that are contradictory to their nature and are flawed. This is a nice change of pace when compared to the stereotypical Jesus-Kun character that plagues modern anime.7/10.Enjoyment / Comedy:The humour is sometimes childish and disgusting; this is one of the most significant drawbacks of the show. Despite this, however, a vast majority of the jokes made me laugh at loud, startling my roommates at 3 am as I howled out in enjoyment. So, like 'Gamers' (another underrated Japanese Comedy Anime) I have to highly rate it just for the fact that it's funny and enjoyable.9/10.Art & Sound:The Art style and sound aren't too my liking, to be honest, but I think it adds to the show's character. Clearly, this show was done out of a passion, the voice acting is excellent at parts, and you can tell the (DUB) actors had a great time filming which adds to the enjoyment of watching. But once again, it does sometimes come across and cheap and rushed. For this reason, the Art and Sound can push many people away from this anime, but I'd still say give it a chance, it's rough, but it's lovable.5/10.Overall Score:Overall I'm rating it selfishly. Subjectively it should be around a 7 out of 10 to a 7.5 out of 10. However, just for the fact that this anime has been heavily criticised by the 'comedy police' (who I must say act like middle-aged mums), I'm giving it a solid 8 out of 10.8/10. was completely intended.

I was wrong but not for the wrong reasons. First off, the official sub wasn’t available so most of it was done by fans which lead to some problems but I can’t complain because that’s better than nothing. One thing not done by the fans was the animation itself; it was actually awful....I think it did a good job of conveying the facial expressions and making the best out of the funny moments but they didn’t have the same impact as the manga. It made me more sad than anything to see something I truly liked have such a horrible adaptation, think Berserk.Okay but let’s talk about the show itself and not the design. So the show cuts up the chapters into mini episodes and we get three per whole episode. I felt like this ruined a lot of the pace of the show and made any plot progression nullified because sometimes the next chapter is just a random story at times. That’s not to say it’s a bad thing but the development and shenanigans of these Gokudolls should’ve been a main focus but it didn’t feel that way at times.The best way I can describe the show to you is...it’s a meme. It has got some great funny moments and some well placed facial reactions but they are mostly hit or miss. You can pick out a few moments for a good animemes post but the show itself is almost painful to trudge through. I’d say those moments make it worth but having read the source material I’d say you are better off sticking there more than anything.I gave it a 5/10 below average and low level meme tier.

I found it to be a weird but slightly enjoyable manga.I then find out that this is gonna get an Anime adaptation and I was mostly just confused as to why. It just doesn\'t seem like an actual thing you\'d expect in an anime form. I got to admit, I\'m curious as to how embarrassed the voice actors could\'ve been.The Music I won\'t lie Is actually pretty good in my opinion. I\'d hope so with this being a show about Idols.Now probably one of the biggest turn-offs for people is the animation. Most shows I\'ve...watched aren\'t really that badly animated. But this takes the WR for the worst animated show that I can remember. I will admit that with a constrained budget that they did do some honestly nice visuals at times that you don\'t really see.The Audio tends to not be in sync with the animation of the lips and we get a good amount of still images.The thing I disliked the most in the Manga was that it\'s kind of depressing with these people always having to do what the Boss wants. I still feel bad for them even in anime form. Episode 2 is where the story got caught up with the manga, So I have no idea what\'s gonna happen now.The voice acting at least from the ""Girls"" is actually pretty good if I am, to be honest. We did get a quick scene in episode 2. It\'s a still image of one of the ""Girls"" Mother. The voice we got just didn\'t match the look of the mom at all.I do also wish we got these characters in a different show. I like the models/design of the ""Girls"" I\'d love if they were used in a different anime and don\'t have them be originally boys with their balls chopped off. I like the personalities and can see them in a school setting with the entire school knowing them as the weird duo. You have the very girly girl, The Leader and the Tomboy.

That\'s right.. when you first heard of how the plot goes, you go like ""Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........that\'s interesting."" Some people might even say that Japan is running out of ideas for unique stories and yes maybe that\'s correct. This show has a plot like no other because it doesn\'t even have one. Each episode is just a bunch of segments put together. To be honest, the story is a bit cliche but the anime knows it as well that\'s why it tries its best to try and twist the plot to bring out...the unexpected. Though it was kind of exaggerated, the comedy factor never ceases to amaze you. Ironically, it feels that the only thing going for this series is the unique story and nothing more. Other than an embodiment of cringe, it is funny in its own way. The visuals make it noticeable that it was illustrated by J.C. Staff but I don\'t think much effort was put into it unlike the other series of its season. The opening and ending themes were made to fit the anime very well and maybe I can say the same for the background audio. The characters were in their natural behaviour most of the time but there were some unique ones that bring the face of this anime to uniqueness. I can\'t say that I enjoyed this series much because I had long breaks in between episodes and it feels that I didn\'t really find what I was looking for in a plot like this.

I saw a few comments about transphobia and I really didn't see it. Already the premise of the show is how three yakuza members get surgery in Thailand and become idols. Based on the description alone, you know this show is a comedy and shouldn't be taken too seriously. And nobody had the intention of offending anyone. But if it's a topic you are sensitive to and are uncomfortable with joking about,  then it's best to skip.The show is a bit rough around the edges. The art looked a bit...''dirty'', there were a lot of simple and predictable jokes, but it was still a pretty chill watch. No matter how tired or distracted I was it was easy to pay attention and keep up. The few plots that had a twist managed to make me laugh or even chuckle. Think with a few adjustments it would be a great show. It has the potential to be something even better and If they consider season 2 I hope they dedicate more attention to the jokes, soundtracks and the artstyle.

As someone who loves bad taste, this is easily one of the most ridiculous anime I have seen in a LONG time. It's ridiculous in all the right ways as it is absolutely hilarious.I have been watching the dub but I tried to watch the sub but the dub is far better with amazing voice actors like Richard Epcar (Raiden - Mortal...Kombat) it's hard not to enjoy when Raiden is saying highly inappropriate things. The dub you actually get to listen to the ridiculous things everyone says especially the main characters (Mari, Chika & Aily) & Lina say.

Unless you mess around with chromosomes, you can't simply reassign your sex. What you can change are the social constructs to which you adhere or represent yourself as, such as gender. They just had to do enough to basically sell it to whatever their target audience was (maybe a niche group of westerners, or...scum like me). This anime really was designed for adults or mature audiences. If you are disturbed by scenes depicting the mistreatment of humans (esp. women), whether violently or otherwise, then I do not recommend that you view this anime. Alongside misogyny, if you do not support content that may portray even mild to moderate transphobia or homophobia (whether or not indirectly) or jokes about such things, then you likely won't enjoy this series because it will leave you with a bad feeling that will diminish much (if any) enjoyment you can get from watching it. There is also a scene where one of the main characters is sexually assaulted. Reading the synopsis of the anime should already tell you plenty, I think.Do not confuse these Yakuza idols as transgendered folk. They do not represent how most trans folk feel or act. These are seemingly cisgendered males that have been forced into taking hormones or undergoing cosmetic surgeries to assume new bodies and new roles. Their new bodies are feminine, and their new roles are feminine idols, and sometimes sex objects; they're treated like subpar humans. So basically, they're (mis)treated just like women often are. Well, they are generally viewed and treated as women by most characters, i.e. except by their transphobic and misogynistic boss. If your sense of humour is in extremely bad taste, like mine, then give it a shot, but don't let your friends know that you watched it (show some restraint and maybe endure a bit of shame and genuine self-reflection). Some of the dialogue in this show are not akin to anything else I've seen in anime (though probably because I haven't watched enough anime due to those damn pesky exams and assignments getting in the way!). Episode 3 caught me off guard, in spite of this being a gag anime with an abridged plot that has a kind of predisposition against the disambiguity between the plot and subplot(s). You can easily tell where this anime's plot is heading... most of the time. But the gimmick, however, remains static. And that is by design.If you're still reading this review, I'll have you know that the absolute highest standard of any anime I've watched and rated is probably Terra Formars. Yes, fools! Most people who watch anime passionately do not like that anime. It's trash to them. But why do I rate it so highly? It's because Terra Formars gave me exactly what I wanted: humans getting destroyed and desecrated by cockroaches (literally). I can't even remember what the story was about. I simply relish in and savour the suffering of humans. This Gokudolls anime has plenty of that (albeit without all that gore). But, believe it or not, this anime managed to disturb me a little when the three uhh... protagonists were getting treated almost like cockroaches. I almost felt sorry for them. Almost. I want this to happen to your generic anime hero so that I can enjoy it even more without worrying about possibly feeling any guilt.I like the characters in this show because most of them are back-stabbing, treacherous scum with little to no redeeming qualities. I don't like heroes. I don't care for 'good' people. So I love the character concepts here! Being one myself, I can recognise and understand misanthropes, arseholes, rejects and obsessive fans. Perhaps the character developments, subtle as they might seem, are the only reason to watch this. The characters here made villains like myself feel right at home. But I still wish they'd all get eaten by cockroaches. They're all pieces of shit, especially that professor of 'girlology' or whatever. I know, I know, it's a joke. This is a gag anime. But those terrible characters are what made the series so appealing. The two-dimensional goons are the main focus - and that's very exciting! It makes this anime so atypical, so refreshing. Thus, don't expect any evil geniuses.The main reasons why you'd want to watch this anime are likely because(a) your anime list is already comprised of 'gender bending' or crossdressing themes because that's your not-so-secret fetish(b) the over-the-top humour, weirdness and shock are among your preferences(c) a well-written narrative is open to compromise if the gimmicks are good enough for youI want to make a little comment upon the humour in Gokudolls. I found it bittersweet. I laugh at these strange scenarios that the Yakuza thugs get roped into because of my own misconceptions, expectations and unfair stereotypes. But some of the content reminds me just how shallow and perhaps ignorant or inconsiderate some of the humour is. Maybe I'll leave that to cultural differences. I grew up in the transphobic rape capital of the world, so maybe I'm a bit more touchy about the humour.If you're thinking of watching this because you may find it kinky, then I'm sad to say that there isn't all that much there. It has its moments, such as on-stage performances, photoshoots, bodily confusions and curiosities. That type of fan-service isn't so much the focus of this series as is its humour, and surviving abuse - such as a lot of ridicule and harm directed toward the characters. There are some uncomfortable, awkward character interactions. I suppose some of the dialogue is suggestive, if not hilarious or... yuck-uza. I-I mean YAkuza! Yakuza. But then again, the start of episode 3 might be just the sort of dirty talk you were looking for, ehehe. How could I know? I'm not here to judge your kinks or fetishes. I'm just trying to help. There are no healthy dom/sub relationships, as far as I can tell. No cannibalism. No nudity. Lots of sexual references... and I've conveniently forgotten the rest of what I was going to say because some of it shouldn't be mentioned as a selling point, but rather as a deterrent. This anime isn't even mildly hentai material. More like occasional eye-candy moments (which is nice because I prefer the lighter stuff).If you enjoy content unapologetically exhibiting a bad taste in humour, sadism, some over-the-top dramatic expressions of maybe the same three emotions on repeat, a succint narrative and character development, all wrapped into a ridiculous premise that's pandering to a very specific audience (maybe for their kinks) - then, my oh my, do I have great news!

This is a straight comedy and it is gold.  I honestly don't know how anyone can say...anything bad about this show, simply because it is so funny and the comedy is so well done.

I thought the premise was way to weird for me, but I loved it and I will never think twice about a show like this again.  Take my challenge and try to get through the first 10 minutes without laughing hard and wanting to see more.

""Tootsie"", ""Some Like It Hot"", and many other examples have all proven (though not without exception) that putting a man in women\'s clothing is almost certain to obtain a ripping good laugh. But in the modern era, we can take things a bit further. What if we had men forced to become women and hide that fact while performing? Well, that\'s what we got in the definitely NSFW ""Back Street Girls: Gokudolls"" made by J.C. Staff and brought to you by the fine folks at Netflix.The simple version of...the plot is this: 3 Yakuza members mess up big time and are forced by their boss to get sexual reassignment surgery and train to become the perfect Japanese idol group and keep their origins a secret. Needless to say, comedy ensues. The adjustment period is more or less skipped over as their training is shown through flashbacks, but that\'s not to say they\'re completely comfortable in their new lives- who would be? But the best laughs are reserved for the most off-beat moments when the most bizarre little ironies occur. These moments are the definition of dark humor but you can\'t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the scene. ""Back Street Girls: Gokudolls"" succeeds in avoiding the biggest pitfalls of this concept- doing something everyone\'s seen before. They achieve new heights with a somewhat hackneyed premise, so be ready for something different than ""White Chicks"" or ""Big Momma\'s House"".The failure of this show is in it\'s main characters. You think of them as a unit, so it\'s hard to think of them separately. Each gets their own time in the spotlight, but without much time with them previously as men it\'s hard to identify them. Thankfully, the side characters come to the rescue big time. The Gokudolls manage to create their own little antagonist faction through their various misadventures, which leads to some fun. The little additions to their group- such as a clueless manager or a couple of trainees- really help bring the funny but the best part of the show is their boss- oh my Gawd, this guy is gold. Boss Inugane may be one of the most batsh*t crazy characters in Anime history. And anytime he\'s on is must-see, which he\'s there plenty, but still not enough. I brave to say if it were not for him, the show would be a mediocre failure.Because the show was not going to win on it\'s soundtrack. I think they were going for purposefully tacky, J-Pop crap with some funny lyrics added, but I reject the notion that to be bad on purpose is always the way to go. They missed an opportunity to make something there and although the opening and closing themes are semi-catchy, the musical numbers are more grating than entertaining. Not for the voice cast\'s lack of trying, though. This has some of the best voice editing I\'ve heard. While the Gokudolls speak in their voices as women, their internal voices are still that of their true men selves, with some clever shots of them with their old faces on their new bodies added in for good timing. The show is very Japanese and should be watched in Japanese for best enjoyment, while the English cast does well enough to keep up. Massive shout out to the veteran Keiji Fujiwara as Boss Inugane, who\'s bellowing voice that inspires intimidation is used to immense comedic effect with some of the lines he\'s forced to bark out here.If you\'re looking for something funny and new, but aren\'t too easily offended, definitely give this one a watch. A Netflix exclusive, yes, but I don\'t think anyone else could have made this in today\'s PC culture. An odd gem destined to become a cult classic. 8/10. Check it out.

Cheers!', 'To quote Pistachio Disguisey from 2002\'s The Master of Disguise, “[the scheme] is so stupid, it just might work,” would be very appropriate for this show. It was just so ridiculous, it worked… kind of.Backstreet Girls: Gokudolls was created in the same format as ""Daily Lives of High School Boys,"" ""Haven\'t You Heard? I\'m Sakamoto,” ""Handa-kun,” and “Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan” (someone please inform me what to call the type of series that has several somewhat unrelated mini-stories in one episode). It kicked off with the premise of three Yakuza subordinates fumbling on an important assignment. As they begged on their knees for their lives,...their boss said he would spare them if they got sex reassignment surgery and became pop idols. The plot circulates around the humor behind the different implications, struggles, and surprisingly, perks, of these Japanese Mafia trans-stars.It was funny how they actually created albums for this anime. Albeit, those shown were the stereotypical and tasteless pop songs that don’t seem to take much talent and effort to make. The art was rough, probably appropriate for the story, but just okay.The characters didn’t really stand out. Each was just his/her own brand of typical Yakuza-turned idol.One must admit that this is a very unique plot. It’s fascinating how two polar opposites of the gender spectrum were bulldozed into each other. Perhaps this is reading too into it, but Gokudolls seemed to be a big fat satire of reality, given the relative controversiality of sexuality and gender nowadays. The yin and yang contrast between the epitome of masculine tradition, the Yakuza, transformed into the personification of feminine modernity, young pop idols, generated a fascinating, quirky discourse on being a coerced trans person, especially when identity confusion became a concern. Then again, the producers may have just been having drinks after work and thought that mashing these two silly things would be a good idea.At the end of the day, however, it was not consistent, and just borderline misogynistic. Though it was comic at times, how the eccentric elements came together is what made it interesting. their boss said he would spare them if they got sex reassignment surgery and became pop idols.

And if that's what you're looking for, look no further.I loved this show and I've even rewatched a few scenes.

Based off the poster I saw for it, which was an anime girl singing, I figured the reason that I didn't hear anything about this one was because it probably just another dumb Idol show. I clicked on episode 1 and it became blatantly obvious that there wasn't much going on in the animation department. The opening to the show doesn't even have any animation in it, it's just real life people girls with a pattern silhouette dancing, but then I noticed all...the Yakuza characters, and then I saw the idol characters turn into guys. OMG it's that one anime with that wild synopsis I saw online. Back Street girls is about 3 men of the Yakuza who piss off there boss to the point where he sends them to Thailand to get a sex change, so they can come back and become famous Idols. I know, fucking wild. The show proceeds to follow these Yakuza lives as reborn cute girl idols. Personally I found the show hilarious, even if the comedy was on the immature side. It also helps that there's both male and female voice over for the characters. You can tell the voice actors had a lot of fun in these rolls. Now I know I said that the animation isn't good, because there really isn't any, just moving mouths most of the time, and even the drawings of the characters are off model constantly, but it surprisingly grows on you. I think a lot of people probably went into this, saw the animation style, and said nope. Listen, give this show a chance, you might find yourself loving the shitty drawings by the end of it. Back Street girls is a tragic comedy that heavily relies on it's good writing.

I took a look at the manga after the fact and it's as though the whole show is just a slideshow of the manga panels colourized with a voice-over and lip movements, and very often the faces just look unsettling.However looking instead at the story, it's insane, just crazy, and I love that it's so over the top. There's quite a lot of character in the show too, I liked the Boss and Manager characters, they all have a bit fleshing out on their backstories and they just seem to fit together well.The voice acting is top notch really, I saw the dubbed version and a bit of the subbed, there's no difference in quality between the actors for each so just choose your preference.All in all, if you're looking for something insane and sometimes unnerving (both good and bad) give this one a look, otherwise you're not really going to be into this one. the art style ranges from inconsistent to downright lazy.

The three main characters struggle to fit into their new lives as girl ""idols"" while still trying in varying degrees to retain their identities as male yakuza. This often yields hilarious results providing commentary on both ""lifestyles"" What stands out are the similarities between their old lives and their new lives. They...are still under the thumb of their boss and under both conditions struggle to assert their own identities separate from their assigned roles.The visuals are odd and night even be described as ""retro"" which also plays into the theme in a strange way.

As a viewer, I don\'t have a problem with that (and I assume mostly of people that watch anime either) but is so annoying when every chapter its about one of this or all of them.

It is completely inappropriate, and thewhole anime itself is over the top. I guess it would be one of those, ""It\'s so bad, It\'s good."" I literallycould not stop laughing at certain parts, and yes most of it was very cringeworthy, but I justhappened to like it :). The animation is a little bit weird and over the top, somewhat different from what I usually watch, but it works out really well. Watching this anime was literally a rollercoaster, happy moments, sad moments, depressing moments, cringey moments, and repeat ', 'Back Street Girls: Gokudolls is heavily underrated and near unknown due to the fact that it was released to compete with the likes of other very popular anime in 2018. The art style is unique, and although similar to other series, it brings the most out of the storyline.What is important to understand is that this show is a gag anime. There is little development forwards and the plot was set from episode 1. Despite this, each character is well fleshed out, having their own storylines and personality which many other works seem to gloss over and still receive better ratings (demonstrating that MAL...reviews are an utter joke, pointless).Overall this show is about opinion (as every show is), and what the viewer finds humorous determines how much they will like gokudolls. For me the humor was raw comedy, paralleling shows like Saiki Kusuo, Arakawa under the Bridge, and etc. It heavily blurred the line between male and female, which only turned out to be enjoyable.

There are some good jokes here and there, but they aren't really worth it most of the time. Every episode spends 80% of its time slowly going along without providing any kind of entertainment.

Real trans women aren’t like that and you can easily spot the difference. I guess it would be a shame if this makes people view all trans women like that but this is why I am saying this now. They were forced to get a sec change and were still all men. This I found very fucked up and felt bad and could relate. If anything it...would be a representation of trans men in pre transition (not saying it is a true representation but would be what it is representing). They threw around transition and sex change too much and it was kind of a dark premise. But it played part of the comedy and tbh I enjoyed it. It was funny. Unless the original author Jasmine Gyuh is transphobic and intends to stain the image of trans people which I am not sure of, it’s really just dark humor.Aside from that, Idk about sub but the english voice acting was pretty great.

Even their boss has a huge misunderstanding of how pop idols live and tries to force this lifestyle on these rugged guys, its super funny. The characters even strive to keep true to their yukuza souls, despite being forced to be pop girlie music idols being indebted to their boss. The drawn animated style is a little ugly, but...it works for this crude like humor show. Definitely watch the first two or three episodes before dismissing the show.

On the other hand, Demetrios is a very good athlete but doesn't want to compete in sports. The village leader tries forcing him into competing and inventing sports when Demetrios gets hit by lighting and is brought to the 1964 Japanese Olympics. There he learns about sports, cultures,...and sportsmanship which he brings back to Greece. (Keep in mind he gets brought to Japan multiple times)Story - 8/10It's unique I guess? It's not flawless but its really really cool in my opinion.

Overall it was unique and created the perfect mood for what it was made for.Art - 4/10Clay stop motion, with heavy CGI and plastic mini objects, is not my thing. After seeing this I was kinda like oh cool... and then just moved on with my life. If you guys want to see 'Anime' styled anime then your out of luck since the character is either made in clay or is like a 2D card. The backdrop can range anywhere to an actual drawing, to a cartoonish drawing, or even a picture. The animation was good though since I didn't want to rip my eyes out because of CGI. In fact, they actually used the CGI correctly and well.Sound - 5/10So there's a new song for every ending (I'm pretty sure). It looks really weird and makes you feel weird. Maybe because the ending song is sung by a clay dude with a real mouth painted white or the really weird flashy or odd video that goes with it. Either way, I can't say much because I'm not picky about this stuff.Character - 3/10It's shallow. Demetrios doesn't have much of an outstanding personality. Just normal... The village leader is just hungry for more money. The professor is just a normal professor. Yea, overall the character isn't unique.Enjoyment - 9/10I have no idea why I enjoyed it so much. Maybe because it made me high af, or maybe because it was really unique and new and quite funny.

It was a show that was heavily overshadowed by several household and hyped up titles, and as well as its short length and unique nature. This show is quite unique as it experiments with several types of animation and techniques that you don’t often see in TV, such as Claymation and use of fabric materials, so for one to enjoy a show such as this one, it requires a certain taste and a little bit of open-mindedness.The show follows the timid and cowardly, yet...incredibly athletic main character, Demetrios, as he aims to become a pottery painter, rather than an athlete; a position that he is bullied into by the village mayor. Over the span of the show, and with the power to travel through time to post-war Japan, he learns the joys of sport (and modern western culture in general), and eventually becomes more willing to participate in them. This show is one of the few rare instances where a clay figure of a Greek man gets more development that most shounen protagonists, sorry not sorry My Hero Academia fans.One of my favourite aspects of this show has to be the endings. Have you ever seen a show that uses random stock videos as background visuals for their endings? They even paid for Jesus from Fiverr to record himself smiling. How amazing is that? Even when they are short, they can often be extremely funny, and are worth sticking around after every 5 minutes.This show probably isn’t for everyone, but if you’re someone who likes the quick nature and comedic dialogue of series such as Inferno Cop and Saiki Kusuo, then you’ll get a laugh out of this.

Over the span of the show, and with the power to travel through time to post-war Japan, he learns the joys of sport (and modern western culture in general), and eventually becomes more willing to participate in them. This show is one of the few rare instances where a clay figure of a Greek man gets more development that most shounen protagonists, sorry not sorry My Hero Academia fans.One of my favourite aspects of this show has to be the endings.

The planet rightly needs time to restructure itself, in addition to prioritizing everyone\'s health. Olympia Kyklos was the anime that came with a unique cultural objective, showing us historical and comic references of the formation of this very memorable date every four years. We will analyze then, one of the most important anime of this year.This review contains some small spoilers.Olympia Kyklos is a set of short stories, by Demetrios, an illustrator and at the same time creator of events, whose ""mandatory work"" is to promote sports and the Olympics...in his region. Of course, he wouldn\'t do that just as he wanted. The local leader always asks for this, with money as the main objective. But not only that. Demetrios manages to go to the future constantly, in Tokyo, meeting a group of three relatives. Whatever the moment, there is always at least one of the three close to Demetrios. The story alternates between 1964, the year of Japan\'s first Olympics, and the Greek period, one of the milestones in intellectual and social civilization. I thought it was a great idea, as it manages to convey ""isekai"" in a more relaxed and innovative way, instead of being generic and tedious, as most current anime has done.The plot is simple and goes on until the end of the anime. But, what makes this anime special? I would say a number of factors. Comedy that works very well, charismatic characters that always please us, quick and functional story, in addition to inserting the concept of isekai in a fun way. Olympia transforms the elements we know in the anime world and makes fun, lampoons and plays with puns and historical moments that are presented. The anime is much more than just another project to be watched and passed on. It\'s a funny story, incredibly well done and always entertaining us. The way the environment is made, with a more handmade use and different from current anime creates a more experimental idea and a new way of looking at the universe that studios and future manga can create and enjoy with joy and affection on the content presented, as in Olympia, besides having a variation between molded characters and people doing anything in the endings, the anime practically says it was meant to be literally like that. The Gosay studio debuted very well. A beautiful debut from a promising studio with the potential to be much more.Spartans, unknown sports, gastronomy, ways of documenting the traditions with vessels, mythology, criticism of prejudices still present (such as homosexuality and machismo) and many other contexts govern its history, making it rich and unmissable. The production itself is also innovative. The characters, houses and environments are all simple, but very pleasant to see. Many criticized it for being ""poorly used"" or ""visually bad"", but I admire this type of work very much. It is these works that deserve recognition with each new season. Anyone who remembers Yami Shibai, knows what I\'m talking about ... Even the opening and the 24 closings are well done. Imagine wanting to sing the ending of the triathlon episode and other similar modalities. That\'s art! That\'s how exaggerated and different things work. It is not an anime that repeatedly copies another to the point of being bad. It is a way of pleasantly exposing a culture that few know. The anime explains history, teaches the Olympics and transmits information, using both ancient figures, and the most current characters show the funny actions of Demetrios reported in books, such as sports drawn on vases (seriously, I laughed a lot seeing this).Another factor that differentiates Olympia from the others is the fact that it encourages the public to research concepts and the cultures themselves of one of the oldest and most important civilizations that exist today, in addition to offering us a broad knowledge of the very origins of sports, such as the marathon. The anime teaches well the Greek words themselves, where some refer to the many used today. Offering explanations during the episodes, Olympia places us well in the historical context, with high-level humor and fun.Finally, Olympia is a work that made me happy to exist. We really need this type of art more. We have been through a sad time in world health, where even the largest sporting event has suffered losses. But at least we can be happy with this work, since it gives us a longing for Olympic sports, which we will be able to watch next year. in his region.

I\'m purely rating this based off my personal enjoyment of this series.So, I\'ve been meaning to read the manga for a while, never got around to it. In late september my friend and I, on our weekly anime-watching-session, gave in to our curiosity, because the preview picture of this anime has been intriguing us for weeks at that point. So we decided to just try one episode, to see what exactly this anime was, and were surprised it was five minutes long. And then, without realising it, we ended up watching all sixteen? seventeen? episodes...that were availabe back then.It really, really sucked us in.Story - 8 PointsNow, don\'t let this high score fool you. Bessatsu Olympia Kyklos is not a deep show, at all. And it doesn\'t try being one, either. It\'s comfortable being a weird couple minutes of content sandwiched between its OP and ED, and does that well.  It\'s a story about a young man who does amazing pottery but sucks at painting occasionally time travelling from his small, Ancient Greek town into a more modern 60s Tokyo; essentially, to come up with a sporting event for his town. One, that rivals the Olympics, even! There\'s also the asshole major, a very intelligent dolphin (who\'s a better painter than him), a girl he likes; an old Japanese man who helps him, his family; spartans, the threat of war...It\'s not a show you go into, expecting something deep and meaningful. It\'s a few minutes of sillyness, and that\'s what I appreciate about it. It doesn\'t try to be anything more than that. I like that.Art - 9 PointsNow, this one might be where opinions differ the most. It\'s not a regular anime. It\'s claymation, paper cutout looking things, figurines, paper, real people sometimes. A lot to take in, and something that blew me away. Because it\'s creative and fun, giving it a charming low-budget edge. Think early 2000s adult swim, the more.. avant-garde things. The Greek characters are made of grey clay/plasticine, clearly giving off the air of an ancient statue. Their enviroments are made of miniatures. Whenever the MC interacts with the drawn Japanese characters, in drawn Tokyo, he looks off in a stylish. Zeus is straight up just a real-life guy in the sky. The opening works with Greek paintings on plates, lots of colors, more of that wonderful, fun stop-motion, the Endings (plural!) include not only everything I mentioned before, but cheap animation (on purporse) and more real people, stock images/videos, and so much more.I love the decision to do it this way. It\'s eye-catching, fun and allows for an odd way to make it more dynamic. It\'s really just fun to look at!Sound - 10 PointsThis is what blew me away the most! The voice acting is good. Daisuke Ono as the MC was something I didn\'t expect, and he does a good job like always. Actually, all the voice actors are doing great! But that alone wouldn\'t have landed those 10 Points. The SFX aren\'t to ""blame"" for it either. It\'s the OP (the Willhelm Tell Overture, recreated solely by singing ""Ba""/""Da"") and the endings.Every single ED is different. A bard is serenading is about a certain Greek word/custom somewhat related to the episode, and they\'re all so, so fun. Only about 30-40 seconds a piece, they all are just a bite-sized bit of crazyness, which I love. I\'d even recommend just checking the EDs out, they alone already are just fun to watch.Characters - 9The characters aren\'t it\'s biggest strenght, but I still enjoyed them. Demetrios is a fun MC, his dolphin friend is never explained and still fun as well. Everyone is just.. fun! I\'m sorry, there really isn\'t much more behind them. This entire anime is supposed to be fun, and it does it\'s best at that.Enjoyment - 10I wouldn\'t have binge watched it if I didn\'t like it as much as I did. Best to watch with a friend, but even my rewatch alone still made me laugh. It\'s two hours of weird, fun, colorful stuff and I looked forward to each new ending. I\'ll definitely rewatch it again at least once. Probably more.Overall - 9Objectively, it would be more of a 7. But I truly loved this little show, and I feel comfortably giving it a 9. It was a dark horse that pulled through, and what it did just worked for it so well. I truly wish for more anime like that.I definitely recommend it to everyone. Like, really. I think everyone should give this one a try, simply for how.. out there it really is. that were availabe back then.It really, really sucked us in.Story - 8 PointsNow, don\'t let this high score fool you.

We have some psychedelic vibes and old Japanese one-dimensional cartoon. The contrast between the use of greek statues and traditional hand-drawn cartoons is what makes the anime genuinely...unique.Olympia Kyklos is about a vase painter Demetrios that is bad at painting but enjoys doing it. Demetrios is also perceivably good at sports but dislikes doing it, for whatever reason, Demetrios time travels to Japan every time he is in trouble and brings back the ideas he got in Japan to his village in Greece.The stark contrast between the two cultures, the two time periods and the characters make for some hilarious jokes.It was amazing to see such unique soundtracks as well; the opening is a vocal soundtrack of the famous classical used in horse racing, Rossini: William Tell Overture: Final. The endings were equally as hilariously amazing; they were all unique to each episode and changes every episode, the endings take on a traditional Karaoke-style with trippy songs and weirdly amusing backdrops.Olympia Kyklos is an underrated gem hidden amongst the pile of weird and stay-aways.Take note that this review may be outdated.

Dennou Boukenki Webdiver,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3561/Dennou_Boukenki_Webdiver,"['For the general impression, I suggest first reading the review by DerOkashi.And now I will try to explain, why there are people like me, who like anime like Webdiver.As you read, Webdiver has a simple, generic and repetetiv story. I had no problem with that, because I love the setting. It reminds me of an old childrens book I own, ""citties of tomorrow"", where different assumption on future events are described, especially on how living will be, but also eg. the moon base to be build around the year 2000...Another reason for me to like the story are the charakters. Most of them having importance...for one episode and then just being nice ornaments of the background, there is a handful of interesting main charakters of which everyone has an interesting (but simple) personallity.A point important for me: The parents of some of the main charakters play a role!These interactions between charakters in the city of ""Diverland"" are the best parts of the series. Unfortunately these moments only make one sixth of the whole story, which mostly plays in ""Magical Gate"" (the digital world).Magical Gate brings us to the artstyle. While Diverland, the real world, is well conceived, while the charakters are decently animated and designed, the mechas and the place they are in is really cheap 3D-dejection. There is actually one thing that looks good: The evil creatures of the second story arc. Their design is very creative!But for me, I had to find out: It does not bother me at all. There are moments, I think ""Oh Mein Gott, sieht das Kacke aus!"" (Oh, my god, this looks crap!)... and these moments can get long; remember, this is a very typical mecha show, which means: Mecha Transformations!... Back and forth and with different variants and everything you would expect! This show is still mostly made to sell a variety of merchandise products produced by takara.And now: When I sit there, looking at crappy animations of crappy 3D graphics for the 10000th time, you might ask the popular question: ""Why?""And I would not listen, absolutely absorbed by the music.For this show of 52 episode, there exist each two opening and ending songs, aditionally some insert songs. Of these songs, four are under my absolute favourites of anime music and only one is really bad. The background music is not high quality, but I personally like it really much.This piece of post 90\'s ""primary-school-children-are-our-only-hope-to-rescue-the-world + mecha"" series is one of the latest of its kind and suffers under a low budget and general lack of interest.However, it was able to find its fans and has some interesting concepts.Those who had fun with similar shows like erudoran-series, might want to give this a try. All those who dont know the genre, but wanting to explore it, should start with something else.I express my gratitude to the members of Subdiver, having translated this show into english, korean and indonesian. for one episode and then just being nice ornaments of the background, there is a handful of interesting main charakters of which everyone has an interesting (but simple) personallity.A point important for me: The parents of some of the main charakters play a role!These interactions between charakters in the city of ""Diverland"" are the best parts of the series.

Very basic and the opening animation is nothing related to the actual animation of the mecha.

It has that classic Super Robot anisong epic style that its the real only good point of this animeIts a good idea of an anime but bad executed, maybe could be better without the cgi robotsThe characters are really plain and not very exciting.

And actually starting with the first episode I didn\'t know what to make of it.The story is actually very basic, even for anime standards. It\'s the typical good vs evil story in which a lot of good characters being manipulated become evil and had to be rescued. OK, so much for that. Starting the first episode, you get a feeling of a formula, which is...being kept throughout all the 52 episodes. Every now and then you get an episode which tries something new and yet it falls back into the same formula. Our heroes usually encounter some dilemma which is tied to the evil doing of one of the manipulated web knights. Our heroes have to web dive and face the web knight or whatever evil entity they have to encounter and destroy it. This is of course a formula which is present in a lot of anime of that sort. Yet it brings nothing new, nothing fresh. Of course it\'s very creative to see how those web knights influence diver land and yet it\'s just for the time until they go back to magical gate. The ending falls very flat. The repetitiveness reaches a ludricrous level. It was just painful because the ending drags awfully which makes it really hard to watch to many episodes in quick succession. It was just boring.The artwork is quite minimal. The settings in the real world are actually quite nice but as soon as you go to magical gate it\'s just uninventive and boring. The greatest problem with it is the CGI they used for these purposes. The fights don\'t look very impressive. At the time the anime was made you could already produce impressiv CG but they used it in a way that probably even a forth grader could have done it. Some of this scenery reminds me of a dreadful film called ""Food Fight"". If you don\'t know what I mean, try to watch it, the essence being try. They could have at least make the backrounds a little more colourful or diverse. But it looks more like sombody puked on the screen and they tried to animate around it. And I know, it\'s a money issue here, but they animated the openings without using obvious CGI. Why couldn\'t they at least represent it a little bit in the episodes, I\'m not asking much, but to see the climax of the episode done with such a lack of care, for me this is just incomprehensible. But as I said, whenever we\'re not in magical gate, the artwork is fine. It\'s not much but decent.The characters are also quite basic. But what did you expect. All I\'m talking about is a very average story, so it would be quite absurd to have more than standard cliché characters. The lead Kento is generally nice, has the heart in the right place and has above all a clear motivation. This is already quite extraordinary, because he wants to save his brother and starts his journey with purpose instead of just being tossed into the situation and having to deal with what\'s coming. He is also not the clichéed character who is either the perfect omnipotent overhuman nor the doofus who just runs staight ahead into danger but through bravery and dumb luck is victorious in the end. He is, well, normal in some sense which makes him stand out a little. The rest of the characters on the other hand... hm... were there other characters, at least among the humans? OK that\'s very harsh, but whatever is left of side characters there is not much to talk about. Most of the series they were expendable. There are a few that actually happen to appear more frequently like Aoi. She is, well the girl, but with hacking abilities, so that\'s, um... well, that\'s kind of that. And even this trait is being forgotten throughout the series. Then we have the rival, who is also quite... just that, the rival. Not very outstanding, not very interesting, next. Of course we have his french friend Jean-Jacques. And to be honest, I see hints of a bromance here and there, just slightly, but it\'s definately there. We just don\'t spend enough time with them to explore it, so it\'s just vague, quite like the character. Traits, well, does he have any, and a personality? I\'m not sure if anyone has a distinct personality of his own except for the main charakter. The other characters have kind of the task to give exposition and/ or moral support. But you don\'t really know anything about them. You have a huge line up of supporting roles and none of them is explored, none. Talk about a missed opportunity. The web knights are also pretty basic. They have no personality. The design of some of them is pretty cool. An especially cool point of them is, that they are vehicles to be turned into giant fighting robots. But the obvious CG is also quite distracting here. The bad guys, well, they are even more basic, they are evil. Why?. Just because! OK, the overturned web knights have an explanation of just being evil. They are being manipulated. But the buildup of the main antagonist Deleteloss is so huge (for this series standard) that I expected more. There is not much rhyme or reason. It\'s just a standard out of the ordinary boring antagonist.The music is actually one of  the high points of this anime. It has nothing that sticks very much but the tunes have a nice beat to them. They are nice to listen to, even though they don\'t really represent the suspense and the overall feeling, this series is trying to convey.To sum it all up: I watched this anime even though it was draging very much. I couldn\'t do binge watching with this anime but yet I could watch it. So if you like average repetitive stories with just a minimal amount of care in producing, writing and animating it, this is your anime. If you\'re looking for a little more effort and diversity, you should probably skip this one. being kept throughout all the 52 episodes.

So my assessment here is based on my previous experience.this is a pretty good anime and became my favorite show in the past with the concept of a transformer version of the VMMORPG game like S.A.O today. Of course the point of view is changing now that I'm getting older and there are many films with the same and better conceptif you've just watched this after you're over 13 years old you'll probably find this film no more interesting than ex arm or something because it wasn't meant for...you and CGI wasn't as advanced as it is today. you and CGI wasn't as advanced as it is today.""]"
Digimon Tamers: Boukensha-tachi no Tatakai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3032/Digimon_Tamers__Boukensha-tachi_no_Tatakai,"[""This was a pretty intresting story, someone makes up a cute program, which gets infected by the bad Digimon etc, so all the electronic things go into mayhem. Haha, too bad no one died.Anyway, the story's pretty cool, they did a good job on it in this Digimon Tamers movie, a great job actually. The art is still the same, the quality's just a bit better, so is the animation and the sound, still gotta love Guilmon's voice actor right?The dissapointing parts of the mo...vies are the fights in the movies, they can barely defeat the weak Digimon, evolve way to easy and if they...do, they can defeat them in one attack, the higher-up digimon got eliminated in an instant too, and the final &quot;boss&quot; was another piece of that digital cake. Really dissapointing.But that aside, we got a few new cool characters which got introduced, an old friend of Takato, Kai. A surfer looking guy who's carefree and lives in a temple, then we've got that grandfather of Kai. An old dude playing some kind of guitarish instrument, he even fights against a Digimon using.. ka-ra-te(?), without succes of course. And then the girl, Minami, the one that introduces the problem to Kai and Takato. Some others too, but those don't matter, but they did a great job, I love the new characters, and of course the old.Highly enjoyable for digimon lovers and other people. do, they can defeat them in one attack, the higher-up digimon got eliminated in an instant too, and the final &quot;boss&quot; was another piece of that digital cake.

Digimon Savers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/859/Digimon_Savers,"[""I absolutely loved this anime, and everything about it, I can't help but give everything a 10, for some though, if I could, I'd give more than a 10, as I'll have in my reasons belowThis review is being given after watching the Japanese version of this animeStory: 10/10You could say that this anime starts out a little slow, with the meeting of the main character, Masaru, and Agumon (once more the main characters digimon) and the introduction of all the other characters that will later play a big part in the series. I had this anime on-hold at episode 14, and when I started...it back up again, I became completely addicted to the series. Though I remember the beginning being slow (which is why I put it on-hold for such a long time), once I began watching it again I couldn't stop. I non-stopped watched the series and it's action-packed plot.The whole storyline mainly focuses on the 'main' main character, Masaru Daimon and his digimon with some of the side main character, Yoshino Fujieda and her digimon, Raramon, Touma Norstein and his digimon, Gaomon, as well as the later introduced character, Ikuto Noguchi and his digimon, Falcomon, as they all aim to help protect the Human World as well as the Digital World from both attacks from Digimon, and even other humans.Art: 10/10Unlike the other Digimon series, Digimon Savers (or Data Squad as it is known in English) doesn't focus on young kids getting Digimon, this time it's older teens who get/have Digimon. The age of Masaru, Yoshino, and Touma would average around 17 years of age, with Ikuto being the youngest main character at the age of 10. With teens getting Digimon this time around, the art is a bit different in terms of the art of each of the human characters.And yet again, the art for every time the Digimon evolve is excellent as it takes on a totally different form from the normal images that are seen during the viewing of each episode.Sound: 11/10This is one of the ones that I couldn't help but give it a higher rating than what's aloud here. I found myself absolutely addicted to the both of the opening and ending theme songs as well as some of the music that was played during the episodes. Sometimes I would even dance to the music while it was playing on the episode. Which was hard when I was trying to read the subs on my iPod ^^;Anyway, the music was absolutely amazing and all the voices for the characters fit them perfectly, I have no complaints at all.Characters: 11/10The personalities of each character were well planned (in my opinion) and there were no 'split-personality' characters in this anime.Each character was unique and had pasts that would later on become a large part of the series. (at least most of them)By the end of the series, I had become extremely attached to almost each and every character, especially Ikuto, Falcomon, and Masaru, and was crying at the end because of the fact that the series was ending and it would be the last time I'd get to see them unless I rewatched it.Enjoyment: 11/10I couldn't say I have enjoyed a series THIS much in a long time!! Being a fan of not only Digimon, but action-packed, adventure, and comedy animes, I loved this series!! It has a nice balance of action, adventure, as well as even it's bit of comedy that almost every anime needs to succeed!Overall: 50/50If I kept the normal ratings of 10 for each, I'd end up with a 50 out of 50 score for overall. The anime was great, the characters couldn't be better, the music is absolutely addicting. I couldn't ask for anything better than what this anime managed to pack into its 48 episodes.If you're looking for an action-packed, adventure, comedy, and something that you'll enjoy even if you've never watched a Digimon episode before, I know you'll want to watch this series!!

People who dislike (or even hate the series) are usually 2 types of people: 1) people who saw barely 3 or 4 episodes and abandoned it and 2) people who watched it from the beginning to finish annoyed by the fact that this series is way too different from the previous Digimon series. The first I can understand, as Savers doesn\'t have the strongest first arc (like every Digimon series), but the second one I don\'t:...every single Digimon series is different and distinctive from each other, so what if this one is more mature and darker? I think that is one of the strengths of this series, because it aimed to those children who grew up watching Digimon, offering them something they can almost equally enjoy, with new layers of depth, great character insight, darkness of despair and the always reliable power of believing in your dreams: now that is a Digimon series! That is what made Adventure so rich, and amazingly executed, even when it was a bit lighter. I respect the people who say that they don\'t like this series, because I accept we may not share the same taste, however if you look at the execution, everything here works in every level, and we\'ll see why now:Story wise: Savers have 4 distinct story arcs. The first one relays too much on the comedy side, but the following 3 goes deeper into the drama side (while never fully abandoning its comedy roots) and delivers some really deep emotional moments along with satisfying story arcs and some tearjerkers moments.First arc, DATS: From episode 1 to 11 we have an episodic format, a case of the week if you may, in which our DATS member have to face Digimon cases and handle them ""quietly"". Here we are introduced to our main trio, Masaru, Yoshino and Tohma, and their digimon. These 11 episodes are way too light on the drama and character background side, only foreshadowing for later, while being too heavy on the comedy; every Digimon series starts slow, so I guess the choice to rely on comedy was made in order to make it more passable, however it is because of this that the first inserts of drama feels out of place, but everything changes in episode 12 and then onwards we have an outstanding shounen anime.Second arc, Mercurimon and the inter-dimensional conflict: here is where Savers passes from enjoyable time killer to be actually good to great. We get insight in our characters, the story plot thickens, and we feel like we finally are being told a true conceived and thought through story rather than just random cases. The drama side starts taking over the comedy and I must say, it is good drama, as it develops from what was foreshadow earlier and both story arcs and characters arc start to go along.Third arc, Kurata and the genocide: Here Savers just shows its teeth and becomes great; if by the second arc we peaked at characters depth now we sink into their darkness, we get to see the best and the worst of our heroes, and they start to truly grow and mature by the experiences of the previous arc; we get to see them being reckless, feeling jealousy, betraying, losing faith, but we also get to see them standing right back up, facing their own flaws, and take a step forward against a seemingly hopeless situation, despite their fears, and as the character work is just right, it is incredibly satisfying.Fourth and final arc, Yggdrasil and the crisis: Now, if we already saw darkness in the previous arc then prepare yourselves to go even deeper. Here we are in one of the worst crisis any Digimon series has faced since Tamers; if the previous crisis was seemingly hopeless, this one is even more. Our characters have already grown, they know they have to stand still, yet the doubt is there and as they work out their own issues they find the strength to move forward, and I must say that these episodes are the most moving of the series, and successfully made me cry in various episodes; I know that\'s just me, but I have to say it, because it aims for a great emotional impact and delivers.Characters: Digimon Savers has great story plot and pacing, but lacks on the beginning. However, it does have something that it is almost flawless: character work.Masaru: In the beginning he is the typical shounen hero, strong headed, stubborn, bad attitude and borderline stupid. His best quality in the beginning is that he is mostly funny to watch and be with, so I can understand some people not liking him. But don\'t be rash! Even the most stereotypical characters can work with the right character treatment and Masaru is proof of that. As the series goes forward he keeps his bad attitude and he always pick fights, but he grows more considerate, we are shown a background that makes sense with his personality, and successfully goes from annoying to really likeable. He feels like a different person and at the same time he\'s still Masaru. That is the best character treatment we can ask.Tohma: Just like Masaru, Tohma is also stereotypical, but get the best character treatment. Of all the characters he must have the hardest background and it totally echoes with his reserved and a bit arrogant personality. He grows deeper as the show goes forward and episode surrounding him are usually the strongest. He so clearly goes from the “know it all”, arrogant, calculator guy to a reliable friend who learns to trust his friends more than his wits, once again, without ever abandoning his true self. His growth is always in place, his actions are never out of character, and he faces troubles in unexpected, yet satisfying ways. I\'ll admit it, I have a soft spot for the character, but I think everyone could see all this in him.Yoshino: when your weakest character is still well developed you know you are looking at good material. Yoshino is the lazy yet responsible girl who- in the beginning- have some kind of inferiority complex, which she resolves as the series goes on and becomes an important asset to the team as well as a strong and determined person. The only thing I truly dislike about her is her background; it\'s not bad, but it\'s not fully exploited, and as such I would have liked to know a lot more about her family, but this is just a little complaint to an otherwise very well done character work.Ikuto: if there is a character that can compete with Tohma for saddest background it\'s him. He is a boy raised by Digimon, and as such he is mostly conflicted about his duality as human/digimon, and the series explores this issue with no fear and he grows around it. He goes all the way from wild reckless boy to what we could say is a very mature grown man. His character work is just outstanding, as it doesn\'t matter how many episodes pass by we see that he is always dealing with his duality as human/digimon, even when he seems to have accepted it, and that\'s just gold.The 4 main digimon: though the series is called ""Digimon"" the series focus way more in the human characters and their relation with their digimons. The digimons themselves are all fleshed out with their own quirks and personalities and show growth over the series, but it\'s mostly shadowed by the amazing character work of the human characters, but you can\'t stop noticing how much Agumon changed from the first arc to the last, and the same can be said about Gaomon, Lalamon and Falcomon; I won\'t go into details, but they all grow.Supporting: There are several! And all of them get their screentime and their due development in their limited time. Sayuri might be the weakest link, but she still has her moments as she shows how mothers have to struggle about seeing how their children might get hurt, but acknowledging that they must get hurt in order to grow, and as such she doesn\'t bother much. The rest of the supporting characters all have their own functions in different themes, and they show develop through the series.Sound: After feeling that Digimon Frontier lacked a little bit, I was glad to see that Savers came back with great tracks. ""Believer"" is a perfect evolution song as it fits every single character and ""Hiari"", the second opening, just shows us how this show came from its comedy roots embracing the darkest side of itself while never abandoning important themes as dreams and hopes. The tracks were masterfully chosen and scored.Enjoyment: The first time I watched Savers I was 17 and I loved it, as I was thrilled to see a Digimon series that dared to be as mature as it could be, to tell us a story about teens and their conflicts, and to see them overcoming such incredibly, almost hopeless, situations. I watched again at 19 and I was still as pleased as the first time. Now I\'m 21, this is my third time, and I still enjoyed as much as the first time; even if you know our heroes will make it to the end, you can get so much joy out of their journey and their growth that I think I can watch it several times and never be bored.As I said before, I respect people who disliked Savers, but I don\'t understand them. I\'ve read some of the reviewers who hated the series and they say ""this is not the Digimon I grew up with!"", now are they talking of Adventure, Tamers or Frontier? They are all different, and what is important is not to be similar, but to manage to exploit the storytelling and character potential that each series has: Tamers is way different from Adventure and still it triumphed because it denied its past and just wanted to create its own storytelling with the digimon elements. Savers does the same, and even surpasses Tamers (and almost reaches Adventure greatness) as it tell us a meaningful story that only lacks a bit on the first arc (with only 3 bad episodes) and delivers satisfying conclusions to each arc.I\'ll respect your opinions, and so I expect you to respect mine: for me Savers is the 2nd best Digimon series ever made, just slightly edged out by Adventure.Stray observations (funny bits of information I got while re-watching. May contain some spoilers):-In episode 5 we see Tohma bleeding; I think this is the first time ever a human has bled in a Digimon series.-These are the makeup exams Masaru took on episode 7: ""Modern Japanese Language"", ""English"", ""Japanese history"", ""Physics"", ""Mathematics"", and of course he didn\'t know anything about any of those subjects xD-Apparently Masaru likes to play the drum in Rock Band as seen in episode 7.-Every time a family matter is discussed Masaru grabbed his pendant, thinking about his father, which was a very good detail.-Banchouleomon laugh in episode 28 is epic!-Yoshino is so lazy that even in the short training sequence in episode 29 she didn\'t do anything xD.-Episode 31, Gaomon reaction to Masaru taking credit for Tohma\'s plan: ""It was master\'s plan"" I also got angry at Masaru back then too.-One great Yoshino moment: when she strikes a barrel at a Gizomon she finally shows some backbone!-The Masaru vs Tohma thing in episode 34 felt very much like Taichi vs Yamato from Adventure, it gave me goosebumps!-Masaru to Tohma in episode 35: ""Apologize to them with tour life! DIE!"" Now, that\'s the darkest side of Masaru. I applaud the writers for going there.-Gaomon in the finale, bringing tea to Tohma: ""It\'s my own blend. I call it \'my vow to meet you again\'"" that was so utterly cute that it got me to tears. I want a digimon like Gaomon!-At last, I\'d like to mention that, in my opinion, the finale is as perfect as Adventure\'s and Tamer\'s finales and left me with a wide open smile in my face. I didn’t want it to end!And that\'s it. As always, I hope you enjoyed this review. I\'ll make an effort and get through Digimon Xross Wars (the only Digimon series I dislike) and make a review, so… this might be the headline:Next time: Digimon Xross Wars tries to be every single Digimon series and manages to be none. every single Digimon series is different and distinctive from each other, so what if this one is more mature and darker? I think that is one of the strengths of this series, because it aimed to those children who grew up watching Digimon, offering them something they can almost equally enjoy, with new layers of depth, great character insight, darkness of despair and the always reliable power of believing in your dreams: now that is a Digimon series!

These 11 episodes are way too light on the drama and character background side, only foreshadowing for later, while being too heavy on the comedy; every Digimon series starts slow, so I guess the choice to rely on comedy was made in order to make it more passable, however it is because of this that the first inserts of drama feels out of place, but everything changes in episode 12 and then onwards we have an outstanding shounen anime.Second arc, Mercurimon and the inter-dimensional conflict: here is where Savers passes from enjoyable time killer to be actually good to great. We get insight in our characters, the story plot thickens, and we feel like we finally are being told a true conceived and thought through story rather than just random cases. The drama side starts taking over the comedy and I must say, it is good drama, as it develops from what was foreshadow earlier and both story arcs and characters arc start to go along.Third arc, Kurata and the genocide: Here Savers just shows its teeth and becomes great; if by the second arc we peaked at characters depth now we sink into their darkness, we get to see the best and the worst of our heroes, and they start to truly grow and mature by the experiences of the previous arc; we get to see them being reckless, feeling jealousy, betraying, losing faith, but we also get to see them standing right back up, facing their own flaws, and take a step forward against a seemingly hopeless situation, despite their fears, and as the character work is just right, it is incredibly satisfying.Fourth and final arc, Yggdrasil and the crisis: Now, if we already saw darkness in the previous arc then prepare yourselves to go even deeper. Here we are in one of the worst crisis any Digimon series has faced since Tamers; if the previous crisis was seemingly hopeless, this one is even more. Our characters have already grown, they know they have to stand still, yet the doubt is there and as they work out their own issues they find the strength to move forward, and I must say that these episodes are the most moving of the series, and successfully made me cry in various episodes; I know that\'s just me, but I have to say it, because it aims for a great emotional impact and delivers.Characters: Digimon Savers has great story plot and pacing, but lacks on the beginning. However, it does have something that it is almost flawless: character work.Masaru: In the beginning he is the typical shounen hero, strong headed, stubborn, bad attitude and borderline stupid. His best quality in the beginning is that he is mostly funny to watch and be with, so I can understand some people not liking him. But don\'t be rash! Even the most stereotypical characters can work with the right character treatment and Masaru is proof of that. As the series goes forward he keeps his bad attitude and he always pick fights, but he grows more considerate, we are shown a background that makes sense with his personality, and successfully goes from annoying to really likeable. He feels like a different person and at the same time he\'s still Masaru. That is the best character treatment we can ask.Tohma: Just like Masaru, Tohma is also stereotypical, but get the best character treatment. Of all the characters he must have the hardest background and it totally echoes with his reserved and a bit arrogant personality. He grows deeper as the show goes forward and episode surrounding him are usually the strongest. He so clearly goes from the “know it all”, arrogant, calculator guy to a reliable friend who learns to trust his friends more than his wits, once again, without ever abandoning his true self. His growth is always in place, his actions are never out of character, and he faces troubles in unexpected, yet satisfying ways. I\'ll admit it, I have a soft spot for the character, but I think everyone could see all this in him.Yoshino: when your weakest character is still well developed you know you are looking at good material. Yoshino is the lazy yet responsible girl who- in the beginning- have some kind of inferiority complex, which she resolves as the series goes on and becomes an important asset to the team as well as a strong and determined person. The only thing I truly dislike about her is her background; it\'s not bad, but it\'s not fully exploited, and as such I would have liked to know a lot more about her family, but this is just a little complaint to an otherwise very well done character work.Ikuto: if there is a character that can compete with Tohma for saddest background it\'s him. He is a boy raised by Digimon, and as such he is mostly conflicted about his duality as human/digimon, and the series explores this issue with no fear and he grows around it. He goes all the way from wild reckless boy to what we could say is a very mature grown man. His character work is just outstanding, as it doesn\'t matter how many episodes pass by we see that he is always dealing with his duality as human/digimon, even when he seems to have accepted it, and that\'s just gold.The 4 main digimon: though the series is called ""Digimon"" the series focus way more in the human characters and their relation with their digimons. The digimons themselves are all fleshed out with their own quirks and personalities and show growth over the series, but it\'s mostly shadowed by the amazing character work of the human characters, but you can\'t stop noticing how much Agumon changed from the first arc to the last, and the same can be said about Gaomon, Lalamon and Falcomon; I won\'t go into details, but they all grow.Supporting: There are several! And all of them get their screentime and their due development in their limited time. Sayuri might be the weakest link, but she still has her moments as she shows how mothers have to struggle about seeing how their children might get hurt, but acknowledging that they must get hurt in order to grow, and as such she doesn\'t bother much. The rest of the supporting characters all have their own functions in different themes, and they show develop through the series.Sound: After feeling that Digimon Frontier lacked a little bit, I was glad to see that Savers came back with great tracks. ""Believer"" is a perfect evolution song as it fits every single character and ""Hiari"", the second opening, just shows us how this show came from its comedy roots embracing the darkest side of itself while never abandoning important themes as dreams and hopes. The tracks were masterfully chosen and scored.Enjoyment: The first time I watched Savers I was 17 and I loved it, as I was thrilled to see a Digimon series that dared to be as mature as it could be, to tell us a story about teens and their conflicts, and to see them overcoming such incredibly, almost hopeless, situations. I watched again at 19 and I was still as pleased as the first time. Now I\'m 21, this is my third time, and I still enjoyed as much as the first time; even if you know our heroes will make it to the end, you can get so much joy out of their journey and their growth that I think I can watch it several times and never be bored.As I said before, I respect people who disliked Savers, but I don\'t understand them. I\'ve read some of the reviewers who hated the series and they say ""this is not the Digimon I grew up with!"", now are they talking of Adventure, Tamers or Frontier? They are all different, and what is important is not to be similar, but to manage to exploit the storytelling and character potential that each series has: Tamers is way different from Adventure and still it triumphed because it denied its past and just wanted to create its own storytelling with the digimon elements. Savers does the same, and even surpasses Tamers (and almost reaches Adventure greatness) as it tell us a meaningful story that only lacks a bit on the first arc (with only 3 bad episodes) and delivers satisfying conclusions to each arc.I\'ll respect your opinions, and so I expect you to respect mine: for me Savers is the 2nd best Digimon series ever made, just slightly edged out by Adventure.Stray observations (funny bits of information I got while re-watching. May contain some spoilers):-In episode 5 we see Tohma bleeding; I think this is the first time ever a human has bled in a Digimon series.-These are the makeup exams Masaru took on episode 7: ""Modern Japanese Language"", ""English"", ""Japanese history"", ""Physics"", ""Mathematics"", and of course he didn\'t know anything about any of those subjects xD-Apparently Masaru likes to play the drum in Rock Band as seen in episode 7.-Every time a family matter is discussed Masaru grabbed his pendant, thinking about his father, which was a very good detail.-Banchouleomon laugh in episode 28 is epic!-Yoshino is so lazy that even in the short training sequence in episode 29 she didn\'t do anything xD.-Episode 31, Gaomon reaction to Masaru taking credit for Tohma\'s plan: ""It was master\'s plan"" I also got angry at Masaru back then too.-One great Yoshino moment: when she strikes a barrel at a Gizomon she finally shows some backbone!-The Masaru vs Tohma thing in episode 34 felt very much like Taichi vs Yamato from Adventure, it gave me goosebumps!-Masaru to Tohma in episode 35: ""Apologize to them with tour life! DIE!"" Now, that\'s the darkest side of Masaru. I applaud the writers for going there.-Gaomon in the finale, bringing tea to Tohma: ""It\'s my own blend. I call it \'my vow to meet you again\'"" that was so utterly cute that it got me to tears. I want a digimon like Gaomon!-At last, I\'d like to mention that, in my opinion, the finale is as perfect as Adventure\'s and Tamer\'s finales and left me with a wide open smile in my face. I didn’t want it to end!And that\'s it. As always, I hope you enjoyed this review. I\'ll make an effort and get through Digimon Xross Wars (the only Digimon series I dislike) and make a review, so… this might be the headline:Next time: Digimon Xross Wars tries to be every single Digimon series and manages to be none.', ""I remember when I was about eight or nine this used to be on Kix, and I absolutely loved it. And five or six years later, I look online to see the horrible reviews it's getting.To be fair, I never watched the original Digimon, so I can't really say anything. But I do know that this show doesn't deserve all the criticism it gets.From what I know, it's DRASTICALLY different from the previous Digimon series. Different art style, older-looking characters, and a completely different concept. From what I understand, the previous Digimon series were about children being sent to the digital world, and Savers/Data...Squad is about a group of people who capture Digimon who are sent to the human world. Honestly, I see why fans of the original might not like this one at first glance. But if you get past the first few episodes (which in all honesty, are a little cheesy), I'd say you'd enjoy it. The series gets a little darker, and a lot more serious.If you're a die-hard Digimon fan, maybe sit this one out. If you're new to the series, I'd say you'd enjoy it.Overall, I give this a well-deserved 8/10 Squad is about a group of people who capture Digimon who are sent to the human world.

Lots of stand out songs which have been burned into my memories, plenty to choose, all of which I enjoy.Art:I felt I needed to mention this since it is one of the weak parts of the show. I feel some of the attacks and actions could have looked even more epic, but a lot of it was either speeded up or just not given a finishing touch. I...also noticed the eyes would randomly teleport before the head would move into the correct position. Despite the lazy art design I thoroughly enjoyed this show.Story:The story itself I feel is quite strong, I love that this anime pulled in a couple of digimon factions that we had never seen together before. However I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies which occur in the show. One second a mega level is destroyed by an overwhelming attack, but next episode the same attack doesn't destroy champion or ultimate level digimon. This inconsistency occurs throughout the show to the point that I was questioning what the writers were thinking. Literally on the final boss, its attack defeats multiple mega level digimon, but then its attacks are stopped by mere champion levels.Overall I love Digimon and I feel this show saved itself from the disappointments of Frontier.

After a few years without Digimon, I was a little skeptical as to what this season would be like.For starters, I wouldn't recommend watching this if you are unfamiliar with past seasons of Digimon. They fail to explain basic facts that would leave newcomers perplexed.Character - Like all Digimon seasons, we have our main team of protagonists who set out to defeat the evil Digimon and save their own world as well as the Digital World. This time we get a cocky leader, Marcus, the more-mature and smart guy, Thomas, and the older female...lead, Yoshino. Yes, I watched the dub, so I'm unfamiliar with their original names. The character's can become rather annoying to watch, especially their useless arguments every other episode. It just gets old...fast. Not my favorite batch of DigiDestined...that's for sure.Story - Digimon Savers started out in the worst possible way. They spend over 10 episodes on the same concept: an evil Digimon appears in the human world and our protagonists fend them off while growing in power and battle experience. I understand that they wanted to show off their Digimon's forms, but we don't need to see the same thing numerous times that has almost nothing to do with a plot of some sort. It was extremely boring. When the real story finally starts, it can be a little confusing. Like all seasons, we get our first bad guy &quot;boss&quot; and then we get the true enemy. I suppose towards the end that the story gets more shocking, but it isn't anything special.Art &amp; Sound - The art is alright. I actually preferred the style used in previous seasons, but it isn't anything to complain about. The sound can get annoying, though.But anyway, Digimon Savers is probably the season that you would either love or hate. I, personally, hated it, but that's just me. lead, Yoshino.

I\'m glad that\'s over.This is my first ""review"" on MAL, and I will be blunt here. Take some of my thoughts with grain of salt, because the review is less organized, than I\'d like it to be.Before you leave, I won\'t bash Savers, because it ""ruined my childhood anime"". I went in hopeful for a change of setting.There will be some spoilers.Digimon Savers is the first full length Digimon series since Digimon Frontier in 2002-3. I\'ve seen quite a few people praise it for ""saving Digimon"" and being more ""mature"", than it\'s predecessors. For starters, it has more aggression and main cast aging from...mid teens to early twenties (with some variables), so it must be more mature. Right? Well.. no. It\'s not. I dare say it\'s even more childish than Frontier was.But would that be a bad thing on it\'s own? No. Definitely not. Seeing the first few episodes, I actually thought it would become a silly shounen adventure by the end.It didn\'t.It was actually aimed at a more ""mature"" audience, unlike the series prior and for that reason, after the initial few episodes went down, it turned into a ""serious business"" show.It didn\'t hit the mark.(I won\'t give points. Since everyone rates differently, I find them generally less useful than they\'re shown to be. What a 5 means to one person can be very different to what it means for another. I will give impressions instead.)Story:The story is about a cardboard cutout shounen manga protagonist saving the world with his fists. (Take this at face value.) Everything else is just a semi-bland mesh of spices.I don\'t dislike simple stories. Simple stories can be great. However even the simplest of stories need something entertaining going for them. This story you can experience by reading almost any shounen manga or by watching almost any shounen anime in a much more entertaining manner. The only thing different here are the Digimon as a choice for Monster of the Week monsters. You can predict most of it by looking at the first 15 episodes. Or watching every 4th one. Doesn\'t make a lick of difference. Considering all this, the story could have been charming if it was somewhat played for laughs. It wasn\'t. The plot takes itself extremely seriously and given it\'s subject matter it\'s completely laughable. Except I cried.What if it had a nice set of characters?About that...Characters:The main cast is a mess, but there are some unpolished gems. Too bad next to nothing is expanded on any of the characters except the main four and 1 or 2 others.The main four are:Masaru doesn\'t grow even a little bit as a character. He is depicted and is supposed to be accepted as an idealistic view on a ""MAN"". This is demonstrated though him beating up others (including Digimon) and through this they start to respect him, because he ""talked to them with his fists"" and ""that\'s the way a man does things"". He is like this until literally the last frame and is presented extremely seriously. I hoped that he would grow out of this personality or do something productive with it, like all other digimon protags, but he didn\'t. The other saving option would have been that the story and he himself turns purposely corny. This doesn\'t happen either. He is a worthless character in every sense of the word.Tohma has a little bit more growth as a person than Masaru, but it\'s still filled with overdone clichés and exaggerated, meaningless drama. He is mostly only there to be the rival trope for the self-insert protag.Yoshino is there, because ""cool older sister"" trope. That\'s it. She has no character arc. No, that one episode doesn\'t count.Ikuto has by far the most well made character arc, but sadly, as many a reviewer said before me: No matter how much you polish a turd, it won\'t become a piece of gold. He is a little shithead through the first ~20 episodes he\'s featured in. After that he becomes completely docile until the end. He has two agendas. The first one: HUMAN=EVIL, next one HUMAN+DIGIMON=GOOD. He\'s supposed to represent the ""humans\' potential to live alongside digimon peacefully"" and ""HUMAN EVOLUTION"" ((within the context of the Digimon shows: growing up)). (In contrast, in all other Digimon series before this, all characters had this happen to them very naturally and mostly without being constantly hammered through the ""retarded viewer\'s"" skull.)Some of the others:The partner digimon are cute but that\'s it. They have basic personalities. Agumon is always hungry and is the same as Masaru. Gaomon is a butler. Lalamon is... well.. sometimes a straight man to Yoshino I guess? Falcomon is mostly a mirror to Ikuto. Kamemon had some potential, but he is mostly just there, saying and doing nothing. Sometimes he fights alongside Yushima. The two PawnChessmon are purely for support, same for their tamers. Kudamon and Satsuma combo is fun to listen to sometimes, but they\'re filling the bare minimum roles of ""a father to his men""-type boss characters.There is one supporting character who\'s constantly mentioned through the entire series. He\'s Masaru\'s dad. He is the same as Masaru and nothing is really done with him other than constant praise by everyone. He\'s basically a ""means to an end"" character. He\'s mainly used to justify happenings in the story.The enemy characters were explained with:""He\'s a cackling evil scientist, kill him."" and ""He\'s an emotionless algorithm, kill him.""The first one has a long and drawn-out buildup, basically shoving a shitton of ""kick the dog"" moments to show how he\'s evil because he\'s evil. The other antagonist on the other hand comes out of nowhere and blames the entire humanity for one man\'s actions and decides in his infinite wisdom to kill everyone. His followers obey him without any questions or showing any character until the last two episodes.The characters I enjoyed seeing were few and far between, but here they are in no particular order: Mercurimon, Craniummon, Satsuma, Kudamon, Yushima.I also love hearing that voice actor from the mouth of Dukemon (even though at first it was a bit jarring to hear Tamers Guilmon\'s voice back from Savers Dukemon).Art:Mediocre, but I won\'t fault Toei. Making Saturday morning stuff with limited time (and lack of direction and probably a lack of faith from the higher-ups) is definitely not easy. Especially in the mid 2000s, making a promo, monster of the week show for Digimon. At least the battles were spectacular and a lot better than the first two and the fourth series\' battles and most CGI wasn\'t bad. (Except for the MachGaogamon evolution. Every time the frame-rate drops form 24 to 3, a little bit of my soul evaporates.)Sound:One of the better points. The openings are nice and energetic, the endings are calming (though not sure how fitting they are for this kind of presentation). The Evolution song is one that I really like. It\'s the perfect song to just shout loud. I love it. The other OST is not bad, but I can\'t hum any of it after watching the whole series. It\'s just there. Sometimes I remember it fitting the atmosphere, but most of the time I can\'t recall any of it. The voice acting cast is good enough, though Yoshino\'s voice actress sounds extremely uninterested half the time.Enjoyment:Poor. I enjoyed how they showed us the characters in the first couple of episodes and I remember thinking ""Huh, this is vastly different from before, but so far I like it! I wonder how they\'ll make them likeable or what story will go around them!""If you\'ve read this far, you already know the answer to those questions.Overall:I did not enjoy Digimon Savers. It was a copy-paste of the first volume of any shounen manga story about school gang-fighting and how that\'s honorable. Add some Digimon and that\'s it. The characters don\'t change, which was one of the cornerstones of the previous four Digimon series. The story is by the numbers and even like this, it\'s taken bloody seriously. Last but not least, the show treats the viewers like morons.I can\'t find a single reason to watch this anime over basically any other shounen of similar length or indeed any Digimon series that aired before it. If you honestly enjoyed it or can take the piss out of it, I\'m happy for you. Sadly I couldn\'t. mid teens to early twenties (with some variables), so it must be more mature. Right? Well.. no.

I would have given it a 4, but there are some things I actually somewhat enjoyed about Digimon Savers, so I thought calling it downright ""bad"" would be inappropriate. So instead I\'m going to say: this series is not good. It\'s not the worst ever, but it\'s not good. This comes from a person who has loved the Digimon merchandise as a whole for almost ten years.When Savers originally...aired, I simply ignored it. I wasn\'t that high on Digimon hype back then and from the very first promo picture I could tell I didn\'t like the series. Only this year I finally decided to check it out, as I\'ve seen all the other seasons.It took me over a month to finish it.Story: The plot is fairly unoriginal. The digital world and the human world are beginning to overlap, main characters fight against invading digimon with their partners, a couple of sub plots emerge, and in the end they save both worlds by defeating a strong enemy.There are only two things that really distinguish this season from the others: firstly the way the main characrers have been made young adults instead of kids, and the DATS organisation. The former is a nice idea but poorly executed, and the latter somewhat reminds me of Tamers and isn\'t that original afterall. Most of the time I really couldn\'t bring myself to care about what was going on. The most interesting part of the story, for me anyway, was the concept of a team of researchers venturing to the digital world ten years before the main characters met their partners, and the fate of Daimon Suguru. Otherwise the overall plot took off clumsily and didn\'t reach any kind of peak of excitement. There wasn\'t a single episode that honestly would have left me feeling like I wanted to know what happens next.Overall, I think the story could have been better if it was carried out better.Art: Definitely the biggest setback of the whole series. It looks awful. The number of well-drawn episodes can be counted with the fingers of one hand, and that isn\'t much of help anyway as the colour scheme is one of the worst I have ever seen (and I have seen a good bunch of different kinds of anime, honestly). Just look at the shades of Masaru\'s hair and red outfit - they are unbelievably ugly. Overall the colours look dirty and grey-ish.And as I mentioned already, this series has very poor art, even on a kids\' show\'s standards. All the other Digimon seasons are better drawn, possibly thanks to their simple style. I cannot understand why they had to change the style so drastically to the worse. Savers is a gold mine of incorrect anatomy, awkward angles and bad perspective, not to mention their faces which were beautifully drawn only on very rare occasions. I swear Chika\'s face is drawn well only once in the whole series, and that is in the very last episode.The character designs do not appeal to me, at all. They lack imagination, the colours are mostly an eyesore, and their clothes are often ridiculous (for example the skin-tight DATS jumpsuits). Ikuto doesn\'t even look like a Digimon character. The way they changed Agumon to look much more artless is definitely a sign of plain laziness. And the list of weak points goes on and on. The animation is also mostly very poorly done and it often ended up making me laugh at its primality.Altogether, art-wise this series is a reminiscent of the ugly style of the beginning of the 00s when digital animation was still a new thing and animators weren\'t skilled enough yet. Considering that Digimon Savers came out in 2006 (and the older seasons look much, much better), this is rather outrageous.Sounds: The soundtrack had some good, memorable tunes, but mostly I didn\'t even think about the music all that much. I didn\'t like any of the opening & ending songs either but this, I can say, is probably due to my personal pickiness when it comes to music, so the songs aren\'t necessarily bad. The evolution theme, Believer, is quite likeable, though not one of my favourite insert songs from Digimon.Not many people have commented on the seiyuu/voice actors of the series. This is yet another issue regarding Digimon Savers. While I adore some of his roles, Hoshi Souichirou manages to sound extremely annoying as Masaru most of the time, as shouting and screaming isn\'t one of his fortes. In almost every episode, he is doing some very over-the-top over-acting.Much worse than Hoshi is Yoshino\'s VA who simply cannot act at all. She sounds emotionless, forced and just plain stupid. I cannot comprehend why they couldn\'t give Yoshino a proper seiyuu, as the previous seasons showed some great talents and very famous actors.Another very poor attempt at acting was provided by the seiyuu of the blond-haired DATS woman, whose name I have entirely forgotten. She is a minor character, but I felt like ripping my head off every time she opened her mouth.I have no further complaints about the cast, though. Especially Nojima Hirofumi and Nakai Kazuya sound wonderful as Touma and Gaomon - Nakai has never sounded this cute before!Characters: This section is mostly made of my personal opinions instead of facts, please don\'t forget that.Stereotypical and un-inspiring or simply annoying, the characters of Digimon Savers did not impress me. Masaru is your typical aggressive main character dressed in red, and it made me very sad how they didn\'t even care to give him goggles like every other main boy. Agumon lacks all of the charm his predecessor in Adventure had and is mostly tiresome for me to watch.Yoshino has very little to none personality with her Lalamon and I found it difficult to think anything at all about her (apart from her horrible VA). I guess she\'s supposed to be level-leaded yet insecure but I\'m not even sure. She was given very little highlight throughout the show.Touma and Gaomon, on the other hand, while not all that original either, are lovely characters and pretty much the only reason I bothered to complete this series. Touma, unlike the other characters, has multiple levels to his personality and is surprisingly refreshing even for a rival character in Digimon - I have to say he\'s like an older, half-European version of Jenrya (who happens to be my favourite from Tamers) but possibly even more charming. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones where the focus was on Touma\'s independent whereabouts. I guess you can call me biased like that.Ikuto, while his story was unique considering the whole Digimon verse, annoyed me right from the moment he was introduced. I tried very hard to like him but ended up disliking him more and more by every episode. His design is overdone and I can\'t stand bratty brats like him, no matter how justified his personality is by his past. Everything about him as a Digimon character is just way off.Masaru\'s family, sans his father, didn\'t manage to bring any emotion out of me. I liked his father and BanchouLeomon though, their story was interesting and delightful considering how he\'s the first seriously meaningful parent character ever in Digimon (well, maybe along with Jenrya\'s father). Overall I preferred Touma\'s family\'s bittersweet dynamics.The two DATS women were unnecessary and pointless, and I didn\'t care much about the villains either and didn\'t really understand all of their motives. In my eyes they were pretty much recycled material from other seasons and didn\'t bring anything new and exciting with them.The other minor characters, such as Satsuma, were nice - and weirdly seemed to have much more personality than Yoshino who\'s supposed to be the main girl...Overall, I couldn\'t get myself to sympathise much with the cast and found myself constantly annoyed at them - for example, the sub story with Chika and Piyomon was just plain boring in my opinion. The characters and their relationships lack charm and excitement and had very little to offer for someone who\'s seen all the seasons. I was hoping for the main characters to build interesting relationships with each other and it never happened.Enjoyment: Digimon Savers does have its occasional saving graces (namely Touma, Gaomon and Suguru), but overall it is a weak anime with poor production values and doesn\'t have any nostalgic value for an old Digimon fan. It didn\'t make me laugh with its lazy humour, and neither did it make me cry (seasons 1-4 did, quite easily actually). It\'s like a poor attempt to create a season where the fans can relate to the grown-up ""digidestined"". I guess I did enjoy it enough to watch all 48 episodes, but on the other hand, at times I just stopped watching for a week.Overall, if the art and animation in Savers were better (say, similiar to the other series), I might have enjoyed it somewhat more. But as it is, even Xros Wars (which has gained a fair amount of unpopularity) appeals to me more. aired, I simply ignored it.

The main character is  Masaru Daimon who loves to fight. His Digimon is a new Agumon, and I'm saying new because this Agumon doesn't look like the old Agumon we all know and love. This fella is taller, his nostrils are bigger and he has these weird red bracers.Now I haven't watched a lot of this season, and...I have dropped it but I might come back to it. Why? Well the story in my opinion is pretty good. It might not interest some Digimon fans into watching it since the story has changed quite a bit. These guys don't go into the virtual world that we know as the Digital World people. However, the series is quite funny in some stages.Art looks generally alright, this is what IO wouold expect from an anime, especially from the year this was made. The colours are beautful and some of the backgrounds are nice and detailed, simply lovely.The sound is pretty good as well, it's nice to listen to and it changes into well fitted music for each scene. Nothing else needs to be said here!The characters are quite good in their own sense. The development in these characters are shown straight from the first episode. From the first episode you knwo the main character loves to fight, and he ends up fighting with Agumon and stuff. Throughout the anime and the storyline, you get to really know the characters.Enjoyment, eh? Well I did enjoy this quite a lot, but the one thing that annoyed me the most was how Agumon looked. No-one can really blame me on this, since I've grown up with Pokemon and Digimon, and the monsters on these ttwo shows. If I see a Digimon I love get changed then I wouldn't say 'yay', I would say 'ney' because I grew up loving that Digimon. However, Digimon Savers is a good anime.

Some of the other seasons connected with each other this one COMPLETELY DID NOT!! The art was totally different and  it didn't have the same feel as the previous seasons. The characters weren't that likeable in my opinion. They attempted to make a new story and bring Digimon back but this was not the way to do it. WORST DIGIMON series so far. I tried to give it a shot by watching the first 5 but it just was not doing it for me. I tried to watch it...in both English and in Japanese, neither worked for me. The voices in the English were horrible as well. I'm an aesthetic person and the art was what turned me off the most though on this.

Due to Digimon Savers ""excellent animation and story"" I have to write one as to warn people who love Digimon franchise.Story : I have to agree that Digimon Savers has the most unique storytelling compare to other digimon franchise. Not only the main characters is someone who is old (compare to others, where most of the character is 10-13 years old) most of character is 14 years old and above. Not only that, they have their own squad,...and the story doesn’t start from digital world (I don’t know if this considered as spoiler, but it is all there in Episode 1). But, background story and how they meet their digimon is not clearly told (except for daimon and yoshino). I give 7/10 for the storyCharacter : here is the downfall of this anime. The main character somehow outshines all digimon including his own digimon, agumon. Not only that, most of the digimon’s size is HUGEE (well, it is not the main problem, they look cute anyway). Using your will and emotion only can’t save you all the time, well unless you are Daimon, then it is possible. I give 6/10. Why 6? Because there is Tohma Norstein,  Yoshino and Ikuto characters somehow save this series and made it enjoyable to me.Sound : The opening, ending and insert song is not catchy enough for me compared to Tamers, 01 and 02. I didn’t skip the opening, so that somehow i can fall in love with the opening, but i still don’t like it. I give 5/10 out of generosity.Art : the animation is so far okay. It’s not bad but not that good. You can still watch it and enjoy (it doesn\'t give you any eye cancer). I give 7/10.Enjoyment : From the first episode until around 29, I plan to give 10/10 to this series, but after that, the story just fall over the cliff for no reason. I can’t say that I enjoyed but i was a fun ride to finish this series although most probably in this near future, I won’t re watch it, maybe 5-8 years later. I give 5/10.After watching 48 episode include the special episode, I have conclude that the most powerful Digimon is Daimon. And if you somehow despise Daimon, you will have a hard time to finish this series.

his attitude is impulsive,rude&inconsiderate and he NEVER changes,he has no chemistry with any of the other main characters he even treats his partner agumon like a subordinate thug.It is in stark contrast to the original season where kids had vibrant personalities and they all worked with each other like a family and they learned NOT to be impulsive&inconsiderate(Skullgreymon Episode) but here the show glorifies marcus\'s thuggish  shenanigans.----------Yoshino:-----------If you search for ""Token  Anime girl""  on google you\'d most likely see yoshino\'s photo on the front page.. she\'s the textbook definition of that she\'s bland,boring,shallow,whiny and much like marcus she never changes!It is quite BAFFLING to me that despite being a main character she  has ABSOLUTELY ZERO relevance to the plot like AT ALL and her partner is just as forgettable&bland as her.----------Thomas:-----------He\'s yet another angsty tsundere/child prodigy he\'s basically batman if he was a 15 yr old with too much estrogen,his partner is a loyal dog kinda like gabuwhatever.But TBH compared the psycho thug and the miss bland universe Thomas is actually likeable&interesting he has a decent backstory but his character arc is rushed,his relationship with his sister just isn\'t built up  as well as taichi\'s bond with Kari or the bond of henry&suzie.In other words Thomas\'s sister\'s(much like marcus\'s sister) is a very generic moe girl NOT like a real life child.--------Kurata:---------He\'s easily the best character in this season too bad he has the Evil scientist syndrome but TBH most of villains in Digimon series have been just evil for no good reason but Kurata is a human which makes it kind of weird.Nonetheless he\'s a joy to watch he\'s sleazy,he uses politics and dirty tricks to archive his goals.-----------------Keenan/Itsuno:------------------A feral child raised by digimom and even though almost all digimons can speak fluently he speaks like Tarzan ""Me digimon hate Hoomans!"" i guess he\'s just retarded,whatever he\'s still  better than the psycho thug too bad the show again rushes his mother\'s relationship thus ending his character arc.His mother also comes off as uncomfortably inappropriate in one episode.==========ARTSTYLE (4/10)==========The artstlye is kind of  a mixed bag.. its vivid and doesn\'t have the tradmark ""Digimon"" artstyle on the surface it just looks like another generic anime.the main problem is with the animation and the character&Digimon designs... the animation is very inconsistent in quality,sometimes its very choppy,sometimes its smooth,sometimes the black outline is overly prominent,the adult 30+ women look like they\'re in the early college years.and then there\'s Digimon\'s butchered proportions  now to understand the problem you have to first consider the fact that the official designs for most of the digimons from Bandai are not supposed to be that Big.. yet Savers takes the liberty to make Digimons who were never intended to be taller than your average 10 yr old  taller than a goddamn skyscraper.and they can\'t even draw agumon with a consistent height sometimes he\'s drawn as if he\'s as tall as Masaru where its clearly the animator\'s fault.=============SOUNDTRACK (8/10)=============Its Digimon OST! i\'m no big fan of J-pop songs really these insert songs are just amazing no matter what season these songs are guaranteed to grow on you, at first i didn\'t even like ""believer"" but then slowly it became one of my fav Digimon songs.The jap OST also has latin songs for EPIC moments XD clichéd&cheesy yes but awesome nonetheless.The U.S dubbing also has decent rock/metal BGM and nice evolution theme  but i\'d definitely suggest you watch the original as some of the insert songs just make the show much more enjoyable.===========CONCLUSION 6/10===========This is a decent Shonen/action anime which takes painfully long to start going somewhere and it just doesn\'t feel like ""Digimon"" its too mean spirited ,lacks any semblance of realism(character wise),maturity&mysticism which the series is known for,if you aren\'t a fan of Digimon and are just looking a fun action packed anime watch Hellsing OVA instead. convinced then they made it obvious by the use ""neuralizers"" and how Digimons follow a consistent pattern of turning into Giants,till this season Size never really mattered in Digimon but in this season apparently everything has to be of EPIC proportions,it also strives to be all dark&edgy but refuses to actually be mature&logically coherent like Tamers was,its all flash and no substance.For ex: In the older seasons(Adventure&Tamers) adults&children alike interacted with each other like actual human beings but here the characters act like they\'re from Ranma 1/2,even in extremely serious&dangerous situations the characters are busy throwing snarky nonchalant remarks at each other whereas parents of the teens are just stock  anime characters who are less believable than Digimons.And to top it all off... unlike the other seasons where children had to rely on their partners&parents and bond with them to survive here that complex character development structure is reduced to DBZ logic,screaming&willing for power basically gives them more power and people can be brought back from dead there is no need for personal introspections or realistic family problems,its mostly about being ass kicking angsty teens who have a dysfunctional relationship with each other and mostly apathetic relations with their own parents.and that\'s pretty much the gist of it,nothing really substantial happens till Ep 24 mark, avoiding any major spoilers the ""Kurata Arc"" is pretty much the high point of this season and then after that it starts recycling old plot elements from tamers&adventure like how both digimon&humans fight together against a new enemy which threatens both worlds and how the hot blooded guy has a duel with the level headed guy,except this time its not as well written.============CHARACTERS (3/10)============-------------------Marcus/Masaru :--------------------Before i delve into this character let me inform you that THIS guy is the main protagonist of this season,80% of spotlight is reserved for him,if you don\'t like him the very least the chances are you\'re not going to like the entire season.Our main ""protagonist"" is a 15 yr old street thug with an IQ of a rock(he goes to school and doesn\'t know what is a VIRUS is!) and from his crazy violent behaviour i can only guess that he has a testosterone imbalance.His physical feats are outrageous he can Jump 40 ft in the air and still manage to give a K.O punch to a giant monster AND land perfectly fine without fracturing his legs.. if that\'s not absurd enough for you then he can also nosedive his fist directly into a giant titanium shield AND break it.BTW the ""DNA charge"" doesn\'t seem to allow Thomas&Yoshino or anyone else to do these inhumane feats,heck marcus was able to seriously beat the crap out of Garurumon(A giant fox) without DNA charge.So putting THAT aside he is just an unlikeable douchebag!

For the first third of the season starts out bland and just your typical ""MOW"" (Monster of the week) formula, by episode 13. You finally could take the show seriously the second third of season just focus on their exploration of the Digital World and we found out more on how Digimon is roaming into the human world and meet our antagonist of the show, Karata. He plans to whipe out all the Digimon with his man made Digimon...known as Gizumon. The Gizumon comes from Digimon DNA except he doesn\'t have a heart. His plot were actually totally devious. Now the third half is where they jumped the shark. Honestly the King Drasil (mind you I watched the dub) Arc was quite boring. Granted, it was okay that we get to know more about Kudamon and we find out that he\'s was a Royal Knight by his Mega Level Kentarosmon. But aside from that I wasn\'t amazed from this Arc. That where Data Squad (Savers) suffered.Characters (9)Each character pretty much developed alot. Marcus started off as a reckless jerk with no type of common sense. But later on he realizes that he can\'t just rely on his fist all the time. Thomas started as a douchebag by just being a smartass. But he gets much nicer at later on. He even had to trick his friends just to save his own sister. I can\'t say much about Yoshi except she becomes more friendly.. But that\'s it. Now Keenan had the most. He started as a kid who hated Digimon we soon realizes their was a reason to it. His Digi-mother Frigimon was killef by Gizumon. Merucimon and Marcus convinces him that human aren\'t bad.

I have been since I was a kid watching them air on tv. I never watched Savers when I was younger so I came into this fresh.Initially I absolutely hated this show. I watched the English dub and despite having some great VA's, they couldn't save some awful writing. I, like many people, found the intial arc to be horrible. Its really boring and doesn't get you to care about the universe or the characters. Many characters seem to be copies of other main characters from other series.Over time it did get better...though. I would never say I felt it was great though. By far the most redeeming factor for this entire show is Marcus. He seems dumber than any other main character we've had so far, but he actually punches the Digimon in the face. And its amazing. If they made a Savers 2 where Agumon disappears for some reason and its just Marcus punching everything in the face, I'm in. though. I would never say I felt it was great though.

Gleipnir,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39463/Gleipnir,"[""Gleipnir is an over the top edgy mess of a show and if I had to give it any compliments it would be that the fight scenes are well choreographed and have smooth animation, but sadly that’s where my compliments end. This show is so aggressively gross that it makes it hard to enjoy any of the non-toxic parts of it, and when I say gross I don't mean like blood, gore, and cum type of gross I mean like reading a middle schooler’s hyper-specific fetish fanfiction type of gross. Any time the author tries to get me to sympathize with the relationship between the...main character and the abusive yandere chick it just makes me feel like I'm watching a gaslighting in slow motion. So in summary, Gleipnir is A show that had the potential to be a fun edgy mess but it just ends up feeling like it was written by a middle schooler with a very specific fetish. main character and the abusive yandere chick it just makes me feel like I'm watching a gaslighting in slow motion.

You're so sticky and wet. I'm going all the way in. It's so warm and fits just nicely. Does it hurt? We're one now.I'm just a mere being wandering on the hellhole that is earth and as such, I don't deserve anything worthy of praise. But when Gleipnir knocked out my doorstep I straight away knew that this was the present I've always wanted. Yes, because Gleipnir is more than an anime - it's a new experience to be witnessed at least once in our dismal life. Something that would make our hearts go full uwu.Gleipnir isn't the usual story....It's far deeper than you may initially think. In fact, I'd consider this on par with Monster. Just imagine Johan as Shuuichi and his sister, Anna as Clair. An indissoluble bond. In this case, however, they're not really brother and sister. Neither a couple nor friends. They're life--fighting for the freedom that some despicable beings have extracted from them. It's a harsh truth and yet, they don't surrender. They never will and with that only they'll make new friends. With that only, they'll have an adventure that's both fun and sad.Gleipnir was a pleasant surprise. Because I thought to see something where the protagonist just gets some powers and with that only he'll get out of anything fairly unharmed. While I admit there's a bit of friendship power in here I would be lying if I said that the whole thing is to build on that only. Shuuichi never wanted to be in such a situation, yet he's there fighting all kinds of monsters. Without Clair, he'd be dead by now. She was an inspiration--no she was the will Shuuichi never had. Without her, he would have not done anything he has done. Isn't Clair great though? I'd say that she was the highlight of the anime. Indeed she's the best character with also the saddest backstory in the whole anime. Not only that--she won't let anyone down. If she starts caring about someone/something you bet your ass that she won't surrender until it gets that shit done. Some may consider that selfish I'd say it leads more to dedication. The dedication she has had is nothing short of a miracle.The other characters are significantly meaningful as well. Everyone in a pretty cool fashion do what they're told to do in the first place. Some are edgy and some are not. Some are cute and some are not. Some are strong and some are not. It's a near-perfect cast of characters that exist to give our favorite duo a run for their money, which is necessary for their growth in the repugnant world they live in.For you to understand Gleipnir you have to look beyond the obvious.

For instance, I don’t have to suffer every week watching some kid in a creepy mascot animal outfit running around. Watching Gleinpir was not a pleasant experience and by unpleasant, I mean the type of unpleasant that makes you want to turn the television off.First of all, let’s ask ourselves, just what the hell is Gleipnir? It’s not a real word but a creation made by Sun Takeda. With that out of the way, you may probably want to take a closer glance at the synopsis because it’s full of...bizarreness. Even our main protagonist Shuuichi Kaguya has a strange characteristic – the ability to transform into a monster. And after encountering a mysterious girl named Claire Aoki, his life gets even stranger. As with supernatural mystery stories, I tend to think Gleipnir as the type that tries to be as mysterious as possible. In this base form, we see our main characters trying to find answers but it’s obvious that something darker and sinister lurks behind the scenes. Does Gleipnir takes its opportunity to capitalize on its premise to make this into a pleasant experience? Hell no.There’s actually nothing wrong with a show being edgy or even use shock value to be appealing. The main problem lies on how Gleipnir executes its ideas. The mystery seems intriguing on paper until you see how thin the storytelling really is. From the first episodes, I got the impression of a ridiculous show without a clear target audience. Let’s face it, this isn’t an easy anime to recommend to anyone. At its core, we do have the relationship between Shuuichi and Claire, two characters that are practically polar opposite of each other. It doesn’t help that Shuuichi is a reserved individual with little social experience. Take away his ability of monster transformation and there’s literally nothing special about him. On the other hand, Claire is a clever girl who managed to blackmail Shuuichi and can be deceptively hard to read. Even though her goal is to find the truth about the monsters and her older sister, it seems no one can really understand her. Despite her age, she doesn’t seem to retain a moral sense for humanity. What I mean is that she actually kills others without hesitation and isn’t afraid to take daring risks. After gaining control of Shuuichi’s body, she literally becomes a killing machine although not mindlessly but with a purpose. Throughout the series, she shows no mercy towards her enemies and it’s shown to be taken lightly. Gleipnir seems to force body horror and fan service at numerous amounts, sometimes perhaps way too much for its own good. Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship is built on trust although with more episodes progresses, they seem to grow more intimate. Don’t expect true love blooming between the pair though. The author didn’t want to pull the trigger because this is obviously not some fairy tale romance.While Shuuichi and Claire has to carry this show on their backs, there are a few individuals worth mentioning. First, there’s Elena, Claire’s older sister who possesses a twisted obsession towards Shuuichi. Perhaps one of the most mentally unstable characters in the show, she represents the dark side of humanity and is willing to do anything to get what she wants. If you’re familiar with the term ‘yandere’, that’s basically what she is. Then, there’s the mysterious ‘Alien’, a character who is looking for other aliens on their planet. Truth to be told, he is a big question mark as no one knows exactly what he is. Taking the form of a young man, we do know that he will grant a wish to anyone who can help him achieve his own goal. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t devote enough time to explore his own story as we are constantly fed with Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship. Being a show about monsters, this came to me as no surprise although I do wish the show made more time on characterizing Alien. He seems to be much more than just a mystery. For what’s worth, most of the other characters this season are less appealing despite some having important roles. Kaito, Honoka, and Sayaka are a few examples as it’s hard to get invested into their characters. It seems the anime wants to evoke emotions for the viewers but with such limited storytelling, these characters aren’t worth to watch for. Even in the case of our main leads, they don’t strike to me as anything special. Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship is saturated by lazy writing that anyone could easily come up with. That’s also to say, the overall direction of the plot is mediocre at best and couldn’t be salvaged even if it’s twice episode count length. Thank goodness it isn’t.I sincerely hope you don’t plan to watch Gleipnir with your family or kids around. This isn’t a show suited for the faint of heart. Gleipnir seems to be in love with itself, being that it loves fan service. It uses it in the form of nudity, body horror, and gruesome action scenes. It isn’t ashamed to pull the trigger with violence in ways with heads being tore off or body ligaments being blown to pieces. Claire is also a walking billboard of fan service as she’s half naked nearly half the show. And let’s not forget, she literally climbs into Shuuichi to control his body. That’s like some twisted form of metaphoric union. Of course, let’s not forget the appearances of the monsters themselves. I don’t know if it’s just me but somehow, Shuuichi’s monster form looks unintentionally comical. It looks like a creepy oversized toy that came to life. Here I am sitting wondering what made the author create a monster to look such way. Is how they see stuffed animals from nightmares?No, I can’t recommend Gleipnir to you and it’s more than just because it’s “edgy”. Even without the shockingly amount of grotesque elements stuffed into this show, it still remains mediocre by the contents of its plot and characters. It’s barely watchable at best and sometimes, I wish I didn’t jump into the manga either. Because for me, watching Gleipnir is kind of like eating junk food and you feel too guilty to know the mistake until it’s too damn late. bizarreness.

The author didn’t want to pull the trigger because this is obviously not some fairy tale romance.While Shuuichi and Claire has to carry this show on their backs, there are a few individuals worth mentioning. First, there’s Elena, Claire’s older sister who possesses a twisted obsession towards Shuuichi. Perhaps one of the most mentally unstable characters in the show, she represents the dark side of humanity and is willing to do anything to get what she wants. If you’re familiar with the term ‘yandere’, that’s basically what she is. Then, there’s the mysterious ‘Alien’, a character who is looking for other aliens on their planet. Truth to be told, he is a big question mark as no one knows exactly what he is. Taking the form of a young man, we do know that he will grant a wish to anyone who can help him achieve his own goal. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t devote enough time to explore his own story as we are constantly fed with Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship. Being a show about monsters, this came to me as no surprise although I do wish the show made more time on characterizing Alien. He seems to be much more than just a mystery. For what’s worth, most of the other characters this season are less appealing despite some having important roles. Kaito, Honoka, and Sayaka are a few examples as it’s hard to get invested into their characters. It seems the anime wants to evoke emotions for the viewers but with such limited storytelling, these characters aren’t worth to watch for. Even in the case of our main leads, they don’t strike to me as anything special. Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship is saturated by lazy writing that anyone could easily come up with. That’s also to say, the overall direction of the plot is mediocre at best and couldn’t be salvaged even if it’s twice episode count length. Thank goodness it isn’t.I sincerely hope you don’t plan to watch Gleipnir with your family or kids around. This isn’t a show suited for the faint of heart. Gleipnir seems to be in love with itself, being that it loves fan service. It uses it in the form of nudity, body horror, and gruesome action scenes. It isn’t ashamed to pull the trigger with violence in ways with heads being tore off or body ligaments being blown to pieces. Claire is also a walking billboard of fan service as she’s half naked nearly half the show. And let’s not forget, she literally climbs into Shuuichi to control his body. That’s like some twisted form of metaphoric union. Of course, let’s not forget the appearances of the monsters themselves. I don’t know if it’s just me but somehow, Shuuichi’s monster form looks unintentionally comical. It looks like a creepy oversized toy that came to life. Here I am sitting wondering what made the author create a monster to look such way. Is how they see stuffed animals from nightmares?No, I can’t recommend Gleipnir to you and it’s more than just because it’s “edgy”. Even without the shockingly amount of grotesque elements stuffed into this show, it still remains mediocre by the contents of its plot and characters. It’s barely watchable at best and sometimes, I wish I didn’t jump into the manga either. Because for me, watching Gleipnir is kind of like eating junk food and you feel too guilty to know the mistake until it’s too damn late.', '--THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW--What if I told you an anime could be surprisingly well animated, have characters that get solid development, a fairly interesting story with plenty of mystery and action, a BANGER of a soundtrack, all of this combined...while still absolutely being edgy, ecchi trash? That is Gleipnir in a nutshell. It’s nothing amazing and there’s an argument for it just being a “surprisingly good ecchi show”, but I see it more as a genuinely good show with effort put in that just also has a ton of fanservice and innuendos. Having been caught up on the manga, without spoiling anything...I can certainly say the anime adaption adds some minor improvements to the story and characters, and overall does what an anime adaption should and enhances the source material. I will say right now if you’re not a fan of ecchi, you probably won’t enjoy this. I don’t like ecchi either but I was able to ignore it, and got a genuinely enjoyable and well made series out of it. There is A LOT of fanservice though, and straight up nudity in the manga so uh yeah be aware of that before starting the series.--Story--Want to see a half nude, hotblooded, not entirely sane girl kick butt in a discount FNAF suit? We got that. What about a weak-willed MC that develops a spine and tries to figure out his purpose in life? We got that. Maybe a gang of scumbags using the power of friendship? We got that. Want to see an incel get cucked by the MC, and cry about it? Oh yes, we got that.A basic synopsis of this story is just that Shuichi our male protag has the power to turn into a giant sports mascot costume for a reason he can’t remember why. He saves our main female protag Clair who was trying to kill herself, Clair figures out Shuichi’s secret and black mails him into helping her. Basically, her sister killed her parents and left her with a coin, these coins seem to be related to Shuichi’s power somehow, and she forces him to help her figure out the mystery of this town and quite the mystery it is.Gleipnir is a wild ride from start to finish. It doesn’t have a super deep message to give really, but it’s good edgy fun with some nice heartfelt, emotional moments sometimes. Ultimately, the premise is unique enough and the mystery is thrilling enough to keep you invested I’d say. I’d say at least give it 3-4 episodes, before you decide to drop it.--Characters--The cast of characters while not being super unique, are well rounded and likeable enough to enjoy. Any characters that might be considered annoying are usually very minor characters, and aren’t important at all to the plot.The character designs of the transformations I would certainly say are unique though. The various “monsters” , especially the more important ones, have some really cool designs and powers.Out of our 2 MC’s (AKA Shuichi and Clair), Clair is the much more interesting and compelling one out of the 2. Shuichi is a fine character, but his role in the story is more him trying to find his purpose in life, who he is as a person, and also being the weapon/tool Clair uses to fight with. He’s your typical weak nerd that eventually grows a spine. He has some good moments, but I would say while they’re technically equally important to the story, the story puts much more emphasis on Clair.Clair on the other hand works very well as a strong willed female protag. A lot of people are just going to see her as fap material or maybe even a discount Yuno Gasai, but fanservice aside, do you want a good character? You got a pretty good one that gets great development. She starts off as this seemingly half suicidal loon that is willing to do anything to get more info on these coins, but as the series progresses you get to learn what really makes her tick and what kind of person she is. She falls a bit into the crazy yandere trope, but she’s more just reckless and ruthless than outright insane and murder crazy. Her relationship with Shuichi is actually kind of cute, and isn’t just “I love you for no reason so I can appeal to some filthy weeb self inserting”. I mean there is a bit of that, but that’s more on the fanservice side of things. She is willing to forsake all kinds of morals and ethics to get what she wants, but she also cares for those around her and since she basically has nothing to lose she’s willing to do some terrible things even if she deep down would rather not.The rest of the cast ranges from generic and tropey to actually good as characters. The side cast of the protags are fairly generic outside of one character who becomes important about halfway through. The antagonists are a good bit more fleshed out but are a tad generic outside of the actual main villain and a girl with deep relations to both our MC’s. I will say my fave characters outside of the MC’s were Erena and Yoshioka. Sanbe (sickest transformation just meh personality), Alien, & the gang leader were alright too.--Animation--Honestly, very surprised this got the quality animation it got. Not to say the manga is bad or anything, but it’s certainly not popular enough to get the type of animation it has got. There are some new scenes that add some nice minor depth to the characters and story. Fights that were only a few pages in the manga get greatly expanded on especially the one in the 2nd episode. The fights themselves are well choreographed, and have a very satisfying weight to them. Like you can really feel the characters getting hit, and it’s fairly brutal at times. Miscellaneous stuff that would normally not be shown like changing clothes or walking to a destination are actually included and well animated too. I don’t have much to say about the animation, just know it’s great. Like probably way better than this series deserved.--Music--I don’t know who was in the studio making these tracks, but they are catchy as heck. The music in Gleipnir ranges from atmospheric rumblings to hardcore EDM style fight music. You get some chill, almost Vaporwave like songs, and some chilling, near horror like tracks to just add to the thrills and mystery. And uh...ok I’m not really that good at describing music. I just know I really love what I hear, and it sets the mood perfectly for the series. Just trust me on this, it’s a good freaking soundtrack.--Overall Enjoyment--I quite liked Gleipnir a lot. The manga isn’t that great I’d say, but the anime has elevated it to a level I honestly say it’s a good series imo. Literally the only thing the manga has over the anime is of course continuing the story and bare breasts. Again no masterpiece, but a solid 8/10 anime with a unique enough premise you would probably enjoy it.

While the story is interesting it's not that unique when you think about it. Basically, this is reverse Darling in the Franxx. But with more edge. And somehow with even more sexual theme of fights.Story - 7/10 - For now 'cause I don't really have to go...on here.Art - 9/10 - Surprised with the level of work put into the fights, very good. I'm also liking character design.Sound -  7/10 - Nothing stands out for me but at least overall voice acting and osts are fitting and well done.Character - 4/10 - With all the pain in my heart. Lead female is a great balance between crazy and hot, would love to see more of her, but the male lead is.... everything that's bad about this. He's the LEAST interesting part about this thing and has overall very negative influence on atmosphere and story. And I give 0 crap about his past, he's too unlikable for me to like even after a 'redemption/flashback' arc.Enjoyment - 8/10 - I want crap like this every season.Overall - 7/10 - If they don't ruin anything else besides MC it's probably gonna end up good. on here.Art - 9/10 - Surprised with the level of work put into the fights, very good.

And about the story it’s beyond the ridiculous, the main character has no background it’s empty, all he does is help the girl, that’s really the story, then there are monsters coming out of nowhere, nothing is explained and the monster designs are really ridiculous ', 'Every season there\'s always at least one anime where you can\'t help but think: damn, this anime is terrible in every way possible! What a waste of resources creating this, and what a waste of time watching this! Upon superficial viewing, Gleipnir may seem like this type of series, one where you just don\'t know what is going on in the creator\'s right mind. However, this is in fact, not the case.In reality, Gleipnir is a gripping psychological drama with a hint of a beautiful romance. The title itself should already be enough to draw you in. \'What the fuck does Gleipnir mean?\' I bet...that\'s what you\'re wondering. Don\'t worry, this is not explained at all during the first 3 episodes of the show, nor are any important plot points, as this important info shall serve as a device to evoke suspense and urge the viewers who care enough to continue with the show.The characters are also very nice, and their chemistry is the most organic. We have the blonde main bitch who is always trying to get ""inside"" the male protagonist. Yes you read that right, get ""inside."" Apparently the male MC is able to turn into this large stuffed animal which the female can enter, character design of utmost peculiarity. She doesn\'t beat around the bush at all with this guy, and starts going at it from like the 2nd ep, making remarks afterwards like: ""I pissed myself while inside you, just joking"" (haha) or ""my body is being moved, gross"" to which the male responds with ""it\'s gross for me too."" Like ffs just get married alreadyThe characters are deep and well-developed. Their personal dilemmas are almost immediately presented in the first few eps, with the blonde being suicidal and found some new goal in life by toying with this stuffed toy guy, who is also lost in life and unsure of what college to attend etc etc. The girl becomes completely infatuted with controlling this guy\'s inner beast, but there already existed a short redhead already in love with this guy, forming a dramatic love triangle. How could it be better? A THIRD girl comes in who is in fact the first girl\'s big sister, who is also somehow in love with the male protagonist. (it\'s confusing ik but it all makes sense when u watch it!)The pacing is painful to experience, not because it\'s bad, but because the show has got me so emotionally invested. We go from one scene where the female is taking her time getting inside him to another fight scene with insane fight choreography and animation. One second I\'m crying and squirming to the cute romance and the next I\'m in awe at the production quality and direction! I can\'t keep up with this dynamic show. Not gonna lie the fighting is actually epic as hell, but I just can\'t tell what the show is trying to become.Gleipnir may seem like the type of show that is complete trash, but think twice. The meant-to-be-emotional scenes have plenty of irony/satire value to appreciate, and the fighting scenes are just awesome. Some shows exist just to be enjoyed/made fun of and not to be taken seriously. I suggest giving this a watch if you are having a bad day and want to laugh and cry with these MCs. that\'s what you\'re wondering.

Not for kids. Not for Shounen fanatics. For starters, let\'s get something clear. This is a series not for the...faint of heart, be it for being an ecchi series and for the several adult themes touch within the show itself.Therefore if you are expecting a lighthearted series, then this could not be what you were looking for.Then again, if you are more refined and have a broader and wider scope of what you tend to watch, as in you don\'t limit yourself to a specific genre, by all means don\'t let me stop you.So let\'s address the main concerns first:Art & Animation: Very appealing 8/10. Very fluent 9/10. Color palette and light usage creates a more grim atmosphere that raises the tension and suspense.Sound: OP is catchy and good 8/10, but aside to that nothing that memorable. Sound is not really the most important anyway.Enjoyment: Subjective. It all comes down to what I pointed out to you before.Story: ¿? By the knowledge of the source material. Yes. It\'s a very well written and constructed universe.Character: This is by far the most ambiguous. Some people say that the MC is a crybaby. They are not wrong though. The other question is, does it get development. Yes. A lot.Now let\'s go with personal biased opinion:A Youtuber said this series is Trash...Why?Let\'s define ""Trash"": Garbage. Something Worth little or nothing.Therefore, for all purposes, in Anime media, being called Trashy show it would mean things along these lines, not worth mentioning or watching and a big waste of your time.I believe that is a severe critique, albeit everyone is entitled to their opinion, I do not think is fair to say a series is either good or bad based of first impressions, due to the fact it lacks the knowledge and the full picture of what has been evaluated.On top of the fact that people tend to make off comparisons.So let\'s clear some common mistakes:No. It\'s not a Battle Royale per se.This is properly explained in the story.So if people tell you that, please compare it to the most obvious example, the Fate Franchise.The most recognizable Battle Royale series ever.As you can see, way different concept.The other wrong comparison, Clair/Kurea is an offbrand cheap imitation of Gasai Yuno.No. Just, no.First of all. Mirai Niki\'s Gasai Yuno IS a 100% Yandere. Second Yuno & Yukiteru are the exact representation of the Lima & Stockholm Syndrome. Hence way different characters.I am being as vague as possible because I am trying to avoid spoilers regarding the characters themselves.But just to point out a fundamental trait it would allow you to see how different they really are.Then we say that this series is Trash for the use of Fan Service.This is a Seinen series. Young adult is the target audience.If Fan Service is a resource and not the main plot point.If it\'s seldom shown and is not the main focus and it\'s whole purpose is adding a little bit of taste to the scene is not bad.Also, the rating for this should is R - Mild Nudity.Fan Service is kind of expected.If you don\'t like it, if you think that is not really for you, don\'t watch it because you will not enjoy it.This is also a Thriller & Psychological.Those along should give a major idea of what the story is really about.And the dumbest reason why people say this show is off putting:Clair is a bad character because she has freckles.The irony is that you also hear that Karen from Tower of God is so cute because of the exact same reason.Yes, really. That is a thing.No. Just, no.A woman with freckles looks pretty and cute.Women with freckles and big breasted should rule the world.So if you are a woman with that trait, or you are a guy who is attracted to this trait, A+ to you.So with all the odd reasons out of the way...Why should you watch Gleipnir?Meet our 3 protagonist Shuichi, Clair and her older sister Elena.Yes, Elena is also the protagonist of the series.Shuichi is our ""Not so protagonist of the story"" MC.At first glance, he seems to be wimpy, scary, skinny, glasses-kun, run of the mill kind of guy that you find almost in every other show.So why is he special? Why should he become special?Well that is to be seen and is the main point of the story so if I just flat out tell the reason then where is the fun in that.Clair on the other hand, is everything that Shuichi is not.Clair has massive... Confidence. Feisty. Strong minded. Badmouthed. Relentless. Hence, she is hot AF.One provides what the other one lacks and viceversa.Their dynamic is full of double meaning conversations and almost all the time is Clair imposing on Shuichi.Oddly enough, it fits.It sets the tone of the series. They don\'t have a normal relationship.The norm should be Senpai-Kohai, since Clair is younger than Shuichi.Maybe lovers?Neither one of those criterias fit them. At least, nothing so shallow.They are comrades, sharing a common goal.Therefore using each other instead of helping each other would be more accurate.What about Elena?The main female protagonist role is more for her than Clair\'s.Not even the source material has clarify her story completely though.Describing Elena as a character, her connection to Shuichi and her motives cannot be done unless spoilers are given.Although her meek, mellow and bashful persona in front of the MC should have given you enough hints.Suffice to say, that she is the most complex character in the series.What is Gleipnir about and why should I care to watch it?Have you ever had a dream?Have you ever thought that you wanted to change something about yourself or about the people around you?The one beneath the facade that you wear, is that the real you?Is that who you wanted to be? To become the shield of those you wanted to protect, or to become the puppet for others to be used for because you lack the courage to do it yourself?Will you become happy and satisfied after your dream has been granted?This is an emotional and psychological mindbreak & turmoil.In order to stop all the events that are currently affecting all the people around the MC, he will have to become the exact opposite of what he stands for.Will he be able to retain his humanity in the process? Will he remain the good guy or will he become shrouded in the darkness?Clair\'s despair and Shuichi\'s acceptance of madness. To fight the evil around him and within him. To obtain the redemption and absolution of his past mistakes and sins.That is basically the foundation of the hero and the main point of the story... faint of heart, be it for being an ecchi series and for the several adult themes touch within the show itself.Therefore if you are expecting a lighthearted series, then this could not be what you were looking for.Then again, if you are more refined and have a broader and wider scope of what you tend to watch, as in you don\'t limit yourself to a specific genre, by all means don\'t let me stop you.So let\'s address the main concerns first:Art & Animation: Very appealing 8/10.

Young adult is the target audience.If Fan Service is a resource and not the main plot point.If it\'s seldom shown and is not the main focus and it\'s whole purpose is adding a little bit of taste to the scene is not bad.Also, the rating for this should is R - Mild Nudity.Fan Service is kind of expected.If you don\'t like it, if you think that is not really for you, don\'t watch it because you will not enjoy it.This is also a Thriller & Psychological.Those along should give a major idea of what the story is really about.And the dumbest reason why people say this show is off putting:Clair is a bad character because she has freckles.The irony is that you also hear that Karen from Tower of God is so cute because of the exact same reason.Yes, really. That is a thing.No. Just, no.A woman with freckles looks pretty and cute.Women with freckles and big breasted should rule the world.So if you are a woman with that trait, or you are a guy who is attracted to this trait, A+ to you.So with all the odd reasons out of the way...Why should you watch Gleipnir?Meet our 3 protagonist Shuichi, Clair and her older sister Elena.Yes, Elena is also the protagonist of the series.Shuichi is our ""Not so protagonist of the story"" MC.At first glance, he seems to be wimpy, scary, skinny, glasses-kun, run of the mill kind of guy that you find almost in every other show.So why is he special? Why should he become special?Well that is to be seen and is the main point of the story so if I just flat out tell the reason then where is the fun in that.Clair on the other hand, is everything that Shuichi is not.Clair has massive... Confidence. Feisty. Strong minded. Badmouthed. Relentless. Hence, she is hot AF.One provides what the other one lacks and viceversa.Their dynamic is full of double meaning conversations and almost all the time is Clair imposing on Shuichi.Oddly enough, it fits.It sets the tone of the series. They don\'t have a normal relationship.The norm should be Senpai-Kohai, since Clair is younger than Shuichi.Maybe lovers?Neither one of those criterias fit them. At least, nothing so shallow.They are comrades, sharing a common goal.Therefore using each other instead of helping each other would be more accurate.What about Elena?The main female protagonist role is more for her than Clair\'s.Not even the source material has clarify her story completely though.Describing Elena as a character, her connection to Shuichi and her motives cannot be done unless spoilers are given.Although her meek, mellow and bashful persona in front of the MC should have given you enough hints.Suffice to say, that she is the most complex character in the series.What is Gleipnir about and why should I care to watch it?Have you ever had a dream?Have you ever thought that you wanted to change something about yourself or about the people around you?The one beneath the facade that you wear, is that the real you?Is that who you wanted to be? To become the shield of those you wanted to protect, or to become the puppet for others to be used for because you lack the courage to do it yourself?Will you become happy and satisfied after your dream has been granted?This is an emotional and psychological mindbreak & turmoil.In order to stop all the events that are currently affecting all the people around the MC, he will have to become the exact opposite of what he stands for.Will he be able to retain his humanity in the process? Will he remain the good guy or will he become shrouded in the darkness?Clair\'s despair and Shuichi\'s acceptance of madness. To fight the evil around him and within him. To obtain the redemption and absolution of his past mistakes and sins.That is basically the foundation of the hero and the main point of the story...', 'Action, ecchi, mystery, sci-fi, battle royales. If any of the following interest you, you’ll like Gleipnir. It was easily one of my favourite shows from Spring 2020 and was a fun time throughout.For me, the ideal anime is one that blends a lot of lewd fan service with a good story and characters. Gleipnir managed to do that very well. I understand fan service and edgy story set ups are not for everyone, and if you are opposed to that, you will probably not enjoy this.From the very first episode, the series managed to hook me with its interesting premise and mystery. Every...week I was on the edge of my seat waiting for a new episode to drop and find out more of what was going on with the story. I’ve not seen any other battle royal anime besides this and Darwin’s Game, so the concept is fresh to me and very enjoyable.I really don’t have too many criticisms of the show as I’m pretty easy to please. Some might argue that the MC is a bit bland or that the show is overly edgy, those things don’t bother me much. I watch and rate purely on enjoyment and I had a blast with this one. The story feels unique and hooks you pretty early on.Action sequences are well animated with nice character designs and art. OST is well done and added to a lot of the scenes.If I had to change anything about this show, I would make it longer. The pacing is fine, but it just really felt like an extra few episodes could have fleshed the story out better. This, like most anime, was mainly a set up to get people into reading the manga. It certainly worked on me. I’ll be sticking with this series for a while to come.Gleipnir gets 8 coins out of 10 from me. week I was on the edge of my seat waiting for a new episode to drop and find out more of what was going on with the story.

I feel though others are bandwagons for things that they haven’t even seen. When I went to look at the ratings before watching(like on YouTube and MAL), the ratings really did draw me off from watching. I saw people describe this anime before even the 4th episode even came out Making it seem TOTAllY different from what is it. I highly request for people to give this a try. Even “i” had my doubts and it is saddening to me that people give this a bad score because they base it off others...or they are uncomfortable with the provocative scenes when this anime has a lot more to offer.I really do feel the most popular review on this cite does Do a HUGE disservice. This anime has character, action, and a great concept. Pacing is great as well, not at any moment was I bored or drawn of from the story. I truly believe that most of the bad reviews are from the “Karen’s” of anime, And that this anime doesn’t deserve that kind of energy as it discourages others from watching(including myself). If it weren’t for the genuine reviews that convinced me to watch I would have never discovered this hidden gem. I believe this anime is a Contender as top spring anime right beside tower of good. After watching the anime and seeing the reviews I had to make an account and voice my opinions. or they are uncomfortable with the provocative scenes when this anime has a lot more to offer.I really do feel the most popular review on this cite does Do a HUGE disservice.

The creators just wanted this sadistic girl last for more than an episode and that\'s the only reason the MC hasn\'t eaten her which would\'ve solved all the problem. Absolutely atrocious series judging by only the first episode. Why couldn\'t they just talk it through? Why does it have to be a totally wimpy MC? If you want some series with decently developed characters, with interesting story where events happen because it\'s necessary, and not because creators thought it would be cool to add - that is not for you.Now, on to the...second episodeYep. Confirmed. This is a Mirai Nikki rip-off. A wimpy schoolboy as the MC and a strong-willed partner that helps him save his life.Third episode.All of a sudden he\'s not as whimpy as before. I\'d say the studio missed the WHOLE 24-episode series explaining this transformation. The anime is getting worse and worse.Fourth episode.The background of the story has finally been claryfied. I can\'t believe the studio hasn\'t started the series with this one, or at least with some fusion of the four released episodes. The MC keeps on changing at light speed - the only downside. But overall the episode is suprisingly good. If the creators continue the production without the chaos of the previous episodes, it would be nice. second episodeYep. Confirmed.

I know Fire Force isn’t the first of its kind to do something like this but unlike some other shows, it's most frustrating when the concept of the show is really interesting. However, unlike Fire Force, everything else about this show also falls flat.Tl;dr Gleipnir started out pretty promising but slowly as time went on went from “decent” to nonsensical in about 6 episodes then stayed at that level for the rest...of the journey. It MIGHT might be considered a “show that really isn’t for everyone” but I really can’t imagine a single thing that this show does that isn’t mediocre at BEST. I’d recommend you stay away from this anime.Story: 3I have no idea how they turned a story of a dude transforming into a mascot with superpowers boring… but they did.Gleipnir’s story started out SUPER interesting but eventually as it slogs on you start to realize how barebone it truly is which is a trend that we see throughout the whole experience. You start to feel invested just to get dragged out of the story due to really weird coincidences, strange plot developments, or characters acting nonsensically. Characters being the biggest drawback in the anime, tearing down the story instead of lifting it up (save for one or two notable examples).Art: 5Probably the only “mediocre” thing about this whole showThe first three episodes were where the show was at its greatest in terms of art with smooth animation, only problem was the relatively generic character design, but a character doesn’t have to be the most unique for the show to be good. Slowly but surely, however, the animation quality started going down as the action sequences became more scarce and shorter until you’re left with almost nothing.Sound: 5ngl the opening was kind of a banger…This is probably the last compliment I can give to this show and even this is a stretch, the rest of the OST is extremely forgettable and repetitive.Character: 3Usually, a story is held together and carried by its character which is unfortunate because almost every character in this show is completely one dimensional and is either forgotten or killed before they ever get any plot development of any kind. Almost everyone is boring and flat and it feels like the entire cast is made up entirely of background characters.Enjoyment 1Nothing about this show is satisfactory, conflicts end in really bizarre ways, characters that seem like they should be important die in three seconds, the story either progresses at a snail's pace or dashes by so fast you can’t even comprehend what just happened.

Allow me to explain.The basis of the plot is pretty interesting, involving an alien ship that crashed on earth. This particular alien race doesn\'t have a material body, so they have their minds stored inside coins. One of the aliens offers humans cool anime powers in exchange for finding his friends, who are scattered around the general area of the crash site. The powers each person gets are based on their innermost desires/fears/complexes, whatever. You get the idea. Yeah, it\'s not air-tight, but it\'s pretty interesting. On...the technical side, the animation is good and the action scenes are very well done.And then it royally fucks itself over. The plot revolves around a boy and a girl who are caught up in this mess, but it goes nowhere and only serves as an excuse to have people fight each other with very badly done build up. It does tease a deeper mystery involving the main character, because a yandere chick wiped his memories. This is, yet again, nothing more than an excuse to withhold seemingly important information from us, but anyone with half a brain can guess what it is, and it\'s not that good anyway.My biggest issue by far are the god-awful characters, with the main duo as the most serious offenders. Shuichi (our main boi) is your typical wimpy, depressed, pussy-ass anime protagonist who can\'t do jack shit unless Claire (the main girl) is there to hold his hand. He\'s indecisive, allows the plot to jerk him around, and makes for an overall annoying protagonist because even when he does do something, it\'s either his powers going haywire or plot armour that force him to take action. He then promptly reverts back to his timid ways, negating whatever growth or proactive nature he previously showed. Claire is even worse. She\'s a gorgeous goddess with a rocking bod who is Light Yagami levels of clever, only the creator of Gleipnir isn\'t, so you can smell the plot armour bullshit whenever you think about her actions for more than two seconds. She always rises to whatever occasion and hijacks every scene she\'s in, because she\'s that awesome. By the way, she\'s 15 and always way less experienced than her opponent in whatever situation they are in, so her comfortably pulling a win out of her ass every time is very frustrating to watch. Everyone else is pretty much one dimensional and acts only in manners that serve to either further the plot or make Claire look good, often without rhyme or reason.After seeing the personalities and interactions of the main duo I can only assume that the author, who is still around 14 years old mentally, basically wrote Shuichi to be a reflection of himself, and Claire to be the perfect girlfriend he always wishes he had. I get the fantasy, but it\'s a really boring experience for anyone who isn\'t in the centre of said fantasy, or is older than 15. Also, I want to talk about Shuichi\'s powers, which involve him transforming into a dog-mascot suit thing with a gun, and allowing someone to wear him. Whoever does so controls his actions, but it\'s mostly Claire. The entire thing is very sexual, with the insides of the suit looking, feeling, and sounding like the innards of someone\'s body, and Shuichi garnering pleasure from the process, both physically and mentally. This screams ""fetish"", and I suppose that it would get off whoever has similar thoughts/needs, but I was unable to take it as seriously as the show wanted me to, if at all.So, yeah. I didn\'t like it. the technical side, the animation is good and the action scenes are very well done.And then it royally fucks itself over.

I didn\'t like it.', 'This shit was garbage alright, but I thought it was going to be the type of garbage that I would enjoy like of which the Highschool of the Dead. Don’t get me wrong, the first half of this show was enjoyable. It had an interesting premise, fights, ecchi fanservice, etc. The second half of this show was where it fell apart for me.What initially was going to be about an adventure between a boy named Shuuichi and a yandere girl named Clair to find out the reasons behind her sister’s murdering of her parents, to the boring stale talking about nonsense with maybe a...few actions here and there.The show started it off strong. We were introduced to the main male protagonist Shuuichi who was bestowed with an ability to turn into a monster that resembles a teddy bear. This ability gives him an abnormal amount of strength, power, and agility. However, he doesn’t know how to use this power to his advantage -- at least effectively. This is where Clair, the main female protagonist, comes in. You see, she’s the yandere of this show, but not too extreme like the which of Yuno Gaisai. And she has a motivation that is at least understandable, unlike Yuno. Just like any Yandere, she is badass, cool, sexy, and can knock you out in one punch. She’s also merciless. If you rubbed her in the wrong way, you might as well be dead. What’s her involvement with Shuuichi? Well, she pilots Shuuichi’s monster.Clair can pilot Shuuich’s monster form by going inside the body of the monster. That’s right, when Shuuichi is in his monster form, people can get inside it. However, just like any living beings, the monster’s inside is always hot and humid like a sultry day. Thus, you will always see her wearing bikinis or swimsuits because you know, for fanservice. And yes, there will be plenty of ass shots.The premise of this show sounds all fine and dandy until the show introduced aliens. That’s right, ALIENS. Instead of focusing on finding the truth behind Clair’s sister, we have to follow our two main protagonists’ journeys finding these alien coins, basically the MacGuffins of this show. These alien coins are needed to be collected and delivered to the guy -- who’s an alien -- at some random vending machine somewhere in Japan. The thing is, what happens after they delivered the coins? Will the alien tell Clair about the truth of her sister? Or will the alien use the coins to summon an alien invasion? We don’t know. The show just introduces some of these random asspulls to explain these powers for the sake of explanation. What’s next? A full-blown war with other aliens? Fuck this show.After the reveal of aliens, the pacing of this show slumped. It went from pure action to stale talking after Clair and Shuuichi joined a useless clan of people who can turn into all sorts of things. They have a common goal: collect as many alien coins as possible. Along the way, they fight other clans for domination. However, in all of these fights, Clair and Shuuichi were the only effective ones, the rest of Clair and Shuuichi’s clan were just useless.This show’s production quality is surprisingly outstanding. Especially with the smoothness of the action scenes. Outside of that, the attention to background details, character designs, and lighting was mediocre.This show isn’t worth watching because for the majority of the time there aren’t many things going on. The dialogues are plain and servers pretty much no purpose. Unless you’re in for full ecchi, it’s not an enjoyable show. few actions here and there.The show started it off strong.

Unless you’re in for full ecchi, it’s not an enjoyable show.', 'Imagine being a kid and one day you wake up to huge paws, an enhanced sense of smell, and a sudden hunger for freckled, crazy, blonde panties. For most people we call that puberty, for Shuichi it is literally a nightmare as he finds himself blackmailed and joined at the hip to a crazy freckled blonde named Claire who quickly entagles him and a brutal and violent death game.Gleipnir\'s setup and its first initial episodes have the subtlety of a brick. From the get go you know what this is about. Shuichi turns into a big giant fursuit, and when Claire steps inside of him,...his eyes widen and with a shocked expression says "" she is inside me""... It\'s about sex. Or more specifically its about puberty and an adoloscent burgeoning for, well sex. The characters and furthermore the characterzation in this show isn\'t why you are watching this show, and the mangaka Sun Takeda knows this. The characters here are derivative. The dynamic of a meek, but good natured male protagonist with a fiery, more ambitious women has been done to death. What sets Gleipnir apart from being another generic show. Well three things. It\'s edginess, its imagery, and its utterly dry deadpan sense of humor.If a guy monstrously transforming into a fursuit with a girl climbing into his back to control him doesn\'t scream ""this show is edgy!"" the there are a million other things that will. The fanservice and the action are almost all in this anime to sell the shows edginess. Pretty much every episode(not exagerrating) has to have an obligatory panty shot/crotch shot. The action is even better. I was sold on this show, after two characters got done punching and kicking the living daylights out of each other, the fightscene was tailended by a smith & wesson, oversived revolver stuck in someone\'s back, while the trigger is slowly squeezed, brutal execution incoming.If i have you excited. Let me quickly quell that excitement. This show isn\'t really edgy. I mean it tries to be, but this show doesn\'t really have the fictional fursuit balls and gutso to truly be dark. All of that stuff is really window dressing to entice the viewer to tell an otherwise more conventional battle-royale, death game story. This show throws curveballs at you, sure! My favorite being when Shuichi and Claire finally run into somebody who is clearly stronger then them. They ask him for his motivation is, and he with a straight face pretty much admits to being an masochist and just looking for somebody who has the strength to kill him. I say that to not only highlight the shows deadpan dry humor but to also highlight the fact that character motivations are a huge backbone of this show. Except Shuichi. The protagonist, Shuichi, is pretty much blackmailed into this whole thing. Shuichi spends the better part of four episodes sniveling, and crying that Claire is manipulating him. Which she is.The character dynamic of this show of a clearly emotionally disturbed girl manipulating a meek, booksmart nerd have people comparing this show to one of my favorites Aku No Hana. Although the initial plot construction of this show is very interesting it grinds to a fast halt because Shuichi has the personality of a wet blanket and outside of his whole ""I just want to fit in schtick"" he doesnt really get anymore character development for a large swath of the shows runtime. Another thing about Shuichi\'s unconfident, dark moody nerd character troupe is that this show doesn\'t really put it to use at all. Aku No Hana, NGE, shows that both have these character archetypes, both delve into the psychological reasons.Something that I look for in shows that isn\'t really discussed a lot is continuity. Continuity in characters and themes is very important for shows to feel like they have some sort of intentionality behind it and not just a mishmash at various unrelated ideas. Gleipnir suffers hugely from this problem because in a scene to scene sense the show can be very entertaining and even funny at times. The big problem I had with the show is that it fails to combine the things that make it entertaining in any meaningful way. It wants to be this heavy, middle-finger to the world story, but the show doesn\'t really have anything to offer for it. Perfect example is these monstrous transformations are supposed to be external displays of these characters inner personas. Which is why it is very fitting that Shuichi\'s transformation is a harmless hollow teddy bear that needs somebody to crawl inside for it to gain its full power. However, it doesn\'t help that a lot of the characters transformation besides shuichi\'s or his side characters don\'t have any thought put into them at all, and are usually just grotesque ugly big tooth monsters/insects and sometimes just amorphous shadow blobs. Another example, is that the audience is aware that these characters are in a death game anime. Death is literally in the genre name, and these characters always seem suprised or are caught unaware when they are subject or are subjected to brutal violence. Its bizzare. Like me or you, if caught in this situation would constantly have our head on the swivel if we realized that other literal ghouls and goblins are out for our head, yet Shuichi and his gang are constantly caught off guard, pretty much every time. There is no continuity to these characters actions or words which makes everything else in the story seem loose and unfocused.Gleipnir had its moments. Even the overt sexiness never ceased to amaze me. I mean this show is downright revolutionary with the way it sneaks in its fanservice. The scene where Claire grabs her crotch while saying ""did she go inside you"" is legendary. I just wish everything else in the show felt that fresh and inspired. his eyes widen and with a shocked expression says "" she is inside me""... It\'s about sex. Or more specifically its about puberty and an adoloscent burgeoning for, well sex. The characters and furthermore the characterzation in this show isn\'t why you are watching this show, and the mangaka Sun Takeda knows this. The characters here are derivative. The dynamic of a meek, but good natured male protagonist with a fiery, more ambitious women has been done to death. What sets Gleipnir apart from being another generic show. Well three things. It\'s edginess, its imagery, and its utterly dry deadpan sense of humor.If a guy monstrously transforming into a fursuit with a girl climbing into his back to control him doesn\'t scream ""this show is edgy!"" the there are a million other things that will. The fanservice and the action are almost all in this anime to sell the shows edginess. Pretty much every episode(not exagerrating) has to have an obligatory panty shot/crotch shot. The action is even better. I was sold on this show, after two characters got done punching and kicking the living daylights out of each other, the fightscene was tailended by a smith & wesson, oversived revolver stuck in someone\'s back, while the trigger is slowly squeezed, brutal execution incoming.If i have you excited. Let me quickly quell that excitement. This show isn\'t really edgy. I mean it tries to be, but this show doesn\'t really have the fictional fursuit balls and gutso to truly be dark. All of that stuff is really window dressing to entice the viewer to tell an otherwise more conventional battle-royale, death game story. This show throws curveballs at you, sure! My favorite being when Shuichi and Claire finally run into somebody who is clearly stronger then them. They ask him for his motivation is, and he with a straight face pretty much admits to being an masochist and just looking for somebody who has the strength to kill him. I say that to not only highlight the shows deadpan dry humor but to also highlight the fact that character motivations are a huge backbone of this show. Except Shuichi. The protagonist, Shuichi, is pretty much blackmailed into this whole thing. Shuichi spends the better part of four episodes sniveling, and crying that Claire is manipulating him. Which she is.The character dynamic of this show of a clearly emotionally disturbed girl manipulating a meek, booksmart nerd have people comparing this show to one of my favorites Aku No Hana. Although the initial plot construction of this show is very interesting it grinds to a fast halt because Shuichi has the personality of a wet blanket and outside of his whole ""I just want to fit in schtick"" he doesnt really get anymore character development for a large swath of the shows runtime. Another thing about Shuichi\'s unconfident, dark moody nerd character troupe is that this show doesn\'t really put it to use at all. Aku No Hana, NGE, shows that both have these character archetypes, both delve into the psychological reasons.Something that I look for in shows that isn\'t really discussed a lot is continuity. Continuity in characters and themes is very important for shows to feel like they have some sort of intentionality behind it and not just a mishmash at various unrelated ideas. Gleipnir suffers hugely from this problem because in a scene to scene sense the show can be very entertaining and even funny at times. The big problem I had with the show is that it fails to combine the things that make it entertaining in any meaningful way. It wants to be this heavy, middle-finger to the world story, but the show doesn\'t really have anything to offer for it. Perfect example is these monstrous transformations are supposed to be external displays of these characters inner personas. Which is why it is very fitting that Shuichi\'s transformation is a harmless hollow teddy bear that needs somebody to crawl inside for it to gain its full power. However, it doesn\'t help that a lot of the characters transformation besides shuichi\'s or his side characters don\'t have any thought put into them at all, and are usually just grotesque ugly big tooth monsters/insects and sometimes just amorphous shadow blobs. Another example, is that the audience is aware that these characters are in a death game anime. Death is literally in the genre name, and these characters always seem suprised or are caught unaware when they are subject or are subjected to brutal violence. Its bizzare. Like me or you, if caught in this situation would constantly have our head on the swivel if we realized that other literal ghouls and goblins are out for our head, yet Shuichi and his gang are constantly caught off guard, pretty much every time. There is no continuity to these characters actions or words which makes everything else in the story seem loose and unfocused.Gleipnir had its moments. Even the overt sexiness never ceased to amaze me. I mean this show is downright revolutionary with the way it sneaks in its fanservice. The scene where Claire grabs her crotch while saying ""did she go inside you"" is legendary. I just wish everything else in the show felt that fresh and inspired.', 'I\'m willing to bet that most of the people that picked this show up, did it because of either the amazingly-animated fight or because of the tasteless fanservice that accomodates most of Clair\'s screentime. For me it was both, and while the bad rating had me on guard, I honestly did not expect it to be this bad. If I had to find one phrase to describe this it would be ""A waste of good production"". That fight was the only thing this show had going for it and that\'s exactly why it makes me so sad...Story/Characters:Awful. Horrible. Disgusting. I can\'t even find the courage...to describe this abomination to which I am subjected every week. It honestly pisses me off to think that someone got paid for writing this and yet... Our main character is your run-of-the mill loser that has the power to transform into a big teddy dog thing, along with a great smell ability, in a sense making him closer to a non-teddy dog thing. Most of his character so far revolves around his perpetual mental breakdown over ""losing his humanity"" even though he can freely transform back to his normal self as he wishes. The other main character is a sadistic bitch that\'s seemingly written as to be as hated by the viewers as much as possible and then the writer tries to make us sympathize with her or whatever. Long story short, the plot is all over the place, the characters are soulless and the epitome of bad writing, their interactions shallow and cringeworthy and generally this whole thing is akin more to a crappy fanfic than a professional manga that deserves an anime adaptation.Art/Animation:This is the part that\'s the saddest about this show. The animation is good. The character designs are well-done, backgrounds are good albeit nothing too special, but the fight choreography and animation clarity is so good, it wouldn\'t be a stretch to say it\'s the best out of all this season\'s shows. Pine Jam is a literally who studio that has made only a handful more, borderline relevant shows, none of which had been action shows (they were actually pretty average), so I really must wonder what they would put had they worked with proper good source material. Well I guess their work does put a positive dent into this atrocity.Enjoyment:I\'m not someone that desperately seeks for ""deep"" shows with intricate plots and complex characters. Sure I definitely appreciate those but I believe myself to be just as capable of putting my brain to sleep and enjoying a chill feel-good show or a show with good action. However even as I try to do just that with Gleipnir, my brain is rudely awakened every few moments to scream ""What ?!"" or ""Why ?!"". This show is not something uninteresting, it\'s something bad. It gets unbelievably cringy at times and briefly siphons away the smidgen of enjoyment that it managed to build up.I get sad even thinking what kind of good manga was sentenced to not receive an anime adaptation just so that this obscenity could. to describe this abomination to which I am subjected every week.

There are some pitfalls that other people watching this show have put themselves into though that can taint there experience of the show. One don\'t...try to put yourself in the protagonist shoes and live in this world through him, there are shows out there for those who like doing that with super cool and awesome protagonist but Shuichi and Kurea are just real people in this world that you can relate and empathize with, but they are first and foremost there own people. They have there own personalities that you get to know and love throughout the series. Dos don\'t come expecting a traditional story either, this is no hero beat the big bad villain isekai, this is just everyone trying to accomplish there own goals with the action only happening because of people helping or hindering each others goals, its a psychological thriller not some shounen arc of the number 1 hero bro.

I thought the premise of turning into a monster was pretty rad until I saw all the screenshots and clips of him being a goddamn furry suit and being controlled by some psycho yandere. I don\'t recommend it. It may sound cool, but it\'s just weird and uncomfortable and terribly confusing.My roommate and I decided to watch this for shits and giggles. It\'s HORRID. There is all kinds of sexual harassment within the first episode alone! Fem MC is so hypersexualized for being around 15/16 years old and male MC is bland and weak-willed despite having his...weird powers. The relationship between the two is nothing but blackmail and emotional manipulation.There are a lot of plot holes???

How did Elena get a second coin and why did she give it to Clair after MURDERING THEIR PARENTS?! If Elena turned into a monster while wearing her school uniform, how did Clair even get a hold of it?And the track n\' field girl? What was the point of her murder other than to provide a plot point for Clair to hop inside Shuichi\'s furry suit? She was literally one of the only leads to figuring out where the monsters and coins came from and they MURDERED her, then pretended like it didn\'t happen.I like gore and violence in anime but this is just a poor excuse for it. Half of the situations are pointless and a waste of time. And that one classmate of Shuichi\'s, Nana? What the fuck is up her? Is she just a ""love rival"", despite having no true interaction or connection with Shuichi?I will give credit where it\'s due; the animation for the battle scenes is beautifully simplistic and flows nicely. The soundtrack for the show is not terrible - like something that fits the scenes but not something you\'d go out of your way to listen to, ya know?The concept of the monster wishes is wonderful and makes sense. As my roommate explained to me, their monster forms reflect the users wishes. The track n\' field girl wanted to be stronger, so her monster form allows her to be faster, stronger, just like she wanted. And Elena? She used her wish for Shuichi which is why he became a mascot, something to be controlled, and she became a shadow; essentially ""nothing"" as a result.I\'m gonna keep watching just so I can keep shitting on this piss-poor excuse of a psychological horror/drama. weird powers.

This is a great anime worth watching if ur a fan of action or a fan of anything anime. It’s quality hasn’t gone down since the first episode and the pace of the anime isn’t slow what so ever. I feel this anime deserves at-leasts a 7.8 because it’s concepts from story and production on how it is executed is outstanding. I feel reviews on YouTube and others Cites explain the anime wrongly on what type of anime it is. It is a action pact anime. Although the music isn’t outstanding it does not draw away from the...anime. The characters that are introduced have their own personalities that can’t be mistaken for one another as well as character design. (I accidentally put I watched 11 but actually ten got it confused with the amount of episodes I watched for tower of god) anime. The characters that are introduced have their own personalities that can’t be mistaken for one another as well as character design. (I accidentally put I watched 11 but actually ten got it confused with the amount of episodes I watched for tower of god)', ""I'll describe this anime like the underwear it uses, it starts with nice laced ones and ends with a bland blue swimsuit.This anime starts well but after ep3 it goes downwards, even the art and sound deteriorate.The middle episodes can easily be erased without losing much of the story. A part of the ending episodes is even about erasing ties with the middle ones.Characters are incomplete as details get lost and you just have to believe they have reasons for their actions. The more you think about it the more questions you get.Ah for an anime about collecting coins, not a lot...of coins got collected. of coins got collected."", 'Update: Aight so I wrote this after ep3 came out, but now that ep 4 is out I\'m entirely convinced this show is completely self aware of it\'s own tropes and is even trying to take advantage of it. Not by deconstructing what\'s bad or funny about them, but by actually justifying them. The tropes were just a hook so at first they may have seemed shallow, but the more episodes come out the more the tropes pay off in very clever and most of the time realistic ways for the characters. This includes the fanservice. I think the current low rating is probably gonna...go up by a lot by the time the show is over.This review is gonna be a little longer than I\'d typically write because I\'m also going to be countering some points already made by other reviews. Because of this there are some spoilers of the first couple episodes, but I don\'t think they\'re enough to take away from the experience. Tbh, this show is one of the most objectively high quality of this season, and I\'d hate to see it get a lower rating than it deserves just because people like to think edgy=bad. This the wrong timeline if Darwin\'s game has the same rating or higher.StoryFor the sake of simplicity I\'ll separate story and characters by the who vs what\'s happening. The story, or the what, is a seinen death game setup. Death games have been done time and time again, so what makes Gleipnir different? Nothing except for the fact that it doesn\'t want to waste your time explaining what\'s obvious. For instance, the rules the gantz ball explains, the know-it-all yandare in Mirai Nikki and Darwin\'s Game that won\'t shut up, or the crazed billionaire/game-dev and his powerpoint presentation on a cargo plane in Kablooey!!!! Those shows are interesting, sure, but don\'t you ever get a little tired of characters explaining what literally just happened, or what was obvious from the first scene? In Gleipnir, we see the main character actively trying to hide his ability to shapeshift into a murderous furry suit from his high school friends. We also see him fight another shapeshifting monster (with the same weird plus symbol on her eye) as she tries to steal a coin from him. Both of these happen in the first episode, and the most anybody does to explain it in words is a hot blonde guy that spawns out of a weird vending machine (the character turns around and the camera looks away the moment he does this) asking you to find more star coins in exchange for some ""power"". That\'s it, and that\'s all it needs to be at the start to stay interesting. If I started questioning my life choices because a dude that came out of a vending machine and told me to find some more coins, I wouldn\'t be deep, I\'d be schizophrenic. Wouldn\'t you be way more interested in how he came out of a vending machine, or how to stop magically turning into a creepy furry suit? I would be. And I get to be because that\'s what the show focuses on. Tell the story through the character\'s emotions, show the story through the character\'s actions. Not every anime\'s story has to follow that exact philosophy like a rule, but it\'s ideal for a death game not to get too overly ambitious in world building over the characters themselves. Although technically speaking, the vending machine guy and incredibly weird and disturbing magical power he bestows on people count as a mystery of world building. A mystery that I\'m all in for watching the characters find out cause I want to know wtf that guy is about as much as they do. It\'d be boring if somebody just explained it in the first episode. If not for the smooth pacing and wacky mysteries, it would be a 5-6 at most. But this story isn\'t bad, and it isn\'t great. It\'s a good 7/10CharactersAight so first you got your vending machine blonde guy. Not sure if I can associate him with that ""unknown battle/death god that likes fucking with humanity"" trope because I legitimately have no clue wtf this guy is. Done. That\'s all you need to know for now. That\'s all the show tells you. I\'m intrigued, but the main character\'s body and the people trying to kill him are more pressing matters than the audiences curiosity (for now). Second, we got the ""weak-minded"" protagonist trope. Or so people are calling him after he saved a girl from a fire and spent half the first episode trying to live a normal life without letting a single hint of his powers slip. Is that weak-minded? Idk, I\'d call that courageous and socially intelligent. On top of worrying more about whether someone\'s watching than whether he\'s in danger going into a burning building to save a girl, he also actually succeeds in acting like he still needs glasses for months. If you have glasses, take them off. If you don\'t, put on a friend\'s. Now go about your daily life for one day without squinting, feeling headaches or acting differently in any way. He\'s a complainer, for sure. But you\'d be crazy not to feel like shit all the time. I mean cmon, man. I shouldn\'t have to explain this. Literally all of this applies to Peter Parker. This guy is just Peter Parker except with a way more humiliating and creepy power. Third, you got the yandere-chan. Except she isn\'t in love with the main character, she doesn\'t ever feel like killing people for his sake as opposed to her own desire to find out wtf is going on, and the most she\'ll ever do for the main character is die with him, not kill for him. The reason being that she was already trying to kill herself in that fire before he got in the way, so why not just end it there. Makes logical sense. Also, she seems to act pretty conflicted about her relationship with him. Makes emotional sense. Will that grow into love? Disdain? Maybe. Will she trust him with her life after saving her? Idk about that one. He barely stopped himself from pulling off her panties while she was still ""unconscious"" after he saved her. At first glance, that extra detail might be shameful fanservice/scummy, toxic masculinity in a main character, but in this case it was used as a tool to make both characters more interesting. Now we know our adolescent boy of a main character has the courage to jump into a fire to save a girl, as well as the restraint to not take advantage of her in any way after leaving her somewhere safe and calling an ambulance. Except because he\'s stressed af about his situation and is still a teen, he has difficulty doing both of these things. That makes sense, and now it also makes sense why this girl doesn\'t trust him that easily. And in the process, it also shows how little this girl cares about herself considering she pretended to be unconscious while he lifted her skirt. Tiny details, but if these details weren\'t added their relationship would be pretty damn boring. As far as characters go, those are probably the only ones to analyze. The show does a pretty good job giving their motivations, back stories and inner thoughts the right balance of screen time, but it also doesn\'t waste your time on characters if they arent as interesting as the main ones. There\'s a very clear difference in pacing between background-kuns, side characters, one off villains and the two mc. Characters aren\'t perfect, but pretty well thought-out. 8/10ArtTime for my favorite category. This show... looks fucking beautiful. Take it from a professional animator, it\'s badass. I almost feel spoiled this season since literally every show I\'ve watched so far has had really good visuals, even the isekai this season. Among those ""good visuals"" are about 3 I\'d describe with ""amazing animation"". Then there\'s Gleipnir. Yup, Gleipnir has better animation than Brand New Animal and that was directed by Yoh Yoshinari (Animation director for Neon Genesis). That\'s not to say it\'s that much of a landslide difference. In fact, most people would disagree that one is better than the other. But in situations like that, being able to stay just as expressive as a show with cartoony visuals except with more realism or detail wins in my book. The designs are clean and sharp af with an artstyle reminiscent of of the late 2000s, so on top of being really good looking it\'s also super refreshing to see that style pop up again this well animated. And by well animated I mean best of the season. The fight scenes get to the same level of quality as the good episodes of naruto shippuden, and it really doesn\'t get much higher than that in this industry unless we\'re talking ghost in the shell or cowboy bebop the movie. I try not to use one punch man as a comparison in this case since that entire show had a different goal in mind for the action, but I\'d believe Gleipnir has the same level of talent working on it as that. And while the storyboards and shot composition aren\'t in as iconic a style as the promised neverland or beastars, they can be just as cool-looking during the action and just as smooth during the acting. Easy-peasy very high key 10/10.SoundUnfortunately, the soundtrack hasn\'t stood out that much so far. That\'s not really a bad thing for a show like this. Definitely could be better, but aside from standing out it does match the tone of the scene pretty well. And while I don\'t remember too much of the soundtrack, the op is pretty cool and the ed is lit af imo. A solid 6, but mind you, I\'m writing this two episodes in tho. Ofc, I\'ll keep up with Gleipnir and edit it later if I need too, but there hasn\'t been many huge game-changing moments in the story that has a super well placed soundtrack. And there also hasn\'t been a moment where I was put off by a weird sound that doesn\'t make much sense for what\'s going on. At the moment though, this category falls a little short compared to others. 6/10Enjoyment/OverallHonestly, enjoyment is so vague I\'d almost call it pointless. Separating it from overall may be a good way to set bias aside from objectivity, but they\'re still final thoughts. So for starters, subjectively speaking I love this show and don\'t really want to talk about its flaws because what it does right is extremely well done. I\'d easily give it a 9/10 in terms of my personal gut feeling on it. I like it a lot, and I\'m gonna have a ton of fun watching it. Overall though, I can\'t ignore the soundtrack not being memorable or the opening being as skippable as it is. Therefore I give it a 7.5/10. Except that isn\'t possible so I\'m rounding it up to 8. The artstyle compliments the characters really well and although flawed, the story doesn\'t actually detract from any of this. If it was a 7, I feel like it wouldn\'t properly imply the level of production value in this show, especially considering it actually got better in the second episode. I\'m going to keep up with the episodes and change the review if need-be, but I have a good feeling this will apply to the rest of the show as well. go up by a lot by the time the show is over.This review is gonna be a little longer than I\'d typically write because I\'m also going to be countering some points already made by other reviews. Because of this there are some spoilers of the first couple episodes, but I don\'t think they\'re enough to take away from the experience.

Wouldn\'t you be way more interested in how he came out of a vending machine, or how to stop magically turning into a creepy furry suit? I would be. And I get to be because that\'s what the show focuses on. Tell the story through the character\'s emotions, show the story through the character\'s actions. Not every anime\'s story has to follow that exact philosophy like a rule, but it\'s ideal for a death game not to get too overly ambitious in world building over the characters themselves. Although technically speaking, the vending machine guy and incredibly weird and disturbing magical power he bestows on people count as a mystery of world building. A mystery that I\'m all in for watching the characters find out cause I want to know wtf that guy is about as much as they do. It\'d be boring if somebody just explained it in the first episode. If not for the smooth pacing and wacky mysteries, it would be a 5-6 at most. But this story isn\'t bad, and it isn\'t great. It\'s a good 7/10CharactersAight so first you got your vending machine blonde guy. Not sure if I can associate him with that ""unknown battle/death god that likes fucking with humanity"" trope because I legitimately have no clue wtf this guy is. Done. That\'s all you need to know for now. That\'s all the show tells you. I\'m intrigued, but the main character\'s body and the people trying to kill him are more pressing matters than the audiences curiosity (for now). Second, we got the ""weak-minded"" protagonist trope. Or so people are calling him after he saved a girl from a fire and spent half the first episode trying to live a normal life without letting a single hint of his powers slip. Is that weak-minded? Idk, I\'d call that courageous and socially intelligent. On top of worrying more about whether someone\'s watching than whether he\'s in danger going into a burning building to save a girl, he also actually succeeds in acting like he still needs glasses for months. If you have glasses, take them off. If you don\'t, put on a friend\'s. Now go about your daily life for one day without squinting, feeling headaches or acting differently in any way. He\'s a complainer, for sure. But you\'d be crazy not to feel like shit all the time. I mean cmon, man. I shouldn\'t have to explain this. Literally all of this applies to Peter Parker. This guy is just Peter Parker except with a way more humiliating and creepy power. Third, you got the yandere-chan. Except she isn\'t in love with the main character, she doesn\'t ever feel like killing people for his sake as opposed to her own desire to find out wtf is going on, and the most she\'ll ever do for the main character is die with him, not kill for him. The reason being that she was already trying to kill herself in that fire before he got in the way, so why not just end it there. Makes logical sense. Also, she seems to act pretty conflicted about her relationship with him. Makes emotional sense. Will that grow into love? Disdain? Maybe. Will she trust him with her life after saving her? Idk about that one. He barely stopped himself from pulling off her panties while she was still ""unconscious"" after he saved her. At first glance, that extra detail might be shameful fanservice/scummy, toxic masculinity in a main character, but in this case it was used as a tool to make both characters more interesting. Now we know our adolescent boy of a main character has the courage to jump into a fire to save a girl, as well as the restraint to not take advantage of her in any way after leaving her somewhere safe and calling an ambulance. Except because he\'s stressed af about his situation and is still a teen, he has difficulty doing both of these things. That makes sense, and now it also makes sense why this girl doesn\'t trust him that easily. And in the process, it also shows how little this girl cares about herself considering she pretended to be unconscious while he lifted her skirt. Tiny details, but if these details weren\'t added their relationship would be pretty damn boring. As far as characters go, those are probably the only ones to analyze. The show does a pretty good job giving their motivations, back stories and inner thoughts the right balance of screen time, but it also doesn\'t waste your time on characters if they arent as interesting as the main ones. There\'s a very clear difference in pacing between background-kuns, side characters, one off villains and the two mc. Characters aren\'t perfect, but pretty well thought-out. 8/10ArtTime for my favorite category. This show... looks fucking beautiful. Take it from a professional animator, it\'s badass. I almost feel spoiled this season since literally every show I\'ve watched so far has had really good visuals, even the isekai this season. Among those ""good visuals"" are about 3 I\'d describe with ""amazing animation"". Then there\'s Gleipnir. Yup, Gleipnir has better animation than Brand New Animal and that was directed by Yoh Yoshinari (Animation director for Neon Genesis). That\'s not to say it\'s that much of a landslide difference. In fact, most people would disagree that one is better than the other. But in situations like that, being able to stay just as expressive as a show with cartoony visuals except with more realism or detail wins in my book. The designs are clean and sharp af with an artstyle reminiscent of of the late 2000s, so on top of being really good looking it\'s also super refreshing to see that style pop up again this well animated. And by well animated I mean best of the season. The fight scenes get to the same level of quality as the good episodes of naruto shippuden, and it really doesn\'t get much higher than that in this industry unless we\'re talking ghost in the shell or cowboy bebop the movie. I try not to use one punch man as a comparison in this case since that entire show had a different goal in mind for the action, but I\'d believe Gleipnir has the same level of talent working on it as that. And while the storyboards and shot composition aren\'t in as iconic a style as the promised neverland or beastars, they can be just as cool-looking during the action and just as smooth during the acting. Easy-peasy very high key 10/10.SoundUnfortunately, the soundtrack hasn\'t stood out that much so far. That\'s not really a bad thing for a show like this. Definitely could be better, but aside from standing out it does match the tone of the scene pretty well. And while I don\'t remember too much of the soundtrack, the op is pretty cool and the ed is lit af imo. A solid 6, but mind you, I\'m writing this two episodes in tho. Ofc, I\'ll keep up with Gleipnir and edit it later if I need too, but there hasn\'t been many huge game-changing moments in the story that has a super well placed soundtrack. And there also hasn\'t been a moment where I was put off by a weird sound that doesn\'t make much sense for what\'s going on. At the moment though, this category falls a little short compared to others. 6/10Enjoyment/OverallHonestly, enjoyment is so vague I\'d almost call it pointless. Separating it from overall may be a good way to set bias aside from objectivity, but they\'re still final thoughts. So for starters, subjectively speaking I love this show and don\'t really want to talk about its flaws because what it does right is extremely well done. I\'d easily give it a 9/10 in terms of my personal gut feeling on it. I like it a lot, and I\'m gonna have a ton of fun watching it. Overall though, I can\'t ignore the soundtrack not being memorable or the opening being as skippable as it is. Therefore I give it a 7.5/10. Except that isn\'t possible so I\'m rounding it up to 8. The artstyle compliments the characters really well and although flawed, the story doesn\'t actually detract from any of this. If it was a 7, I feel like it wouldn\'t properly imply the level of production value in this show, especially considering it actually got better in the second episode. I\'m going to keep up with the episodes and change the review if need-be, but I have a good feeling this will apply to the rest of the show as well.', ""First Of All, Don't Hate Me Because I'm Giving The Anime 9/10, Its My 3 Episode Review OpinionStory 8/10The Story Was Good, But What I Don't Like From This Anime Is Because They Push Some Ecchi Scene That Makes Me UncomfortableArt:9/10The Art Was Great, Mostly I Appreciate What They Do In Fight SceneSound:8/10I Like The Scoring, But Nothing Special At The Scoring...Character:7/10The Character Was Pretty Bad At First 2 Episode, But At Episode 3 To 4 The Chemistry Between Clair And Shuichi Was GreatEnjoyment:10/10Although I Little Bit Disappointed With Some Character Not Blended Well At First 2 Episode, I Very Enjoy It Because Great Visual And The Story Was Not That BadOverall:9/10This Anime Was Dark At Some Point, And The Art Was Very Nice,I Very Enjoyed, But, If They Not Put Some Ecchi Scene, Maybe I Give It 10 Character:7/10The Character Was Pretty Bad At First 2 Episode, But At Episode 3 To 4 The Chemistry Between Clair And Shuichi Was GreatEnjoyment:10/10Although I Little Bit Disappointed With Some Character Not Blended Well At First 2 Episode, I Very Enjoy It Because Great Visual And The Story Was Not That BadOverall:9/10This Anime Was Dark At Some Point, And The Art Was Very Nice,I Very Enjoyed, But, If They Not Put Some Ecchi Scene, Maybe I Give It 10"", ""I came into Gleipnir not expecting much, or expecting something really weird and over the top in some areas.

It has become common to see not-so-good animes stand out, while others that need more attention cease to be seen, precisely because of their not-so-good numbers, when it comes to popularity.  Sword Art Online, Mirai Nikki and Darling in the Franxx are clear examples of too popular animes.  While there are established shows that are not even commented on: Monster, PPTA, Tatamy Galaxy, etc.  Where do I want to go?  Is that Gleipnir was one of the anime that backfired and...will always be remembered, whatever the anime did.Gleipnir is the type of anime that divides opinions between the anime of the season.  Whether for the story, or for the relevance that the anime had, the show was constantly questioned about what different it would bring (besides the dog costume, of course).  The anime has a clear difference between being the darling of many and having an absolutely weak and dull story.  I felt it myself a lot while watching.At first, we saw a pair that met by ""chance"" and decided to fight together for coins, that can make any wish come true (obviously, restrictions like resurrection exist, which is a positive aspect in the coherence of the story).  In the end, the anime left more questions than resolutions.  Shuichi\'s past, Alien\'s goals, confusing dramas and narrative have been punished over time and haven\'t resolved at all.  Neither the action scenes, nor the team coin search arc saves the anime.  Things were artificial, they gave no emotion and were uninteresting.  I\'ve seen this happen before, even this year, with Darwin\'s Game.  Gleipnir worsened the situation.  The dramas were not coherent and had many exaggerations.  All problems were solved with deaths, fights or something, it seems that the characters do not know how to talk harmoniously (the suicide scene was very uncomfortable).The end doesn\'t like it either, the quality only declines even more.  A bad resolution, which gave aspects of a ""coin hunt, part two"".  And speaking of the coins, I didn\'t really understand their purpose.  Is it really a device used only to place orders?  Alien does not seem reliable.  Even in his dialogues with the other characters, all I understood was that he would need coins to rebuild his ship and return anywhere on the map.  But what would he gain from seeing a possible carnage happen in his eyes?  This is the most correct method to do?  Honoka should be feeling uneasy to see this in the sky ... No, wait!  Oh, never mind.  Even the ""death"" concept was broken and Honoka became a protector of Kaito.  It seems that the same consistency that I praised has been destroyed, doesn\'t it?I don\'t totally disregard the show, its first half is okay, because in addition to starting the work well, it managed to bring a darker side that perpetuated until the end.  In that sense, I did not feel an exaggeration, besides supporting the idea previously.  But I think that was left out in a very abrupt way, since the rest of the show just used confrontations as a way to explain who is the strongest among the characters.  A fake and very destructive technique, which degredolated Gleipnir.I don\'t question the production, nor the staff\'s attempt to improve the anime, it was a decent job.  Sometimes, it is necessary to watch some work, even if it is bad, to appreciate the effort of those who made the anime.  It is a pity to see that they were unable to make the work good.  For me, Gleipnir is nothing more than a popular anime and that, again, will always be commented for having failed, when it comes to pretending to be good.  Even though it has more seasons, I don\'t think it will go to a good place in the end.

The soundtracks are also of high quality.It\'s a shame the series doesn\'t have a second season, but I will undoubtedly read the manga from start to finish.', 'Glepnir, from Norse mythology, the name of an enchanted chain that tied Fenrir, a monstrous wolf.LA came for Gleipnir for Nao Touyama, what LA got was a crazy bizarrely almost nihilistic team battle royale deathmatch for alien coins (no seriously).Gleipnir\'s premise is one of the more audience alienating (HA) animes out there, from our main protagonist Shuuichi Kagya voiced by Natsuki Hanae being able to transform into some stuffed plushie dog suit monster, it\'s not until an incident where he saves a girl, that girl by the name of Clair Aoki voiced by Nao Touyama that she pretty much blackmails him to keep his secret...but she also is trying to find a ""monster"" similar to Shuuichi, it\'s her sister.The premise towards Gleipnir takes several swerves from this and gradually builds into something bigger and bigger to what LA said above, a team deathmatch situation in finding alien coins, as you see it\'s those alien coins that MADE Shuuichi into the dog suit monster and Clair Aoki finding her sister dives deeper into not only those coins but the ultimate reasoning to gathering the coins. There are little subplotline, like Chair and her sister Elena Aoki voiced by Kana Hanazawa\'s relationship to latter on when Clair contacts a gathering group for the coins which gets deeper to more monsters after the alien coins.Before LA talks about the world building of Gleipnir, the entire relationship of Shuuichi and Clair is extremely dysfunctional with Clair doing whatever it takes for her not only to survive but for her to get answers about not only for the coins but her sister, but the entire dynamic of Shuuichi and Clair\'s relationship is more like ""using"" him and her methods, mostly viciously killing for survivable that makes Clair and Shuuichi\'s relationship rocky, BUT LA will defend Clair in saying that because of the entire alien coins making normal lowest of the low humans into powered up monsters and the prospects of what the coins are actually capable of, it\'s all of nothing in trying to gather them thus Clair\'s attitude, thus LA actually ""gets"" Clair\'s perspective on things and was pretty much why LA continued to watch this anime (Nao Touyama voicing her was a GREAT BONUS). Shuuichi does grow a backbone throughout this anime and also starts to ""get"" Clair\'s perspective as jaded as he becomes of Clair\'s perspective but as dysfunctional as their relationship is, they more or less have the same goals, finding out how Shuuichi turned out this way and maybe able to reverse it as finding out what Elena\'s deal with Shuuichi is AND finally to save the world from the lowest of low monsters to an extent.On speaking of which, the ""monsters"" in this anime also gives us a certain perspective form their point of view and guess what they made us sympathetic to their cause, as they just aren\'t inherently evil, it\'s the environment they were brought up in that caused them to be jaded and lash out on the world and the coins gave then power and with that they want more power. In a ways, almost ALL of Gleipnir\'s cast aren\'t all inherently evil, just the methods they do things does but that they have some sense of humanity in their monstrous forms and power may indeed morphed them into those monsters...now was LA talking about Clair & Shuuichi or Elena?.The animation done by Pine Jam, well shows off their grittier atmospheric animation on display and even a good jump in animation for battles as graphic as it does become. Pine Jam kinda went all out with this anime\'s animation, from the detailed and striking character AND monster designs, fluid and graphic battles and nice background work. Pine Jam stepped up for Gleipnir and it REALLY shows, LA will say one of their more pristine yet gritty animations work they\'ve done and to think LA first thought it was studio Ezola who did Happy Sugar Life who did the animations at first, man was LA surprised.Nao Touyama is showing off her femme fatale side in mature glory as Clair and MAN LA loved Nao Touyama as Clair in this anime and once again shows Nao\'s RANGE in this anime,pretty much gonna give Nao Touyama MVP for this anime. Natsuki Hanae was good as Shuuichi with his timid but dramatic performance with Kana Hanazawa giving off an almost Rize from Tokyo Ghoul cadence as Elena. The other two notable voice actors for Gleipnir for LA would be Kana Ichinose as Chihiro Yoshioka as being the polar opposite to Nao Touyama, though typecasted in this role, she does give some nice dramatic performances and her butting heads with Clair and finally Shizuka Ito as Sayaka Koyanagi was a surprise as being part of the main cast. As LA doesn\'t remember if Nao Touyama and Shizuka Ito\'s characters ever spoke to one another in different animes, but seeing this just made the voice cast for LA for LA soo much better, sure objective look LA is being VERY biased but let LA have this. Nonetheless the voice cast in Gleipnir was GREAT with MVP easily going to Nao Touyama for her extremely mature and almost viciously femme fatale cadence.Gleipnir if anything shows ALOT of nihilism through the alien voiced by Takahiro Sakurai and the unwitting instigator to the entire anime and the worst thing is, he doesn\'t care. Hell his entire ""goal"", he doesn\'t care about, as he sees it more of a game and giving humans powers for the lulz as he sees them as ""fun"", even more fun than gathering his own ""alien coin friends"" as he NEVER cared about them and found THEM annoying too. From the backstory given through several characters, he unwittingly wants to the best for humans, but he himself is a false trickster genie type character without a care about the world he landed in and wants to ""play"" with the humans for fun. The humans he transformed for power may be the ""monsters"" of the anime, but truly, for once as much as Gleipnir shows the lowest of the low of humanity, this time...the alien is the true villain and monster of Gleipnir.Gleipnir is an interesting edgy anime for Spring 2020 and LA says ""interesting and edgy"" as honestly as possible. Sure the fanservice does take the edge even further but for what the character focused plots and especially the mysteries behind Shuuichi and the alien himself makes the anime interesting let alone gives different perspectives of even the villains in showing that the human villains ""aren\'t exactly evil themselves"". Gleipnir has an audience alienating (HA) premise, but for the edgy stuff it did, it\'s characters  and the mysteries behind ALOT of the plot points were it\'s best strengths towards mitigating the edge it had and more or less Gleipnir becomes an oddity, a GOOD oddity and another breath of fresh air in the same vien of Darwin\'s Game form the previous season but BETTER. LA was at first intrigued by Gleipnir with Nao Touyama voicing a main character attracting LA into the anime, but LA actually got pretty invested in the anime, from the mysteries of the anime itself to it\'s characters being mostly in the gray morality throughout.Gleipnir is an surprising oddity of Spring 2020, something with edge WITH the nuances of it\'s plot, character and mystery elements and follows through with it, Gleipnir is something you REALLY need to leash onto... but she also is trying to find a ""monster"" similar to Shuuichi, it\'s her sister.The premise towards Gleipnir takes several swerves from this and gradually builds into something bigger and bigger to what LA said above, a team deathmatch situation in finding alien coins, as you see it\'s those alien coins that MADE Shuuichi into the dog suit monster and Clair Aoki finding her sister dives deeper into not only those coins but the ultimate reasoning to gathering the coins.

The main point i would like to emphasize is the lack of a strong, relatable lead, the girl is suicidal, the guy has no balls, and the sister is hard to read. I don't hold it against this series, i just wanted to point it out. I like the...way this anime distinguished itself by making a super powered male lead that isn't actually the lead, simply the conduit. It adds more depth to the story than just a shounen. The way other characters have been introduced also adds complexity to the world, showing where they were relative to the main character without adding anything too outlandish. It's good to see other characters existing when the main isn't specifically interacting with them. way this anime distinguished itself by making a super powered male lead that isn't actually the lead, simply the conduit.

This can only be described as echi, psychological, supernatural gem with some great fight scenes.

When the main attraction of the show is a beta loser school kid in a dumb looking mascot animal suit, you realize early on what you are getting yourself into. When the dream pixie girl of the show is a slut that is not missing the chance to do sleazy fan service, you also know how little the show cares about respect to its own characters. And when the fights are full of gore and nudity, you know there is not much depth in...the themes. So yeah, it’s another one of those edgy nonsense shows for horny virgins who are still turned on by girls flashing their panties and who think violence equals maturity.If for any reason you care about the plot, it’s about the beta loser helping the slut to fight others who can transform into monsters, by basically undressing and merging. Why are they fighting transforming superhumans? Because an alien wants to gather his lost coins and hands around superpowers to anyone who helps out. Does any of that make sense or even connect to each other properly? No, but then again you are not watching Gleipnir for the plot. It’s a mindless power fantasy about a loser virgin merging erotically with a naked slut and butchering to pieces a bunch of crazy people who are fighting over wish granting coins from space. And no, it’s not building up to something that has enough theme exploration for mitigating all the dumb parts. It doesn’t even end! They stop in the middle of nowhere, flip you the bird, and tell you to go read the manga.And don’t expect to get much mindless entertainment either.

Finally since a longer time, I found a nice Seinen Anime, which is just 13 episodes long. Sure it ends in a way, which leaves you expecting a sequel, there is some more to be shown.Anyway, the plot is exactly as I like it, more of a dark one, just what a real R - 17+ Rating needs, Action, Mystery and Supernatural with a small flair of some Ecchi. To be Frank, do not get discouraged by the first episode cause it is just, well OK and the following second...and third also leaves the Viewer Sceptical. Just like it said, it need time to kick in. After it every episode is more interesting than the previous, cause the plot thickens and more is revealed about Gleipnir. And last few Episodes are really cool. The plot itslef centers around some magical coins which when you find, give it to a alien and he will grant you a wish, of course downside is, you will want more, more wishes granted and powers gained from gathering the coins for the alien the less Human and more of a monster you become.Now the wishes that are being granted are various, everything from new car, more money, sexy Bitches, to changing you form, gaining more power and eradicating all Life on earth. That also says a lot about characters, some want to have more arms to molest women, some just grow flowers and plants, others, kill without effort, manipulate minds. The Moral of Gleipnir, is I would say, Fear not the supernatural, fear the people that can use those mysterious powers.I also must say, the OP song and ED song are really good, perfect matches for those sequences. In my playlist already.What is left is season 2.I recommend you all, give this anime a shot. and third also leaves the Viewer Sceptical. Just like it said, it need time to kick in.

Something that does not require much thinking and is just there to be entertaining. There is not much analysis as to what qualifies as too much edginess, as it mainly comes down to personal preference and the tolerance of much one person can take. So personally, Gleipnir (which is fun to pronounce every time) hits that sweet spot of it being enjoyably edgy without it going overboard. Well not yet at least.So Gleipnir follows the story of...Shuichi Kagaya, a seemingly normal high school boy has the ability to transform himself into a monster but has no idea how he even got the ability. To protect himself, he hides this secret from everyone. But one day after saving a fellow classmate, Clair Aoki, from a burning building, she now blackmails Shuichi into helping her find her sister or she will reveal Shuichi’s secret of him being a monster.There are hints of a more deep story with monsters secretly among them and the mysterious coins but then I saw Clair half naked wear Shuichi’s monster form like a flesh suit and say she kind of p**sed in it at the end and I’m like, “Yeah this ain’t the reason why I’m watching it.” Because if there is one word that I have to describe Gleipnir, it would be shameless. It doesn’t try to play down what it is and merely embraces it but doesn’t go too far with it to the point of sheer ridiculousness. You want fanservice? It’s got fanservice. You want crazy? It’s got crazy. You want edge? It’s got edge. It’s got elements that makes it entertainingly stupid which is fully embraced by our main female lead, Clair.Clair is a shameless, sadistic and crazy b**ch who is merely using Shuichi for her personal gain and does not understand the concept of empathy. She matches the tone of the show. Is she a great character? No. She is really unsympathetic and a bad person. Is she entertaining? Yes, because of those traits. But of course, because she is crazy, our main lead suffers because in order to emphasize these traits. Shuichi is stereotypically the wimpy, pushover character you would expect in this scenario who is scared of his power and really doesn’t have much else going for him. Even by this show standards, I really didn’t care about Shuichi’s plight about him worrying that he is slowly losing his humanity. Mainly because Clair’s personality and drive completely overshadows Shuichis and, as such, takes away all of the spotlight from Shuichi. Easily the weakest part of the show.Now one thing that really surprised me was the production value in this show. The show’s animation is done by Pine Jam, who’s last TV work was back in 2017 with Just Because! and Gamers! They did some other stuff between but it’s not really worth mentioning. The show looks great and the animation is impactful. I point to the big fight in episode two where you can really feel the impact of the punches and kicks. They really got some force behind them; which you would expect from monsters. Character designs are solid as well, with Claire really rocking the crazy b**ch look with her expressions and that smile. Something I don’t know whether to protect or to eliminate. The ost is solid and matches the tone of the show with it trying to be gritty and dark with a dab of techno thrown into there, but I wouldn’t say it really stands out. The opening, “Altern-ate-” by H-el-ical is okay if not a bit plain with the usual character showcase, character drama and the fight scene at the chorus. While the ending ""Ame to Taieki to Nioi"" by Mil, I actually really like, mainly due to the visuals as it looks good maintains a calm tone to relieve from the chaos from the episode.So is Gleipnir worth checking out? Well depends really. Like I said earlier, everyone has a tolerance as to how much they can take this kind of ecchi edginess before just getting annoyed by it all. For me, it’s entertaining as to how stupid this show is. Because let’s be honest, this show is stupid. It’s not exactly brimming with scenes of deeper meaning or just simply clever writing or directing. But it is fun and has not bored me yet as the great animation and Clair have carried the show pretty well. Come in with that mindset and you will see a ridiculous but fun show that definitely has its moments and that’s enough for me at the moment.First Impression:Story: 4/10Listen, the story so far isn’t exactly fleshed out but the vibe I’m getting from the narrative isn’t that interestingCharacters: 5/10Clair is such an entertaining character. Shuichi, not so much.Animation: 8.5/10Surprisingly good. From what I’ve seen so far, this is definitely a high point.Sound: 6/10It’s fine. Does it’s job of setting the atmosphere and the opening is okay. Definitely like the ending though.My Personal Enjoyment: 8/10This show is entertaining and fun to watch but that really is my opinion though. Yours may be different.Overall Score: 6.3/10 Recommendation: Consider it Shuichi Kagaya, a seemingly normal high school boy has the ability to transform himself into a monster but has no idea how he even got the ability. To protect himself, he hides this secret from everyone.

Well depends really. Like I said earlier, everyone has a tolerance as to how much they can take this kind of ecchi edginess before just getting annoyed by it all. For me, it’s entertaining as to how stupid this show is. Because let’s be honest, this show is stupid. It’s not exactly brimming with scenes of deeper meaning or just simply clever writing or directing. But it is fun and has not bored me yet as the great animation and Clair have carried the show pretty well. Come in with that mindset and you will see a ridiculous but fun show that definitely has its moments and that’s enough for me at the moment.First Impression:Story: 4/10Listen, the story so far isn’t exactly fleshed out but the vibe I’m getting from the narrative isn’t that interestingCharacters: 5/10Clair is such an entertaining character. Shuichi, not so much.Animation: 8.5/10Surprisingly good. From what I’ve seen so far, this is definitely a high point.Sound: 6/10It’s fine. Does it’s job of setting the atmosphere and the opening is okay. Definitely like the ending though.My Personal Enjoyment: 8/10This show is entertaining and fun to watch but that really is my opinion though. Yours may be different.Overall Score: 6.3/10 Recommendation: Consider it', ""1- Sound:There was not a moment when the soundtrack was out of place, that did not match perfectly with the acts and climates of the scenes. It was also not a track that got boring repeating sounds and musical themes.The greatest feat of sound is the musical fit in the ending and opening. So far it is the best ending of the year, competing with other sensational ones, and one of the best openings. It deserves an extra point just for that. Of course the conceptual and animation artistic part also did a lot in this ending and opening.2- Image:Many fluid scenes, detailed scenarios, well-choreographed...fights, relatively common designs, but very pleasant with traits that were constant and there was nothing ugly with it.In general, I practically only heard positive reviews regarding the image of the anime, mainly regarding the first episodes. However, there was a single negative criticism about the image that come to me, in which complained that some monsters were represented only by spots. Personally I found it very unfair, there was nothing wrong with that, and even if there, was it was the anime following the manga that portrays the same way.Colors, shadows, rhythm, framing, changing scenarios, all of that was very good, all very well. If it were to put a defect, it would be because they were not bold enough in things that they could highlight, however it was already a more than satisfactory result.3- History:The story comes out of blackmail and I grew absurdly, the plot being well connected, with several mysteries, and some intriguing twists. Reinforced things all the time, which hold the viewer and leave him interested in wanting to watch until the end.It is an anime for adults, with a story for adults, so it has psychological nuances in the development of the plot and in what the message of the anime wants to convey. Things like: guilt, sexuality, betrayal, sacrifice, suicide, power, and especially what monsters are discussed. The anime brings a reflection and an apparent explanation that monsters are those who have no ties to other people.Now, negatively, it is a script that I feel had the potential to be more than it was. There was a lot of concern in focusing and it ended up being relatively linear, losing part of the atmosphere of fear that could pass. Despite the wealth of content, it is a reduced plot due to the very grandeur that the proposal allowed.4- Characters:The characters had worked past, motivations revealed, and being consistent with the narrative. What was developed in them was relevant to the central plot, and showed psychological human facets that gave it their own identities.For example: Clair (the suicidal, blond, and psychopathic) has her traumatic past of parental death that motivates her to commit suicide and revenge. So it is consistent that she no longer cares about herself, so she can be promiscuous and indifferent to others. This gave her an identity, showing a psychological state that has a direct connection with the main characters and with the central plot.I exemplified Clair, but all the other characters were developed in a similar way and had relevance from Alien to Erena, all.5- Pleasure:I believe that with everything I have already explained, it is clear why I would have a lot of pleasure, so it is best to try to understand the little pleasure of others.In fact, the MAL score for most people is not a technical note that does justice to the qualities of anime, but it is a note of satisfaction, and sometimes of perception of values. There are some genres that will always be hated, no matter how they make a masterpiece. As much as the anime is aimed at an older audience, and that does not have an ecchi too much, there will always be people who will make a judgment of values \u200b\u200band hypocritically will condemn the anime to the fire pit.Another point is the prejudice against the gore, personally I usually don't have a lot of problems with that, but I admit there are some gores that are so disgusting that I am repulsed. I confess that the proposal of a girl literally entering a boy seemed to me that it would be something repulsive and I would have prejudice, however when watching it was not. Anyway, I believe that a lot of people gave up on this anime because of that, others maintained their prejudiced (biased) addiction, and others are much more sensitive.6 - Conclusion:It is a great anime that deserves tue its merits recognized. It was pleasant to follow, it is an easy and stimulating anime to watch.Why not ten? My ten needs the anime to be absurdly excellent at something. Gleipnir is great in almost everything, but in no way has it reached the absurdity of good, only the very above average. fights, relatively common designs, but very pleasant with traits that were constant and there was nothing ugly with it.In general, I practically only heard positive reviews regarding the image of the anime, mainly regarding the first episodes.

The story is set for more than 3 episodes. I\'m explaining this now:I won\'t say it\'s the best anime ever made. BUT the story is pretty nice, as a reader of the manga, and follower of the anime I can say so. The characters aren\'t what they seem to be, it all changes between a few moments, it has really good moments of mistery and you dont know anything until almost the very end.Gleipnir just punches you in the face when you think you know something.Yeah the relationship between the main...characters is pretty toxic. But that is the way things are. Life is not fair.Life is literally not fair, and the MC is pretty useless cause he is the average student and like all of us, he is not a ""hero"", what would you do in that world, being suddenly transformed into a monster that is not even ""that"" strong? Obviously you would fear, fear your environment, your friends, the other monsters... MC fears for his life like everyone would do.I won\'t give any spoilers about it but, of everything I said, there is almost nothing accurate. You would have to see it by yourself.In conclusion, its a mistery/action anime, with a really twisted and (at the beginning) bizarre plot. Give it a chance, first episodes are literally just shit, (I guess because they just wanted to engage?) but they do not relate to the rest. characters is pretty toxic. But that is the way things are.

Upon watching the first few episodes of Gleipnir. It seems to have the same vibe as a certain edgy anime that aired last season, ""Darwin\'s Game"". So if you enjoyed Darwin\'s Game, you\'ll most likely enjoy Gleipnir too. Both have protagonists that starts of being kind and unwilling to kill, but starts to change over the course of the series. Both also have female leads who may have hit their head a few too many times. The music, tone and the whole vibe in general are also very similar. For example, you can swap the OPs of both series and it wouldn\'t seem that out of place. Now, let\'s move on to the review.Gleipnir\'s two main leads are Shuuichi(the male lead) who can transform into an animal mascot and Clair, a girl with a few screws loose. Both have to fight alongside one another in order to survive. Their general fighting tactic boils down to Shuuichi transforming into a dog mascot, and Clair getting inside of him in order to control the dog mascot.The story is not super unique, but does interest me enough to keep watching it. The art and animation is quite good compared to most shows in this genre. The sound design is nothing special. The characters are generic as generic survival game characters can be(I\'m not sure if it is a survival game, but it does give out that vibe). We have a male lead who is too scared to do anything. A female lead who\'s not afraid to kill. So, exactly like most anime of its kind.I did enjoy it more than I thought I would. The mystery aspect of it was enough to make me want to continue watching it. Though it is still far from perfect. My main issue with it is the over the top amount of fan-service. Everything from the dialog to the visuals just screams ""Let\'s make this as sexual as possible"". The amount of times Clair has said ""Let\'s become one"" or stripped is immeasurable. The fan service also detracts from the serious tone the show is trying to create. Call me perverted for laughing every time I hear ""Me and you are one"" or ""She inside of me"". But there is no denying that they didn\'t do this on purpose.In conclusion, Gleipnir is the latest anime to follow in the footsteps of Mirai Nikki. It has a fairly interesting plot and decent animation. But has generic characters and suffers from way too much fan-service. Even though I did end up enjoying it more than I expected. It is still popcorn entertainment. This show is definitely something I imagine angsty teenagers would enjoy. So if you like Mirai Nikki or Darwin\'s Game, then you most certainly will enjoy this show. But if you didn\'t then this show could still be entertaining to watch. But is nothing amazing or ground-breaking. So if wanted something to watch to fill the void after watching something amazing, then this is not the show for you. But if you\'re just bored and want something to kill time. Then this show might be worth your time.

No. Although this ""death game w/ yandere"" genre is definitely niche, Gleipnir does a good job of giving us exactly that. I wouldn\'t say it\'s a ""copy"" of Mirai Nikki (it\'d be like saying every isekai is a copy of SAO), but it follows that same recipe, which honestly is a guilty pleasure.Story: 6It\'s a death game. Some people like the trope, others don\'t. Characters collect coins and get unique abilities based on wishes. I feel like it\'s fairly creative without getting too complicated and gets by with not too many loopholes that piss me off. The...show gives fairly quick gratification, and has surprisingly good pace and mystery to keep you intrigued. Nothing great, but it\'s good for what it is.Art: 8The first fight scene was SMOOTH. And subsequent action sequences were also up to par, hopefully it keeps up. I like the style, it\'s distinct, suits the genre while while still being attractive. There\'s a good amount of fanservice and eyecandy, again, it\'s a guilty pleasure.Sound: 7I really dig the OP, OST is also really good at times, nothing too distinct, but there\'s some bops in there.Character: 6Weak male protag and hot yandere. Some people are 0 or 100. MC is honestly not that bad, and development progresses by ep 3 or so. Idk what you expect, let the character mature; just don\'t expect much. Claire though... one of the best yandere characters, depends if you\'re into it. Other characters are quirky but not annoyingly eccentric.Enjoyment: 7It\'s not a thought provoking show, I simply enjoy it. Action is good, eyecandy is great, plot progresses nicely and the mystery keeps you interested. I probably like this better than Mirai Nikki. No one is touting this as amazing, but it is good at what it does and is very enjoyable. show gives fairly quick gratification, and has surprisingly good pace and mystery to keep you intrigued.

The first half started out as I expected it to - tacky, messy, comedic, over-the-top with lots of innuendos and panty shots. And with a ridiculous storyline (a guy turns into a plushy dog costume that allows a girl to get inside of him and control him... because some alien dude hanging out by a vending machine mysteriously granted him that power). It was weird, it was messy, it made...no sense, it was tacky and over-the-top, which was exactly what I was expecting from a show with such a ridiculous premise. And it should've stayed that way.But then it tried to be serious and boy oh boy did that fail.The story became so messy and hard to follow that I seriously couldn't even bother with understanding it. The characters' motivations became even more unclear for me, the storytelling was done so badly that I really couldn't properly follow any of it. The introduction of some new characters from the main character's past and the whole mystery surrounding them didn't really make much sense to me. And suddenly, the main characters started acting completely different from what we were used to. You could attribute that to ~character development~, I guess, but there was none of that here. It didn't happen very organically, it felt very clear-cut and straight up bad.Final verdict? It should've stayed as ridiculous as it started out. I was alright with the main characters and their stereotypical behaviors (meek main guy bossed around by an assertive girl), because it seemed a bit tongue-in-cheek, even. I don't appreciate the way the show suddenly started to try to take itself seriously because it only ruined things. Such a ridiculous premise doesn't really need a dEeP bAcKsToRy and mYsTerRiEs in my opinion. I mean, I guess it could've even worked, but the storytelling was just so bad and hard to follow... and judging by how the series ended, there could be a season two in the future. Oh boy am I excited for that. (not really, in case you couldn't tell)The only good thing about this show is the soundtrack. There were some pretty amazing EBM/industrial/drum'n'bass tracks as background music that really took me by surprise and pumped me up. The ending song was pretty nice to the ears as well.But yeah, overall.... a big ol' 3. I couldn't even give it a 4 because it just isn't even 'decent'.

I've honestly never been so disappointed in a recommendation before. The show isn't that great. There's nothing that stands out and there's nothing really original or appealing about the characters or story. The concept of supernatural things existing in this universe was cool until you found out the reason - which was really dry and made me even less interested in the show. Ironically enough, the only character that is somewhat interesting is the main character. I'm not saying I like...him, because I don't, but he's a bit better than the other characters.

But I wanted to give it justice, considering the bad score and negative reviews.What is good about this anime? The short answer would be the characters development and depth, the art, the action scenes, the dark atmosphere if you’re into it. The story is also intriguing and reminds me of Parasyte and Darwin’s game. Now, the long answer. You follow the story of Shuuichi, a good guy and an introvert who suddenly acquire power he never asked for. A power he doesn’t understand and doesn’t accept. He’s having a hard...time understanding what’s happening to him and keep his power secret. On top of that, he’s blackmailed by Kurea who found out his secret and wants to use his power for personal reasons. Kurea is the complete opposite of what Shuuichi is. She’s like fire, extrovert, selfish and has no compassion for others. This is explained by what she went through in her childhood. Because, yes: you actually learn about the characters, get into their thoughts, and get to understand them. Fate made the two protagonists to team up with a common goal. As the story goes, you’ll see the characters evolved, as their journey leaves some marks on them. Because, yes, as I’ve said it’s a dark universe. The fight scenes are really well done, for what I’ve seen in the first four episodes. There is also a bit of lust, especially when Kurea “wears” Shuuichi in his beast form.

On top of that, he’s blackmailed by Kurea who found out his secret and wants to use his power for personal reasons. Kurea is the complete opposite of what Shuuichi is. She’s like fire, extrovert, selfish and has no compassion for others. This is explained by what she went through in her childhood. Because, yes: you actually learn about the characters, get into their thoughts, and get to understand them. Fate made the two protagonists to team up with a common goal. As the story goes, you’ll see the characters evolved, as their journey leaves some marks on them. Because, yes, as I’ve said it’s a dark universe. The fight scenes are really well done, for what I’ve seen in the first four episodes. There is also a bit of lust, especially when Kurea “wears” Shuuichi in his beast form.

Turns out it was a hit.To be honest, the level of fan service in this series is definitely a little off-putting, and I'm not really picky when it comes to this, most of the times I don't mind. But I think this has to do with the themes of the story so i'm forgiving this aspect.The animation on this series is really stunning, the sound design is okay,...but where this excels at is the vibe and the story. This gives me the feel of a cult classic in the making... unless they decide to screw up further down the line.But for now, it's a solid recommendation to watch if body horror and gratuitous fan service don't put you off. There is a lot of intrigue and questions floating around, and the dynamic between the two mains is interesting.

It is very sexualised and fetishistic which may be a turn-off (pun intended) for some viewers.However it is also a very well made anime with great fight scenes and an interesting underlining psychological element which make it a great choice for people not off-put by the strangeness of the show.It's Art is very good at its worst and amazing at its best, Its soundtrack is probably not for everyone but fits wonderfully with the shows themes, and its fight scenes are exceptionally high quality.Overall I'd recomend the show if your looking for a...good anime that doesn't fit the mold of your traditional show. Gleiphnir knows what it is and is made to target a specific audience rather than be widely appealing, If you find something to like about the show in the first three Eps I'd recommend the show highly, If not it may not be for you and i'd recommend looking else where. good anime that doesn't fit the mold of your traditional show.

This is the first part of what is clearly intended to be a show with multiple seasons and it ends on a stopping point rather than anything close to a proper conclusion. However, three years after its release and despite its popularity, a second season has not been announced and may still be a ways off, if it ends up happening at all, so keep that in mind if you decide to give this a go.An issue I had throughout the entirety...of Gleipnir is a feeling of it trying too hard, and not at all subtly, to be ""edgy"" and ""sexy"". This is particularly evident in both the character design and the writing and it\'s shamelessly targeting a specific audience, obviously teenage boy in this case, which is an audience I\'m pretty far removed from so this element of the show never landed with me. A lot of the attempts at humor and edginess, such as repeatedly referring to a completely non-sexual position in which our female protagonist, stripped down to her underwear or less of course, enters the inside of the zip-up animal suit from the back as ""doggy style"" simply made me roll my eyes.The appearances, themes and special abilities of the characters are absolutely all over the place and don\'t feel like they all belong in the same anime, which is an issue I had with Tower of God as well, but at least in this case you can loosely justify it because there is a story-related explanation as to why this would be plausible, even if it still felt weird and lacking cohesion for me. Largely it felt like there weren\'t rules or restrictions whatsoever and characters could do or be whatever they want.The animation of this show gets praised a lot. It looks nice, sure, but I wasn\'t blown away. It simply looks like something modern and not low budget, but that could be said about dozens or hundreds of things. The soundtrack stood out to me in a good way a handful of times. It\'s not an all time banger, but it\'s got a few good tracks that command your attention for sure.One thing I did like about Gleipnir is the development and progression of the two leads, who start out in pretty opposite corners of the personality spectrum and then both make pretty hard pivots back the other way, perhaps even too much so or too quickly. I\'d assume in the manga off of which this is based these changes are a bit more gradual, but regardless I appreciate that the characters grow and change rather than remaining flat throughout.I struggle to articulate why I\'m merely lukewarm on Gleipnir, and I feel like I\'m supposed to like it more and rate it higher than I\'m ultimately going to. It\'s hard to put a finger on one specific thing it does poorly that really kills it for me because it isn\'t actually awful at anything and it\'s a pretty decent show. I think for me the fact that it never escapes its juvenile undertone and that the ""ending"", which as I mentioned is just a stopping point rather than a proper ending, isn\'t satisfying at all and leaves us with far more questions than answers, is the one-two punch that resigns this, until a theoretical second season anyway, to merely ""good-ish"" for me rather than something better.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5~PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.75-7 of Gleipnir is a feeling of it trying too hard, and not at all subtly, to be ""edgy"" and ""sexy"".

The combination of dark themes and ecchi/erotic themes in movies/series tends to affect my viewing pleasure. Most of the time, I would just regard what I watched as plain bad, but after reading the source material while also finishing the anime, do I consider Gleipnir an exception or an addition to the catalogue of failed genre mixing that I’ve personally seen? Well, it’s a bit of both.Gleipnir, for the most part, has an interesting set of characters. The relationship between the two...main protagonists and their character development are good, although I’m still suspicious of Clair’s intentions. The side characters were okay, except for the “camera-cuck” as what the fans call him. The villains were not bad, especially that one villain named Madoka and of course, the flashback episode where some of the story begins to clear up and is probably what I would consider to be the first major turning point in the series.The soundtrack was pretty great. It made me bob my head along as I watch an intense fight between the characters. Speaking of intense fights, the animation is very solid. Every frame of a fight choreography had so much detail put in it that it made my eyes stay glued to the screen.However, I have mixed feelings with the plot. Some episodes I felt didn’t do much to progress the plot, which is saying much for a 13-episode anime. Of course we can’t forget the “ecchi-ness” of this series, which to my shock, is actually more censored in this anime adaptation when compared to the manga, which is mostly uncensored. For me, the way the studio pulls off ecchi can either make or break that anime, and in Gleipnir’s case, once again, it’s a bit of both.Surprisingly, there were also quite a few changes to the anime like the fates of their characters and most notably, the ending. While I do understand the 13 episode limit, the anime-original ending could have been pulled off better. Some of the characters’ decisions felt rushed and impulsive, which was completely different to the progression of the manga, which I will not get into to avoid spoilers, but what I can say is the flashback episode was good, but it was made rather redundant after seeing the ending. The last episode does set-up for a second season, which also made me wonder how will the studio continue this series’ plot, especially when they derive this much from the source material.At the end of the day, it’s an okay watch for those who love dark shows, although you could spend more time looking for other shows that are far superior to Gleipnir.6.3/10 main protagonists and their character development are good, although I’m still suspicious of Clair’s intentions.

But as the episodes go on, the story opens up and a lot of assumptions turn out to be wildly off. This is a show that I didn\'t enjoy too much initially, but began to become captivating halfway through as more and more things began to be revealed.I keep seeing the word ""fan service"" tossed around whenever a female character shows skin, but this doesn\'t feel like fan service at all. There isn\'t a romance plot, at least in this first season....Its gritty without the usual lewd situations common to a lot of anime. characters aren\'t prudes who blush at convenient gusts of wind that show their underwear. Some of the women in the show do try and use their sexuality as a tool, but it doesn\'t come across as being there just to be fan service.If you are uptight about such things, this show probably isn\'t for you. There is a fair bit of sexual situations and some violence and gore, but nothing that makes it stand out. The thing that does make it stand out is how dark the whole world feels and the way the reveals are handed out throughout the series.

I will not go indepth any further, because every second I think about this anime, the aching pain in my head I got from starting this series is getting stronger.I will now watch a WW2 documentary to make me feel better. "", 'Is this a good show? Hard to tell. Why? Because the mystery basically just started to unfold in the last few episode and there is a lot which we dont know yet. This show was definietly planned for at least 2 seasons. So far I would tell it is really good. I mean if the 2nd season will be executed correctly then its a 10/10 for me.Character development: Finally some gorume sh*t! (To be honest it wasn’t so exceptional, but I didnt see a well paced character development for a while). After the first few episode I was planning to critize the show because the...MC started as the usual looser whimpy protagonist (what I hate), but I was wrong. FINALLY a MC who had a realistic and good character development arc. The traumas he went trough changed him. He went from the typical ""I dont know what to do, and I dont want to hurt anybody"" to a really likeable anti-hero like character, who knows what he wants. Who is willing to get his hand dirty for it. He took his destiny into his own hand (or they took, nevermind). Moreover the interactions between the mc and the main grill worked really well. They started in Mirrai Niki style (crybaby+psycho), but they far surpassed it at the end. Since the girl showed her emotional side, while the MC grew some balls. They became like a real couple, unlike in the MN.Sidenote: The superhero ability of the MC is a great idea. There are so much potential in it, which was put to good use.Visual: This show looks really good. The animations are amazing, the sense of weigth conveyed really well. My favorite part was the protagonist\'s ""beast form"". It looked in menacingly creepy, yet funnly (it was perfect in my book). It had the joker vibe. When you see it you cant decide if you should laugh or run.Story: Actually it was well written. Nothing fancy though, but I didn’t watch this anime because I wanted to decipher the meaning of life. It was perfect fit for what this show is all about. I would say it was more than I was expecting. Initially you may think this series should not be taken too seriously, and you would be rigth, nevertheless if you start to think about the events it may raise a few interesting thought to chew on.Nudity: I llike how the fanservice was integrated into the settings. Who would want to dive into guts in cloths? Nobody, I assume. Better question though, whould I even do it? Yeah probably. It would be really interesting to feel an other person feelings. Jokes aside I dont really mind if there is pointless nudity in any series if it fits in the theme, I\'m not a prude person.Gore: It has quite a few gore scenes, so obviously a stronger stomach is recommended, but I saw a bunch of other anime which was much more brutal than this.Summary: This show is basically what Mirrai Niki could have been if it were actually good. All in all this show is really good so far. For now I give it a 9/10, since this season does not stand alone in itself, but I had a great time watching it. I may revisit this review though when the second season is out.One minor detail:For some reason this quote stuck with me, because I agree with its meaning. ""You are completly different. You two never became one."" Relationship consultant 101, and it would save a tonns of people from disappointment in love. There is the saying: ""Opposites attract each other"", which is the biggest lie. I mean they might attract, but better to resist, because after they come into contact with each other they just extinguish each other. MC started as the usual looser whimpy protagonist (what I hate), but I was wrong. FINALLY a MC who had a realistic and good character development arc. The traumas he went trough changed him. He went from the typical ""I dont know what to do, and I dont want to hurt anybody"" to a really likeable anti-hero like character, who knows what he wants. Who is willing to get his hand dirty for it. He took his destiny into his own hand (or they took, nevermind). Moreover the interactions between the mc and the main grill worked really well. They started in Mirrai Niki style (crybaby+psycho), but they far surpassed it at the end. Since the girl showed her emotional side, while the MC grew some balls. They became like a real couple, unlike in the MN.Sidenote: The superhero ability of the MC is a great idea. There are so much potential in it, which was put to good use.Visual: This show looks really good. The animations are amazing, the sense of weigth conveyed really well. My favorite part was the protagonist\'s ""beast form"". It looked in menacingly creepy, yet funnly (it was perfect in my book). It had the joker vibe. When you see it you cant decide if you should laugh or run.Story: Actually it was well written. Nothing fancy though, but I didn’t watch this anime because I wanted to decipher the meaning of life. It was perfect fit for what this show is all about. I would say it was more than I was expecting.

I feel like a lot of people don't like it because its slow, not to the point, and is more of a weird teen mystery story before anything else. It has weird sexual themes that honestly take a back seat real fast or i just stopped noticing it because it doesn't really matter by the end.The story feels very muddy but it has its moments and I want to know more....Hopefully we get a season 2.

The plot was a bit overly complicated for what it needed to be, but it kept my interest.Honestly I didn't think it was edgy nonsense because I've grown up with the garbage Zack Snyder and Michael Bay churn out, so it's probably fair to say I have no scale left any more. I found the use of the oversized revolver outside direct combat particularly interesting. Plus there is some amazing artwork for this show.This isn't my usual kind of show to...be fair, but I enjoyed my time with it and will now probably collect the manga. be fair, but I enjoyed my time with it and will now probably collect the manga."", 'I surprisingly liked this one more then I expected to.

It has everything I've been looking for in a story honestly. A lot of people will probably dislike it because it's enigmatic dark plot feels somewhat muddled by the arguably immature and frequent innuendos along with a barrage of quite questionable nudity and other less explicit lewd things.Gleipnir is...the least guiltiest and most pleasuring guilty pleasure anime/manga I've ever had watched and read. The plot is a masterpiece, it feels really well thought out and I constantly was on the edge of my seat feeling like at any moment the story could be just one chapter away from a conclusion.

I was first introduced to the series when I stumbled across the manga months ago, and from the moment I read the first chapter I was hooked and did not stop reading for a week. Fast forward to the present and I found out Gleipnir also had a short anime adaptation and I was interested.Gleipnir is a decent action, supernatural, ecchi anime (if you\'re looking for a side of fan-service to your \'plot\' then you\'ll definitely find enough to enjoy here). You\'ve got a show with aliens, monsters, supernatural powers, and high...school kids trying to prevent the apocalypse. The series\' premise is interesting enough to convince some people to give the series a try, but if I was being 100% honest I wouldn\'t recommend people watch the anime for one major reason.The anime is too short, and the manga (the source material) is nowhere near finished yet.From what I remember the anime diligently follows the plot of the manga, with the exception of a few bonus chapters or side events with little to no impact on the overall plot besides furthering character development or relationships, but personally I feel the anime viewers will get the shorter end of the stick by missing out on these moments.Last time I read the manga there were 58 chapters and the main protagonists (Shuuichi and Clair) were still in deep up to their knees unravelling the mystery plot surrounding the series. The anime only covers around the first 30~ chapters and also deviates in plot in the last 2 episodes. This will leave anime-only viewers feeling like they\'ve been cock teased before being punched in the balls as you\'re sat there during the end credits on episode 13 wondering: ""Wait... that was it?""Even without reading past the ""ending"" in the manga, its pretty clear to anyone paying attention there is meant to be more to the story, even feeling like there should have been more episodes but they were cut or something.To be fair, factoring the amount of time it takes to produce an anime adaptation from the date that production is green-lit, 30~ manga chapters may have been all that were released at the time... but I don\'t think its much of an excuse honestly.So many series out there that experience even mild popularity are rushed into being adapted into an anime before even thinking if there is enough material there to give one enough substance to stand on its own, and I\'m getting very sick of it... and Gleipnir\'s anime is now another to add to the pile of anime I would not recommend to people to watch unless they love the feeling of getting blueballed by the anime suddenly ending when the plot is nowhere near concluded.Besides that, the art style is great, faithful to the manga art style but also prettied up a little. No complaints about the sound design, no standouts among the BGM and the opening and ending do their job well enough although they won\'t be enough to make you come back to listen to them again once anyone finishes this anime. There are some pretty recognisable VAs among the Japanese cast (can\'t say for the Eng Dub though) so A+ in that department.Fight scenes are animated well enough, although Gleipnir never trys to push out of its comfort zone, always playing it safe and easy. There will be bursts of action but ultimately, even during fight scenes the characters will spend a lot of time talking to each other or their enemy. The most fluid combat we get are moments of CQC and when combatants are getting flung all over the place, slamming into trees or walls.Characters... Gleipnir\'s last chance to make itself stand out. Honestly we never spend enough time with anyone for them to leave enough of a lasting impression, and most will end up being forgotten. The only exceptions are our two main characters: Shuuichi and Clair.Shuuichi is your standard cookie cutter anime protagonist. He\'s a quiet & naive boy in his third year of high school. He\'s the type of person who doesn\'t stand out, who wouldn\'t hurt a fly, wears his heart on his sleeve and is considered an honor student destined to leave their town in the countryside and join a prestigious college/university in the city and make it big. However he also has this mysterious power to transform into a powerful monster that looks like a mascot costume, which has completely shaken up his life to the point he doesn\'t know how to act or think anymore. He also has no idea how he managed to get this power.In comes Clair, the second protagonist. She is the complete opposite in Shuuichi, including the fact that she does not have any powers and is a \'normal\' human girl in her first year of high school. She\'s confident, she\'s calculative, even a little manipulative. She always knows what her goal is, and is always moving forward to try to achieve it. She also happens to be beautiful and will even use that to her advantage if its in the cards. You never really know exactly what Clair is thinking, but one thing for sure is that ever since she met Shuuichi she\'s latched onto him and the two have a near unbreakable bond and it is a nice experience watching it grow through the series.Should also mention that Clair is the main target of the fan-service. She is 99% responsible for why this series has the ecchi tag slapped on it (the leftover 1% being the upskirt shots of other girls, but the main focus is undeniably Clair). A lot of attention must have went in to how Clair was designed because she is probably the prettiest girl in the show, and they make sure you get to see almost all of her in all her glory. You wouldn\'t be wrong for thinking Clair is somewhat of an exhibitionist for the amount of times she has to strip down to her underwear, or her birthday suit, or put on a tight school swimsuit... for \'plot\' reasons. You could say its because she\'s comfortable in her own skin, or she\'s comfortable around Shuuichi because of their bond... but there are also scenes where she might go through an entire conversation standing out in the open in very little clothing. I just see it as gratuitous fan-service, so if that is your thing then you\'ll very much enjoy this show (and the manga too). If you hate that kind of thing... well you shouldn\'t be looking at the ecchi section anyway.Through the runtime of the show we get to see Shuuichi go through a character arc very similar to Shinichi Izumi from Parasyte, where he goes from hating action and violence to becoming used to it. Its implied its a by-product of both the journey of the story and from spending time and bonding with Clair, he\'s becoming a little more like her. While its great to see the too-pure Shuuichi start to gain more confidence to the point where he even stands out more at school and his classmates notice his change, its also brought up that he\'s changed to the point where some don\'t recognise him as he was anymore. It creates an interesting dynamic.On the other hand, at the beginning of the series, Clair can be seen as coldhearted and apathetic to anyone but herself and anything that can help her achieve her goals. As the series progresses it becomes more and more apparent that Clair forms an attachment to Shuuichi and becomes considerate of his attitude and feelings, and cares for his wellbeing... something she\'s never done with anyone else (that we know of). Spending time with Shuuichi has managed to thaw out Clair\'s icy demeanor, somewhat.To wrap up, what is there is enjoyable but Gleipnir reaches its ""conclusion"" at a point in the story where it feels like we\'re only halfway there and makes you feel like there should have been 26 episodes instead of only 13... only adapting the part of the manga where the creator was still setting up the big mystery the characters are just coming to realise.Therefore I\'m giving Gleipnir a 5/10. As far as anime goes, there are much worse adaptations out there. Gleipnir neither excels or completely falls on its face in any department, besides wonderful fan-service for those of you who care (Watching Clair is very easy on the eyes). However, just as the plot itself seems to be reaching its potential, it ends. So for the final time: Just go read the manga. You\'ll get to see everything here, plus the story won\'t blueball you until you run out of chapters, but you\'ll know more will keep coming at least. school kids trying to prevent the apocalypse.

This anime is not for everyone.  Some will like it, some will hate it, but don't judge it before you give it a shot.  This at first seems very odd and I admit, it took a while to get used to the whole mascot outfit thing going on.  But honestly this anime hides a lot of great elements from the ever changing and twisting plotline, to the incredible character growth and development, to the really cool fight scenes which make you wanna put on a mascot costume and parade around punching people in the face....Ok, maybe not that far, but you get the point.  This is not a masterpiece by any means but I do think it is a must watch.  If it's not for you that's fine, but this does have a lot of things going for it.  Now go watch it and see for yourself the rabbit hole that awaits you in Gleipnir. Ok, maybe not that far, but you get the point.

There are genuinely thrilling, well-directed, well-animated moments besides the manbearpig fights. Sound is borrowed from other shows with some dubstep on top. Characters are shit with one notable exception. The art is sometimes impressive. Reverse entry vagina manbearpig looks fantastic - reminds me of the Donnie Darko bunny. It just works. The rest of the monsters are a mixed bag but mostly recycled filler fodder. The viewing experience can be jarring. Some moments are so well directed it will catch you off guard, and the manbearpig fights are two cuts above everything else. The rest...is on par with a Naruto filler arc, unfortunately. In fact, many sequences try to recapture some of that Naruto chuunin exam magic, and it doesn\'t work out.Gleipnir\'s greatest strength is female protagonist Clair - a traumatized, machiavellian girl who ostensibly attempts suicide in the first episode. Moving on without fanfare to drive the events of Glepinir on a nihilistic whim, Clair may feel sorry for herself but she has buried it too deep to be sure and we\'re never asked to attend a pity party despite the tragic events in her past. She\'s not a monster, but she\'ll think and act like one without pause as necessary. Stoic and capable in a crisis but not above the fancies of a young woman, Clair is portrayed as a redeemable person in a bad place with a death wish going through puberty, and it fucking works. Some of the best scenes are non-verbal tells from Clair when she is experiencing jealousy, erotic thoughts, fear, sadistic urges, or apprehension but keeping her shit all the way together with ease in spite of it. Clair will dismiss criticisms of coconspiritors with logical, dispassionate rebuttals that suggest a mature intellect honed by introspection. She views the sniveling male lead not with contempt but compassion, even respect for negligible acts of courage he manages despite his hysteria. The implication is that she has wrestled with similar despair herself and does not judge him for being further behind her. It only strikes us that way because she is not a bleeding heart and doesn\'t give a fuck about anyone in almost any other context. Despite her empathy for the male lead, she is also using him to accomplish her own goals. She schemes with wild abandon, shoots from the hip, and takes risks when lives are on the line - but is also a decent tactician. Her behaviour makes a lot of sense given that she has just attempted suicide and now feels both that she has nothing to lose and something to gain at long last. The tears she sheds over the few people she feels affection for make sense when they come, and she continues to act in the moment as they flow. Clair deals, overcomes, but does act out her childhood trauma through sadism, relishing the manipulation of people and events. Still, her goals may yet be noble - unclear.Gleipner\'s greatest weakness is the foundational events and progression of the story. Amplified by the bumpy ass way that the story unfolds, flashbacks often elicit visceral disgust more to do with the fact that they aren\'t believable within the contraints and character arcs set out in the show, rather than their grotesque nature. To be clear, their grotesque nature does add to the disgust. Other offenses include 21st century Japanese normies whose lives have not fundamentally changed after being granted supernatural abilities having a burning desire to participate in a Lord of the Flies, Stand By Me, Naruto mashup setting on nights and weekends. The idea that they become murderous bandits with a blind faith in the words of an immortal spacefaring alien is inconsistent - they are not given Yakuza backstories, they aren\'t ""possessed by some psychotic energy"". The alien having an existential crisis who is just too lazy to collect his friends sprinkled across the countryside in the form of arcade coins containing their virtual existences is so, so stupid. Most egrigious is the ""nobody TOLD me!?"" moment you\'ll get to that ends up being the fulcrum of the entire story.

In the United States, it has always irritatingly boiled down to toy sales:  A shitty show can continue as long as the kiddies snatch those toys from shelves and good shows can get shelved if the toys become landfill stuffing.  In Japan, the focus is on the manga sales, where you can have an anime made to promote the manga to generate more sales or an anime adapted after its manga shoots to the moon.  This... creates my biggest gripe with Gleipnir, despite it being...a solid entry in my favorite genre.  The mystery behind the world, the dynamic between the female and male protagonist, all of this has me biting my nails with intrigue.  But then I remember this anime is probably in the same blue-ball sacs as No Game No Life, Pandora Hearts, and High School of the Dead, and I weep as my appetite for more turns me into a hungry ghost.Should you watch Gleipnir?  Yes, I did give it an 8, because I very much enjoyed it.  The show creates an interesting premise with what would happen if Dr. Jekyll was a mech suit (Or a Five-Nights-At-Freddy's costume) and Hyde rode him with devastating results, throws in some fan service with some interesting amnesiac plot elements that add an air of mystery, inside the greater mystery as to WHY this is all happening, with some horror-nod sprinkles on top, and you have a hell of a show to view.  But I bet you realized.... I haven't answered your question yet ;).  I want to love this show.  I want to take it out to dinner, flirt with it a little, and get under its pants like a mad dog in heat... but I just... can't.  Like an ex you know is hot but comes with too much baggage for you to endure the hell she (or he ladies) put you through again, it's just a painful experience knowing you'll never be able to commit to that relationship, and in this show's respect there's a high chance this story won't get an anime continuation.  Sure, I could READ THE FREAKIN' MANGA, but I don't wunna, so I'm gunna stay disappointed.  Another thing that annoyed me about Hot Freckles Girl's Homicidal Trip Inside Her Furry Husbando, and something I know someone will write a dissertation about at some point, was the censorship.  Can someone tell me why it makes sense to show someone's blood and guts as they get squished to death, but not to show animated tiddies?  Or how about someone getting a hole shot through their guts, showing said guts, but no animated tiddies?  This censorship when it came to sexual stuff over gore was just... weird to me, and raised a different debate I'm too lazy to delve into on MyAnimeList.  Maybe an uncensored Bluray will get released in the future, but what's the point if there's no 2nd season or SOME type of ending?In conclusion, if you're the non-comittal type that loves a fun ride with horror elements, you'll enjoy this anime, as I did.  That's the thing that confuses me sp much about this show, just as a fun, hot-in-the-sheets lover who has a crazy bi-polar side you have to deal with...  I REALLY enjoyed it, but I can't recommend it to anyone until some of its loose ends get covered in another season.  I love fun horror anime, but I HATE anime shows meant to promote the manga with a passion, and I have a sinking feeling, when you consider the amount of quality that went into this show yet no announcement of a 2nd season can be seen in the horizon, that this IS such a show.  If you don't mind that, pick up Gleipnir; you won't regret it, take my 8 out of 10, and finish the story in the freakin' manga.  However, if you DO mind that, avoid this show, for you'll probably feel it's a 5 out of 10... or a 3 out of 10 if you dislike fanservice.  That is all.  Peace Out... a solid entry in my favorite genre.  The mystery behind the world, the dynamic between the female and male protagonist, all of this has me biting my nails with intrigue.  But then I remember this anime is probably in the same blue-ball sacs as No Game No Life, Pandora Hearts, and High School of the Dead, and I weep as my appetite for more turns me into a hungry ghost.Should you watch Gleipnir?  Yes, I did give it an 8, because I very much enjoyed it.  The show creates an interesting premise with what would happen if Dr. Jekyll was a mech suit (Or a Five-Nights-At-Freddy's costume) and Hyde rode him with devastating results, throws in some fan service with some interesting amnesiac plot elements that add an air of mystery, inside the greater mystery as to WHY this is all happening, with some horror-nod sprinkles on top, and you have a hell of a show to view.  But I bet you realized.... I haven't answered your question yet ;).  I want to love this show.  I want to take it out to dinner, flirt with it a little, and get under its pants like a mad dog in heat... but I just... can't.  Like an ex you know is hot but comes with too much baggage for you to endure the hell she (or he ladies) put you through again, it's just a painful experience knowing you'll never be able to commit to that relationship, and in this show's respect there's a high chance this story won't get an anime continuation.

I did not find any enjoyment while watching. the pacing is bad, characters are mid, story at first glance interesting then super average. at first I thought ""wow the story will probably be unique"". It was, in a very average way. It was uniquely average.I wish this kind of animation was used in other shows because the animation really grabbed my attention. so the only good part...of the show was the art style and animation.the ecchi side of things usually keeps me invested but this has done the unthinkable. even the ecchi side of things could not help this show.I could not get attached to any of the characters. they just did not have enough depth. the characters tried real hard to be unique but were bland as fuck.Overall not my cup of tea so, I don\'t recommend it. of the show was the art style and animation.the ecchi side of things usually keeps me invested but this has done the unthinkable. even the ecchi side of things could not help this show.I could not get attached to any of the characters. they just did not have enough depth. the characters tried real hard to be unique but were bland as fuck.Overall not my cup of tea so, I don\'t recommend it.', ""Criminally underrated. Quite literally. I was initially turned off by the meagre 7.1 rating, but I'm so glad I decided to try it out anyway. Gleipnir is one of the best anime I've seen in a long time. The air of mystery, the epic soundtracks, and the sinister atmosphere are beautifully complemented with a cohesive plot and heavy emotions. Everything about this anime seemed top notch.If you're like me, you'll be reluctant to try out an anime that's rated just above 7/10. But please, just this once, don't listen to reason, but your gut. Give Gleipnir a chance, and it will deliver. "", ""I don't know what to think about this. Most of them are monsters (not impressive at all, i mean there is a camera boy, an invisible girl, another with cat ears and a gardener yeti) transformed from an alien who collided with the planet and needs her alien coin-friends. Then there is a fetish with being inside people, fist fights that to be monsters is quite disappointing, the sexual connotations to satisfy the fan service, such as, for example, massaging breasts, massaging breast, massaging breast, nudity and passing the tongue through the mouth when they see a girl. The whole issue of protecting the world...and getting coins because apparently if you get 100 you will get a wish.The strong story that is solved in the trio of Suichi, (protagonist who has amnesia and does not know why he is a teddy) this tsundere girl called Clair and her apparently evil sister.

Honestly, you\'re not wrong. But let me explain why gleipnir is not just another random ecchi anime.Story: 8I found the story to be very interesting, though i will not spoil anything in this review. I personally feel like the creators  did an excellent job at giving just enough information whilst also generating gradually more mysteries keeping the viewer interested. What are the coins? What is the protagonist? Hopefully, these are some of the questions you\'ll get answers to when watching the...anime.Art: 8There is not much to be said about the art in this anime. it\'s like most anime nowadays, except for the fact that this one is a lot darker. For example, look at the cover art of this anime. I really love the art of the monster the protagonist turns into. Not only that, as you will see in the anime there is also a very special way they go about what the ""monster"" sees.Overall, the art is just pretty, but normal. There are a few things which make the look of the anime stand out from other anime, which is why i\'m giving it an 8.Sound: 7Honestly, i never pay a lot of attention to background music or anything like that in anime, so mostly i give a 7 on sound to almost any anime for this reason. However, i do remember some epic sound effects from this anime which is a positiveOverall, there are some really cool sounds in this anime but since i don\'t really listen to it a lot i\'m just giving 7Character: 7The protagonist is your average anime crybaby. However he does make a change and steps away from the classic crybaby protagonist. The antagonist however is a very interesting character. I don\'t wanna spoil to much but she\'s pretty cool. A lot of other characters come into play, each with their unique traits.Overall, i\'d give a 5 because the protagonist starts as your average anime crybaby, but the antagonist is definitely interesting. So a 7 as the final score.Enjoyment: 8As I said in the ""story"" segment, this anime knows what to give the viewer. There are so many mysteries around the whole series, yet every episode you feel like you learned something important for the plot, whilst also being left with another mysterty to solve ""next week"". I hope they keep this style up.However, as you might have heard, this anime is quite ecchi at times. i\'d give a 9 for enjoyment if it weren\'t so ecchi, so after all an 8 seems fair.Overall: 8I like it a lot, but i do feel like it has some trashy stuff too.

I\'ve heard that the story sounds a lot like a conventional death game type of anime, but since I\'ve only recently gotten into anime and haven\'t watched any sort of anime like that, I dont see it as generic or cliche. I cant write to much about the story since it\'s only gotten started but so far I would say it has gotten off to a pretty...compelling start.Although the art itself isnt to different from other anime I\'ve seen, it\'s still very appealing to see (especially Clair shes pretty hot). However the fight scenes is what makes this great. They\'re so incredibly well done. You can really feel the power of a punch when they are being thrown at a character and how the environment changes as a result of the impact.Umm, I\'m not really sure how to rate sound since I dont really pay attention to the sound effects as much so I just gave it 7.The characters are a little weak albeit they\'re still enjoyable. The mc is is probably the weakest character since we get little of his back story or what he even wants. He just kind of follows Clair around wherever she takes him. I would say the most interesting part of his character is the lack of balls he has. I think it would make for a truly interesting contrast to Clair who basically kills without remorse. Clair is by far my favorite character in the show so far (probably more so due to her design and smile). We were given a pretty basic and tragic back story for her and we were shown that she is pretty crazy. She is definitely very enjoyable to watch on screen due to her weird and quirky (and batshit crazy) personality which is a great contrast to the mc. However I fully expect the characters to be expanded upon later on.Overall my enjoyment of the show was positive. The story was pretty interesting to keep me watching and the two main characters are a very fun pair to watch.

One night, he saves the life of a girl his age from a building fire, unaware that she was intending to commit suicide within the building. The girl, Claire Aoki, blackmails Shuichi under threat of revealing his abilities to others to help her learn more about others with the ability to transform like him and mysterious coins connected to this phenomenon. As the two work...together to learn more about these ""monsters,"" they come to realize both are kindred spirits in having broken pasts caused from the events and that those close to them are connected with the mysterious events unfolding.I do want to kind of be careful with what I get into with Gleipnir as a good chunk of what it dabbles into with its plot and themes would have major spoilers. But basically, the series explores how those facing personal problems within society would make use of powers granted to them and how making use of these abilities affect those close to them. This is prominently focused on with Claire and Shuichi who each have suffered mentally to varying degrees due to finding themselves caught up in the conflict between ""monsters"" and the series gradually reveals the horrific degree that these developments have on them both mentally and within their personal lives. The two gradually find themselves having to make life-altering and morally questionable decisions to ensure their safety in the conflict, even having to coming at odds with people close to them at points within the series. Other characters are focused on to show how they view the benefits of having their abilities and what to do with them based on the pressures they face within society or any problems within their personal lives, which help add additional dimension to the ""monster"" conflict and the mental developments faced by the characters.As far as what the plot dabbles into with the causes surrounding the ""monster"" conflict, they are kind of a double-edged sword. The reveal of what is behind the ""monster"" conflict also relates to past events that shaped Shuichi and Claire\'s current mental well-being and the current state of the conflict, and shows that the main instigator of the conflict has some rather morally ambiguous motives that aren\'t completely clear for why he\'s allowed the conflict to continue unfolding. This helps add an additional layer to the twisted developments that shape how the characters within the series view the world around them and how this leads them to utilize their abilities. On the other hand, some of the revelations revealed concerning said origins do happen at a rather inopportune time as they happen toward the end of the series, which is conveniently left with an unresolved ending as Gleipnir\'s manga source material is still ongoing as of the time I write this review and still leaves the true motives of said instigator unclear.While having some issues because of its source material still being ongoing, Gleipnir still made for an engaging supernatural horror/action series that explores the flaws of its characters with how they utilize the abilities of their transformed states as ""monsters"" and what led them to take on their mindsets with utilizing their abilities, with the origins concerning said conflict adding more layers to how this shaped the mental state of Gleipnir\'s main characters of Shuichi and Claire.

Normally it\'s an anime I would quickly discard after the first five minutes. But there is this indescribable heaviness and tension to each encounter and the general feel of the world. A sense of consequence and maturity, even if specious.Then of course it ruins it in episode 10 and 11 with a sudden change to an infantile, black and white sense of morality, a complete flip from the previous 9 episodes. They *gasp* kill some people in self-defense, something they\'ve been doing all this time without too...much existential fuss, but somehow this time around it crosses the line and they turn into puritans who can\'t accept their ""sins"" and won\'t shut up about it, going so far as to sanctimoniously lash out at the one who gave them their powers, this evil evil interloper, even though he is neutral and only wants them to collect and return his coins to him. Any violence and conflict is a direct result of mankind\'s worst nature and greed, be it for money, food, territory, or in this case, magical coins that grant wishes. It\'s unfounded blame. The 11th episode is then topped off with a fight, where one of the previous surviving attackers tries to get vengeance. This would not be noteworthy by itself, but the attacker goes on a long spiel about how unjust it was that his whole evil gang of thugs was murdered when they tried to mercilessly kill others, and of course the main protagonist humors him and feels utterly devastated. It\'s all extremely contrived, a sudden and cheap debate on ethical non-issues. The show seems to have been hijacked to give a false sense of (really bad) substance, like an anime-only ending is about to come up, one I\'m not sticking around for. much existential fuss, but somehow this time around it crosses the line and they turn into puritans who can\'t accept their ""sins"" and won\'t shut up about it, going so far as to sanctimoniously lash out at the one who gave them their powers, this evil evil interloper, even though he is neutral and only wants them to collect and return his coins to him.

The first arc involves the the main heroine Claire discovering the main hero Shuuichi’s secret, that he has the power to transform into a super powerful mascot animal costume though he has no clue why. This arc involves them essentially groping around in the dark to try to figure what’s going on and in the process fleshes out both Claire and Shuuichi’s personalities, establishes...their relationship, and also explains some of Claire’s background. They ultimately do figure out what’s going on, or at least figure out well enough to obtain a goal to begin working towards, and to do so they end up joining a team composed of others with powers, and end up fighting a team of other power users. This part helps flesh out the world more and uses the contrast between Claire and the rest of the team they join to highlight the differences between Claire and Shuuichi and also slowly starts building up to character development in Shuuichi.The first two thirds had various aspects that are pretty decisive to put it lightly. For one, everything is pretty edgy. Not in a completely juvenile way, but still in a way that screams that it was trying too hard to be ‘mature’. It isn’t as much in terms of the content itself, wherein in terms of ecchi or blood/gore though there is a decent amount it’s actually pretty weak. It’s also not like the script is overtly heavy handed in trying to portray Shuuichi or Claire as anti-heroes. The edginess comes more so more the general tone of how it portrays and frames things, especially with elements like Claire literally getting into Shuuichi and all that entails. Still, I certainly don’t dislike edginess, and I felt that this anime did a good job of using it pretty well to produce a pretty gripping atmosphere that made it easy to stay interested in what was going on.The other major issue people seem to have is with Claire. She has a relationship where she’s dependent on Shuuichi and she wants him to be dependent on her as well, thus making them inseparable partners. But at the same time, the two are incredibly different with Claire being incredibly cold and Shuuichi being overtly kind. They don’t fit together well at all, but Claire essentially wants to force their bond anyway, which results in a really toxic relationship. This certainly isn’t a relationship that I would look to as a paragon of romance, rather the romance aspect felt incredibly lacking to the point it was pretty disappointing, but I still found it a really interesting relationship that I got quite invested in and wanted to see how it would progress and what effects it would have on the character development of each of them.So overall I would say the first two thirds or so of the anime were great. The problems started at the end of this part and the entirety of the last third. It’s just overall a mess. Things move way too fast and are just in general really lack flow and structure. There’s an extended flashback at one point that pretty much feels like an infodump that explains all the major mysteries that had been alluded to throughout the season in a manner that’s minimal to the point it isn’t really able to hit any major emotional beats and is also somewhat confusing. On top of all the mysteries being resolved in this manner being inherently pretty unsatisfying, it also doesn’t fit in well at all. Usually such a flashback occurs when characters in the story themselves are finding out the information in the flashback. However, as far as I can tell, this isn’t the case for anyone. The flashback wasn’t connected with anyone actually learning any of this, Claire and Shuuichi are still complete clueless about everything in the flashback, and thus it was entirely for the viewers benefit.This makes it a lot harder to follow along with the plot because it makes it more difficult to get into the head of the characters who don’t know what was revealed in the flashback and thus motivations and such are hard to parse all that well. This is especially a problem because there were major inconsistencies in character’s behavior and motivations, wherein it clearly felt like things were being forced in a direction it doesn’t make much sense for the story to go. There’s definitely character development in Shuuichi, and it’s kind of sort of following the path laid in the earlier portions, but it’s done in such a haphazard manner it feels pretty wrong. And to make it all worse, the season ends at a pretty weak point, ending not on a bang but a miserable whimper, which combined with everything else leaves a pretty bad final impression even if the first two thirds of the anime were pretty great.The art and animation are pretty solid. The designs were a mixed bag wherein some were pretty great, mainly humans and human like designs, but a lot were pretty lame too, mainly the more monstrous designs. It was also pretty strange how a lot of enemies just straight up didn’t get designs, just being shown as nondescript dark blobs instead. The soundtrack was pretty solid in context though no individual tracks really stood out. The OP was pretty great in terms of audio and visuals. The ED was okay in both aspects. their relationship, and also explains some of Claire’s background. They ultimately do figure out what’s going on, or at least figure out well enough to obtain a goal to begin working towards, and to do so they end up joining a team composed of others with powers, and end up fighting a team of other power users.

The flashback wasn’t connected with anyone actually learning any of this, Claire and Shuuichi are still complete clueless about everything in the flashback, and thus it was entirely for the viewers benefit.This makes it a lot harder to follow along with the plot because it makes it more difficult to get into the head of the characters who don’t know what was revealed in the flashback and thus motivations and such are hard to parse all that well. This is especially a problem because there were major inconsistencies in character’s behavior and motivations, wherein it clearly felt like things were being forced in a direction it doesn’t make much sense for the story to go. There’s definitely character development in Shuuichi, and it’s kind of sort of following the path laid in the earlier portions, but it’s done in such a haphazard manner it feels pretty wrong. And to make it all worse, the season ends at a pretty weak point, ending not on a bang but a miserable whimper, which combined with everything else leaves a pretty bad final impression even if the first two thirds of the anime were pretty great.The art and animation are pretty solid. The designs were a mixed bag wherein some were pretty great, mainly humans and human like designs, but a lot were pretty lame too, mainly the more monstrous designs. It was also pretty strange how a lot of enemies just straight up didn’t get designs, just being shown as nondescript dark blobs instead. The soundtrack was pretty solid in context though no individual tracks really stood out. The OP was pretty great in terms of audio and visuals. The ED was okay in both aspects.', ""This series is great!  A solid 9 for what it is.  I put this on for nighttime fodder and smashed it in one go.  We all hop in that costume and go along for an amazing fan service ride.  If thats not what you feel like watching, then dont.  These salty bad reviews are hilarious.  People complaining about another pathetic MC clearly didnt give this series a chance.  Its called character progression.  And thats the point, theres a lost memory mystery going on here.I hope studio's are taking notes, because this is how...you do fan service.  Very few series that are ecchi driven are actually done so well and deliver an interesting story, with good action, decent character development, and leave you wanting to watch the next episode to actually see what happens next.  And the fan service itself is done so damn well.Gleipner is a supernatural mystery with a splash of horror.  People turn into monsters, climb in eachother, theres alot of flesh, its great.  Theres no point giving spoilers just enjoy the ride.  You never quite know what is going on or why things are happening.  As pieces of the puzzle start coming together, they end up leaving more questions along the way.  I knew when i started the last episode it wasnt going to end with enough answered.  Its too bad there wasnt enough source material to work off of but im loving what we have so far.  The production and audio are done really well and theres a good amount of character development.  As the characters learn more about themselves and grow thru this experience they all become more likeable and relatable.   Usually you get generic tropey trash with terribly delivered fan service but this here is top notch. you do fan service.

The plot is great and truly a breath of fresh air in this 'fantasy/ shounen/ drama/' kind of anime type that haven't got a good entry since Mirai Nikki (my opinion). The problem with these type of show that has got a lot of things going on plot wise, is that it strives to be all at once, and maybe this works for a manga series but a 13 episdode anime doesn't work. The adaptation falls short in comparison with the source material and this leaves space to misinterpretations and contributes to bad reviews. Still the...plot and the characters are great, the MC has a nice growth arc in wich he becomes more interesting and owner of his own story. These anime has 5 thrilling episodes that made me go from sitting on the edge of my seat (due to the action) to fell the emotional load of the drama that runs throughout the story.

female character I find her not that likable as well as the main character himself being such a bore I don't get why Japanese writers seem to love making bad main characters while they introduce side characters who are 100 times more entertaining than the main guy, OK so don't be fooled the main character himself is a SIMP I was so annoyed at the beginning where he just decided to be the main female characters dog when...I say dog I mean he low-key just obeys whatever she says or does bruv you can think and act for yourself why don't you, the art and animation is good so good in wondering why they decided to put this amount of effort into the fights and animation I'm a bit baffled tbh nevertheless I love the opening and ending theme visuals it's eye-catching but yeah I just wish Japanese writers would put a but more effort in their writing ability rather than useless fan service if I want fan service if hits read or watch a series that mainly focuses on fan service yknow like To Love Ru etc I get you wanna put a bit of fan service that's understandable but I'm seeing the camera angle mainly focusing on the main female backside for a good while there on episode 10 lol.The plot seems interesting the mystery is good but as I said the characters and writing needs work the manga is decent it's not as bad as the anime hence why I collect it but I'm getting tired of series like these that want to be serious but have dumb stuff happening within them that leads me to question the mentality of the author, Claire the main female character is the worse forced character I've seen she tires so hard to be the emo, crazy chick that she is I get it you wanna be that bad ass chick who can kill without feeling a thing but that only comes into play when you yourself have gone through something so bad that it warps you, your parents was murdered by your sister but you aren't questioning why she left you alive their is obviously a reason if she wanted to then she would have killed you with your parents dumb nuts instead she goes off the rails and tried killing herself forcing dog boy kun to come to save her then she realizes it's dog boy kun is the one who saves her and proceed to blackmail him but my point in this is dog boy kun you could easily force her to keep her mouth shut you are the one with the power why are you obeying her like she's gold I'm dumbstruck he could easily threaten her but no that ain't his character this is why I'm getting annoyed with how Japanese people write their main character stop coming up with trash characters like these and then

compared to the other anime this season, it seemed pretty interesting in its concept so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Now I can certainly see where my hesitation came from.Gleipnir has its charm, I\'ll give it that. The animation can be pretty good, though you can tell all the budget went to the fight scenes. The concept was interesting enough, and it had just the pull it needed to keep me around for a few episodes. And then it lost me.The character design is...not great - it\'s downright boring. For a series like this, having characters that are just kind of meh in appearance and personality? It\'s not a great grab. Claire was kind of interesting, but I\'m not into characters that are just edgy and crazy and clearly for the male gaze. I get that it\'s an echhi anime, I do - and that\'s totally fine. I\'m usually all here for butt and boobs, alright? But watching a girl climb out of a meaty fursuit in her undies is... not cute. Not about that life, sorry.There are plenty of ""weird"" shows, so it\'s not even that it took a strange turn or anything. It\'s just... not gripping enough for me to care about the plot, the world, or the characters. I definitely don\'t recommend it, myself, but for anyone who could find enjoyment in it, hats off to you.

Additionally, the anime starts off a bit slower since a lot of time is spent establishing the setting and overall feeling of the town. But trust me, this all changes very quickly. You will find that the show goes DEEP into the characters' lives and backgrounds for very specific reasons in addition to developing the plotline of the present day.With that said, this show is extremely engaging, filled with mystery, and keeps you asking questions and wanting more.

When it started I thought I was in for some trashy dark fantasy show, that could prove a decent time waste. Soon I realized not only was it that, it was also fueled by fanservice. Yet surprisingly around the show\'s half point I found myself genuinely intrigued by its story and near the end of it the edginess and the ecchi began to dwindle away a bit. So, I was really confused because the show presents itself as trashy, edgy, pubescent dream come true type fantasy, yet buried...under all of its cringe is a decent story to enjoy.Let\'s get this out of the way first, if you can\'t stand in your face fanservice, don\'t bother watching this show because up until the last third of it, the fanservice is going strong. Same regarding the pubescent ""I\'m a nerd but now i\'m a badass"" story because that part of it never really goes away, although it gets more subtle as the show goes on.Now here\'s what the show does bad that\'s less obvious. For starters Gleipnir has a huge cast of side characters, a huge cast of a pile of boring. There is really only one entertaining character to watch (which is a main character) and a couple of ones that are bearable. This is a huge problem because there is so much dead time in this show, many monologues and dialogues with one dimensional and forgettable characters. Most of them don\'t add anything of worth to their scenes, they\'re just there because they help solve problems and progress the story but they\'re not interesting to watch and they hold no value.Dead time is a theme for the problems. For you see, one of the things Glepnir excles at the most is its action. The animation and the fight sequences and direction are actually really good. Characters feel like they have weight to them, and their movements are interesting and flow from one to another with style. Yet this is an aspect of the show that isn\'t really shown a lot. There\'s a lot more talking than fighting, which of course isn\'t bad in and of itself, but when the talking is just there to dump information on me and present those same awful side characters, there really isn\'t much joy in watching it.The information dump is there because this show has an extremly convoluted plot and in order to explain it all during its short runtime of 13 episodes, it has to blast you with information. Not only is this sometimes boring, but the worst part of it is that it simply isn\'t organic at all. Story telling isn\'t about what happens (i.e the information), it\'s about how it happens (i.e how it\'s told). Gleipnir is a decent mystery type story and it tells it in the most scuffed, pointlessly complicated and arbitrary way possible. The pacing of the show is god awful, with most of the story progression happening in the last couple of episodes. It\'s a shame, because I am really interested in the story, in the mystery, and in the world building the show has to offer. It\'s just that it offers it on a wooden plate in seven different sequences by five waitresses which makes me cranky.I think this review seems really negative as opposed to the moderate score I handed out. Let me state once more that this show has a geniuly interesting story, some sick fights and animations, and overall decent fun to be had even if a lot of it can be guilty pleasure fun. At the end of the day what holds it back is the unncessary fanservice and stereotypical teenage dark fantasy, but even more so, when you and the show to some extent get over those problems, the chaotic unraveling of it all is what dumbs it down so much.

So, after only 1 year of release, does Gleipnir still hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe premise of a battle royale/death game is kinda reaching oversaturation in the anime landscape lately, but it can still be interesting if the story puts an innovative spin on it and Gleipnir's spin on this premise is making the protagonist turn into a mascot-like suit that can be worn by other characters. That is...just the beginning of protagonist Shuuichi's problems, however, as he and his unlikely ally Clair find themselves trapped in a dangerous battle to find coins and gain the favor of alien who can grant them any wishes they want.I really like how the story introduces several elements such as the complexity of human morality and emotions and quest for identity and strength, but I feel the story loses some of its impact in its final episodes, when it is revealed that the whole story started because of a misunderstanding. No, seriously, the whole story started because some people decided they thought they knew what was best for everyone and this was how this game began. What a waste.If there's one lesson I can take away from Gleipnir is that many of the tragedies in this show could have been averted had the character just sat down and talked to each other instead of making rash decisions for everyone. Still, the good parts of Gleipnir's story outweigh the bad and for me, that's enough. (7/10)CharactersThe relationship between Shuuichi and Clair is without a doubt, both the emotional core and the strongest aspect of Gleipnir. At the beginning of the story, Shuuichi and Clair could not be anymore different. He is shy, a bit cowardly and would rather run away from a fight instead of hurting anyone, while she is ruthless, pragmatic and uncaring in the face of death itself. As they spend more time with each other, they begin to bring out the best in each other. Clair develops something resembling a morality, while Shuuichi becomes more aggressive and pragmatic. The duo we see at the beginning of the story isn't the same duo we see at the end and that deserves no shortage of praise.I don't know what to think about Elena, the closest thing Gleipnir has to a primary antagonist. At first, we're told that she is a ruthless murderer, but then we get some context on why she did her initial actions. Still, the show doesn't dig deep into the murders she commited and apparently, that's supposed to justify her actions and portray her as a good person making the most out of a bad situation. The best thing I can say about Elena is that she is perfectly inconsistent with her own inconsistency.I really enjoyed the supporting parts of Chihiro and Nana. They bring some much needed levity to a show that can sometimes be too dark and gritty for its own good. Character writing is without a doubt one of the best things about this show. (8/10)ArtPine Jam did a really good job with Gleipnir. Everything, from the characters, the fight scenes, the backgrounds and the lighting looks beautiful. The fanservice can be a bit distracting sometimes, but at least the show provides a reason for the fanservice. It's for story development, not just male titillation. (8/10)SoundsThe soundtrack is absolutely incredible. Aside from the epic opening song and the soothing closing song, there are background tracks for intense action scenes, comedy and tender dramatic moments.The vocal performances, both in Japanese and English, were amazing. It was always a personal fantasy of mine to have Natsuki Hanae (Shuuichi) and Nao Touyama (Clair) to star in an anime, and needless to say, they play absolutely well off each other. This also has to be my first time listening to Kana Hanazawa (Elena) and Kouki Uchiyama (Kaito) as antagonists, because I'm more familiar with their works as heroic characters.As for the English version, well, I'm not familiar with the work of Ry McKeand, but he did a fine job as Shuuchi, while Brittney Karbowski (Clair) is as sterling as ever. Morgan Garrett has an amazing vocal range and she did admirably as Elena (much better than Kana Hanazawa, if you ask me). Finally, I would like to praise the work of Xanthe Huynh as Nana. (9/10)ConclusionI had fun the first time I watched Gleipnir, but the show definitely became better with a second viewing because it helped me appreciate the story and character much better than the first time. Gleipnir is a show that can be dark and gritty without becoming too grotesque and obscene. Whenever there are action scenes, they feel earned rather than just handed over and there's enough levity to avoid the show from becoming unwatchable. Gleipnir is a clear example of a diamond in the rough and I highly recommend it.

At first, we're told that she is a ruthless murderer, but then we get some context on why she did her initial actions. Still, the show doesn't dig deep into the murders she commited and apparently, that's supposed to justify her actions and portray her as a good person making the most out of a bad situation. The best thing I can say about Elena is that she is perfectly inconsistent with her own inconsistency.I really enjoyed the supporting parts of Chihiro and Nana. They bring some much needed levity to a show that can sometimes be too dark and gritty for its own good. Character writing is without a doubt one of the best things about this show. (8/10)ArtPine Jam did a really good job with Gleipnir. Everything, from the characters, the fight scenes, the backgrounds and the lighting looks beautiful. The fanservice can be a bit distracting sometimes, but at least the show provides a reason for the fanservice. It's for story development, not just male titillation. (8/10)SoundsThe soundtrack is absolutely incredible. Aside from the epic opening song and the soothing closing song, there are background tracks for intense action scenes, comedy and tender dramatic moments.The vocal performances, both in Japanese and English, were amazing. It was always a personal fantasy of mine to have Natsuki Hanae (Shuuichi) and Nao Touyama (Clair) to star in an anime, and needless to say, they play absolutely well off each other. This also has to be my first time listening to Kana Hanazawa (Elena) and Kouki Uchiyama (Kaito) as antagonists, because I'm more familiar with their works as heroic characters.As for the English version, well, I'm not familiar with the work of Ry McKeand, but he did a fine job as Shuuchi, while Brittney Karbowski (Clair) is as sterling as ever. Morgan Garrett has an amazing vocal range and she did admirably as Elena (much better than Kana Hanazawa, if you ask me). Finally, I would like to praise the work of Xanthe Huynh as Nana. (9/10)ConclusionI had fun the first time I watched Gleipnir, but the show definitely became better with a second viewing because it helped me appreciate the story and character much better than the first time. Gleipnir is a show that can be dark and gritty without becoming too grotesque and obscene. Whenever there are action scenes, they feel earned rather than just handed over and there's enough levity to avoid the show from becoming unwatchable. Gleipnir is a clear example of a diamond in the rough and I highly recommend it.

I really can't think of anything negative to say about the art.The sound was also perfect for me, as every fight scene was put with fast and tense music that really helped emphasize the emotions the characters felt. It was also able to transition fairly well between that and calm lofi-esque music for the non-battle scenes.In terms of characters and their development, I'd say that most of the main crew have depth and detail put into them.

But there was a point where episodes started to get very interesting and it just made me want more surprisingly.We follow Shuuichi that met Clair at the beginning and got blackmail by her from the start. A bit sudden but I had the idea that Shuuichi was a horrible main character. One that shies away and just overall be a literally pussy. But I was wrong, amazingly.

I guess this show is just full of surprises, she ended up being quite a decent character.The main plot is somewhat blurry as not only is this show just a beginning to a boarder story, it has many parts that just we the viewers don't understand. What does Clair sister relate to Shuuichi or what is that white glowing girl and so on... Many questions left only to be answered in the next season or maybe by just reading the manga.

The story and the overall concept are its strongest points so far, however it does fall of later in the manga and we'll have to see how it gets adapted. On the matter of adaptation so far it's been doing good: some things were skipped, others added for filler, but some fixed perfectly what the manga did wrong (ep. 2). the art and sound are fine, nothing spectacular yet terrible....The characters are awful, their design is actually good with the main protagonist reminding of Rei from 3-gatsu no lion and Clair's design screams crazy without being an over the top yandere. Despite this, they are the stereotypical loser and the crazy abusive main girl, their motivations are weak and unclear, Clair's especially, but most importantly: the side characters are better characters. The first villain to begin with is so much more 3dimensional just thru a few lines and a 2 minute backstory, the other upcoming villains (I'm writing this review after watching the fourth ep) have better motivations and make much more sense than the very protagonists, if it weren't for the villains the character score would be much lower. Gotta give credit to the fight scenes, the choreography was fantastic and I hope they're consistent thru the whole show. Overall it's a 7, very close to 6 tho, out of sheer enjoyment and for how it drew me in with its concept, monster design and story.EDIT:after watching episode 7 I'm giving this a 6, it's just above watchable at this point, still entertaining, but it didn't keep up with my expectations. The fights threw me off the most, they were pretty average for anime and didn't match the first one which probably set the bar too high. There were some terrible cuts and it overall declined in quality.

The show that had the new and beloved semi-yandere style character that swooned people’s hearts.I came into the show with fairly high intrigue and interest as the cover art for the show had me excited to see some really cool fighting and interesting character design. The character designs weren’t as dazzling or cool as I was expecting as the main character looked like a dumb patchwork dog, for which he ended up being to me throughout the show. However, I did have a character steal my heart away. Nana, her and her cute bushy eyebrows and messy pink hair was...all I needed in this show. However, she didn’t have any real important role in the show and that was a bit disappointing since her design made her stand out more than some of the other reappearing supporting characters.Regardless, let’s get to the meaty chunk of the show, the action and the mystery it dangled in front of you. If this show had one very very strong thing going for it, it had to be the action scenes in the show. The animation that studio Pine Jam did for the scenes was absolutely gorgeous, it was so fluid and truly carried weight that it was honestly the only thing that kept me invested in the show.The mystery that the show dangles in front of you appears in episode 1 and is only slightly intriguing due to a short 10 second clip rather than the 15 min or more they spend on the character that the mystery revolved around at first. This had to do with the main protagonist being your standard “loser” character that doesn’t say much, is meek, and gets frightened easily. Having the sexualized scenes set precedence in the first episode was uncomfortable, but it made sense. Gotta get the boys horny some way and what better way than having the main female protagonist strip in almost every episode and make sexual innuendos often, right? Anyway, besides that she was probably the best written character in the show as she had actual intrigue and motivations for doing the things that she had done in the show and had a kickass villain smile to boot. Other than that, mystery unravels at a snails pace and gets less interesting as you progress. The show did get the mystery to split open by the end, but the show kind of felt like it was missing something still by the end of it. The first “mystery” question was answered but still made it so that there was still a “bigger mission to come” by the end which made it an eh ending.Overall, the show was a solid 7/10, nothing but the fighting scene was extraordinary to me so that’s all your boy has to say. all I needed in this show. However, she didn’t have any real important role in the show and that was a bit disappointing since her design made her stand out more than some of the other reappearing supporting characters.Regardless, let’s get to the meaty chunk of the show, the action and the mystery it dangled in front of you. If this show had one very very strong thing going for it, it had to be the action scenes in the show. The animation that studio Pine Jam did for the scenes was absolutely gorgeous, it was so fluid and truly carried weight that it was honestly the only thing that kept me invested in the show.The mystery that the show dangles in front of you appears in episode 1 and is only slightly intriguing due to a short 10 second clip rather than the 15 min or more they spend on the character that the mystery revolved around at first. This had to do with the main protagonist being your standard “loser” character that doesn’t say much, is meek, and gets frightened easily. Having the sexualized scenes set precedence in the first episode was uncomfortable, but it made sense. Gotta get the boys horny some way and what better way than having the main female protagonist strip in almost every episode and make sexual innuendos often, right? Anyway, besides that she was probably the best written character in the show as she had actual intrigue and motivations for doing the things that she had done in the show and had a kickass villain smile to boot.

Well this anime ISN\'T just that.Story (9/10)Shuuichi comes off as your average ""smart highschool boy"". He does give us his thoughts about being like that and you set off on the idea of him being like that. Meeting Clair was the reason his life went downhill and brought us a masterpiece which is Gleipnir. We follow this two on their investigation with the appearance of monsters and the disappearance of something (or someone) Clair holds dear.The ""mystery"" they try to solve actually gets them nowhere...and the things they find out only lead to more questions unanswered. The world they gotten themselves into has no place for mercy or rest. What will these two seemingly normal highschool kids,  give up for the truth? What will they give up for their lives?The story was hard to follow. I couldn\'t put my head around it, but something just felt distant. It sort of felt like something had already happened and the viewers got dropped in the middle of things without any context or background. To be honest, it was quite irritating. They also did this with the characters and all the more made the show hard for me to continue on.So why did I give it a 9? The first few episodes didn\'t have much to go with. You would know too little to ever fathom what in the hell was going on. However, I shouldn\'t have been quick too judge. The show completely redeemed itself (story-wise). The story was already there and how they told the story made it even better. Our protagonist is surrounded with mystery and unanswered questions, the show very well tries to put the audience in the same trance. It worked. It almost felt interactive in way that what the MC knew is what we should also know. This is how the story connected to the viewers, or for myself. The story-telling was also careful when telling things from an all-seeing perspective. The concept of this show being a mystery-thriller sticks through the first episode to the last.Art (9/10):The art style was really smooth. The fight scenes was really well choreographed and executed. They were also sure to capture the character\'s emotions quite expressively. Though the background could use some improvement or a little bit more details but, that\'s just a personal preference.Sound (10/10):This show blasts us with its opening song on the very first episode. I wouldn\'t recommend watching it at first, because OPs do give off somewhat of a spoiler. When I did watch the opening song, hell it was quite upbeat and catchy. Their background music was also quite notable. They played a wide range of music, for fight scenes you\'d get this sick EDM beat and for thrillers you\'d get this sound that would creep you out and fill in some ominous vibes. The random choices of the sounds they played, worked out and contributed the shows mood and story telling.Character (8/10):Despite the great story, I felt like there were gaps or holes in characters that could have been told and the mystery or thrill would still have been there. There was also some inconsistencies with character behavior that made me question if something happened in between scenes that was not shown.Enjoyment (8/10):Overall (9/10):My enjoyment with this anime started in later half of the series. It did redeem itself with its story and character development in the later half, but I just can\'t seem to feel satisfied with how things started. Other than that, the show for me ended on a high note.I think when this show came out, I dropped it at first because not being able to watch the 13 episodes continuously would actually be a turn-off. Especially how the show was brought about in its first half of episodes, I didn\'t really have much of a reason to go on with it. This anime is quite edgy and ""dark"" that would not make it ideal to be watched out in public. There are various sub themes that are not quite tackled but it is still there and it is not really public appropriate. I would recommend this anime to anyone who could sit through the first few episodes and also to anyone who has a taste for edgy ecchi. and the things they find out only lead to more questions unanswered.

This is fine, as the show's potential lay more in its portrayal of the characters anyway from the start. The world setting is just passable enough that if...you buy-in during the show as to the premise, it suffices to allow the action to take place.The Main Story feels a bit stagnant and stilted. It never really gets going and stays in a pretty mediocre mode of discovery for the viewer. It just feels on rails and doesn't surprise at all.There are a few peaks here and there and a few sub-stories/vignettes from side characters that have a lot of promise but these are never the main focus of the story.Art/Animation - 6The art style itself is nothing risky, its pretty down the middle of what you'd expect it to look like. Animation wise it felt pretty good though, there were no obvious and jarring uses of CGI filler crowds etc. that pull you out of the immersion due to their poor execution (in my uncritical watch).The animation felt fairly fluid as well, while there were obviously a lot of static talk over shots it had enough character movement and set shifting that it didn't feel tight and boxy as when the animation gets short shrift.Violence and fight scenes were enjoyable and didn't come off cheesy or under-cooked.Music/Sound Design - 7Here I found the the best part of the art side of Gleipnir. I enjoyed the soft synth-wave musical theme the show carried in its opening and closing music. The 'in-action' music never distracted from the actual events on screen. It was pretty on point in terms of shoring up and aiding the on screen tension and in certain situations it even (albeit very briefly) comes forefront in a few scenes to really hit the emotional cue home to the Audience.Sound Effects felt natural and balanced.The voice acting as well felt really good in this, emotions came across from the lead performers. Supporting cast members were on the whole also voiced well, just the story detracts a lot from their performance I feel as how they are performing is good, but the content of what they're saying results in some really uninteresting dialogue sessions.Character Writing/Story - 5 (With a few standouts at points)The Lead Shuuichi never really hooked me. His mixture of Ecchi romp protagonist shyness/tough good guy when the times comes/hero with a secret just never clicks together and he comes off annoying throughout most of the series which is disappointing.Clair on the other hand feels a lot more complex and interesting with her behavior and past, and I was really hoping - as the protagonist often alludes - that she might be the star of the show but sadly all we get is a pretty uninteresting back story and conflict that goes nowhere during the 13 episodes.At the mid season mark there is some foretelling of further story-line that was just enough to get me to not drop the show and commit to finishing it in case it really started to shine when delving into the material.This never happens, there are a flashes of really cool stories to tell from the Shuuichi's past but they get skimmed towards the end of the Season which is a pity. If they'd been focused directly after mid-season and the show didn't end on such an (again) flat note this would have been higher.Enjoyment - 3Personal Taste here. the Ecchi sucks, it lacks the comedic aspect of Ecchi that I tend to prefer and instead goes for the 'soft-molestation' angle Ecchi can also have. This is not done tastefully or in an emotionally impactful way to the story, its played purely for gratuity sake which for me is just cringe. I further scored this down because I felt annoyed after finishing that I got sold on the latter half of a season that just never explored the material in an interesting or investing way.Overall - 5Show is by no means awful, its solid binge viewing if you enjoy the Genre and are not concerned with generic and kinda flat story telling but are in it for the emotional swing of the art style and music. you buy-in during the show as to the premise, it suffices to allow the action to take place.The Main Story feels a bit stagnant and stilted.

And yes it's really edgy, sometimes a bit unnecessary, I don't buy that more than one girl is willing to get naked in front of the protagonist after just meeting him, but sometimes the edgy style and...fanservice serves it's purpose.Like I said, there is an interesting mistery here, and a story that feels that is bigger than you orinally may thougt, so, it really can hook you quickly.The characters are really interesting, and there's a lot of interesting places to take these characters. The animation, as far as they showed it can look really good, you get the feeling that a lot of effort was put here.However it has some things that many people may not like, for example, the protagonist is another shinji ikari style protagonist, while I personally like this protagonist many people may not like this kind of character. That's the thing about this show, it has some things that I personnally really enjoyed, however, the pacing, the style, characters and more stuffs aren't for everyone, although I feel that at least it deserves a chance, maybe watch it until episode 3 or 4 and you may know if the show is for you or not.Even though I want to give this show an 8, seing how it hasn't finish, i'll give it a seven, maybe I'll change it once the show is complete. Another thing is that the show, likes to take it's time with some stuffs, and that doesn't really bother me as long as it manages to keep itself interesting, however, seing the speed of how things are going, if the show ends up having only 12 or 13 episodes, it might suffer from that, and seing how at the time of this review the manga has a few more than 50 chapters, that might be the case. Regardless it's a great show that I think you should watch, or give a chance, I want to give it an 8, but I'll wait for the show to be complete to decide whether or not to put it. fanservice serves it's purpose.Like I said, there is an interesting mistery here, and a story that feels that is bigger than you orinally may thougt, so, it really can hook you quickly.The characters are really interesting, and there's a lot of interesting places to take these characters.

Had it\'s ups and downs, likable characters and unlikable characters; funny moments, decent action, decent depth. Too many questions unanswered though, and it felt like the story was told in the wrong order sometimes and jumped around a ton. Main character\'s monster form\'s appearance grew on me, but honestly for a while it bugged me how unique and kinda dumb it looked compared to literally everyone else\'s monster forms.Everyone\'s crazy as hell and their personalities are essentially bipolar, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, but it made the characters hard to believe for me, as they would sometimes do things seemingly...without merit, going against their personalities as well. Of course some of this is due to ""character development"", but a lot wasn\'t.Lots of Ecchi, so if you are into that, hell yeah, you won\'t be let down.Animation was lacking at times, but was totally tolerable, and the fight scene animations were always great. Dubstep/trap in anime is friggen great when done right, and almost always the sound and music was on point in Gleipnir.Still worth watching, and can only hope for a season 2 that\'ll give what this season was missing, as I enjoy the unique premise and want to see it to conclusion, done right...Oh yeah, and how can you go wrong with a cute lolli dog girl? without merit, going against their personalities as well.

I wanted this anime to be good, because it does multiple things well. The main fights, as I said, are animated quite well (don\'t get too excited there are only 3 of those), the plot is intriguing and the fan service is perfect for a...sad virgin like me. But unfortunately it does fall short in how it deals with plot twists in the story.Art: 7/10. Nothing special. Art style is fairly ""anime"" and backgrounds are quite well done.Animation: 6/10. The animation is very good during some of the fight scenes but overall it\'s plagued with still frames and just totally boring scenes. This is not an anime worth watching solely for the fight scenes.Sound: 9/10. The music, oh yes. I love the bg score of gleipnir. It\'s definitely the best thing about this anime for me. The opening is pretty good and the ending is my favourite of the season. I love mili\'s voice. not giving it a 10 cause the sound effects were quite boring and uninspiring.Character: 4/10. The character writing in gleipnir is just... Bad. It\'s just a total shit fest with a 24/7 horny cast of either extremely edgy people (I cannot possibly articulate as to how edgy they are) or just good for nothing weaklings. The characters feel very fake and detached from reality and it was hard to take any of them seriously. I\'ll explain further under ""story"".Story: 6/10. All that potential, wasted. Ofcourse the story hasn\'t reached its conclusion yet so I can\'t fully judge it, but every twist and turn so far has been bad.**Spoilers start here**In episode 2, Clair mercilessly kills a girl. Now I\'m not against killing characters or anything, but it\'s gotta have a reason and some use to the story, not just randomly killing some character out of nowhere without any meaning to his/her death (RIP neji. I won\'t forget what Kishimoto did to you). So the reason our main characters killed this girl was because she was after them. She was troubled because her newly gained powers were not what she wanted, so to turn herself back she chooses to steal coins from the mcs by, ofcourse, killing them. Clair did not want to die, so she interrogates this girl, snaps her leg and then kills her. Now, had they communicated, this whole situation could have been entirely avoided. ""Yo, I got monster legs. I wanna turn back to normal. Gimme your coin"". ""Tell me how the coins work"". ""You put it in an abandoned vending machine and an alien grants your wish"". ""Ok then, we\'ll find a coin together"". ""Sure, I guess"". Ofcourse this is not how it turned out. The characters had too much edge to communicate, monster legs chick died protecting information that the mcs found out easily in the later episodes from the alien himself, that is, FROM THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION. This is not the only death that I found to be poorly executed. In episode 12 when shuichi\'s past was being revealed, there are 2 character deaths that are done in such an absurdly poor fashion that I cant explain why it\'s bad without cringing on the inside.""Oh I\'m getting bullied. Guess I\'ll die"".B..but you have loving parents and multiple friends who care about yo.. Oh wait she\'s already dead.""Alright girl. I had a crush on you when we were young, but now I THINK you\'re the reason the other girl disappeared. I don\'t need confirmation or anything, I\'ll just strangle you to death.""Honestly, no event in this series would have occured if the humans in it had THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. A normal person does not go out of their way to murder another based on an assumption. That\'s just plain retarded.**Spoilers end here**Hopefully the shit show ends and the story picks up well after season one, cause it would truly be a waste of potential.Enjoyment: 6/10. There\'s an arc in between with some bandits which is the most useless thing I\'ve ever seen in my life. it\'s basically canon filler. You can entirely skip it and not notice any change to the overall story. Other than that, it\'s pretty ok I guess.Overall: 4/10. No one has any reason to watch this show. Just watch the one good fight scene that everyone is talking about (it\'s only above average tbh) and then drop it. Do check out the soundtracks though. It\'s very good. sad virgin like me. But unfortunately it does fall short in how it deals with plot twists in the story.Art: 7/10. Nothing special. Art style is fairly ""anime"" and backgrounds are quite well done.Animation: 6/10. The animation is very good during some of the fight scenes but overall it\'s plagued with still frames and just totally boring scenes. This is not an anime worth watching solely for the fight scenes.Sound: 9/10. The music, oh yes. I love the bg score of gleipnir. It\'s definitely the best thing about this anime for me. The opening is pretty good and the ending is my favourite of the season. I love mili\'s voice. not giving it a 10 cause the sound effects were quite boring and uninspiring.Character: 4/10. The character writing in gleipnir is just... Bad. It\'s just a total shit fest with a 24/7 horny cast of either extremely edgy people (I cannot possibly articulate as to how edgy they are) or just good for nothing weaklings. The characters feel very fake and detached from reality and it was hard to take any of them seriously. I\'ll explain further under ""story"".Story: 6/10. All that potential, wasted. Ofcourse the story hasn\'t reached its conclusion yet so I can\'t fully judge it, but every twist and turn so far has been bad.**Spoilers start here**In episode 2, Clair mercilessly kills a girl. Now I\'m not against killing characters or anything, but it\'s gotta have a reason and some use to the story, not just randomly killing some character out of nowhere without any meaning to his/her death (RIP neji. I won\'t forget what Kishimoto did to you). So the reason our main characters killed this girl was because she was after them. She was troubled because her newly gained powers were not what she wanted, so to turn herself back she chooses to steal coins from the mcs by, ofcourse, killing them. Clair did not want to die, so she interrogates this girl, snaps her leg and then kills her. Now, had they communicated, this whole situation could have been entirely avoided. ""Yo, I got monster legs. I wanna turn back to normal. Gimme your coin"". ""Tell me how the coins work"". ""You put it in an abandoned vending machine and an alien grants your wish"". ""Ok then, we\'ll find a coin together"". ""Sure, I guess"". Ofcourse this is not how it turned out. The characters had too much edge to communicate, monster legs chick died protecting information that the mcs found out easily in the later episodes from the alien himself, that is, FROM THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION. This is not the only death that I found to be poorly executed. In episode 12 when shuichi\'s past was being revealed, there are 2 character deaths that are done in such an absurdly poor fashion that I cant explain why it\'s bad without cringing on the inside.""Oh I\'m getting bullied. Guess I\'ll die"".B..but you have loving parents and multiple friends who care about yo.. Oh wait she\'s already dead.""Alright girl. I had a crush on you when we were young, but now I THINK you\'re the reason the other girl disappeared. I don\'t need confirmation or anything, I\'ll just strangle you to death.""Honestly, no event in this series would have occured if the humans in it had THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. A normal person does not go out of their way to murder another based on an assumption. That\'s just plain retarded.**Spoilers end here**Hopefully the shit show ends and the story picks up well after season one, cause it would truly be a waste of potential.Enjoyment: 6/10. There\'s an arc in between with some bandits which is the most useless thing I\'ve ever seen in my life. it\'s basically canon filler.

It\'s very good.', ""This had so much potential to be a very good anime and when I say that I mean it, think of how good Parasyte was,  this could have been at the tier, but of course, the main character is too wimpy for that. Do you love wimpy shrimp main characters or, aka the Shinji syndrome, do you love a show that keeps on making you question every decision? Then “oh boy, do I have a show for you”. I can see why some people liked this, but after finishing it, I have a lot more dissatisfaction than anything. Have you ever wanted to like...something, but it keeps on disappointing, well that’s what I felt watching this all the way through.This anime had a fascinating and eye-catching beginning, the concept of the show I really loved; with the whole collecting coins for wishes, but as I saw more and more, the whole thing left more to be desired and questions than a coherent story. Now, it’s hard to know where to begin with a blog of an anime that makes you so frustrated, but I guess we can start with Shuuichi Kagaya. There is one thing that annoys more than anything in anime, more than generic isekai, more than lolicons - which are wimpy ass characters. Shuuichi is one. I do believe that sometimes the troupe can work in certain anime like Evangelion, but Gleipnir did it terribly and for me ruined the enjoyment, even ruined the anime too. What really was lacking in this “action anime” was action, well… There was action, but it was a weak excuse for one, as our “not main character” Shuuichi was so shrimpy that it couldn’t provide a full fight, which is what I disliked because the fights felt very lacklustre.This disaster, known as Gleipnir, had a concise start to the anime; a good mystery element to his past, which I was invested in, interested in the Elena character, on board with the goals and hoped to see it pan out, but it started to decrease in score when they met the group. This is when the brain-dead decisions came from the plot that baffled me. Firstly, Chihiro the furry is shuuichi but even more annoying. What really annoyed me was weird sexual overtones of this anime which I felt killed enjoyment and become weird as hell after a while. Some scene they go into extreme danger and are willing to die from the enemy's way stronger just for something like a wallet. Then, plot armor saves them and gets the upper hand, but don't get satisfaction of actions as something always cucks it.Shuuichi not having an exciting fight except for the first episode, I could come to terms that won’t happen halfway through, so it was still annoying to experience, but I’d put that aside to get onto the other priorities of the anime. You know, when people said they hate overpowered characters; I think this show took it literally and made our main characters extremely underpowered.  Our main character is the most useless character I’ve seen as they get pushed around by everyone and the show is even self-conscious about it too which just adds to the frustration. During the later half it felt kind of random and half assed; ideas out of nowhere that have make no sense.The story doesn’t feel coherent after this because they were progressing to their goal, right? But after this, they go back to the school, of all things? I don’t understand why they would go back to school to go back to normality when it seemed like they were missing school, anyway; it felt unneeded and irrelevant. It was just an excuse to segway the story along. Only thing i really enjoyed was the backstory, which was a breather from the stupidity that had occurred through the show. I feel like out of all the episodes, only four of them were actually good and half of it was a backstory. Every other one, I felt, had plot holes, terrible troupes and meaningless or dumb storytelling. I liked Youta’s storyline and where he is now, but the future of the anime seems to me. It had locked itself for disaster and would be an awkward start for season two.What stands out to me, especially during the end, is how they are going to get there final goal. As, mcs are too weak to even try unless he blacks out or merges with the blonde girl but enemies seems like in a way different league from anything else, even with the buffs he could get there is no way he could beat him. Then the ending, which half the timeline is full of holes. After going to some random ending that was probably rushed, saying they are not the main characters; I felt like even who made this was self-aware at a shoddy job they did so made light of it in the end. The end made me just lose my mind at how bad it was and how disarrayed the whole show was, the uneventfulness that took place throughout the anime was remarkable at how much of nothing it came to; the laughable dubstep bgms, the annoying mc, all over the place plot. In conclusion, don’t bother with the anime. Read the manga if you want. Biggest disappointment that you will get if you finish this or have.

He doesn't know why or how, then he meets Clair Aoki whose sister killed their parents and is gone. The two come together to unravel the weird mysteries around their lives and the town they live in. The plot of Gleipnir made no sense to me for the most part and even as I've seen 13 episodes of the first season, the story is still incredibly weird. That said, they did a fantastic job with the characters.Shuichi has shades of Shinichi from Parasyte.

This is the question I’ve had in mind since episode 6. An interesting premise with nothing really complicated going on and characters that are at the very least serviceable. Gleipnir is a show that had something going for it, but from a certain point onward you grow disconnected from the show – mainly because of the clunky pacing.Pacing is all over the place in Gleipnir and it’s kind of hard to watch some episodes because of that. My main issue is that it takes way too long for them to present anything interesting and when they do, it’s killed off...in 2-3 minutes and you don’t get any enjoyment from it; it’s lackluster.Slow pacing isn’t inherently bad and can feel rewarding if done well, but unfortunately Gleipnir has some issues with that. To illustrate this point further, the character introduction feels completely skipped as we’re given some surface-level knowledge about the characters of this show. What follows these characters and their relationships feels very rushed and we’re not given any time to digest these characters. In one episode, our main character and the heroine are introduced, and in the next episode it feels like they’ve known each other for years. It gets even more ridiculous towards the end as we – the audience – have to use our imagination to fill in the gaps of their relationship, and more particularly, figure out as to why these characters are together in the first place.While Gleipnir certainly had several interesting ideas, unfortunately none of them were even remotely explored. At the start of the show, we get some dialogue about how it was Shuuichi and Clair’s destiny or fate to meet each other. This is an interesting concept and could have foreshadowed something much bigger going on as both of them explore this new setting they’re in, however that never happened. Instead, we got a story in chunks or bits in what almost feels like a random order and after we had to connect everything to make sense of it. To be fair, it’s not difficult to follow and the story is for most part linear. However, at times it feels rather disconnected and random. In addition, we almost never get any explanations, things just happen and that’s it. Even the reason for both of our main characters to fight is never properly explained. I questioned myself multiple times throughout the show with the following question: “why can’t Shuuichi just walk away and revoke his powers?”That is one of my main concerns of this show, namely the characters. I did mention earlier that they’re serviceable and that’s true. Thankfully, the author never needed to introduce inherently dumb or stupid characters to this show to make things work from a narrative perspective. That, however, does not make the characters of this show any better. Shuuichi is a blank-slate main character who wants to live a peaceful life. Clair is someone who drags Shuuichi in and actually fills him as a character. I was actually intrigued with how well this dynamic worked out and while it is quite typical, it’s done well in this show. You can say that Shuuichi is a passive main while Clair is reactive. This means that Clair moves the plot along while Shuuichi is moved by the plot. This is exactly what makes this dynamic stand out as opposed to other similar dynamics.While their dynamic is certainly executed well, the same can unfortunately not be said about them as characters. They’re quite typical with Shuuichi being a whiny little prick and Clair being a brat. Though, Shuuichi’s character supposedly “develops” but more on that later. I wish Shuuichi had something clearly defining about him as well as Clair but they weren’t really defined by anything. In addition to that, they never had any motivation regarding anything until much later in the series. This made it a drag to watch because not many plot points were established from early on.About Shuuichi’s supposed “character development”, there isn’t much to say about it apart from it being really, really forced and out of place. Shuuichi’s character experiences so many tonal shifts and shifts in behavior that you might find him bipolar – and honestly, I thought that was kind of what was going on. I really didn’t like his “edginess” without a proper setup. At times, he had no reason to be pissed but he was acting up with his friends and saying weird things.Clair, on the other hand, never got as much attention or any sort of development where we see her grow – in fact, we do not get to see how her character changes at all. It is rather shameful because she had a lot of room for development but instead we get to see her asspull survival strategies and having plot armor when it’s needed.It is also a shame that these characters never got any sort of inner monologues or something that could have made us – the audience – more immersed and understand how these characters think and what they do, instead of second guessing everything.A major disservice in this show were the fights. How do I begin describing the fights? Well, they’re rather short. They’re rather short, and by extension anticlimactic. A fight begins and a blink later it’s over. Everything else is padded out by fan-service, unnecessary dialogue and redundant exposition.Fan-service wasn’t terrible in this show, it was alright. They did have a more subtle approach to fan-service with Clair being half-naked for 90% of the show’s runtime. This more subtle approach works well with the tone that this series has set and there is no over-the-head ridiculous ecchi stuff going on and that’s what I actually liked in Gleipnir.As for the music, I really liked the music for the fights. Some rap-esq beats, dubstep and a lot of other crazy music mixed in which fit very well with the show in my opinion. The opening wasn’t terrible, not so catchy. I didn’t give any attention to the ending.Animation for the show is really good, things are fluid, and characters aren’t off-model too many times. The animation for the fights felt were very good, especially the last fight. It is a shame that this show is only available in 480p or 720p as that 1080p resolution would have been a lot better and sharper looking. I really liked the art style, especially Shuuichi’s ability and the shadowy abilities. I also liked Subaru’s ability as it was unique and something you don’t see too often.In all honesty, I liked Gleipnir. It was enjoyable and very entertaining. You have to consider that there isn’t an awful lot of humor in this show – or, any jokes for that matter which is a shame. However it does create a more immersive narrative and goes well with the general dark tone that they’re setting for this show. When going into this, I’d recommend just watching the first 2 or 3 episodes to see if this is your cup of tea but not much happens throughout the entirety of the show. It does have its dark turns and twists and I’m glad that the show didn’t succumb to sheer edginess and actually tried telling its story.

But in ongoing, once a week, it goes well enough to complete watching.', ""I'm not going to discuss the anime, in a manner which the viewer can be repulsed by a character. That would be taking away from the story, that is unique and something of it's own. Nobody should disregard a series because of their disinterest to a certain aspect of the series. Ignorance can make someone unaware of what has been seen, or written.Story - Gleipnir is a series, where the main character Shuichi Kagaya is transformed to a monster. Which ultimately resembles that of a dog. He doesn't remember how or when he obtained such a power. His ultimate goal was to get the best...scoring grades, to enter the top university of Japan. He ends up encountering one of our female leading character, Shuichi Kagaya. This relationship begins with him discovering her trying to commit suicide, by residing in a burning building. This causes Shuichi Kagaya to transform to his monster-like form, ultimately saving her.

The show does a good job at weaving in a darker sub-theme of how people are fighting amongst themselves to figure out why they are collecting coins and what the true purpose of the alien is.  Shuuichi and Clair are well written characters and work well together as a team and it is interesting at how Shuuichi's primary focus is figuring out why he was turned into a dog costume of all things.I did not like how I felt the anime was dragged on for most of...the season and I felt the climax of the anime was in episode thirteen near the middle of the episode.  It took so long to get the story to where Shuuichi gets his memories back that I felt we needed more episodes or more time to see what happens after that.  I may not have read the original media, but I feel that animation team/producers should've changed around how they implemented the story such that Shuuichi got his memories from Elaina around episode six or seven.Either way it was a decent anime overall, but it needs more time to fully develop and see the results of what happens after the events of episode thirteen because I feel episode thirteen's events should've happened in episode six or seven. the season and I felt the climax of the anime was in episode thirteen near the middle of the episode.

If you would have told me Gleipnir was written by the same author (it\'s not), I probably would have a believed you. Fortunately, Gleipnir does not suffer from the same issues Mirai Nikki and Big Order had.Gleipnir follows the same formula - Character gains abilities, and is thrust into a high stakes life or death game, with a crazy female companion. Granted Clair is an endearing ""everything or nothing"" type of crazy, whereas Yuno was a hysterical manic kind of crazy.The soundtrack is actually pretty awesome,...not gonna lie, and I really liked the unique kind of lanky character design and animation style.But I think the show\'s biggest strength is also the biggest hindrance to me being able to give it a higher score.Gleipnir really plays it safe, and stays in its own lane in terms of tone. Which I appreciate the focused approach, being unfocused and trying to do too much is what hurt Mirai Nikki. But it kind of forces the show into a disposable seasonal watch for me. It focused on entertaining the viewer, while remaining straight forward and coherent.I think this tunnel vision in terms of story and tone really hurts its rewatch value.

Originally edgy was reserved for something that was new, cutting edge and provocative, a good example of this would be Star Wars, yes, the original Star Wars trilogy would have been considered edgy back in the day. Over time more and more cinema and art would try to copy what came before it and while the Terminator would have been considered edgy by the \'classical\' standard Xmen on the other hand in the early...2000s were considered edgy for a completely different reason. By this point the term evolved into a parody of what it used to be, what was once used to describe something new and provocative was now used to describe something chasing a hollow imitation of that imagery. Throughout the internet era the term slowly became a connotation and eventually synonymous with Emo and Dark. This is unfortunate because now the term ""edgy"" is just a catch-all for anything dark (and maybe a little bit trashy) that someone doesn\'t necessarily agree with which is unfortunate because what could have been a great term to describe things like the MCU is now used instead to cast shade at the DCEU.So what does this have to do with Gleipnir?We\'ll I don\'t disagree when people call it edgy, it\'s a new take on an old story that shamelessly borrows from what came before it in this trashy execution that can get needlessly dark but you know what? So is Star Wars, Die Hard, Terminator and many other classic movies, they were all just trying to figure it out as they went along, the issue Is when people call it edgy to just instantly dismiss what this show is trying to be.So next time you see someone use the term ""Edgy"" to describe something I implore you to not take such a vague criticism so seriously, if you feel as though you\'ll enjoy a show that\'s a solid 6.5/10 then watch this, it\'s a perfectly fine show with some trashy teen drama B-plot and ecchi scenes if that\'s what you want.People don\'t want Star Wars to be 2001 A Space Odyssey and I believe the same goes for this.This anime earned its right to exist. 2000s were considered edgy for a completely different reason.

I'm glad I was wrong. I watched the show in one go, that's how much I enjoyed it.The Story, without being incredible original or outstanding, is really nice, it makes sense and it...was really enjoyable. Time to time it was a bit predictable but, even with that, I've got plot twisted a couple of times, the episode 12, I believe it was that one, is a fucking damn master piece, probably one of the best episodes I ever seen on an anime and, by far, on a ecchi show.

Shuuichi is one of the few main characters that I really liked on this kind of show and, even if I'm not a huge fan on yandere waifus, this one, I must acknowledge, it's awesome. They make a lot of flash backs from both of them, it helps a lot on connecting with the character and know their own motivations. Great couple of main characters, want more. 8As I stated I started watch this show and I've got hooked up pretty quickly... so fast that I didn't stop till I ended it, so enjoyement 8, nothing more to say LUL.Probably the global score should be an 8 instead of a 7... but I can't give it a 7.5 which I think is the propper score in my honest opinion damn you myanimelist xD.Totally recommended, I wish there are more ecchis like this one. was really enjoyable.

Hot because of her (aggressive) personality and (carefree) disposition. Many may dislike, even hate her, but that is what makes her attractive. She is a virgin but she does not act virgin-al at all and quite far from it. She's also very decently drawn and confidently/innocently walks in her underwear for several portions of the story.At first, I did not pay attention to this anime due to the presence of that huge stuffed toy like main character in the posters. I chanced upon a few snippets of scenes from the anime though which aroused .... oops......piqued my interest so I tried watching at least the first episode. And there's a ... hmmm .... maybe disturbing ... may be not so ... scene in that first episode that will get your attention. A lot of suggestive dialogue and settings occur throughout as well, which I appreciated. piqued my interest so I tried watching at least the first episode.

Everything from the character designs and their surroundings was visually pleasing.

The ecchi. Some scenes are really oversexualized to the point where it annoyed me. There's sexual innuendo and...puns (which I don't mind.) but I don't need to see panty shots every five seconds.

Who is getting off to a naked TEENAGE girl going inside of a fleshy mascot suit? Gross. And even if you did enjoy the convoluted boring plot, the weird, gross, and overtly sexual fanservice overshadows what awful plot there is.The characters are overloaded with trauma to try to make up for their lack of personality and extreme shallowness. Shuichi is your classical bland bitch protagonist, extremely forgettable, and borderline sex...offender. What relevance was there to remove an unconscious girl’s panties after saving her from a burning building? We’ll never know!Claire is also boring, and constantly makes Shuichi uncomfortable, because for some reasons she wants to go into a fleshy, wet mascot suit naked, instead of a bathing suit, and constantly is in her underwear. Why is so much fanservice of a teenager important? They need to keep the attention of viewers to distract from the once again terrible plot.

It left me wanting to read the manga , except combat just doesn\'t work with static pictures for me . I usually get a ""wtf was that ?"" moment. Minus 2☆Overall score 6.66☆', ""There's no doubt about it, this was a weird anime. It's not everyday that studios go with such an off the wall concept, in this case being the MC's strange abilities, but then shift it in such a way that it actually works. One of my favorite aspects of anime's like this is when they turn an ability that no one thinks could be useful into an actually adequate force. To be honest, the MC's definitely not the most OP, but he is still strong in certain ways. Truly, the only thing that brings down its rating is that they rushed the ending. They built...up a central action that they needed to do and built up the entire season. And when it finally came close, it flopped a bit with the end of the season. If there is a second season, it will certainly be action-packed and have epic standings, but that is still an if. Even with this, however, I would recommend watching if you're a fan of action and people with unique abilities. If the idea of a slightly unsatisfying ending turns you off, then I would also highly recommend reading the manga because, especially at the end, the anime diverted from the original material.

Most of the characters are kind of annoying. the main character is usually scared and hesitates most of the time to act.It took me a while to finish it because I found it annoying due to the characters always being traumatized. This anime proves that the overuse of traumatized characters can make things annoying and painful for the viewer for no good reason. I hope that if they ever make a second season, they stop the overuse of scared characters.If you're already out of patience and bored, not in a good mood,...this anime is not advised. Because, as I've already mentioned many times, the main character is very annoying. If you're already frustrated with people who don't have their act together due to psychological problems, it will amplify any annoyance about this type of people. So, I would prefer to watch anime with a happier theme or something more comedic. This anime only proves that annoying characters suck. this anime is not advised.

Not only does it have a strange power system, this anime is also full of perversion that is presented erotically.However, as an anime viewer who doesn't really like the ecchi genre, for me Gleipnir is still fun to watch because the story is interesting, the pace isn't slow, and of course the action scenes are quite cool.So, from the first three episodes of the Gleipnir anime, it can be concluded that the story is quite interesting and intriguing.

Classroom☆Crisis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30383/Classroom☆Crisis,"[""Nice watch. Dependable male lead. Intriguing plot twists and action. Interesting space-age setting with heavy political overtones.There were just a few hiccups for me:The romance was contrived and devalued some of the characters, though perhaps it's just personal preference.The story could have been more detailed overall; perhaps more worldbuilding, character backgrounds and development, and more explanation for each of the happenings. It may have made the romance worthwhile.Wish it had a mature feeling, but at least you get the feeling that the young adults/children are young adults/children. "", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.THIS SHOW IS WORTH WATCHING. YES IT STARTS SLOW, DEAL WITH IT. GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.DO NOT JUDGE THE SHOW UNTIL YOU\'VE FINISHED IT. Seriously, so many people dropped it early and missed out on arguably one of the better shows of the 2015 Fall season.STORY (9): It starts off slow and kinda generic. You\'ve seen it before, the big bad greedy corporation wants to cut funding for the hardworking dedicated student team finishes their big project. Corporate representative is sent to be evil and shut them down. Snore.Except that\'s...now what the story is about. The classroom is just a single plot point to carry the show onto the next event, as it starts to pull the camera back to show what\'s going on with the behind the scenes. It evolves into a corporate and political drama where alliances are formed behind closed doors and plans are carefully laid to move everyone into positions. The story may be about kids building rocketships, but the show is a much more grand scale.Then you get gut punched by the intense moments, when the trap cards are activated or the action kicks off. It\'s just at the right level that you stay intrigued during the ""slower"" parts.Art/Sound (8): It looks and sounds good. I\'m not really going to go in depth on it because I don\'t know what else to say. The animation is smooth, the art is well done, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the effects are nice. There aren\'t any out of place sounds and the OP/ED are nice.Character (8): This is where a lot of people get confused. ""Why are there so many characters, who\'s the main character, why aren\'t these people getting more attention?"" Whoa there speedy, calm yourself down. There isn\'t what I consider a single ""main"" character, it\'s more like two primary characters, two secondary, and the supporting characters.Kaito is the MC of the classroom side, while Nagisa is the MC of the corporate side. Both are important, and there\'s a solid overlap between them to where it never feels like one is taking the spotlight from the other. Iris and Mizuki both get good development and fill their rolls nicely. I\'ll warn that if you hate amnesiac characters with a burning passion it might take a little away, but it\'s not a critical plot point to the overall story. The other students do what they need to and don\'t get in the way.Romance is implied (and shown) but not plot critical, just enough to get you intrigued but not so much that it detracts from the story.Enjoyment (9): Honestly, it\'s one of the better shows this season. Once the plot got underway I was addicted. The pacing was excellent, the excitement was real, and it ends almost perfectly. All important plot points are wrapped up nicely, though there\'s just enough hooks that a second season can latch on to.Overall (9): I\'ll admit I\'m rating it a point higher than it probably deserves, but I really wanted to counter all the negative reviews. Classroom Crisis is a very well done original work that absolutely needs more attention that it got. The slow start really hurt viewership and I feel it\'s unfair considering just how good the show ended up being. Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise. now what the story is about.

Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise.', 'Without giving too much away about my personal life, I work in IT. My job involves tinkering with technology that helps improve people’s lives in ways they didn’t know they were being helped whilst never getting the recognition involved with being involved. Whilst I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to what’s current or how it’s implemented or how to use Linux for everyday life, I do know that this is a tough career path and even getting started can be a big pain. Interviews suck, especially when you pass many of them only to fail at the final stretch. The learning process is...worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity. worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life.

But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity.', ""This is my first review and I'll just write it to incite some more people to watch this show. This anime seems to be underrated which I totally understand, however, it's a great watch once you get into it.First thing first don't be deterred by the first episodes. It introduce a lot of characters right at the episode 1, and give the setting in the form of a documentary. Honestly, it's quite boring, listening to a off voice telling us about the company, giving a short presentation of every students and other details about the universe. The way everything is introduced is bad and it's...understandable that people would stop at this point. However, once you get past that, you find a captivating anime about corporation war while you may think with the opening that it's about space ships races.Story : 9The plot resolves around an elite classroom in space engine development which is about to be downsized since it brings no results for their alloted budget. A student is transferred in the class as a boss in other to do the downsizing but the story turn after a few episodes into political schemes, family conflicts, hidden past and romance. Overall, there are a lot of turnabout and cliffhanger which keeps make you want for more.Art and Sound : GoodNothing especially remarkable in the art. The characters designs are ok and the animation isn't bad. The spaceship aren't too flashy. It's agreeable to watch and I don't see bad points.The soundtrack on the other end is very good. The opening by Lay Duce is catchy and quite enjoyable, and the ending by Claris is also good. The OST fit in the situations and are pleasants to listen. I usually don't remember the OST but this one caught my ear. The studio even let you enjoy it by using it in scenes without dialogues.Characters : 9The protagonists are well developed, with some interesting revelations and changes in their attitude and conduct as the story progress. The others students in the classroom don't have this opportunity but aren't bad. The antagonists are quite good, with a raging psychopath who only ask to be hated (he fulfills his role at least) and a calm and calculating one.Enjoyment : 10I enjoyed it very much, the numerous turnabout and the character development keep you on your toes. You may need to pay attention to understand some corporates and political schemes but in the end, the episode is over before you know it.Overall : 9Yes, this anime is not flawless. Yes, it won't appeal to you if you're not interested in a corporation's interior conflict. I'm probably biased by giving it a 9 when I found the first 2 episodes quite average but this show how much the rest is captivating. It won't fit everyone's taste but I hope that you will give this anime a chance because I loved it.Worth mentionning : Some people may be turned off right away just by seeing Maruto Fumiaki in the composition, author of the very controversed Saekano. Well, I'm one of those who didn't like Saekano one bit, but I watched this anime without prejudice and it was a good watch in the end. understandable that people would stop at this point.

Since apparently, high school is end all be all for any person\'s life, it\'s only fitting to spawn hundreds of them in order to formulate a genre.  To add to this bunch, we have Classroom Crisis, a show about a bunch of stupid but apparently smart kids in a high school-like anime.  And boy, is this one in crisis.Story: In the far-off future where humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system (yes, even gas giants apparently), Classroom Crisis takes...place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.  Here, we have the specialty class known as A-TEC, a small class of incredibly smart high schoolers who are basically smaller, less mature engineers and business people who work for the large corporation .  (Without pay, of course.)  After a near impossible rescue attempt for the new transfer student of the class, A-TEC comes to terms with the fact that due to their wastefulness of their annual budget, that in about six months, their entire class will be disbanded.  And that folks, is the crisis for this series.The story of Classroom Crisis is a Crisis in and of itself; identity crisis, to be more precise.  While the show starts out with a bunch of high schoolers fighting for their right to stay in class (even though it was CLEARLY their own fault for putting themselves into this mess by overspending), Classroom Crisis tries to drag the reader through a story involving the ins and outs of a corrupted business, covering up different schemes, politics (for some god unknown reason), and with just a hint of both romance and attempted murder.  As a result of all of these factors going around, the show tosses the viewer around with the flow of the plot, sometimes dragging you to a place where you don\'t know what the hell is going on.At the same time with all of these seemingly random plot points going on, Classroom Crisis tries to squeeze in character development which both feels rushed and sometimes completely unnecessary.  Remember that romance bit I mentioned earlier?  For some reason, they sprinkle that in at the end without any indication as how or why any of that came to be.  In addition, the show really doesn\'t actually focus on its base storyline of A-TEC struggle for existence, mostly focusing on the characters that actually aren\'t part of A-TEC, aka the weird power struggle that created such a mess of a series.In end end, Classroom Crisis\'s story was a horrendous piece to watch.  Not only did it not follow to the letter on what it wanted to do, but it also pulled itself in directions that made not only made for a dreadful watching experience, but it also made character importance varied as to who was important and who wasn\'t, to the point that I personally could care less what was going on since there really isn\'t any way that you can get a sense as to what is really going on with the people in this series.  Plus, that ending was kind of random, to be honest.Overview:-  Generic base idea  (High school show, really?)-  Shifting story that changed what it wanted to focus-  Random bits of unnecessary detail  (Seriously, why is there any semblance of romance here?!)-   Artificial character development  (just seemed kind of forced rather than natural)-   Random endingCharacters:  Characters in Classroom Crisis aren\'t really characters, per say.  Many of them are simply plot devices, or are completely forgotten halfway through because the story shifts in a way that those characters simply become irrelevant after a time.  So, I will attempt to pick out the ones that I assume are the true main characters in the series.First is Sera Kaito, the teacher of the class of A-TEC.  As an employee of the Kirishina corporation, Kaito is a very smart person when it comes to engineering, but comes a bit short in every aspect.  He\'s sort of the newbie in the whole scheme of business characters since he is very absent minded about how business practices work, and as such gets very flustered.  Still though, he\'s a very motivated character that works towards his goal of ""saving A-TEC"", but in the end, there\'s not really much to his character.  He doesn\'t change at all in this series and frankly, sort of just derps around half the time due to the various situations that pop up around the whole series.And then we have Kiryu Nagisa.  As the transfer student of A-TEC and the resident douchebag of the series, Nagisa is a very focused and slightly narcissistic individual who puts his mission first above anything else.  His personality is one that you love to hate.  Because he just barrels into the series and just well, does his job as someone who looks out for the company since A-TEC is really just a waste of time and money.  He is gradually shown to be the ""good guy"" of the series but really, there\'s nothing substantial about him.  As a character, he artificially changes to the point where he is considered to be a protagonist rather than an antagonist, but at that point, there\'s nothing about him to even care about.Everyone else in this series are just plot devices.  The entire group of A-TEC students barely get any role aside from supporting roles in the series, and since the entire show is devoted to the less than average story, any other character in the series really doesn\'t have much significance aside from this character playing this and having this role, and that character being that because he\'s this and his basic goal is this.  No one is really past a cardboard cutout of a character and there\'s no point of knowing who they are because no one is really all that memorable.Overview:-  Less than average cast-  Character development didn\'t make sense-  Entire cast were basically plot devicesArt: Contrary to the story and characters, the art for Classroom Crisis was decent.  While the characters themselves weren\'t detailed to the extent of being gloriously animated, the backgrounds and the level of detail in certain things like the rockets were relatively well animated.  But honestly, that\'s as much as I can say for the artwork.  It was pretty standard all the way through and there really wasn\'t much to say about it.Sound: As for the soundtrack, the OP and ED of the series really didn\'t have much to add to the series.  Out of every track, the OP was probably the best with its heroic sounding tone to it, but it really wasn\'t all that memorable.  Same thing goes for the rest of the track.  Like the artwork, it\'s good, but not memorable.Personal Enjoyment: When I first say Classroom Crisis, I thought that this might be quaint little series about a small group of kids or something, but I was dead wrong.  OH, so wrong.  It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.

For all haters/fans this is just my opinion and you can think what you want don't be mad and write your own review if you want to critic an anime.[Story 9/10]CC Project contains a simple story to understand, a group of students / workers in a company in the future where manufactured rockets.A-tec is the name of the group which tried to carry out his last project and show it to the  company to stay or leave.

So i went to MAL and naturally i saw bad/mediocre reviews about it.  this got me to be really scared, since i didnt want to watch a anime that would eat away my brain cells, but boy, am i glad that i didnt drop it, so lets get to the actual review.Story: 7 (MAL rating), 7.5 (my rating)to be honest, along with some people, i found the introduction...to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too. Not much to say here, other than me writhing on the floor. dang that music is great.Character: 7As an anime with decent plot and a generous 13 episode limit, i wished they would elaborate on the other A-TEC members. They elaborated a good portion of Mizuki, Iris and Nagisa to a point where i loved all 3 of them, so its all good. It was too be expected though, since they were the main characters. But still.Enjoyment: 8it wouldve gotten a 9 for me if the intro was a bit better. But the rest of the anime got really interesting, so im giving it a 8.Overall: 8Sometimes people dont look at the animes that isnt a sequel like Non Non Biyori, WORKING!!! or adaptations such as God Eater, or manga adaptations such as Gakkou Gurashi. Classroom Crisis gets overshadowed by all these big anime titles, but i encourage you. Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed. to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh.

It seems like that will be the trend for the whole series, which would make it a rather simple, ""done-before"" anime.However, even from the very first scene, the writers slowly began to change the trajectory of the story. Bits and pieces and hints are strategically placed and begin to grow: corporate intrigue; complex backstories; mysteries and secrets; hidden parts of...character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction. With a well-placed twist and glimpses at deeper characterization, the show is brought to a good climax and ends on a hopeful note for a second season.It should be noted that this is very happily free of a lot of over-used and aggravating tropes. Nowhere do we see some of the romance tropes that make the reader sigh of disappointment, nor do we have horribly annoying characters. Even the presence of some tropes are used for humor, and work well enough.While this isn\'t an incredible masterpiece, it certainly is a good show. I give it 9/10 for the sake of being a show I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and hope eagerly for a second season.Story: 9/10. The twists were well-placed and the plot flowed in an interesting manner. Some might think the beginning lags, but I actually find the contrast of the beginning episodes with where it goes as one of the better points of the show. I like the surprise and slow sinking feeling you get as the show progresses from slice-of-life to something deeper.Art: 9/10. I enjoy the art. The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment. I don\'t have any tracks that especially stick with me, but they fit the mood well.Character: 10/10. For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10. A very good show. character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction.

I like the surprise and slow sinking feeling you get as the show progresses from slice-of-life to something deeper.Art: 9/10. I enjoy the art. The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment. I don\'t have any tracks that especially stick with me, but they fit the mood well.Character: 10/10. For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10. A very good show.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Every year, my family and I go to the cottage we have up north. We ride on the pontoon, we go to the local ice cream store, and we sit around the campfire making s’mores. These separate events are fun, but what makes them so awesome is getting to spend them with my family.I remember one night when Craig, a cousin of mine, brought a telescope with him. It was a clear night, allowing the stars to brightly shine against the dark backdrop. He had been practicing viewing objects in outer space, and, by that...point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10 point, he could consistently find Saturn.

Not a lot of praise, but a bit of praise. Thing is, Classroom Crisis is bad. It\'s objectively not good. I can understand why people could like this, but at the same time, I can\'t.Story: 2Classroom Crisis gives an abysmal attempt at crafting its story. From the beginning, we are confronted with a conflict. Good, plots need a conflict. Couple more episodes, though, and we begin seeing more and more problems arise. There are so many different conflicts and so many different plotlines, it just becomes difficult to keep track of.There is a...main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end. There\'s also a bunch of different villains, with practically no motivation, and no real contribution to the plot.While the ending, without any spoilers, was an alright conclusion in itself, it was cliche and out of place. Classroom Crisis, which should be more aptly named Classroom Crises, was simply a mess in its storytelling.Art + Sound: 7I\'m not stickler for art and sound. I don\'t particularly listen for insert songs or background music, nor do I search for inconsistencies or mistakes in the art. TrySail\'s OP is actually great, in my opinion, and the art is pretty, to say the least. But there\'s nothing special about either.Character: 3The people in the Kirishina Corporation are so normal. Classroom Crisis is filled with such cookie-cutter cliche characters that I can\'t even name them all, but I\'ll name a few notables: Sera Kaito (energetic, somewhat-absent-minded ""mature"" one), Sera Mizuki (also energetic, happy-go-lucky teen girl), Shirasaki Iris (quiet, tough dandere who\'d do anything for her friend), Kiryuu Nagisa (evil-for-no-reason, first villain-turned-anti-hero), Angelina-sensei (tough assistant teacher who has a mysterious past (seriously? why? it\'s never explained)), Kiryuu Yuuji (Nagisa\'s boss and brother, second villain, no motivation), Kiryuu Kazuhisa (main villain, still no real motivation).The rest of the characters can be written off. The only ones I ever really took note of were Nagisa, because you kinda have to, Iris, because I love my stoic danderes, Mizuki, because she has so much presence (also the tiny hint of yuri, that ended up being destroyed), and some student who I couldn\'t tell if they were a boy, a girl, or neither.Anyways, the characters suck. A few of them do have some development, but most are left to gather dust.Enjoyment: 2I did not enjoy Classroom Crisis. It was too hard to want to follow, there is just nothing to grasp onto with it. It\'s just terrible.Overall: 4Classroom Crisis was bad. The attempt at character development, decent ending, and a somewhat traceable plot kept it floating just under mediocre. Classroom Crisis isn\'t good, and I don\'t understand why it gets the praise that it does. On the flipside, Classroom Crisis isn\'t the worst anime ever released. I guess. Please, do not make a second season. I do not want more of this.

They had a  good romance going, and the way it developed was good. But then the other girl regained her memory, and now the anime has become a harem. The man male has 3 girls all wanting him, and the anime just plays it off as a joke.I felt like i was deceived into watching it just to get the ending i most hated.Everything in my review is based on my own opinion. Everyone has different opinions, and mine on this anime is not good.I do not expect everyone to agree. Some people like it, some people don't. And to be honest, I would've given this anime a 6-7 if it weren't for the ending.I wrote this so to share what i feel about this anime. would do.....i don't know if that makes sense or not, but basically only the main characters had a little development, the rest were just there for props.NOW!!!!!The main point that upset me SO MUCH to give it such a low score: THE ROMANCEThe romance was a complete JOKE! i would've gave this anime a decent score, but then the ending made this anime completely appalling.

I\'ve left out major spoilers, however.]I am glad that I watched this.I would probably recommend this to others.I have watched this once, subtitled.I probably won\'t watch this again.---- Positives ----The engineers vs. executives battle is moderately interesting.I\'m not used to watching series about internal company struggles, so I thought that this concept was fresh....The A-TEC characters seem competent.Although there isn\'t much detail explaining to what degree and for what reasons they\'re competent, the A-TEC members each seem to hold their own during their crisis, in the end at least. Some of them had a shaky path, one in particular. Besides proper A-TEC members, Kiryuu Nagisa is also shown to be very competent.

There ~was~ urgency on paper, but it didn\'t ever feel like there was. This series is similar to Amagi Brilliant Park in format, and in that series, there was a very well demonstrated sense of urgency. There were multiple reasons, in fact, for why they had to fight back, so it was easy to get behind the characters and cheer them on. This series? Not so much.Opportunity for cancel: None. There was ample time that could have been spent on this instead of other areas of the series, such as all the focus on Kiryuu Nagisa vs. the executives.They\'re fighting for their jobs against a company that apparently wants them all gone.The worst case scenario for these characters seemed to be leaving the company that was actively trying to get rid of them.

Apparently, there was some motivational history behind this company, and the company had access to high-tech machinery, so the fight back may have been mainly reactionary, and not meant as a long-term solution.

The company tries to get rid of them, so they continue trying against the odds, and what happens at the end wraps everything up nicely.The romance is out of the blue.The romance that sprouts in this series was missing a lot of supporting scenes. Because of that lack of scenes, the romance just sort of happened suddenly, and I didn\'t feel anything on behalf of either of the characters regarding the romance.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series could have divided up its time to more effectively support events like this.Should-have-shot-them-when-you-had-the-chance.There\'s one scene near the end that was terribly unnecessary. It\'s a moderate spoiler, but it gets resolved unremarkably without any large impact on the plot, so I\'ll talk about it without mentioning specific characters. Person B is evil and is doing evil things. Person A and crew break in to stop the evil deeds. Person A has Person B cornered. Hooray. Person A is furious and is in a position to strike down Person B. However, Person A decides not to deliver the final blow, saying that the higher-ups will deal with Person B\'s punishment for doing evil things. Person A then runs off to stop the main evil deed, without binding Person B. Just. Leaves. Person B. There. Does nothing. Surely Person B won\'t run around and come for revenge. Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A. It\'s just sad. The series doesn\'t pull stunts like that for all the prior episodes, and then it just has to pull that near the end. Although good for another reason, the oddest part is that it doesn\'t largely effect the next episode, so I\'m not sure why ~that~ event was chosen by the writers.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series seems to be an original series.

What I expected to be a rocket mechanic slice of life veered into Dan Brown and John Grisham territory with corporate intrigue. There are a few plot holes in the story, but nothing so major that the story and character interactions more than make up for them with how well they are done.If you can get past the first four or five episodes and liked the politics/economy parts of Log Horizon, definitely check this anime out. ', ""This anime is amazing!Every episode turned out to be interesting and packed with excitment. The story moves on and develops constantly, and that is great!In just 13 episodes, things change and evolve so much, it is impossible not to get entertained.The animation quality is great, the characters are not annoying and none of them are a classic copy paste we see these days. They have their own story, passions and deep motivations.It evolves in a lot more than just a classroom of students.Overall a very good anime, it covers sci-fi,action,drama,psychological, political,romance, adventure and it does it in a consistent and excellently measured way.I'm...surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining! surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining!"", 'Classroom Crisis was only a small interest of mine, and when I read some reviews I was not expecting much from the show. I went in with no expectations and at first was really pleased with what I saw. Unfortunately what followed after the first couple of episodes was a roller coaster ride of lack of interest and anger. I do not often find myself thinking that a show didn\'t live up to its potential. We all can look back on something and see what we think could have been better, or what we might change. Those are just opinions and generally the story pans...out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that. out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario.

However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that.', ""Classroom Crisis is way too far from any mainstream anime that I've ever seen. The cute design of characters and colorful approach to artstyle could be misleading as to what the core story of the show really is about. This isn't about cool kids building rocket ships, school festivals or teen drama -- nope. CC is heavily leaning on political matters, hungry corporations, and the manipulations taking place behind the scenes. If this is too much for you, then you are definitely correct about not watching this anime.Classroom Crisis is, plainly put, about a group of bright students working as spaceship engineers, who are told...that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue. It's easier to track the main characters because of that, and relate to them more often than not.Giving this an 8 for great art, great storytelling, nice characters and overall a story well-thought out. Give this a thought if you're in for something more mature, but also light and not too nerve-wrecking to watch. that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship.

The first time, I rated the show a 10 and the second time I affirmed that I made no mistake in my score choice. I understand that this show's major appeals are not for everyone, but this show deserves more recognition as it is able to accomplish creating such a satisfying story in 13 episodes.Here are things I love about the show in no particular order:I love the main character, Nagisa Kiryu, and his development throughout the show. His character is so refreshing to see in the midst of every beta male MC that is common...in modern anime. I love the rest of the cast, and although I may forget about them more easily than others, the A-TEC team has a lovable family atmosphere that I enjoy.I love the OST, especially in hype moments, I find myself getting immersed and tapping my foot along with the catchy beat.I love the themes this anime covers, though not for everyone: Engineering, Politics, Business, Revenge, Self-discovery. Maruto Fumiaki, who had a great hand in the writing of this show, is my favourite writer in the industry and I feel like he's just getting started in his hopefully long career. I love the story because revenge, coming of age, teamwork, and goal-driven plotlines are what I yearn for the most. I love how, the story ends as it leaves on a good note, with major conflicts resolved and only leaving very minor things open for interpretation, possibly in hopes for a season 2.I will definitely rewatch this show again, as I do with all my 10s, in the near future. This show was a roller-coaster ride of emotions that I am always down to ride again. in modern anime.

I watched the first 3 or 4 episodes and I honestly thought it was pretty boring and I was about to drop it.Howevermy friend told me that the beginning is indeed a bit slow, but it's still worth to watch. So I kept watching.And he was right, I ended up actually enjoying it. Even though I'm not into political or spaceship stuff, they managed to make...it quite interesting.I'm a bit disappointed though, some characters had interesting backstories but they didn't really affect the character itself (looking at you, Nagisa)I wish there was more character development and more about the backstory.

At the forefront of this gigantic leap for humanity is the Kirishina Group, a Japanese conglomerate that is in no way related to the Buddhist deity. In order to maintain their competitive advantage, the company conducts research on rocket engines through the group A-tec, which happens to be composed of dependable high school students smart enough to be learning rocket science. However, their new transfer student may be troublesome, as he is also their new boss!Classroom Crisis, regardless of execution, is a differentiated attempt to mix political intrigue,...future fantasy, and your ordinary high school setting all in one. Though there are many holes in the setting and execution, it\'s an entertaining and plot-heavy work. So is it worth your valuable time? If you\'re looking for a harem, comedy, or deep political intrigue this is not a good match- it\'s too much of a chimera to satisfy any one of those categories. If you\'re just looking for a fresh idea and an interesting story, I\'d try a few episodes and see if it\'s a fit.Animation:This is the first work that I\'ve seen from the relatively new studio Lay-duce, and to be honest I\'m not too thrilled. Though the show looks modern and crisp, it definitely isn\'t a high budget show; I had many gripes about the animation in general. Character lines and backgrounds are all very stingy and plain, and I don\'t particularly like the styling of the vehicles or mechs either. Furthermore, despite taking place on a colony in Mars, you\'d soon forget that it wasn\'t Earth if not for the occasional space scenes. Really, the only innovative contribution is the nice, flat UIs on the screens throughout the show Animation doesn\'t fare too well for character designs either, expect a plethora of similar-looking supporting characters. Emotions aren\'t particularly keen either as our transfer student has fewer expressions than there are fingers on my hand. Mizuki, one of our heroines, helps alleviate his lack of humanity but only slightly.Surprisingly enough, there are a few attempts to cast the show in a dark aura with some violence and blood. However, just like the introduction sequence where they interleave a company crisis with Mizuki happily putting on her clothes, there just isn\'t a consistent feeling in the atmosphere. Expect a few decent action sequences, though nothing to really get excited over. Also surprisingly enough, there is more character relationship progress here than in many harems, and you\'ll get a few kissing scenes. This isn\'t an ecchi show though so expect some relatively conservative camera angles.Sound:Contrary to the animation, the sound experience is good. The show opens with a fast-paced, pop piece with a palatable melody. The ED though is in a class of its own. The electro-infused song by Claris, famous in my mind for their work on Oreimo, is an extremely catchy and melodic work. The funk-based BGM is slightly above average also with brass infused instrumentation.The VA cast does a pretty good job overall though certain lead roles are given to relatively junior seiyuus. Though supposedly a supporting character, Yuu Kobayashi gives the standout performance (and occasional comedic relief) as super accountant Angelina. There are some up and coming VAs as well such as Sora Amamiya, but in this case she\'s relegated to a rather boring role. If you\'re a Yui Horie fan, I wouldn\'t watch this just for her as her role has no more than a scant dozen or so lines.Story:The story is really the melding of two different plots. On the one hand, A-tec is being phased out as Krishima supposedly is attempting to reorganize and diversify its business. Thus, we see a classroom setting in crisis as the students and teacher struggle to cope with budget cuts (but really, is giving high school students billions of dollars really a good idea?) and tease out every possible idea to keep the group together. On the other hand is a rising star in the form of our transfer student. Nagisa, typically a girl\'s name if you\'re not too used to Japanese names, is just a magnet for crises be it kidnappings or attempts at political manipulations. As he becomes a student of A-tec, despite not having mastered quantum physics, as well as the boss in charge of A-tec, the members of A-tec are essentially forced to take part in his life\'s dramas.The show follows the two plots in parallel as they become more intertwined and eventually merge before the climax. Though there is one eventual climax, multiple crises throughout the show. The show then finishes off with an open ended conclusion that leaves the possibility for a follow up.The overall experience comes across as somewhat mixed. Let\'s start with the positives. I liked that the show was unique (yes I know there\'s a transfer student and yes the school setting is overused) in its attempt to combine business, politics, and school life. The overall progression was a bit bumpy but the many plot twists kept my interest level fairly high throughout the show. I also liked that the show wasn\'t centered around a harem, something way too overused these days.There were quite a few annoyances with the story as well though. Despite being labeled as a show about rocket engines, I don\'t think the story writers were anywhere near qualified enough for the subject. For instance, a ""clean"" school hangar and a NASA clean room are worlds apart. Furthermore, the concept of ""maximum speed"" is meaningless assuming you have a constant source of acceleration in space. Technical competence aside, the story also reused plot elements repeatedly; the most of annoying of which is that characters don\'t seem to learn. More than once do we see the same character fail to finish off an opponent, only to have that come back to haunt them. Finally, the show just never settles on a mood, is it a happy show about kids enjoying their youth or a dark, somber work about the struggles of a ridiculed family outcast?Character:Unfortunately, I can\'t really reward that many points in this section either. The protagonist, Nagisa, is just pitiful, both in his past and in personality. Though distinguished from the majority of nice harem leads, he feels very one-sided in his personality and goals. This makes it feel out of place when he faces defeat or in his rather sudden feelings for other characters. Despite being a supposedly dynamic character, he just isn\'t relatable or likable. From the start, you pretty much can discern that Mizuki and Iris will be important characters. Mizuki is by far the more likable of the two as Iris is just your typical emotionless sidekick with occasional crazy spasms. Though I liked that there was relationship progress in the show, it did not feel organic at all and was rather rushed. In addition, let\'s not get me started on supporting characters; you could eliminate over half the characters and accomplish the same experience, and possibly actually give Mizuki and Sera some character exposition.Value:This is an oddball of a show. Despite technically subpar scores in the other categories, it was actually a very enjoyable watch. In the context of a rather mixed bag of a season for me, this show comes out as one of the more distinguished ones. It isn\'t complicated enough to merit re-watching, and isn\'t good enough to be memorable in the long run.

I think they lacked at introducing the story in the first 3 episodes. Somehow, it was boring from the start. After the third episode, it started to become interesting. The twist, the unpredictable events, the emotional moments, and I guess the comedy moments as well. It was all interesting, but I guess I can say it\'s fine. It may not be the...best, but I am sure that it is not the worst though it is interesting.The anime ended with a good ending, but I hope there was more episode so we can look at what happened to Iris Shirasaki (a.k.a. the real Nagisa Shinamiya) and the love triangle between Iris, Mizaki, and Nagisa.Also, the Sci-Fi was also interesting.

On the one hand, they wrapped up the stories the series was focusing on, but on the other hand it felt like it was trying to weave more that it wanted to finish in a follow-up.The premise is a hard to break down. Set in the future on a Mars city, a class set up to design rocket engines is assigned a new transfer student/manager to oversee their work. The school is under the authority of a larger corporation which make them employees. The business also...has some officiations in politics which is less looked upon than the other factors but plays a role in the drama that pushes the story. Overall, these storylines are mostly completed by the end. There is mention of a higher figure in the business that we never see and by the end is briefly mentioned in a way that (like a great deal of series) sets him up as the next boss for the next season. It's a minor annoyance but given the focus of this season is fine.The real problem is a lot of character stories. While a good deal of them are fleshed out, there are some that feel left hanging, especially the romance that ends with a love triangle. That might be the biggest detractor for some, especially those going in for that romance element. It's there but not pulled out enough.In a way, the series feels very fast & very crammed like the director wanted it to be longer.

Interesting space-age setting with heavy political overtones.There were just a few hiccups for me:The romance was contrived and devalued some of the characters, though perhaps it's just personal preference.The story could have been more detailed overall; perhaps more worldbuilding, character backgrounds and development, and more explanation for each of the happenings. It may have made the romance worthwhile.Wish it had a mature feeling, but at least you get the feeling that the young adults/children are young adults/children. "", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.THIS SHOW IS WORTH WATCHING. YES IT STARTS SLOW, DEAL WITH IT. GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.DO NOT JUDGE THE SHOW UNTIL YOU\'VE FINISHED IT. Seriously, so many people dropped it early and missed out on arguably one of the better shows of the 2015 Fall season.STORY (9): It starts off slow and kinda generic. You\'ve seen it before, the big bad greedy corporation wants to cut funding for the hardworking dedicated student team finishes their big project. Corporate representative is sent to be evil and shut them down. Snore.Except that\'s...now what the story is about. The classroom is just a single plot point to carry the show onto the next event, as it starts to pull the camera back to show what\'s going on with the behind the scenes. It evolves into a corporate and political drama where alliances are formed behind closed doors and plans are carefully laid to move everyone into positions. The story may be about kids building rocketships, but the show is a much more grand scale.Then you get gut punched by the intense moments, when the trap cards are activated or the action kicks off. It\'s just at the right level that you stay intrigued during the ""slower"" parts.Art/Sound (8): It looks and sounds good. I\'m not really going to go in depth on it because I don\'t know what else to say. The animation is smooth, the art is well done, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the effects are nice. There aren\'t any out of place sounds and the OP/ED are nice.Character (8): This is where a lot of people get confused. ""Why are there so many characters, who\'s the main character, why aren\'t these people getting more attention?"" Whoa there speedy, calm yourself down. There isn\'t what I consider a single ""main"" character, it\'s more like two primary characters, two secondary, and the supporting characters.Kaito is the MC of the classroom side, while Nagisa is the MC of the corporate side. Both are important, and there\'s a solid overlap between them to where it never feels like one is taking the spotlight from the other. Iris and Mizuki both get good development and fill their rolls nicely. I\'ll warn that if you hate amnesiac characters with a burning passion it might take a little away, but it\'s not a critical plot point to the overall story. The other students do what they need to and don\'t get in the way.Romance is implied (and shown) but not plot critical, just enough to get you intrigued but not so much that it detracts from the story.Enjoyment (9): Honestly, it\'s one of the better shows this season. Once the plot got underway I was addicted. The pacing was excellent, the excitement was real, and it ends almost perfectly. All important plot points are wrapped up nicely, though there\'s just enough hooks that a second season can latch on to.Overall (9): I\'ll admit I\'m rating it a point higher than it probably deserves, but I really wanted to counter all the negative reviews. Classroom Crisis is a very well done original work that absolutely needs more attention that it got. The slow start really hurt viewership and I feel it\'s unfair considering just how good the show ended up being. Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise. now what the story is about.

Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise.', 'Without giving too much away about my personal life, I work in IT. My job involves tinkering with technology that helps improve people’s lives in ways they didn’t know they were being helped whilst never getting the recognition involved with being involved. Whilst I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to what’s current or how it’s implemented or how to use Linux for everyday life, I do know that this is a tough career path and even getting started can be a big pain. Interviews suck, especially when you pass many of them only to fail at the final stretch. The learning process is...worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity. worse than Dark Soul’s.

This anime seems to be underrated which I totally understand, however, it's a great watch once you get into it.First thing first don't be deterred by the first episodes. It introduce a lot of characters right at the episode 1, and give the setting in the form of a documentary. Honestly, it's quite boring, listening to a off voice telling us about the company, giving a short presentation of every students and other details about the universe. The way everything is introduced is bad and it's...understandable that people would stop at this point. However, once you get past that, you find a captivating anime about corporation war while you may think with the opening that it's about space ships races.Story : 9The plot resolves around an elite classroom in space engine development which is about to be downsized since it brings no results for their alloted budget. A student is transferred in the class as a boss in other to do the downsizing but the story turn after a few episodes into political schemes, family conflicts, hidden past and romance. Overall, there are a lot of turnabout and cliffhanger which keeps make you want for more.Art and Sound : GoodNothing especially remarkable in the art. The characters designs are ok and the animation isn't bad. The spaceship aren't too flashy. It's agreeable to watch and I don't see bad points.The soundtrack on the other end is very good. The opening by Lay Duce is catchy and quite enjoyable, and the ending by Claris is also good. The OST fit in the situations and are pleasants to listen. I usually don't remember the OST but this one caught my ear. The studio even let you enjoy it by using it in scenes without dialogues.Characters : 9The protagonists are well developed, with some interesting revelations and changes in their attitude and conduct as the story progress. The others students in the classroom don't have this opportunity but aren't bad. The antagonists are quite good, with a raging psychopath who only ask to be hated (he fulfills his role at least) and a calm and calculating one.Enjoyment : 10I enjoyed it very much, the numerous turnabout and the character development keep you on your toes. You may need to pay attention to understand some corporates and political schemes but in the end, the episode is over before you know it.Overall : 9Yes, this anime is not flawless. Yes, it won't appeal to you if you're not interested in a corporation's interior conflict. I'm probably biased by giving it a 9 when I found the first 2 episodes quite average but this show how much the rest is captivating. It won't fit everyone's taste but I hope that you will give this anime a chance because I loved it.Worth mentionning : Some people may be turned off right away just by seeing Maruto Fumiaki in the composition, author of the very controversed Saekano. Well, I'm one of those who didn't like Saekano one bit, but I watched this anime without prejudice and it was a good watch in the end. understandable that people would stop at this point.

Since apparently, high school is end all be all for any person\'s life, it\'s only fitting to spawn hundreds of them in order to formulate a genre.  To add to this bunch, we have Classroom Crisis, a show about a bunch of stupid but apparently smart kids in a high school-like anime.  And boy, is this one in crisis.Story: In the far-off future where humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system (yes, even gas giants apparently), Classroom Crisis takes...place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.  Here, we have the specialty class known as A-TEC, a small class of incredibly smart high schoolers who are basically smaller, less mature engineers and business people who work for the large corporation .  (Without pay, of course.)  After a near impossible rescue attempt for the new transfer student of the class, A-TEC comes to terms with the fact that due to their wastefulness of their annual budget, that in about six months, their entire class will be disbanded.  And that folks, is the crisis for this series.The story of Classroom Crisis is a Crisis in and of itself; identity crisis, to be more precise.  While the show starts out with a bunch of high schoolers fighting for their right to stay in class (even though it was CLEARLY their own fault for putting themselves into this mess by overspending), Classroom Crisis tries to drag the reader through a story involving the ins and outs of a corrupted business, covering up different schemes, politics (for some god unknown reason), and with just a hint of both romance and attempted murder.  As a result of all of these factors going around, the show tosses the viewer around with the flow of the plot, sometimes dragging you to a place where you don\'t know what the hell is going on.At the same time with all of these seemingly random plot points going on, Classroom Crisis tries to squeeze in character development which both feels rushed and sometimes completely unnecessary.  Remember that romance bit I mentioned earlier?  For some reason, they sprinkle that in at the end without any indication as how or why any of that came to be.  In addition, the show really doesn\'t actually focus on its base storyline of A-TEC struggle for existence, mostly focusing on the characters that actually aren\'t part of A-TEC, aka the weird power struggle that created such a mess of a series.In end end, Classroom Crisis\'s story was a horrendous piece to watch.  Not only did it not follow to the letter on what it wanted to do, but it also pulled itself in directions that made not only made for a dreadful watching experience, but it also made character importance varied as to who was important and who wasn\'t, to the point that I personally could care less what was going on since there really isn\'t any way that you can get a sense as to what is really going on with the people in this series.  Plus, that ending was kind of random, to be honest.Overview:-  Generic base idea  (High school show, really?)-  Shifting story that changed what it wanted to focus-  Random bits of unnecessary detail  (Seriously, why is there any semblance of romance here?!)-   Artificial character development  (just seemed kind of forced rather than natural)-   Random endingCharacters:  Characters in Classroom Crisis aren\'t really characters, per say.  Many of them are simply plot devices, or are completely forgotten halfway through because the story shifts in a way that those characters simply become irrelevant after a time.  So, I will attempt to pick out the ones that I assume are the true main characters in the series.First is Sera Kaito, the teacher of the class of A-TEC.  As an employee of the Kirishina corporation, Kaito is a very smart person when it comes to engineering, but comes a bit short in every aspect.  He\'s sort of the newbie in the whole scheme of business characters since he is very absent minded about how business practices work, and as such gets very flustered.  Still though, he\'s a very motivated character that works towards his goal of ""saving A-TEC"", but in the end, there\'s not really much to his character.  He doesn\'t change at all in this series and frankly, sort of just derps around half the time due to the various situations that pop up around the whole series.And then we have Kiryu Nagisa.  As the transfer student of A-TEC and the resident douchebag of the series, Nagisa is a very focused and slightly narcissistic individual who puts his mission first above anything else.  His personality is one that you love to hate.  Because he just barrels into the series and just well, does his job as someone who looks out for the company since A-TEC is really just a waste of time and money.  He is gradually shown to be the ""good guy"" of the series but really, there\'s nothing substantial about him.  As a character, he artificially changes to the point where he is considered to be a protagonist rather than an antagonist, but at that point, there\'s nothing about him to even care about.Everyone else in this series are just plot devices.  The entire group of A-TEC students barely get any role aside from supporting roles in the series, and since the entire show is devoted to the less than average story, any other character in the series really doesn\'t have much significance aside from this character playing this and having this role, and that character being that because he\'s this and his basic goal is this.  No one is really past a cardboard cutout of a character and there\'s no point of knowing who they are because no one is really all that memorable.Overview:-  Less than average cast-  Character development didn\'t make sense-  Entire cast were basically plot devicesArt: Contrary to the story and characters, the art for Classroom Crisis was decent.  While the characters themselves weren\'t detailed to the extent of being gloriously animated, the backgrounds and the level of detail in certain things like the rockets were relatively well animated.  But honestly, that\'s as much as I can say for the artwork.  It was pretty standard all the way through and there really wasn\'t much to say about it.Sound: As for the soundtrack, the OP and ED of the series really didn\'t have much to add to the series.  Out of every track, the OP was probably the best with its heroic sounding tone to it, but it really wasn\'t all that memorable.  Same thing goes for the rest of the track.  Like the artwork, it\'s good, but not memorable.Personal Enjoyment: When I first say Classroom Crisis, I thought that this might be quaint little series about a small group of kids or something, but I was dead wrong.  OH, so wrong.  It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.

So i went to MAL and naturally i saw bad/mediocre reviews about it.  this got me to be really scared, since i didnt want to watch a anime that would eat away my brain cells, but boy, am i glad that i didnt drop it, so lets get to the actual review.Story: 7 (MAL rating), 7.5 (my rating)to be honest, along with some people, i found the introduction...to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too. Not much to say here, other than me writhing on the floor. dang that music is great.Character: 7As an anime with decent plot and a generous 13 episode limit, i wished they would elaborate on the other A-TEC members. They elaborated a good portion of Mizuki, Iris and Nagisa to a point where i loved all 3 of them, so its all good. It was too be expected though, since they were the main characters. But still.Enjoyment: 8it wouldve gotten a 9 for me if the intro was a bit better. But the rest of the anime got really interesting, so im giving it a 8.Overall: 8Sometimes people dont look at the animes that isnt a sequel like Non Non Biyori, WORKING!!! or adaptations such as God Eater, or manga adaptations such as Gakkou Gurashi. Classroom Crisis gets overshadowed by all these big anime titles, but i encourage you. Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed. to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh.

It seems like that will be the trend for the whole series, which would make it a rather simple, ""done-before"" anime.However, even from the very first scene, the writers slowly began to change the trajectory of the story. Bits and pieces and hints are strategically placed and begin to grow: corporate intrigue; complex backstories; mysteries and secrets; hidden parts of...character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction. With a well-placed twist and glimpses at deeper characterization, the show is brought to a good climax and ends on a hopeful note for a second season.It should be noted that this is very happily free of a lot of over-used and aggravating tropes. Nowhere do we see some of the romance tropes that make the reader sigh of disappointment, nor do we have horribly annoying characters. Even the presence of some tropes are used for humor, and work well enough.While this isn\'t an incredible masterpiece, it certainly is a good show. I give it 9/10 for the sake of being a show I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and hope eagerly for a second season.Story: 9/10. The twists were well-placed and the plot flowed in an interesting manner. Some might think the beginning lags, but I actually find the contrast of the beginning episodes with where it goes as one of the better points of the show. I like the surprise and slow sinking feeling you get as the show progresses from slice-of-life to something deeper.Art: 9/10. I enjoy the art. The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment. I don\'t have any tracks that especially stick with me, but they fit the mood well.Character: 10/10. For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10.

A very good show.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Every year, my family and I go to the cottage we have up north. We ride on the pontoon, we go to the local ice cream store, and we sit around the campfire making s’mores. These separate events are fun, but what makes them so awesome is getting to spend them with my family.I remember one night when Craig, a cousin of mine, brought a telescope with him. It was a clear night, allowing the stars to brightly shine against the dark backdrop. He had been practicing viewing objects in outer space, and, by that...point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10 point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most.

Not a lot of praise, but a bit of praise. Thing is, Classroom Crisis is bad. It\'s objectively not good. I can understand why people could like this, but at the same time, I can\'t.Story: 2Classroom Crisis gives an abysmal attempt at crafting its story. From the beginning, we are confronted with a conflict. Good, plots need a conflict. Couple more episodes, though, and we begin seeing more and more problems arise. There are so many different conflicts and so many different plotlines, it just becomes difficult to keep track of.There is a...main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end. There\'s also a bunch of different villains, with practically no motivation, and no real contribution to the plot.While the ending, without any spoilers, was an alright conclusion in itself, it was cliche and out of place. Classroom Crisis, which should be more aptly named Classroom Crises, was simply a mess in its storytelling.Art + Sound: 7I\'m not stickler for art and sound. I don\'t particularly listen for insert songs or background music, nor do I search for inconsistencies or mistakes in the art. TrySail\'s OP is actually great, in my opinion, and the art is pretty, to say the least. But there\'s nothing special about either.Character: 3The people in the Kirishina Corporation are so normal. Classroom Crisis is filled with such cookie-cutter cliche characters that I can\'t even name them all, but I\'ll name a few notables: Sera Kaito (energetic, somewhat-absent-minded ""mature"" one), Sera Mizuki (also energetic, happy-go-lucky teen girl), Shirasaki Iris (quiet, tough dandere who\'d do anything for her friend), Kiryuu Nagisa (evil-for-no-reason, first villain-turned-anti-hero), Angelina-sensei (tough assistant teacher who has a mysterious past (seriously? why? it\'s never explained)), Kiryuu Yuuji (Nagisa\'s boss and brother, second villain, no motivation), Kiryuu Kazuhisa (main villain, still no real motivation).The rest of the characters can be written off. The only ones I ever really took note of were Nagisa, because you kinda have to, Iris, because I love my stoic danderes, Mizuki, because she has so much presence (also the tiny hint of yuri, that ended up being destroyed), and some student who I couldn\'t tell if they were a boy, a girl, or neither.Anyways, the characters suck. A few of them do have some development, but most are left to gather dust.Enjoyment: 2I did not enjoy Classroom Crisis. It was too hard to want to follow, there is just nothing to grasp onto with it. It\'s just terrible.Overall: 4Classroom Crisis was bad. The attempt at character development, decent ending, and a somewhat traceable plot kept it floating just under mediocre. Classroom Crisis isn\'t good, and I don\'t understand why it gets the praise that it does. On the flipside, Classroom Crisis isn\'t the worst anime ever released. I guess. Please, do not make a second season. I do not want more of this. I don\'t care about the Kiryuu\'s father. main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us.

Only towards the end did we get some interesting development with our resident anti-hero/anti-villain (he swayed back and forth for a while) essentially finding out that he was a kagemusha for one of the other students, but that didn\'t even get revealed properly at the end to the other characters, so it was a bit of a waste of a plot point for so few of the characters to even find out about it.***************SPOILER WARNING OVER************************With that said, if I weren\'t forced to watch it for TLC purposes, I would have dropped this show quicker than a hot frying pan.

This series is similar to Amagi Brilliant Park in format, and in that series, there was a very well demonstrated sense of urgency.

Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A.

What I expected to be a rocket mechanic slice of life veered into Dan Brown and John Grisham territory with corporate intrigue. There are a few plot holes in the story, but nothing so major that the story and character interactions more than make up for them with how well they are done.If you can get past the first four or five episodes and liked the politics/economy parts of Log Horizon, definitely check this anime out. ', ""This anime is amazing!Every episode turned out to be interesting and packed with excitment. The story moves on and develops constantly, and that is great!In just 13 episodes, things change and evolve so much, it is impossible not to get entertained.The animation quality is great, the characters are not annoying and none of them are a classic copy paste we see these days. They have their own story, passions and deep motivations.It evolves in a lot more than just a classroom of students.Overall a very good anime, it covers sci-fi,action,drama,psychological, political,romance, adventure and it does it in a consistent and excellently measured way.I'm...surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining! surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining!"", 'Classroom Crisis was only a small interest of mine, and when I read some reviews I was not expecting much from the show. I went in with no expectations and at first was really pleased with what I saw. Unfortunately what followed after the first couple of episodes was a roller coaster ride of lack of interest and anger. I do not often find myself thinking that a show didn\'t live up to its potential. We all can look back on something and see what we think could have been better, or what we might change. Those are just opinions and generally the story pans...out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that. out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions.

This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that.', ""Classroom Crisis is way too far from any mainstream anime that I've ever seen. The cute design of characters and colorful approach to artstyle could be misleading as to what the core story of the show really is about. This isn't about cool kids building rocket ships, school festivals or teen drama -- nope. CC is heavily leaning on political matters, hungry corporations, and the manipulations taking place behind the scenes. If this is too much for you, then you are definitely correct about not watching this anime.Classroom Crisis is, plainly put, about a group of bright students working as spaceship engineers, who are told...that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue. It's easier to track the main characters because of that, and relate to them more often than not.Giving this an 8 for great art, great storytelling, nice characters and overall a story well-thought out. Give this a thought if you're in for something more mature, but also light and not too nerve-wrecking to watch. that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue.

You should watch it to refresh your mind.-Realist and logical male lead. Some typical anime have nerd, otaku, unrealist, talkaktive, and passive male lead character. But, in this series, the MC has strong personality, ambitious, and mature mind set. (It\'s like Shiba Tatsuya mix Hachiman)-YOU SEARCH FOR RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT. There\'s no romance genre in this series, but from what I saw, there\'s a minor romance between MC and heroines. Yes, add ""s"", because there\'s 2 possible lover for MC, and those two was...best friend. The MC not a bastard guy who not sensitive with romance, he handles those 2 fairly, so they dont break their friendship because of a guy.-Serious conflict, but carefree characters. Many conflicts in this series choose serious ways, but almost all characters handle those conflict with smile, trust, and working together to overcome troubles.That\'s all the reason why you must watch this series.

The first time, I rated the show a 10 and the second time I affirmed that I made no mistake in my score choice. I understand that this show's major appeals are not for everyone, but this show deserves more recognition as it is able to accomplish creating such a satisfying story in 13 episodes.Here are things I love about the show in no particular order:I love the main character, Nagisa Kiryu, and his development throughout the show. His character is so refreshing to see in the midst of every beta male MC that is common...in modern anime. I love the rest of the cast, and although I may forget about them more easily than others, the A-TEC team has a lovable family atmosphere that I enjoy.I love the OST, especially in hype moments, I find myself getting immersed and tapping my foot along with the catchy beat.I love the themes this anime covers, though not for everyone: Engineering, Politics, Business, Revenge, Self-discovery. Maruto Fumiaki, who had a great hand in the writing of this show, is my favourite writer in the industry and I feel like he's just getting started in his hopefully long career. I love the story because revenge, coming of age, teamwork, and goal-driven plotlines are what I yearn for the most. I love how, the story ends as it leaves on a good note, with major conflicts resolved and only leaving very minor things open for interpretation, possibly in hopes for a season 2.I will definitely rewatch this show again, as I do with all my 10s, in the near future. This show was a roller-coaster ride of emotions that I am always down to ride again. in modern anime.

Interesting space-age setting with heavy political overtones.There were just a few hiccups for me:The romance was contrived and devalued some of the characters, though perhaps it's just personal preference.The story could have been more detailed overall; perhaps more worldbuilding, character backgrounds and development, and more explanation for each of the happenings. It may have made the romance worthwhile.Wish it had a mature feeling, but at least you get the feeling that the young adults/children are young adults/children. "", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.THIS SHOW IS WORTH WATCHING. YES IT STARTS SLOW, DEAL WITH IT. GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.DO NOT JUDGE THE SHOW UNTIL YOU\'VE FINISHED IT. Seriously, so many people dropped it early and missed out on arguably one of the better shows of the 2015 Fall season.STORY (9): It starts off slow and kinda generic. You\'ve seen it before, the big bad greedy corporation wants to cut funding for the hardworking dedicated student team finishes their big project. Corporate representative is sent to be evil and shut them down. Snore.Except that\'s...now what the story is about. The classroom is just a single plot point to carry the show onto the next event, as it starts to pull the camera back to show what\'s going on with the behind the scenes. It evolves into a corporate and political drama where alliances are formed behind closed doors and plans are carefully laid to move everyone into positions. The story may be about kids building rocketships, but the show is a much more grand scale.Then you get gut punched by the intense moments, when the trap cards are activated or the action kicks off. It\'s just at the right level that you stay intrigued during the ""slower"" parts.Art/Sound (8): It looks and sounds good. I\'m not really going to go in depth on it because I don\'t know what else to say. The animation is smooth, the art is well done, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the effects are nice. There aren\'t any out of place sounds and the OP/ED are nice.Character (8): This is where a lot of people get confused. ""Why are there so many characters, who\'s the main character, why aren\'t these people getting more attention?"" Whoa there speedy, calm yourself down. There isn\'t what I consider a single ""main"" character, it\'s more like two primary characters, two secondary, and the supporting characters.Kaito is the MC of the classroom side, while Nagisa is the MC of the corporate side. Both are important, and there\'s a solid overlap between them to where it never feels like one is taking the spotlight from the other. Iris and Mizuki both get good development and fill their rolls nicely. I\'ll warn that if you hate amnesiac characters with a burning passion it might take a little away, but it\'s not a critical plot point to the overall story. The other students do what they need to and don\'t get in the way.Romance is implied (and shown) but not plot critical, just enough to get you intrigued but not so much that it detracts from the story.Enjoyment (9): Honestly, it\'s one of the better shows this season. Once the plot got underway I was addicted. The pacing was excellent, the excitement was real, and it ends almost perfectly. All important plot points are wrapped up nicely, though there\'s just enough hooks that a second season can latch on to.Overall (9): I\'ll admit I\'m rating it a point higher than it probably deserves, but I really wanted to counter all the negative reviews. Classroom Crisis is a very well done original work that absolutely needs more attention that it got. The slow start really hurt viewership and I feel it\'s unfair considering just how good the show ended up being. Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise. now what the story is about.

Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise.', 'Without giving too much away about my personal life, I work in IT. My job involves tinkering with technology that helps improve people’s lives in ways they didn’t know they were being helped whilst never getting the recognition involved with being involved. Whilst I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to what’s current or how it’s implemented or how to use Linux for everyday life, I do know that this is a tough career path and even getting started can be a big pain. Interviews suck, especially when you pass many of them only to fail at the final stretch. The learning process is...worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity. worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life.

Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity.', ""This is my first review and I'll just write it to incite some more people to watch this show. This anime seems to be underrated which I totally understand, however, it's a great watch once you get into it.First thing first don't be deterred by the first episodes. It introduce a lot of characters right at the episode 1, and give the setting in the form of a documentary. Honestly, it's quite boring, listening to a off voice telling us about the company, giving a short presentation of every students and other details about the universe. The way everything is introduced is bad and it's...understandable that people would stop at this point. However, once you get past that, you find a captivating anime about corporation war while you may think with the opening that it's about space ships races.Story : 9The plot resolves around an elite classroom in space engine development which is about to be downsized since it brings no results for their alloted budget. A student is transferred in the class as a boss in other to do the downsizing but the story turn after a few episodes into political schemes, family conflicts, hidden past and romance. Overall, there are a lot of turnabout and cliffhanger which keeps make you want for more.Art and Sound : GoodNothing especially remarkable in the art. The characters designs are ok and the animation isn't bad. The spaceship aren't too flashy. It's agreeable to watch and I don't see bad points.The soundtrack on the other end is very good. The opening by Lay Duce is catchy and quite enjoyable, and the ending by Claris is also good. The OST fit in the situations and are pleasants to listen. I usually don't remember the OST but this one caught my ear. The studio even let you enjoy it by using it in scenes without dialogues.Characters : 9The protagonists are well developed, with some interesting revelations and changes in their attitude and conduct as the story progress. The others students in the classroom don't have this opportunity but aren't bad. The antagonists are quite good, with a raging psychopath who only ask to be hated (he fulfills his role at least) and a calm and calculating one.Enjoyment : 10I enjoyed it very much, the numerous turnabout and the character development keep you on your toes. You may need to pay attention to understand some corporates and political schemes but in the end, the episode is over before you know it.Overall : 9Yes, this anime is not flawless. Yes, it won't appeal to you if you're not interested in a corporation's interior conflict. I'm probably biased by giving it a 9 when I found the first 2 episodes quite average but this show how much the rest is captivating. It won't fit everyone's taste but I hope that you will give this anime a chance because I loved it.Worth mentionning : Some people may be turned off right away just by seeing Maruto Fumiaki in the composition, author of the very controversed Saekano. Well, I'm one of those who didn't like Saekano one bit, but I watched this anime without prejudice and it was a good watch in the end. understandable that people would stop at this point.

Since apparently, high school is end all be all for any person\'s life, it\'s only fitting to spawn hundreds of them in order to formulate a genre.  To add to this bunch, we have Classroom Crisis, a show about a bunch of stupid but apparently smart kids in a high school-like anime.  And boy, is this one in crisis.Story: In the far-off future where humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system (yes, even gas giants apparently), Classroom Crisis takes...place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.  Here, we have the specialty class known as A-TEC, a small class of incredibly smart high schoolers who are basically smaller, less mature engineers and business people who work for the large corporation .  (Without pay, of course.)  After a near impossible rescue attempt for the new transfer student of the class, A-TEC comes to terms with the fact that due to their wastefulness of their annual budget, that in about six months, their entire class will be disbanded.  And that folks, is the crisis for this series.The story of Classroom Crisis is a Crisis in and of itself; identity crisis, to be more precise.  While the show starts out with a bunch of high schoolers fighting for their right to stay in class (even though it was CLEARLY their own fault for putting themselves into this mess by overspending), Classroom Crisis tries to drag the reader through a story involving the ins and outs of a corrupted business, covering up different schemes, politics (for some god unknown reason), and with just a hint of both romance and attempted murder.  As a result of all of these factors going around, the show tosses the viewer around with the flow of the plot, sometimes dragging you to a place where you don\'t know what the hell is going on.At the same time with all of these seemingly random plot points going on, Classroom Crisis tries to squeeze in character development which both feels rushed and sometimes completely unnecessary.  Remember that romance bit I mentioned earlier?  For some reason, they sprinkle that in at the end without any indication as how or why any of that came to be.  In addition, the show really doesn\'t actually focus on its base storyline of A-TEC struggle for existence, mostly focusing on the characters that actually aren\'t part of A-TEC, aka the weird power struggle that created such a mess of a series.In end end, Classroom Crisis\'s story was a horrendous piece to watch.  Not only did it not follow to the letter on what it wanted to do, but it also pulled itself in directions that made not only made for a dreadful watching experience, but it also made character importance varied as to who was important and who wasn\'t, to the point that I personally could care less what was going on since there really isn\'t any way that you can get a sense as to what is really going on with the people in this series.  Plus, that ending was kind of random, to be honest.Overview:-  Generic base idea  (High school show, really?)-  Shifting story that changed what it wanted to focus-  Random bits of unnecessary detail  (Seriously, why is there any semblance of romance here?!)-   Artificial character development  (just seemed kind of forced rather than natural)-   Random endingCharacters:  Characters in Classroom Crisis aren\'t really characters, per say.  Many of them are simply plot devices, or are completely forgotten halfway through because the story shifts in a way that those characters simply become irrelevant after a time.  So, I will attempt to pick out the ones that I assume are the true main characters in the series.First is Sera Kaito, the teacher of the class of A-TEC.  As an employee of the Kirishina corporation, Kaito is a very smart person when it comes to engineering, but comes a bit short in every aspect.  He\'s sort of the newbie in the whole scheme of business characters since he is very absent minded about how business practices work, and as such gets very flustered.  Still though, he\'s a very motivated character that works towards his goal of ""saving A-TEC"", but in the end, there\'s not really much to his character.  He doesn\'t change at all in this series and frankly, sort of just derps around half the time due to the various situations that pop up around the whole series.And then we have Kiryu Nagisa.  As the transfer student of A-TEC and the resident douchebag of the series, Nagisa is a very focused and slightly narcissistic individual who puts his mission first above anything else.  His personality is one that you love to hate.  Because he just barrels into the series and just well, does his job as someone who looks out for the company since A-TEC is really just a waste of time and money.  He is gradually shown to be the ""good guy"" of the series but really, there\'s nothing substantial about him.  As a character, he artificially changes to the point where he is considered to be a protagonist rather than an antagonist, but at that point, there\'s nothing about him to even care about.Everyone else in this series are just plot devices.  The entire group of A-TEC students barely get any role aside from supporting roles in the series, and since the entire show is devoted to the less than average story, any other character in the series really doesn\'t have much significance aside from this character playing this and having this role, and that character being that because he\'s this and his basic goal is this.  No one is really past a cardboard cutout of a character and there\'s no point of knowing who they are because no one is really all that memorable.Overview:-  Less than average cast-  Character development didn\'t make sense-  Entire cast were basically plot devicesArt: Contrary to the story and characters, the art for Classroom Crisis was decent.  While the characters themselves weren\'t detailed to the extent of being gloriously animated, the backgrounds and the level of detail in certain things like the rockets were relatively well animated.  But honestly, that\'s as much as I can say for the artwork.  It was pretty standard all the way through and there really wasn\'t much to say about it.Sound: As for the soundtrack, the OP and ED of the series really didn\'t have much to add to the series.  Out of every track, the OP was probably the best with its heroic sounding tone to it, but it really wasn\'t all that memorable.  Same thing goes for the rest of the track.  Like the artwork, it\'s good, but not memorable.Personal Enjoyment: When I first say Classroom Crisis, I thought that this might be quaint little series about a small group of kids or something, but I was dead wrong.  OH, so wrong.  It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.

For all haters/fans this is just my opinion and you can think what you want don't be mad and write your own review if you want to critic an anime.[Story 9/10]CC Project contains a simple story to understand, a group of students / workers in a company in the future where manufactured rockets.A-tec is the name of the group which tried to carry out his last project and show it to the  company to stay or leave.

So i went to MAL and naturally i saw bad/mediocre reviews about it.  this got me to be really scared, since i didnt want to watch a anime that would eat away my brain cells, but boy, am i glad that i didnt drop it, so lets get to the actual review.Story: 7 (MAL rating), 7.5 (my rating)to be honest, along with some people, i found the introduction...to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too. Not much to say here, other than me writhing on the floor. dang that music is great.Character: 7As an anime with decent plot and a generous 13 episode limit, i wished they would elaborate on the other A-TEC members. They elaborated a good portion of Mizuki, Iris and Nagisa to a point where i loved all 3 of them, so its all good. It was too be expected though, since they were the main characters. But still.Enjoyment: 8it wouldve gotten a 9 for me if the intro was a bit better. But the rest of the anime got really interesting, so im giving it a 8.Overall: 8Sometimes people dont look at the animes that isnt a sequel like Non Non Biyori, WORKING!!! or adaptations such as God Eater, or manga adaptations such as Gakkou Gurashi. Classroom Crisis gets overshadowed by all these big anime titles, but i encourage you. Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed. to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh.

It seems like that will be the trend for the whole series, which would make it a rather simple, ""done-before"" anime.However, even from the very first scene, the writers slowly began to change the trajectory of the story. Bits and pieces and hints are strategically placed and begin to grow: corporate intrigue; complex backstories; mysteries and secrets; hidden parts of...character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction. With a well-placed twist and glimpses at deeper characterization, the show is brought to a good climax and ends on a hopeful note for a second season.It should be noted that this is very happily free of a lot of over-used and aggravating tropes. Nowhere do we see some of the romance tropes that make the reader sigh of disappointment, nor do we have horribly annoying characters. Even the presence of some tropes are used for humor, and work well enough.While this isn\'t an incredible masterpiece, it certainly is a good show. I give it 9/10 for the sake of being a show I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and hope eagerly for a second season.Story: 9/10. The twists were well-placed and the plot flowed in an interesting manner. Some might think the beginning lags, but I actually find the contrast of the beginning episodes with where it goes as one of the better points of the show. I like the surprise and slow sinking feeling you get as the show progresses from slice-of-life to something deeper.Art: 9/10. I enjoy the art. The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment. I don\'t have any tracks that especially stick with me, but they fit the mood well.Character: 10/10. For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10.

For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10. A very good show.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Every year, my family and I go to the cottage we have up north. We ride on the pontoon, we go to the local ice cream store, and we sit around the campfire making s’mores. These separate events are fun, but what makes them so awesome is getting to spend them with my family.I remember one night when Craig, a cousin of mine, brought a telescope with him. It was a clear night, allowing the stars to brightly shine against the dark backdrop. He had been practicing viewing objects in outer space, and, by that...point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10 point, he could consistently find Saturn.

Not a lot of praise, but a bit of praise. Thing is, Classroom Crisis is bad. It\'s objectively not good. I can understand why people could like this, but at the same time, I can\'t.Story: 2Classroom Crisis gives an abysmal attempt at crafting its story. From the beginning, we are confronted with a conflict. Good, plots need a conflict. Couple more episodes, though, and we begin seeing more and more problems arise. There are so many different conflicts and so many different plotlines, it just becomes difficult to keep track of.There is a...main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end. There\'s also a bunch of different villains, with practically no motivation, and no real contribution to the plot.While the ending, without any spoilers, was an alright conclusion in itself, it was cliche and out of place. Classroom Crisis, which should be more aptly named Classroom Crises, was simply a mess in its storytelling.Art + Sound: 7I\'m not stickler for art and sound. I don\'t particularly listen for insert songs or background music, nor do I search for inconsistencies or mistakes in the art. TrySail\'s OP is actually great, in my opinion, and the art is pretty, to say the least. But there\'s nothing special about either.Character: 3The people in the Kirishina Corporation are so normal. Classroom Crisis is filled with such cookie-cutter cliche characters that I can\'t even name them all, but I\'ll name a few notables: Sera Kaito (energetic, somewhat-absent-minded ""mature"" one), Sera Mizuki (also energetic, happy-go-lucky teen girl), Shirasaki Iris (quiet, tough dandere who\'d do anything for her friend), Kiryuu Nagisa (evil-for-no-reason, first villain-turned-anti-hero), Angelina-sensei (tough assistant teacher who has a mysterious past (seriously? why? it\'s never explained)), Kiryuu Yuuji (Nagisa\'s boss and brother, second villain, no motivation), Kiryuu Kazuhisa (main villain, still no real motivation).The rest of the characters can be written off. The only ones I ever really took note of were Nagisa, because you kinda have to, Iris, because I love my stoic danderes, Mizuki, because she has so much presence (also the tiny hint of yuri, that ended up being destroyed), and some student who I couldn\'t tell if they were a boy, a girl, or neither.Anyways, the characters suck. A few of them do have some development, but most are left to gather dust.Enjoyment: 2I did not enjoy Classroom Crisis. It was too hard to want to follow, there is just nothing to grasp onto with it. It\'s just terrible.Overall: 4Classroom Crisis was bad. The attempt at character development, decent ending, and a somewhat traceable plot kept it floating just under mediocre. Classroom Crisis isn\'t good, and I don\'t understand why it gets the praise that it does. On the flipside, Classroom Crisis isn\'t the worst anime ever released. I guess. Please, do not make a second season. I do not want more of this. I don\'t care about the Kiryuu\'s father. main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end.

They had a  good romance going, and the way it developed was good. But then the other girl regained her memory, and now the anime has become a harem. The man male has 3 girls all wanting him, and the anime just plays it off as a joke.I felt like i was deceived into watching it just to get the ending i most hated.Everything in my review is based on my own opinion. Everyone has different opinions, and mine on this anime is not good.I do not expect everyone to agree. Some people like it, some people don't. And to be honest, I would've given this anime a 6-7 if it weren't for the ending.I wrote this so to share what i feel about this anime. would do.....i don't know if that makes sense or not, but basically only the main characters had a little development, the rest were just there for props.NOW!!!!!The main point that upset me SO MUCH to give it such a low score: THE ROMANCEThe romance was a complete JOKE! i would've gave this anime a decent score, but then the ending made this anime completely appalling.

I\'ve left out major spoilers, however.]I am glad that I watched this.I would probably recommend this to others.I have watched this once, subtitled.I probably won\'t watch this again.---- Positives ----The engineers vs. executives battle is moderately interesting.I\'m not used to watching series about internal company struggles, so I thought that this concept was fresh....The A-TEC characters seem competent.Although there isn\'t much detail explaining to what degree and for what reasons they\'re competent, the A-TEC members each seem to hold their own during their crisis, in the end at least. Some of them had a shaky path, one in particular. Besides proper A-TEC members, Kiryuu Nagisa is also shown to be very competent.

There ~was~ urgency on paper, but it didn\'t ever feel like there was. This series is similar to Amagi Brilliant Park in format, and in that series, there was a very well demonstrated sense of urgency. There were multiple reasons, in fact, for why they had to fight back, so it was easy to get behind the characters and cheer them on. This series? Not so much.Opportunity for cancel: None. There was ample time that could have been spent on this instead of other areas of the series, such as all the focus on Kiryuu Nagisa vs. the executives.They\'re fighting for their jobs against a company that apparently wants them all gone.The worst case scenario for these characters seemed to be leaving the company that was actively trying to get rid of them.

We must persevere and show the company that hates us that they shouldn\'t hate us."".Opportunity for cancel: Yes. Apparently, there was some motivational history behind this company, and the company had access to high-tech machinery, so the fight back may have been mainly reactionary, and not meant as a long-term solution. Regarding that, things work out nicely in the end, helping to counter this negative. The company tries to get rid of them, so they continue trying against the odds, and what happens at the end wraps everything up nicely.The romance is out of the blue.The romance that sprouts in this series was missing a lot of supporting scenes. Because of that lack of scenes, the romance just sort of happened suddenly, and I didn\'t feel anything on behalf of either of the characters regarding the romance.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series could have divided up its time to more effectively support events like this.Should-have-shot-them-when-you-had-the-chance.There\'s one scene near the end that was terribly unnecessary. It\'s a moderate spoiler, but it gets resolved unremarkably without any large impact on the plot, so I\'ll talk about it without mentioning specific characters. Person B is evil and is doing evil things. Person A and crew break in to stop the evil deeds. Person A has Person B cornered. Hooray. Person A is furious and is in a position to strike down Person B. However, Person A decides not to deliver the final blow, saying that the higher-ups will deal with Person B\'s punishment for doing evil things. Person A then runs off to stop the main evil deed, without binding Person B. Just. Leaves. Person B. There. Does nothing. Surely Person B won\'t run around and come for revenge. Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A. It\'s just sad. The series doesn\'t pull stunts like that for all the prior episodes, and then it just has to pull that near the end. Although good for another reason, the oddest part is that it doesn\'t largely effect the next episode, so I\'m not sure why ~that~ event was chosen by the writers.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series seems to be an original series. Even if it wasn\'t, and was instead based on a light novel or manga, and this scene was in the original, I\'d consider it cringe-worthy enough to write out of the anime.Time wasn\'t well-spent.This negative relates to the other negatives.

What I expected to be a rocket mechanic slice of life veered into Dan Brown and John Grisham territory with corporate intrigue. There are a few plot holes in the story, but nothing so major that the story and character interactions more than make up for them with how well they are done.If you can get past the first four or five episodes and liked the politics/economy parts of Log Horizon, definitely check this anime out. ', ""This anime is amazing!Every episode turned out to be interesting and packed with excitment. The story moves on and develops constantly, and that is great!In just 13 episodes, things change and evolve so much, it is impossible not to get entertained.The animation quality is great, the characters are not annoying and none of them are a classic copy paste we see these days. They have their own story, passions and deep motivations.It evolves in a lot more than just a classroom of students.Overall a very good anime, it covers sci-fi,action,drama,psychological, political,romance, adventure and it does it in a consistent and excellently measured way.I'm...surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining! surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining!"", 'Classroom Crisis was only a small interest of mine, and when I read some reviews I was not expecting much from the show. I went in with no expectations and at first was really pleased with what I saw. Unfortunately what followed after the first couple of episodes was a roller coaster ride of lack of interest and anger. I do not often find myself thinking that a show didn\'t live up to its potential. We all can look back on something and see what we think could have been better, or what we might change. Those are just opinions and generally the story pans...out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that. out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario.

The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that.', ""Classroom Crisis is way too far from any mainstream anime that I've ever seen. The cute design of characters and colorful approach to artstyle could be misleading as to what the core story of the show really is about. This isn't about cool kids building rocket ships, school festivals or teen drama -- nope. CC is heavily leaning on political matters, hungry corporations, and the manipulations taking place behind the scenes. If this is too much for you, then you are definitely correct about not watching this anime.Classroom Crisis is, plainly put, about a group of bright students working as spaceship engineers, who are told...that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue. It's easier to track the main characters because of that, and relate to them more often than not.Giving this an 8 for great art, great storytelling, nice characters and overall a story well-thought out. Give this a thought if you're in for something more mature, but also light and not too nerve-wrecking to watch. that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship.

You should watch it to refresh your mind.-Realist and logical male lead. Some typical anime have nerd, otaku, unrealist, talkaktive, and passive male lead character. But, in this series, the MC has strong personality, ambitious, and mature mind set. (It\'s like Shiba Tatsuya mix Hachiman)-YOU SEARCH FOR RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT. There\'s no romance genre in this series, but from what I saw, there\'s a minor romance between MC and heroines. Yes, add ""s"", because there\'s 2 possible lover for MC, and those two was...best friend. The MC not a bastard guy who not sensitive with romance, he handles those 2 fairly, so they dont break their friendship because of a guy.-Serious conflict, but carefree characters. Many conflicts in this series choose serious ways, but almost all characters handle those conflict with smile, trust, and working together to overcome troubles.That\'s all the reason why you must watch this series. This 7,11 mark is bullshit. I think some guys who gave it mark not an anime addict person, so they still not bore in some mainstream anime. best friend.

The first time, I rated the show a 10 and the second time I affirmed that I made no mistake in my score choice. I understand that this show's major appeals are not for everyone, but this show deserves more recognition as it is able to accomplish creating such a satisfying story in 13 episodes.Here are things I love about the show in no particular order:I love the main character, Nagisa Kiryu, and his development throughout the show. His character is so refreshing to see in the midst of every beta male MC that is common...in modern anime. I love the rest of the cast, and although I may forget about them more easily than others, the A-TEC team has a lovable family atmosphere that I enjoy.I love the OST, especially in hype moments, I find myself getting immersed and tapping my foot along with the catchy beat.I love the themes this anime covers, though not for everyone: Engineering, Politics, Business, Revenge, Self-discovery. Maruto Fumiaki, who had a great hand in the writing of this show, is my favourite writer in the industry and I feel like he's just getting started in his hopefully long career. I love the story because revenge, coming of age, teamwork, and goal-driven plotlines are what I yearn for the most. I love how, the story ends as it leaves on a good note, with major conflicts resolved and only leaving very minor things open for interpretation, possibly in hopes for a season 2.I will definitely rewatch this show again, as I do with all my 10s, in the near future. This show was a roller-coaster ride of emotions that I am always down to ride again. in modern anime.

Interesting space-age setting with heavy political overtones.There were just a few hiccups for me:The romance was contrived and devalued some of the characters, though perhaps it's just personal preference.The story could have been more detailed overall; perhaps more worldbuilding, character backgrounds and development, and more explanation for each of the happenings. It may have made the romance worthwhile.Wish it had a mature feeling, but at least you get the feeling that the young adults/children are young adults/children. "", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.THIS SHOW IS WORTH WATCHING. YES IT STARTS SLOW, DEAL WITH IT. GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.DO NOT JUDGE THE SHOW UNTIL YOU\'VE FINISHED IT. Seriously, so many people dropped it early and missed out on arguably one of the better shows of the 2015 Fall season.STORY (9): It starts off slow and kinda generic. You\'ve seen it before, the big bad greedy corporation wants to cut funding for the hardworking dedicated student team finishes their big project. Corporate representative is sent to be evil and shut them down. Snore.Except that\'s...now what the story is about. The classroom is just a single plot point to carry the show onto the next event, as it starts to pull the camera back to show what\'s going on with the behind the scenes. It evolves into a corporate and political drama where alliances are formed behind closed doors and plans are carefully laid to move everyone into positions. The story may be about kids building rocketships, but the show is a much more grand scale.Then you get gut punched by the intense moments, when the trap cards are activated or the action kicks off. It\'s just at the right level that you stay intrigued during the ""slower"" parts.Art/Sound (8): It looks and sounds good. I\'m not really going to go in depth on it because I don\'t know what else to say. The animation is smooth, the art is well done, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the effects are nice. There aren\'t any out of place sounds and the OP/ED are nice.Character (8): This is where a lot of people get confused. ""Why are there so many characters, who\'s the main character, why aren\'t these people getting more attention?"" Whoa there speedy, calm yourself down. There isn\'t what I consider a single ""main"" character, it\'s more like two primary characters, two secondary, and the supporting characters.Kaito is the MC of the classroom side, while Nagisa is the MC of the corporate side. Both are important, and there\'s a solid overlap between them to where it never feels like one is taking the spotlight from the other. Iris and Mizuki both get good development and fill their rolls nicely. I\'ll warn that if you hate amnesiac characters with a burning passion it might take a little away, but it\'s not a critical plot point to the overall story. The other students do what they need to and don\'t get in the way.Romance is implied (and shown) but not plot critical, just enough to get you intrigued but not so much that it detracts from the story.Enjoyment (9): Honestly, it\'s one of the better shows this season. Once the plot got underway I was addicted. The pacing was excellent, the excitement was real, and it ends almost perfectly. All important plot points are wrapped up nicely, though there\'s just enough hooks that a second season can latch on to.Overall (9): I\'ll admit I\'m rating it a point higher than it probably deserves, but I really wanted to counter all the negative reviews. Classroom Crisis is a very well done original work that absolutely needs more attention that it got. The slow start really hurt viewership and I feel it\'s unfair considering just how good the show ended up being. Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise. now what the story is about.

Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise.', 'Without giving too much away about my personal life, I work in IT. My job involves tinkering with technology that helps improve people’s lives in ways they didn’t know they were being helped whilst never getting the recognition involved with being involved. Whilst I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to what’s current or how it’s implemented or how to use Linux for everyday life, I do know that this is a tough career path and even getting started can be a big pain. Interviews suck, especially when you pass many of them only to fail at the final stretch. The learning process is...worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity. worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life.

She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity.', ""This is my first review and I'll just write it to incite some more people to watch this show. This anime seems to be underrated which I totally understand, however, it's a great watch once you get into it.First thing first don't be deterred by the first episodes. It introduce a lot of characters right at the episode 1, and give the setting in the form of a documentary. Honestly, it's quite boring, listening to a off voice telling us about the company, giving a short presentation of every students and other details about the universe. The way everything is introduced is bad and it's...understandable that people would stop at this point. However, once you get past that, you find a captivating anime about corporation war while you may think with the opening that it's about space ships races.Story : 9The plot resolves around an elite classroom in space engine development which is about to be downsized since it brings no results for their alloted budget. A student is transferred in the class as a boss in other to do the downsizing but the story turn after a few episodes into political schemes, family conflicts, hidden past and romance. Overall, there are a lot of turnabout and cliffhanger which keeps make you want for more.Art and Sound : GoodNothing especially remarkable in the art. The characters designs are ok and the animation isn't bad. The spaceship aren't too flashy. It's agreeable to watch and I don't see bad points.The soundtrack on the other end is very good. The opening by Lay Duce is catchy and quite enjoyable, and the ending by Claris is also good. The OST fit in the situations and are pleasants to listen. I usually don't remember the OST but this one caught my ear. The studio even let you enjoy it by using it in scenes without dialogues.Characters : 9The protagonists are well developed, with some interesting revelations and changes in their attitude and conduct as the story progress. The others students in the classroom don't have this opportunity but aren't bad. The antagonists are quite good, with a raging psychopath who only ask to be hated (he fulfills his role at least) and a calm and calculating one.Enjoyment : 10I enjoyed it very much, the numerous turnabout and the character development keep you on your toes. You may need to pay attention to understand some corporates and political schemes but in the end, the episode is over before you know it.Overall : 9Yes, this anime is not flawless. Yes, it won't appeal to you if you're not interested in a corporation's interior conflict. I'm probably biased by giving it a 9 when I found the first 2 episodes quite average but this show how much the rest is captivating. It won't fit everyone's taste but I hope that you will give this anime a chance because I loved it.Worth mentionning : Some people may be turned off right away just by seeing Maruto Fumiaki in the composition, author of the very controversed Saekano. Well, I'm one of those who didn't like Saekano one bit, but I watched this anime without prejudice and it was a good watch in the end. understandable that people would stop at this point.

Since apparently, high school is end all be all for any person\'s life, it\'s only fitting to spawn hundreds of them in order to formulate a genre.  To add to this bunch, we have Classroom Crisis, a show about a bunch of stupid but apparently smart kids in a high school-like anime.  And boy, is this one in crisis.Story: In the far-off future where humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system (yes, even gas giants apparently), Classroom Crisis takes...place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.  Here, we have the specialty class known as A-TEC, a small class of incredibly smart high schoolers who are basically smaller, less mature engineers and business people who work for the large corporation .  (Without pay, of course.)  After a near impossible rescue attempt for the new transfer student of the class, A-TEC comes to terms with the fact that due to their wastefulness of their annual budget, that in about six months, their entire class will be disbanded.  And that folks, is the crisis for this series.The story of Classroom Crisis is a Crisis in and of itself; identity crisis, to be more precise.  While the show starts out with a bunch of high schoolers fighting for their right to stay in class (even though it was CLEARLY their own fault for putting themselves into this mess by overspending), Classroom Crisis tries to drag the reader through a story involving the ins and outs of a corrupted business, covering up different schemes, politics (for some god unknown reason), and with just a hint of both romance and attempted murder.  As a result of all of these factors going around, the show tosses the viewer around with the flow of the plot, sometimes dragging you to a place where you don\'t know what the hell is going on.At the same time with all of these seemingly random plot points going on, Classroom Crisis tries to squeeze in character development which both feels rushed and sometimes completely unnecessary.  Remember that romance bit I mentioned earlier?  For some reason, they sprinkle that in at the end without any indication as how or why any of that came to be.  In addition, the show really doesn\'t actually focus on its base storyline of A-TEC struggle for existence, mostly focusing on the characters that actually aren\'t part of A-TEC, aka the weird power struggle that created such a mess of a series.In end end, Classroom Crisis\'s story was a horrendous piece to watch.  Not only did it not follow to the letter on what it wanted to do, but it also pulled itself in directions that made not only made for a dreadful watching experience, but it also made character importance varied as to who was important and who wasn\'t, to the point that I personally could care less what was going on since there really isn\'t any way that you can get a sense as to what is really going on with the people in this series.  Plus, that ending was kind of random, to be honest.Overview:-  Generic base idea  (High school show, really?)-  Shifting story that changed what it wanted to focus-  Random bits of unnecessary detail  (Seriously, why is there any semblance of romance here?!)-   Artificial character development  (just seemed kind of forced rather than natural)-   Random endingCharacters:  Characters in Classroom Crisis aren\'t really characters, per say.  Many of them are simply plot devices, or are completely forgotten halfway through because the story shifts in a way that those characters simply become irrelevant after a time.  So, I will attempt to pick out the ones that I assume are the true main characters in the series.First is Sera Kaito, the teacher of the class of A-TEC.  As an employee of the Kirishina corporation, Kaito is a very smart person when it comes to engineering, but comes a bit short in every aspect.  He\'s sort of the newbie in the whole scheme of business characters since he is very absent minded about how business practices work, and as such gets very flustered.  Still though, he\'s a very motivated character that works towards his goal of ""saving A-TEC"", but in the end, there\'s not really much to his character.  He doesn\'t change at all in this series and frankly, sort of just derps around half the time due to the various situations that pop up around the whole series.And then we have Kiryu Nagisa.  As the transfer student of A-TEC and the resident douchebag of the series, Nagisa is a very focused and slightly narcissistic individual who puts his mission first above anything else.  His personality is one that you love to hate.  Because he just barrels into the series and just well, does his job as someone who looks out for the company since A-TEC is really just a waste of time and money.  He is gradually shown to be the ""good guy"" of the series but really, there\'s nothing substantial about him.  As a character, he artificially changes to the point where he is considered to be a protagonist rather than an antagonist, but at that point, there\'s nothing about him to even care about.Everyone else in this series are just plot devices.  The entire group of A-TEC students barely get any role aside from supporting roles in the series, and since the entire show is devoted to the less than average story, any other character in the series really doesn\'t have much significance aside from this character playing this and having this role, and that character being that because he\'s this and his basic goal is this.  No one is really past a cardboard cutout of a character and there\'s no point of knowing who they are because no one is really all that memorable.Overview:-  Less than average cast-  Character development didn\'t make sense-  Entire cast were basically plot devicesArt: Contrary to the story and characters, the art for Classroom Crisis was decent.  While the characters themselves weren\'t detailed to the extent of being gloriously animated, the backgrounds and the level of detail in certain things like the rockets were relatively well animated.  But honestly, that\'s as much as I can say for the artwork.  It was pretty standard all the way through and there really wasn\'t much to say about it.Sound: As for the soundtrack, the OP and ED of the series really didn\'t have much to add to the series.  Out of every track, the OP was probably the best with its heroic sounding tone to it, but it really wasn\'t all that memorable.  Same thing goes for the rest of the track.  Like the artwork, it\'s good, but not memorable.Personal Enjoyment: When I first say Classroom Crisis, I thought that this might be quaint little series about a small group of kids or something, but I was dead wrong.  OH, so wrong.  It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.

So i went to MAL and naturally i saw bad/mediocre reviews about it.  this got me to be really scared, since i didnt want to watch a anime that would eat away my brain cells, but boy, am i glad that i didnt drop it, so lets get to the actual review.Story: 7 (MAL rating), 7.5 (my rating)to be honest, along with some people, i found the introduction...to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too. Not much to say here, other than me writhing on the floor. dang that music is great.Character: 7As an anime with decent plot and a generous 13 episode limit, i wished they would elaborate on the other A-TEC members. They elaborated a good portion of Mizuki, Iris and Nagisa to a point where i loved all 3 of them, so its all good. It was too be expected though, since they were the main characters. But still.Enjoyment: 8it wouldve gotten a 9 for me if the intro was a bit better. But the rest of the anime got really interesting, so im giving it a 8.Overall: 8Sometimes people dont look at the animes that isnt a sequel like Non Non Biyori, WORKING!!! or adaptations such as God Eater, or manga adaptations such as Gakkou Gurashi. Classroom Crisis gets overshadowed by all these big anime titles, but i encourage you. Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed. to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too.

Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed."", 'This show proved to be the biggest surprise for me this season, one which I\'m happy to say ended very well.I won\'t bring any spoilers beyond the general trends of where the episodes head.The first few episodes give a very strong slice-of-life comedy drama vibe. It seems like that will be the trend for the whole series, which would make it a rather simple, ""done-before"" anime.However, even from the very first scene, the writers slowly began to change the trajectory of the story. Bits and pieces and hints are strategically placed and begin to grow: corporate intrigue; complex backstories; mysteries and secrets; hidden parts of...character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction. With a well-placed twist and glimpses at deeper characterization, the show is brought to a good climax and ends on a hopeful note for a second season.It should be noted that this is very happily free of a lot of over-used and aggravating tropes. Nowhere do we see some of the romance tropes that make the reader sigh of disappointment, nor do we have horribly annoying characters. Even the presence of some tropes are used for humor, and work well enough.While this isn\'t an incredible masterpiece, it certainly is a good show. I give it 9/10 for the sake of being a show I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and hope eagerly for a second season.Story: 9/10. The twists were well-placed and the plot flowed in an interesting manner. Some might think the beginning lags, but I actually find the contrast of the beginning episodes with where it goes as one of the better points of the show. I like the surprise and slow sinking feeling you get as the show progresses from slice-of-life to something deeper.Art: 9/10. I enjoy the art. The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment. I don\'t have any tracks that especially stick with me, but they fit the mood well.Character: 10/10. For spoilerish reasons, I can\'t say why, but several characters were very well developed by the end. I quite enjoyed them.Enjoyment: 10/10. Slow in the beginning, but that only added to the enjoyment as the show progressed. It always moved uphill, ending on an excellent note.Overall: 9/10.

A very good show.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Every year, my family and I go to the cottage we have up north. We ride on the pontoon, we go to the local ice cream store, and we sit around the campfire making s’mores. These separate events are fun, but what makes them so awesome is getting to spend them with my family.I remember one night when Craig, a cousin of mine, brought a telescope with him. It was a clear night, allowing the stars to brightly shine against the dark backdrop. He had been practicing viewing objects in outer space, and, by that...point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10 point, he could consistently find Saturn.

He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10', 'Classroom Crisis is an anime that I\'ve seen get praise this season. Not a lot of praise, but a bit of praise. Thing is, Classroom Crisis is bad. It\'s objectively not good. I can understand why people could like this, but at the same time, I can\'t.Story: 2Classroom Crisis gives an abysmal attempt at crafting its story. From the beginning, we are confronted with a conflict. Good, plots need a conflict. Couple more episodes, though, and we begin seeing more and more problems arise. There are so many different conflicts and so many different plotlines, it just becomes difficult to keep track of.There is a...main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end. There\'s also a bunch of different villains, with practically no motivation, and no real contribution to the plot.While the ending, without any spoilers, was an alright conclusion in itself, it was cliche and out of place. Classroom Crisis, which should be more aptly named Classroom Crises, was simply a mess in its storytelling.Art + Sound: 7I\'m not stickler for art and sound. I don\'t particularly listen for insert songs or background music, nor do I search for inconsistencies or mistakes in the art. TrySail\'s OP is actually great, in my opinion, and the art is pretty, to say the least. But there\'s nothing special about either.Character: 3The people in the Kirishina Corporation are so normal. Classroom Crisis is filled with such cookie-cutter cliche characters that I can\'t even name them all, but I\'ll name a few notables: Sera Kaito (energetic, somewhat-absent-minded ""mature"" one), Sera Mizuki (also energetic, happy-go-lucky teen girl), Shirasaki Iris (quiet, tough dandere who\'d do anything for her friend), Kiryuu Nagisa (evil-for-no-reason, first villain-turned-anti-hero), Angelina-sensei (tough assistant teacher who has a mysterious past (seriously? why? it\'s never explained)), Kiryuu Yuuji (Nagisa\'s boss and brother, second villain, no motivation), Kiryuu Kazuhisa (main villain, still no real motivation).The rest of the characters can be written off. The only ones I ever really took note of were Nagisa, because you kinda have to, Iris, because I love my stoic danderes, Mizuki, because she has so much presence (also the tiny hint of yuri, that ended up being destroyed), and some student who I couldn\'t tell if they were a boy, a girl, or neither.Anyways, the characters suck. A few of them do have some development, but most are left to gather dust.Enjoyment: 2I did not enjoy Classroom Crisis. It was too hard to want to follow, there is just nothing to grasp onto with it. It\'s just terrible.Overall: 4Classroom Crisis was bad. The attempt at character development, decent ending, and a somewhat traceable plot kept it floating just under mediocre. Classroom Crisis isn\'t good, and I don\'t understand why it gets the praise that it does. On the flipside, Classroom Crisis isn\'t the worst anime ever released. I guess. Please, do not make a second season. I do not want more of this.

They had a  good romance going, and the way it developed was good. But then the other girl regained her memory, and now the anime has become a harem. The man male has 3 girls all wanting him, and the anime just plays it off as a joke.I felt like i was deceived into watching it just to get the ending i most hated.Everything in my review is based on my own opinion.

This series is similar to Amagi Brilliant Park in format, and in that series, there was a very well demonstrated sense of urgency.

Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A.

What I expected to be a rocket mechanic slice of life veered into Dan Brown and John Grisham territory with corporate intrigue. There are a few plot holes in the story, but nothing so major that the story and character interactions more than make up for them with how well they are done.If you can get past the first four or five episodes and liked the politics/economy parts of Log Horizon, definitely check this anime out. ', ""This anime is amazing!Every episode turned out to be interesting and packed with excitment. The story moves on and develops constantly, and that is great!In just 13 episodes, things change and evolve so much, it is impossible not to get entertained.The animation quality is great, the characters are not annoying and none of them are a classic copy paste we see these days. They have their own story, passions and deep motivations.It evolves in a lot more than just a classroom of students.Overall a very good anime, it covers sci-fi,action,drama,psychological, political,romance, adventure and it does it in a consistent and excellently measured way.I'm...surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining! surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining!"", 'Classroom Crisis was only a small interest of mine, and when I read some reviews I was not expecting much from the show. I went in with no expectations and at first was really pleased with what I saw. Unfortunately what followed after the first couple of episodes was a roller coaster ride of lack of interest and anger. I do not often find myself thinking that a show didn\'t live up to its potential. We all can look back on something and see what we think could have been better, or what we might change. Those are just opinions and generally the story pans...out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that. out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue.

I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that.', ""Classroom Crisis is way too far from any mainstream anime that I've ever seen. The cute design of characters and colorful approach to artstyle could be misleading as to what the core story of the show really is about. This isn't about cool kids building rocket ships, school festivals or teen drama -- nope. CC is heavily leaning on political matters, hungry corporations, and the manipulations taking place behind the scenes. If this is too much for you, then you are definitely correct about not watching this anime.Classroom Crisis is, plainly put, about a group of bright students working as spaceship engineers, who are told...that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue. It's easier to track the main characters because of that, and relate to them more often than not.Giving this an 8 for great art, great storytelling, nice characters and overall a story well-thought out. Give this a thought if you're in for something more mature, but also light and not too nerve-wrecking to watch. that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship.

But, in this series, the MC has strong personality, ambitious, and mature mind set. (It\'s like Shiba Tatsuya mix Hachiman)-YOU SEARCH FOR RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT. There\'s no romance genre in this series, but from what I saw, there\'s a minor romance between MC and heroines. Yes, add ""s"", because there\'s 2 possible lover for MC, and those two was...best friend. The MC not a bastard guy who not sensitive with romance, he handles those 2 fairly, so they dont break their friendship because of a guy.-Serious conflict, but carefree characters. Many conflicts in this series choose serious ways, but almost all characters handle those conflict with smile, trust, and working together to overcome troubles.That\'s all the reason why you must watch this series.

The first time, I rated the show a 10 and the second time I affirmed that I made no mistake in my score choice. I understand that this show's major appeals are not for everyone, but this show deserves more recognition as it is able to accomplish creating such a satisfying story in 13 episodes.Here are things I love about the show in no particular order:I love the main character, Nagisa Kiryu, and his development throughout the show. His character is so refreshing to see in the midst of every beta male MC that is common...in modern anime. I love the rest of the cast, and although I may forget about them more easily than others, the A-TEC team has a lovable family atmosphere that I enjoy.I love the OST, especially in hype moments, I find myself getting immersed and tapping my foot along with the catchy beat.I love the themes this anime covers, though not for everyone: Engineering, Politics, Business, Revenge, Self-discovery. Maruto Fumiaki, who had a great hand in the writing of this show, is my favourite writer in the industry and I feel like he's just getting started in his hopefully long career. I love the story because revenge, coming of age, teamwork, and goal-driven plotlines are what I yearn for the most. I love how, the story ends as it leaves on a good note, with major conflicts resolved and only leaving very minor things open for interpretation, possibly in hopes for a season 2.I will definitely rewatch this show again, as I do with all my 10s, in the near future.

Interesting space-age setting with heavy political overtones.There were just a few hiccups for me:The romance was contrived and devalued some of the characters, though perhaps it's just personal preference.The story could have been more detailed overall; perhaps more worldbuilding, character backgrounds and development, and more explanation for each of the happenings. It may have made the romance worthwhile.Wish it had a mature feeling, but at least you get the feeling that the young adults/children are young adults/children. "", 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.THIS SHOW IS WORTH WATCHING. YES IT STARTS SLOW, DEAL WITH IT. GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE.DO NOT JUDGE THE SHOW UNTIL YOU\'VE FINISHED IT. Seriously, so many people dropped it early and missed out on arguably one of the better shows of the 2015 Fall season.STORY (9): It starts off slow and kinda generic. You\'ve seen it before, the big bad greedy corporation wants to cut funding for the hardworking dedicated student team finishes their big project. Corporate representative is sent to be evil and shut them down. Snore.Except that\'s...now what the story is about. The classroom is just a single plot point to carry the show onto the next event, as it starts to pull the camera back to show what\'s going on with the behind the scenes. It evolves into a corporate and political drama where alliances are formed behind closed doors and plans are carefully laid to move everyone into positions. The story may be about kids building rocketships, but the show is a much more grand scale.Then you get gut punched by the intense moments, when the trap cards are activated or the action kicks off. It\'s just at the right level that you stay intrigued during the ""slower"" parts.Art/Sound (8): It looks and sounds good. I\'m not really going to go in depth on it because I don\'t know what else to say. The animation is smooth, the art is well done, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the effects are nice. There aren\'t any out of place sounds and the OP/ED are nice.Character (8): This is where a lot of people get confused. ""Why are there so many characters, who\'s the main character, why aren\'t these people getting more attention?"" Whoa there speedy, calm yourself down. There isn\'t what I consider a single ""main"" character, it\'s more like two primary characters, two secondary, and the supporting characters.Kaito is the MC of the classroom side, while Nagisa is the MC of the corporate side. Both are important, and there\'s a solid overlap between them to where it never feels like one is taking the spotlight from the other. Iris and Mizuki both get good development and fill their rolls nicely. I\'ll warn that if you hate amnesiac characters with a burning passion it might take a little away, but it\'s not a critical plot point to the overall story. The other students do what they need to and don\'t get in the way.Romance is implied (and shown) but not plot critical, just enough to get you intrigued but not so much that it detracts from the story.Enjoyment (9): Honestly, it\'s one of the better shows this season. Once the plot got underway I was addicted. The pacing was excellent, the excitement was real, and it ends almost perfectly. All important plot points are wrapped up nicely, though there\'s just enough hooks that a second season can latch on to.Overall (9): I\'ll admit I\'m rating it a point higher than it probably deserves, but I really wanted to counter all the negative reviews. Classroom Crisis is a very well done original work that absolutely needs more attention that it got. The slow start really hurt viewership and I feel it\'s unfair considering just how good the show ended up being. Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise. now what the story is about.

Seriously, you won\'t regret it, I promise.', 'Without giving too much away about my personal life, I work in IT. My job involves tinkering with technology that helps improve people’s lives in ways they didn’t know they were being helped whilst never getting the recognition involved with being involved. Whilst I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to what’s current or how it’s implemented or how to use Linux for everyday life, I do know that this is a tough career path and even getting started can be a big pain. Interviews suck, especially when you pass many of them only to fail at the final stretch. The learning process is...worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger. Sure it makes no sense why he couldn’t explain his plan to the others or why it took so long to get to some conflict that actually might go somewhere, but I’ll take it if it means we can finally have some actual driving tension to what’s going on.Unfortunately, even that is badly handled, because the show still won’t install any sense of importance to the proceedings to the point that everything feels padded. We have to sit through long long long scenes where Nagisa has to talk about business politics with characters we don’t know, and they barely affect the plot or involve the characters he’s supposed to be saving, making them incredibly tedious. The only part that resembles an actual driving conflict where stuff actually happens comes right near the end when the show reveals why A-Tec’s money has been withheld from them, along with some more plot twists that were sort of hinted at earlier on involving characters that barely contributed anything before now. Not going to spoil them, but let’s just say I didn’t throw out that Captain Planet reference in the beginning of this review lightly.So you want to know what said conflict leads to? What actual character struggles result from their new discoveries? What these sudden plot developments actually lend to the narrative? So the fuck would I. Because Classroom Crisis thinks the best way to conclude itself would be to get sidetracked again with a kidnapping scheme caused by a boring asshole that exists solely to have a convenient excuse to have the characters utilize their individual skills for an agonizingly bad happy ending that was as soulless and token as they come. Mild spoilers: there\'s literally nothing to that ending but the good guys triumphing over the bad guys with no meaningful sacrifice or journey whatsoever, the shallowly naive message that dreams beat corporate, tons of loose ends that never added to anything, an incredibly tensionless rescue scene capped off with a nauseating and crowbarred-in love triangle element that made me want to hurl vomit all over my computer screen (seriously, what is up with Maruto and his fetish for love triangles?), and LOTS. OF. TALKING. The show literally just assembled the pieces, let them do the work, and then went off to have a milkshake without realizing that the autopilot navigation system has been faulty for months.That\'s got to be the most anticlimactic way to pay off on all your buildup since that godawful Robotics;Notes anime! And speaking of R;N, this show sure seems to take an awful lot from that anime in addition to how it ends, doesn\'t it? Like the character types, poor pacing, sci-fi setting, saccharine humor, large sections of the plot, and even being written by a visual novel writer who\'s gone completely downhill after his breakout hit. As the 40-year old virgin\'s friends said in regards to the only date he\'s ever had in his life, ""fuck that"".I don’t usually spend this long on a review talking about the story, but it’s absolute dreadfulness kind of overshadows everything else. But that doesn’t mean everything else gets a free pass. The animation is really terrible, like something from a bad 90s OVA bar the OreImo designs. And the music is bland across the board, from the opening credits to the actual OST. Out of curiosity, I went to Wikipedia to find out what amateur composed this anime’s piece of air and found it to be none other than...the guy who did the triumphant bombast of Haikyuu and Gundam Build Fighter’s soundtracks? As well as Death Parade’s? I soon saw he also did Robotics;Notes’ blandness and it all made sense. Obviously, this is a guy who realized the same thing I did in that there’s no future for anime written by VN writers and vowed to bring that across in his compositions. And if the music guy thinks your anime is shit, who are you to argue?We should really start listening to these semi-major anime industry guys more, less we end up with more cartoons like this fucking atrocity. worse than Dark Soul’s. Multiple failed projects. Corporate decisions screwing you over. The works.So I guess in a way, there is some merit in Classroom Crisis portraying that part of my life. Doesn’t change the fact that the show can go fuck itself though. You wouldn’t defend the more boring iterations of the Assassin’s Creed series solely based on how much effort was put into accurately portraying the time periods said games take place in. And it doesn’t help that the show’s actual handling of business politics is about as insightful as a Captain Planet episode - although I’m pretty sure Sly Sludge had more smarts than anyone in this mess.Classroom Crisis is once again another show following the trend started by Jun Maeda in that it’s written by a sort-of-established visual novel writer who had the same stupid “how hard can it be?” thought all of his predecessors had before proceeding to spontaneously combust himself due to his inability to escape the trappings of his preferred medium, ironically at the same time as Maeda’s own second combustion. But say what you like about Charlotte - I certainly have - at least stuff happens in it! Guy finds he has power, proceeds to abuse it, gets punished, is roped into a strange place, finds out he\'s part of something bigger, deals with tragedies, reverses a few only to run into something irreversible, sacrifices himself, and ultimately grows as a result even if his brain is too damaged to remember said growth. On the other hand, after three anime, Fumiaki Maruto still hasn’t seemed to grasp the definition of the word “story” at all. And with this show he seems to have forgotten the definition of the word “character” as well.Maruto’s last anime, Saekano: How To Be A Boring Heroine, shot itself in the foot before it left the starting gate with its intentions to focus on “character” at the expense of “story”, but at least the characters had identity. This time around, ninety percent of the cast don’t even get so much as a description worthy of a gaming instruction manual. They’re just a bunch of faceless gimmicky extras, led by a teacher who couldn’t be any more obnoxious unless he suddenly turned into a racoon who’d give you rabies every time you answered a question wrong. Actually I don’t recall the teacher doing anything in the show at all - let alone teach - unless you thinking talking big counts as doing something (it doesn\'t). The ratio of things that happen to him as opposed to things that happen by him is so one-sided I don’t think there’s a scale big enough to represent the number on the former side.The only character who actually has some semblance of characterization that doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out is the transfer student and arrogant rich boy, Nagisa Kiryuu. And I’m being very generous here, because his characterization is pretty much Chazz Princeton’s from Yu-Gi-Oh GX without the unintentional humor in that he’s a brat from a respected family who gets beaten down by his older brothers because being rich equals being a Lex Luthor wannabe who doesn’t get that the guy was articulate in his evilness. Oh, and he eventually becomes nicer after being forced to work alongside the idiots surrounding him and discovering they’re not all that bad. Fan-fucking-tastic character writing. Next we’ll be showering critical accolades on a character story about a young boy who has his innocence shattered when he discovers that people die in war.There’s this girl named Iris aka Rei Clone #4395714, and the show beats you over the head that she knew Nagisa in the past so ham-handedly that it might as well have had a neon sign pointing that shit out over her head every time she so much as appeared. But apart from that, she has absolutely no identity whatsoever and barely interacts with Nagisa or do really anything of significant importance whenever said neon sign isn’t turned on. She’s less of a character and more of “plot mcguffin with tits”. Not that being an emotional girl is any better, as Mizuki (had to look up her name because she’s that forgettable and unimportant to anything going on) discovered the hard way with her “I’m nice and maybe have a crush on this bad boy” routine. Maybe if you didn’t devote large sections of your show to explaining a bunch of political business stuff that I couldn’t give two shits for, I’d actually see these characters as someone worth giving a damn to get invested in.So the characters are boring with no relatable or interesting flaws whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean...well actually yes it does mean your show is doomed from the start, especially when your story leans so heavily on them. But even if you had gotten the cast of The Breakfast Club to star in this thing, it’s been awhile since I’ve seen such an awful case of “story driving characters” rather than “characters driving story”. Again, like Saekano - and White Album 2 to a lesser extent - there doesn’t seem to be much of a driving element to Classroom Crisis’s plot at all. As such, I don’t know what I’m supposed to care about or even who’s supposed to be the main hero that holds everything together.After the anime starts with the world’s most boring and throwaway terrorist scenario, Nagisa informs A-Tec upon his rescue that their group is dissolving and they’ll have to go their separate ways, but that’s literally all there is. Why should I care if they dissolve? Will they lose their homes if they do so? What dreams do they want to accomplish by being in A-Tec? What is the importance of building these machines? Well we never know, because the situation is resolved due to some legal loopholes without much of a struggle on the characters’ end and there’s still two-thirds of the anime to go. It’s like watching an episodic family sitcom scenario except stretched to four times the length and without any laughs in it.We then spend the next third having the characters live their lives. No seriously, that’s it. They just live their lives with the only central mechanic being Nagisa warming up to them - which as I’ve stated earlier doesn’t count as a story at all and certainly doesn’t have anything challenging about it - whilst dealing with their projects in the most saccharine way possible. They spend graduation by going to a beach, Nagisa has to pass a test, the characters resolve another random hostage situation that to be fair is better executed than the first one, the characters attend a school festival, and all I can think about whilst watching that shit was “wow, I am really bored. Hey, wasn’t there a plot point about the company stealing money for their own personal reasons? Are we ever going to get back to that? I feel like I’m watching Dragon Age: Origins’ ‘epic elements with no central narrative’ plot if it was channeling Dragon Age II’s ‘daily life of some random jackass without making anything actually happen’ snorefest”.What is up with visual novel writers and wanting to assemble all the pieces first before putting them altogether at once anyways? Not only do I not see why you can’t just put them together as you introduce said pieces, but you can still make mistakes when going all in at once when said assembly is complete. This becomes particularly true when Nagisa is forced to make a sacrifice in order to save his friends by involving himself into the company’s inner-workings in the final third of the show, putting him in a position of betrayals and internal danger.

This anime seems to be underrated which I totally understand, however, it's a great watch once you get into it.First thing first don't be deterred by the first episodes. It introduce a lot of characters right at the episode 1, and give the setting in the form of a documentary. Honestly, it's quite boring, listening to a off voice telling us about the company, giving a short presentation of every students and other details about the universe. The way everything is introduced is bad and it's...understandable that people would stop at this point. However, once you get past that, you find a captivating anime about corporation war while you may think with the opening that it's about space ships races.Story : 9The plot resolves around an elite classroom in space engine development which is about to be downsized since it brings no results for their alloted budget. A student is transferred in the class as a boss in other to do the downsizing but the story turn after a few episodes into political schemes, family conflicts, hidden past and romance. Overall, there are a lot of turnabout and cliffhanger which keeps make you want for more.Art and Sound : GoodNothing especially remarkable in the art. The characters designs are ok and the animation isn't bad. The spaceship aren't too flashy. It's agreeable to watch and I don't see bad points.The soundtrack on the other end is very good. The opening by Lay Duce is catchy and quite enjoyable, and the ending by Claris is also good. The OST fit in the situations and are pleasants to listen. I usually don't remember the OST but this one caught my ear. The studio even let you enjoy it by using it in scenes without dialogues.Characters : 9The protagonists are well developed, with some interesting revelations and changes in their attitude and conduct as the story progress. The others students in the classroom don't have this opportunity but aren't bad. The antagonists are quite good, with a raging psychopath who only ask to be hated (he fulfills his role at least) and a calm and calculating one.Enjoyment : 10I enjoyed it very much, the numerous turnabout and the character development keep you on your toes. You may need to pay attention to understand some corporates and political schemes but in the end, the episode is over before you know it.Overall : 9Yes, this anime is not flawless. Yes, it won't appeal to you if you're not interested in a corporation's interior conflict. I'm probably biased by giving it a 9 when I found the first 2 episodes quite average but this show how much the rest is captivating. It won't fit everyone's taste but I hope that you will give this anime a chance because I loved it.Worth mentionning : Some people may be turned off right away just by seeing Maruto Fumiaki in the composition, author of the very controversed Saekano. Well, I'm one of those who didn't like Saekano one bit, but I watched this anime without prejudice and it was a good watch in the end. understandable that people would stop at this point.

Since apparently, high school is end all be all for any person\'s life, it\'s only fitting to spawn hundreds of them in order to formulate a genre.  To add to this bunch, we have Classroom Crisis, a show about a bunch of stupid but apparently smart kids in a high school-like anime.  And boy, is this one in crisis.Story: In the far-off future where humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system (yes, even gas giants apparently), Classroom Crisis takes...place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.  Here, we have the specialty class known as A-TEC, a small class of incredibly smart high schoolers who are basically smaller, less mature engineers and business people who work for the large corporation .  (Without pay, of course.)  After a near impossible rescue attempt for the new transfer student of the class, A-TEC comes to terms with the fact that due to their wastefulness of their annual budget, that in about six months, their entire class will be disbanded.  And that folks, is the crisis for this series.The story of Classroom Crisis is a Crisis in and of itself; identity crisis, to be more precise.  While the show starts out with a bunch of high schoolers fighting for their right to stay in class (even though it was CLEARLY their own fault for putting themselves into this mess by overspending), Classroom Crisis tries to drag the reader through a story involving the ins and outs of a corrupted business, covering up different schemes, politics (for some god unknown reason), and with just a hint of both romance and attempted murder.  As a result of all of these factors going around, the show tosses the viewer around with the flow of the plot, sometimes dragging you to a place where you don\'t know what the hell is going on.At the same time with all of these seemingly random plot points going on, Classroom Crisis tries to squeeze in character development which both feels rushed and sometimes completely unnecessary.  Remember that romance bit I mentioned earlier?  For some reason, they sprinkle that in at the end without any indication as how or why any of that came to be.  In addition, the show really doesn\'t actually focus on its base storyline of A-TEC struggle for existence, mostly focusing on the characters that actually aren\'t part of A-TEC, aka the weird power struggle that created such a mess of a series.In end end, Classroom Crisis\'s story was a horrendous piece to watch.  Not only did it not follow to the letter on what it wanted to do, but it also pulled itself in directions that made not only made for a dreadful watching experience, but it also made character importance varied as to who was important and who wasn\'t, to the point that I personally could care less what was going on since there really isn\'t any way that you can get a sense as to what is really going on with the people in this series.  Plus, that ending was kind of random, to be honest.Overview:-  Generic base idea  (High school show, really?)-  Shifting story that changed what it wanted to focus-  Random bits of unnecessary detail  (Seriously, why is there any semblance of romance here?!)-   Artificial character development  (just seemed kind of forced rather than natural)-   Random endingCharacters:  Characters in Classroom Crisis aren\'t really characters, per say.  Many of them are simply plot devices, or are completely forgotten halfway through because the story shifts in a way that those characters simply become irrelevant after a time.  So, I will attempt to pick out the ones that I assume are the true main characters in the series.First is Sera Kaito, the teacher of the class of A-TEC.  As an employee of the Kirishina corporation, Kaito is a very smart person when it comes to engineering, but comes a bit short in every aspect.  He\'s sort of the newbie in the whole scheme of business characters since he is very absent minded about how business practices work, and as such gets very flustered.  Still though, he\'s a very motivated character that works towards his goal of ""saving A-TEC"", but in the end, there\'s not really much to his character.  He doesn\'t change at all in this series and frankly, sort of just derps around half the time due to the various situations that pop up around the whole series.And then we have Kiryu Nagisa.  As the transfer student of A-TEC and the resident douchebag of the series, Nagisa is a very focused and slightly narcissistic individual who puts his mission first above anything else.  His personality is one that you love to hate.  Because he just barrels into the series and just well, does his job as someone who looks out for the company since A-TEC is really just a waste of time and money.  He is gradually shown to be the ""good guy"" of the series but really, there\'s nothing substantial about him.  As a character, he artificially changes to the point where he is considered to be a protagonist rather than an antagonist, but at that point, there\'s nothing about him to even care about.Everyone else in this series are just plot devices.  The entire group of A-TEC students barely get any role aside from supporting roles in the series, and since the entire show is devoted to the less than average story, any other character in the series really doesn\'t have much significance aside from this character playing this and having this role, and that character being that because he\'s this and his basic goal is this.  No one is really past a cardboard cutout of a character and there\'s no point of knowing who they are because no one is really all that memorable.Overview:-  Less than average cast-  Character development didn\'t make sense-  Entire cast were basically plot devicesArt: Contrary to the story and characters, the art for Classroom Crisis was decent.  While the characters themselves weren\'t detailed to the extent of being gloriously animated, the backgrounds and the level of detail in certain things like the rockets were relatively well animated.  But honestly, that\'s as much as I can say for the artwork.  It was pretty standard all the way through and there really wasn\'t much to say about it.Sound: As for the soundtrack, the OP and ED of the series really didn\'t have much to add to the series.  Out of every track, the OP was probably the best with its heroic sounding tone to it, but it really wasn\'t all that memorable.  Same thing goes for the rest of the track.  Like the artwork, it\'s good, but not memorable.Personal Enjoyment: When I first say Classroom Crisis, I thought that this might be quaint little series about a small group of kids or something, but I was dead wrong.  OH, so wrong.  It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.  I would not recommend this anime, at all. place on a Japanese settlement on Mars, where a company called the Kirishina corporation takes charge as the frontrunner in rocket engineering thanks to developments to some rather powerful rocket engines.

It was to the point that I dreaded even watching the next episode and honestly didn\'t care about everything that was going on because everything felt so forced to the point I didn\'t give a crap whether or not the classroom was saved.  Because even though the whole corporation was corrupted and hellbent on getting money wherever they wanted to, it\'s still YOUR goddamn fault that you put yourselves to the point of getting yourselves kicked out and/or out of a job.Did I enjoy this anime?No, not really.  There wasn\'t anything to like about it because the show played itself out so horribly in numerous aspects.  As it was made to be a story based anime due to its lack of focus on its characters, I expected the show to at least create a cohesive story, which it didn\'t.What didn\'t I like about this anime?If there\'s anything that I really don\'t like about this anime personally, it has to be the BS plot twists and romance in the show.  I also don\'t like any of the characters at all, and I think that even thinking that any of them were half decent characters would be a mistake.Would I recommend this show?This show is a crisis in and of itself.  There\'s nothing significant about it other than its mess of a plot and its inability to properly tell a story.  Sure, you get some semblance as to what is going on, but not enough for you to know that is happening on an episode by episode basis.  Hell, two characters fall in love for some reason even though you only see them alone with each other for a grand total of 3 scenes.  I would not recommend this anime, at all.', ""This is my first review and I write this because not many saw the best of this season that gave us Nihon.

So i went to MAL and naturally i saw bad/mediocre reviews about it.  this got me to be really scared, since i didnt want to watch a anime that would eat away my brain cells, but boy, am i glad that i didnt drop it, so lets get to the actual review.Story: 7 (MAL rating), 7.5 (my rating)to be honest, along with some people, i found the introduction...to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh. But it helps contribute to what happens later in the story. But as the show progresses, the show stops being boring and becomes rather interesting!The story is basically about a wonder group called A-TEC thats in a verge of being downsized (ded'd) because of an incident that managed to destroy 15 billion dollars in a single day. Such amaze, not even I could do that! The plot is pretty straightforward so those who dont like to think too much while watching can enjoy this anime pretty nicely. Its a casual anime so its pretty fine.Art: 9 (MAL rating), 9.5 (my rating)what actually GOT me into this anime was the artstyle. Like seriously, if an anime has mediocre art ill be like 'nope skipping it cya'. Well, this was to be expected from the same studio that brought to us that adorable piece of anime called Oreimo. Really nice ones. The artstyle was also consistent. That means everything is proportional. A good example of bad animation would be Rail Wars' episode 1. Aligning eyes are to hard for you? hah. no. I'd rather have the colors to be a bit more vivid tho.Sound: 9i think i had an eargasm when i first heard the OP. the BGM was outstanding too. Not much to say here, other than me writhing on the floor. dang that music is great.Character: 7As an anime with decent plot and a generous 13 episode limit, i wished they would elaborate on the other A-TEC members. They elaborated a good portion of Mizuki, Iris and Nagisa to a point where i loved all 3 of them, so its all good. It was too be expected though, since they were the main characters. But still.Enjoyment: 8it wouldve gotten a 9 for me if the intro was a bit better. But the rest of the anime got really interesting, so im giving it a 8.Overall: 8Sometimes people dont look at the animes that isnt a sequel like Non Non Biyori, WORKING!!! or adaptations such as God Eater, or manga adaptations such as Gakkou Gurashi. Classroom Crisis gets overshadowed by all these big anime titles, but i encourage you. Pick this series up and you wont be disappointed. to this anime to be average. Like too much talking. ugh.

It seems like that will be the trend for the whole series, which would make it a rather simple, ""done-before"" anime.However, even from the very first scene, the writers slowly began to change the trajectory of the story. Bits and pieces and hints are strategically placed and begin to grow: corporate intrigue; complex backstories; mysteries and secrets; hidden parts of...character personalities; and so on.They continue to build up until they start to reach a tipping point, which drags the whole show into a new direction. With a well-placed twist and glimpses at deeper characterization, the show is brought to a good climax and ends on a hopeful note for a second season.It should be noted that this is very happily free of a lot of over-used and aggravating tropes. Nowhere do we see some of the romance tropes that make the reader sigh of disappointment, nor do we have horribly annoying characters. Even the presence of some tropes are used for humor, and work well enough.While this isn\'t an incredible masterpiece, it certainly is a good show. I give it 9/10 for the sake of being a show I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and hope eagerly for a second season.Story: 9/10. The twists were well-placed and the plot flowed in an interesting manner. Some might think the beginning lags, but I actually find the contrast of the beginning episodes with where it goes as one of the better points of the show.

The character designs are neat; emotions are well expressed; locations are well-drawn; I have no complaints.Sound: 9/10. The sounds always fit the environment.

A very good show.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Every year, my family and I go to the cottage we have up north. We ride on the pontoon, we go to the local ice cream store, and we sit around the campfire making s’mores. These separate events are fun, but what makes them so awesome is getting to spend them with my family.I remember one night when Craig, a cousin of mine, brought a telescope with him. It was a clear night, allowing the stars to brightly shine against the dark backdrop. He had been practicing viewing objects in outer space, and, by that...point, he could consistently find Saturn. So he set up the telescope, aiming the device at what looked like to me some arbitrary spot in the sky.When I peered through the scope, I saw a tiny, beige dot. It was Saturn. I was amazed to see this celestial object thousands of miles away mere inches from my eye. From that night onward, I learned to respect outer space, more so than I had ever previously done before.Classroom Crisis is an anime that likewise focuses on outer space, and contrary to its name, this anime is certainly not a crisis.STORYClassroom Crisis initially does not seem as if it will do much. The setting is a school. The main group is a club. Their work is bland. And, honestly, the first three episodes are difficult to get through.This difficulty arises from two areas. The first area is the tameness. “Nothing happens” in the beginning because the anime more or less sets up its world. What A-TEC is, which big players are involved, and why any of this matters. It is a lot of explanation, albeit necessary explanation. The second area is the constant negativity. Besides the occasional comedic relief, Classroom Crisis’s first three episodes come off as very unfair. Absolutely nothing is going right for Kaito, Mizuki, and the other members: their budget is cut, their facilities are shut down, and their team breaks away from itself.This is what makes episode five an oddity. On the one hand, the beach and the bathhouse stereotypes come off as out-of-place within the anime given the outer space and political motifs. On the other hand, there are reasons for this episode to exist, such as sparking Iris’s recovery from her amnesia and Mizuki witnessing Nagisa’s scars. But the biggest reason is to give the audience a bit of fun; the vast majority of the anime up until this episode was filled with that aforementioned negativity.Regardless, getting through the first half does pay dividends. The political machinations behind the scenes start to make sense once Nagisa’s actions start to shake up the field. The plot twist that was cleverly concealed is made known. And the true reason for why Kirishina Corporation pursued A-TEC so heavily finally surfaces.The narrative unfolds itself following its slower start, revealing what Classroom Crisis does best: conflict and resolution. Many of the conflicts within the show are small – rushing to make a deal, fighting off bad guys on a spaceship – while others are huge, existing across much of the season – the dismantling of A-TEC, Iris’s newfound fear. But regardless, the conflicts are always filled with purpose, giving the anime a lot of untold strength.And the same can be said for the resolutions that the anime constructs. Each resolution provides closure for the audience, makes sense in the context of the story, and completes the conflict that was created beforehand. Since the resolutions achieve success across all of these levels, they make for satisfying conclusions to the anime.The ending makes this clear. The anime incorporates a lot of full-circle framing to “return the story to the beginning” while also providing a lot of satisfaction in its conclusion. For example, the group brings Sasayama back on as the executive of A-TEC, and the final bit of drama matches the first bit of drama – rescuing Nagisa from a harrowing predicament. But it is Kaito and the gang dissolving A-TEC of their own volition that caps off the anime in as perfect a way as possible.Interestingly, the anime has other parts to it that go unexplored, such as the SWINPR races and the other civilizations on Mars and elsewhere. Classroom Crisis ignores these parts because it understands that they are not the point. They add to the setting, but they are not what is important to the show. Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10 point, he could consistently find Saturn.

Purposely ignoring these extra bits puts more emphasis on the plot and the conflicts and the characters which in turn strengthens these different parts.Another of these parts is the themes, one of which is about learning to rely on others. The major plot points – Nagisa against the Kiryu family and Iris against her fears – follow characters who try to do it all on their own. They only triumph when they start to rely on the people around them. A-TEC also embodies this idea; they save themselves through their support for each other.Classroom Crisis’s most prominent theme, the futility of revenge, carries the most weight. Nagisa’s words work best here: “Revenge is only carried out by fools.” This is seen with both Nagisa and with A-TEC. The former has an entire subplot dedicated to exacting revenge against the Kiryu family, revenge that ultimately fails. The latter does not seek revenge but instead vies to help themselves, help that ultimately succeeds. And it is not until Nagisa drops his revenge and starts relying on those around him that he starts to see success, too.Taking both of these themes together gets at the main message: revenge will get one nowhere, but friends will take one everywhere.ANIMATIONThe artistic direction for Classroom Crisis is, unfortunately, not that impressive. The anime takes place within the same set of locations, namely the A-TEC hangar, the academy, and the headquarters for Kirishina Corporation. This is not to say that art is subpar but rather there is not a whole lot of detail. This goes the same for the lighting and the camera work, both of which are lacking attention.The same can be said for the anime’s actual animation. The anime is filled with a lot of talking, meaning the characters hardly see extensive movement. There are specific scenes where this is not true, such as the ones involving Angelina due to her combat capabilities and Iris due to her spaceship flying. But the majority of the anime is not wholly concerned with intricate animation. Like the art, this is not to say that the animation is subpar but instead passable and only passable.One of the most interesting tactics that Classroom Crisis uses is the comedic way of drawing its characters. Sparingly, the anime likes to exaggerate the facial features of its characters – specifically the eyes and the mouth. Because this tactic is so infrequent, when it does happen, it adds a considerable amount of comedic value to the anime, giving the show higher strength in this department.The character designs are likewise a positive. Mizuki in particular has a wonderful design. Her long hair with ponytail contrasts with her tomboyish work clothes, but it is her larger-than-normal eyes that accentuate her attractiveness the most. Iris’s design symbolizes her personality: her purple hair (a cold color), her expressionless face (no emotion), and her blue-and-white jumper suit (cold and plain colors) match her calm persona. And the other members of A-TEC look unique within the show without treading into goofy-hair and ridiculous-fashion territories.CHARACTERSAnother strong aspect of Classroom Crisis is its characters. A large portion of the cast is mostly there for simple purposes. But Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, have a lot of importance and a lot of clout throughout the season.Starting with Mizuki, she is not a character that can necessarily be described as having a lot of development. She is the younger sister to Kaito Sera. She has the looks, the brains, and the personality. The latter is what makes Mizuki who she is: she leads the club with a smile on her face and optimism in her heart. So it is not all that surprising that she starts to take an interest in Nagisa, a man whose mannerisms and persona opposes Mizuki’s completely. Using a cliché, “opposites attract.”And that is what happens. Mizuki continues to try to understand Nagisa, learning about his troubling past while becoming closer to him. At some point, she realizes that her curiosity is no longer a fleeting feeling but instead love for the man who tries so hard and does so much.Mizuki does not just help Nagisa, though. She takes care of her brother at home, she is best friends with Iris, and she leads the rest of A-TEC in a poised and confident manner. In this way, she is reminiscent of her brother since she is always looking out for everyone else. (They are definitely siblings.) More than just being helpful, she is the ideal side character because she does not steal the limelight from those that need it most – namely Iris and Nagisa – but rather increases said light’s intensity.As was said, Kaito is similar, although he does not connect with the other characters on an individual basis. As A-TEC’s teacher, Kaito makes it his mission to give the kids he mentors the resources they need to accomplish the tasks they set out to do. He is a bit scatterbrained despite being a genius (or perhaps because he is a genius), but his heart is always in the right place. He puts his students and his customers first, aiming to make the people around him as happy as they can be.He tries. He tries a lot. Usually he fails, but Kaito never gives up. This trait is what makes Mizuki and the rest proud of him, and it is this trait that gives his character strength. When everything is falling apart, they know they can turn to Kaito to make something happen. And he does, time and again. In the end, he is the one that delivers the final presentation, and, thanks to his words, Kaito rallies A-TEC and dumbfounds the enemy, proving that he is more than just a girlfriendless, twenty-three-year-old nerd.Where the characters really start to shine is with Iris. Iris’s characterization is admittedly a bland one: she is the emotionless type who has an immeasurable love for Mizuki. Iris has nothing notable about her with the exception of one detail: she is an ace pilot. And that is all she is for roughly six episodes.At the halfway marker, Iris becomes unable to fly – a poetic dilemma if there ever was one. Her conflict coincides with her amnesia, giving her the chance to slowly recollect who she had been many years ago. To the point that she fully comes to understand her origins, adding to the suspense and plot of the show.As the anime nears its conclusion, she has a heart-to-heart with Mizuki, she musters the courage to fly once more, and she “reunites” with Nagisa. Her full character arc not only allowed her to grow as a person but also allowed her to, like Kaito, be more than just the characteristics that defined her. That is, she became a well-rounded character.Without a doubt, the best character in Classroom Crisis is Nagisa – this is to be expected given that this anime is more or less a story centered on him. Nagisa, in the beginning, is nothing short of a jerk, being mean towards the other characters indefinitely. When not hounding A-TEC, Nagisa has a complicated relationship with his brother, Yuji, a relationship that is far from savory. He also focuses on nothing but his work, foregoing fun in favor of fortune.Fortunately, Nagisa starts to open up the more time he spends with Mizuki, Kaito, and the rest of A-TEC. He recounts the physical and mental abuse he received at the hands of Yuji, forming the basis for the revenge he seeks. He starts to work with A-TEC, helping with the cultural festival, seeing their kindhearted nature when they help to rescue Angelina, and thinking about them as friends rather than foes.Despite his changes, Nagisa lets the fires of revenge for Yuji and his other brother, Kazuhisa, consume him, betraying A-TEC and his newfound friends. And after all his revenge seeking, he loses spectacularly.The aftermath of his downfall ultimately changes Nagisa for the better. His beautiful moment with Mizuki lets him know that he does not have to struggle alone. His predicament with Yuji lets him (however slightly) reconcile with his brother. And his final words towards Kazuhisa lets him prove to everyone that he has finally become who he always could have been all along.So while not every single character within Classroom Crisis is stellar, the ones that need to be are.SOUNDThe audio of Classroom Crisis is a toss-up, but there is no questioning that the opening and ending themes are well-executed.The OP starts with space-like sounds and a quick lyric to set the mood. The track then quickly moves into a strong bout of singing from the vocalists that is fun to follow. As the track progresses, the singing goes higher in pitch to fit the higher tension that the track has built. The track is very similar to the story; the track starts off adequately then continues to improve the further it moves along. And if nothing else, the OP is fun to listen to, both in and out of the show.The ED is a mellow track, one that helps to soothe the drama that ensued minutes prior in the episode. It starts and ends the same way as the OP: using eerie, space-like sounds that are cool to hear. The middle of the track starts off slower than its OP counterpart, but the ED truly starts to shine on its own after the halfway point where the track picks up the pace and the lyrics echo. The ED is more or less an homage to the wonderful relationship that Mizuki and Iris share (indicated by the visuals that accompany the track), turning it into the best piece out of all of the music given.Voice acting sees a mix of both strong and weak performances. Ari Ozawa as Mizuki brings a bubbly voice that captures the girl’s equally bubbly spirits. On the opposite end, Yuu Kobayashi as Angelina is annoying to hear. (Even if that is partially the point.) And Yuuma Uchida as Nagisa is somewhere in the middle since, despite the emotion he puts into his voice, it is a bit too old for the high-school student.The remainder of the tracks from the original soundtrack are certainly extensive. Jazz tracks for the carefree moments, spidery tracks for the disturbing moments (Episode five, where Nagisa is talking with Yuji, is an example of this track.), and triumphant tracks for the uplifting moments.Many more types of tracks exist, such as harrowing, tense ones, haunting, violin ones, and funky, bongo ones. Those, like the first few examples, both fit and work. But none of them particularly standout except for one: the preview track for upcoming episodes. Its funky beat and quickness is pretty catchy. Sadly, one fun track does not a strong OST make.ENJOYMENTI will admit that, when I first started this one, I was getting ready to harp on it when it came time for me to write about it. Those first three episodes were aggravating because nothing good was happening. “Good” in the sense that our protagonists get some kind of bone thrown their way. But when that bone did was nowhere in sight for so long, I was more than irate.Then the middle of the anime arrived where events were no longer so one-sided. The odds were still stacked against A-TEC, but now it felt as if the proceedings were “fair.” The comedic, pouting faces were also working, alleviating some of the frustration. Plus, Iris only caring about Mizuki was often funny. Still, I was not wholly captivated by what the anime had in store.The most entertaining section of the anime was the last quarter or so. Iris’s dilemma, Nagisa’s kidnapping, and A-TEC dismantling themselves had a lot of emotion in them. And, of course, the kiss between Mizuki and Nagisa was without a doubt the best moment the show offered.The anime also gave me the chance to write yet another really long piece, this time about conflict and resolution. I am always appreciative of any anime that gives me the chance to better myself, doing more than just providing a well-put-together anime.Yet I cannot say I liked the show all that much. I did not dislike, but I did not love it, either. The beginning contributes to this feeling, but it is the characters that cause this the most. The characters are well-written, but unfortunately I never took a liking to them, making them forgettable compared to a lot of other anime out there.Classroom Crisis might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly does a whole lot right. Its story, while unfair in the beginning, is conflicting and complete. Its characters, while not memorable, are handled well throughout the season. And its art and music, while not incredible, have strengths of their own. Saturn is far away, but one does not need a telescope to see just how nice this anime really is.SUMMARYStory: Great, strong conflicts and resolutions, alongside strong themes on revenge and reliance, craft an unsurprisingly strong narrativeAnimation: Fine, about average artistic direction, about average actual animation, funny comedic expressions, and above average character designsCharacters: Great, Mizuki, Kaito, and Iris, and especially Nagisa, are well-written characters that support and develop in their own ways from start to finishSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, the latter half is entertaining, but the frustrating first half and the forgettable characters hurt the experienceFinal Score: 7/10', 'Classroom Crisis is an anime that I\'ve seen get praise this season. Not a lot of praise, but a bit of praise. Thing is, Classroom Crisis is bad. It\'s objectively not good. I can understand why people could like this, but at the same time, I can\'t.Story: 2Classroom Crisis gives an abysmal attempt at crafting its story. From the beginning, we are confronted with a conflict. Good, plots need a conflict. Couple more episodes, though, and we begin seeing more and more problems arise. There are so many different conflicts and so many different plotlines, it just becomes difficult to keep track of.There is a...main plot, saving A-TEC from being dismantled, but for some reason, a third of the way through the anime, this gets put on the backburner for 4-5 episodes, and instead we get to focus on these other problems that are thrown at us. Why?? The main plot was good enough. Even Nagisa\'s revolution is a good subplot to have. If Classroom Crisis was limited to those two, there would not have been a problem. But then Iris has her issue, and then a tacked on romance, and then a plot twist that contributes nothing to the actual plot, in the end. There\'s also a bunch of different villains, with practically no motivation, and no real contribution to the plot.While the ending, without any spoilers, was an alright conclusion in itself, it was cliche and out of place. Classroom Crisis, which should be more aptly named Classroom Crises, was simply a mess in its storytelling.Art + Sound: 7I\'m not stickler for art and sound. I don\'t particularly listen for insert songs or background music, nor do I search for inconsistencies or mistakes in the art. TrySail\'s OP is actually great, in my opinion, and the art is pretty, to say the least. But there\'s nothing special about either.Character: 3The people in the Kirishina Corporation are so normal. Classroom Crisis is filled with such cookie-cutter cliche characters that I can\'t even name them all, but I\'ll name a few notables: Sera Kaito (energetic, somewhat-absent-minded ""mature"" one), Sera Mizuki (also energetic, happy-go-lucky teen girl), Shirasaki Iris (quiet, tough dandere who\'d do anything for her friend), Kiryuu Nagisa (evil-for-no-reason, first villain-turned-anti-hero), Angelina-sensei (tough assistant teacher who has a mysterious past (seriously? why? it\'s never explained)), Kiryuu Yuuji (Nagisa\'s boss and brother, second villain, no motivation), Kiryuu Kazuhisa (main villain, still no real motivation).The rest of the characters can be written off. The only ones I ever really took note of were Nagisa, because you kinda have to, Iris, because I love my stoic danderes, Mizuki, because she has so much presence (also the tiny hint of yuri, that ended up being destroyed), and some student who I couldn\'t tell if they were a boy, a girl, or neither.Anyways, the characters suck. A few of them do have some development, but most are left to gather dust.Enjoyment: 2I did not enjoy Classroom Crisis. It was too hard to want to follow, there is just nothing to grasp onto with it. It\'s just terrible.Overall: 4Classroom Crisis was bad. The attempt at character development, decent ending, and a somewhat traceable plot kept it floating just under mediocre. Classroom Crisis isn\'t good, and I don\'t understand why it gets the praise that it does. On the flipside, Classroom Crisis isn\'t the worst anime ever released. I guess. Please, do not make a second season. I do not want more of this.

They had a  good romance going, and the way it developed was good. But then the other girl regained her memory, and now the anime has become a harem.

This series is similar to Amagi Brilliant Park in format, and in that series, there was a very well demonstrated sense of urgency.

Because of that lack of scenes, the romance just sort of happened suddenly, and I didn\'t feel anything on behalf of either of the characters regarding the romance.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series could have divided up its time to more effectively support events like this.Should-have-shot-them-when-you-had-the-chance.There\'s one scene near the end that was terribly unnecessary. It\'s a moderate spoiler, but it gets resolved unremarkably without any large impact on the plot, so I\'ll talk about it without mentioning specific characters. Person B is evil and is doing evil things. Person A and crew break in to stop the evil deeds. Person A has Person B cornered. Hooray. Person A is furious and is in a position to strike down Person B. However, Person A decides not to deliver the final blow, saying that the higher-ups will deal with Person B\'s punishment for doing evil things. Person A then runs off to stop the main evil deed, without binding Person B. Just. Leaves. Person B. There. Does nothing. Surely Person B won\'t run around and come for revenge. Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A. It\'s just sad. The series doesn\'t pull stunts like that for all the prior episodes, and then it just has to pull that near the end. Although good for another reason, the oddest part is that it doesn\'t largely effect the next episode, so I\'m not sure why ~that~ event was chosen by the writers.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series seems to be an original series. Even if it wasn\'t, and was instead based on a light novel or manga, and this scene was in the original, I\'d consider it cringe-worthy enough to write out of the anime.Time wasn\'t well-spent.This negative relates to the other negatives. Basically, time wasn\'t divided up effectively, and on top of that, how the types of time slots were spent didn\'t effectively push the series.

Because of that lack of scenes, the romance just sort of happened suddenly, and I didn\'t feel anything on behalf of either of the characters regarding the romance.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series could have divided up its time to more effectively support events like this.Should-have-shot-them-when-you-had-the-chance.There\'s one scene near the end that was terribly unnecessary. It\'s a moderate spoiler, but it gets resolved unremarkably without any large impact on the plot, so I\'ll talk about it without mentioning specific characters. Person B is evil and is doing evil things. Person A and crew break in to stop the evil deeds. Person A has Person B cornered. Hooray. Person A is furious and is in a position to strike down Person B. However, Person A decides not to deliver the final blow, saying that the higher-ups will deal with Person B\'s punishment for doing evil things. Person A then runs off to stop the main evil deed, without binding Person B. Just. Leaves. Person B. There. Does nothing. Surely Person B won\'t run around and come for revenge. Surely we shouldn\'t hand them off to someone else to keep an eye on them. So, literally 40 seconds later [or less, depending on when you start counting], Person B sneaks up and shoots Person A. It\'s just sad. The series doesn\'t pull stunts like that for all the prior episodes, and then it just has to pull that near the end. Although good for another reason, the oddest part is that it doesn\'t largely effect the next episode, so I\'m not sure why ~that~ event was chosen by the writers.Opportunity for cancel: No. This series seems to be an original series. Even if it wasn\'t, and was instead based on a light novel or manga, and this scene was in the original, I\'d consider it cringe-worthy enough to write out of the anime.Time wasn\'t well-spent.This negative relates to the other negatives. Basically, time wasn\'t divided up effectively, and on top of that, how the types of time slots were spent didn\'t effectively push the series. So, both high-level scene planning and low-level scene planning could have been better.Opportunity for cancel: No, but the series was still enjoyable to some degree.', 'Much like an actual rocket, this show takes a while to get off the ground before finding its story and really speeding up. What I expected to be a rocket mechanic slice of life veered into Dan Brown and John Grisham territory with corporate intrigue. There are a few plot holes in the story, but nothing so major that the story and character interactions more than make up for them with how well they are done.If you can get past the first four or five episodes and liked the politics/economy parts of Log Horizon, definitely check this anime out. ', ""This anime is amazing!Every episode turned out to be interesting and packed with excitment. The story moves on and develops constantly, and that is great!In just 13 episodes, things change and evolve so much, it is impossible not to get entertained.The animation quality is great, the characters are not annoying and none of them are a classic copy paste we see these days. They have their own story, passions and deep motivations.It evolves in a lot more than just a classroom of students.Overall a very good anime, it covers sci-fi,action,drama,psychological, political,romance, adventure and it does it in a consistent and excellently measured way.I'm...surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining! surprised. I went in to watch it without expecting anything. And it turned out to be a remarcable experience.Definitely a great story, that advanced and grew stronger with each episode, something very important that we dont see a lot these days!I highly recommend Classroom Crisis, totally worth investing your time.Very entertaining!"", 'Classroom Crisis was only a small interest of mine, and when I read some reviews I was not expecting much from the show. I went in with no expectations and at first was really pleased with what I saw. Unfortunately what followed after the first couple of episodes was a roller coaster ride of lack of interest and anger. I do not often find myself thinking that a show didn\'t live up to its potential. We all can look back on something and see what we think could have been better, or what we might change. Those are just opinions and generally the story pans...out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions. However I found myself thinking that this show really chose the worst path to follow. With that out of the way lets get into the different sections.Story 6The story is something that really had me torn. You start off with some business people panicking over some kidnap scenario. This is where we switch to what I\'m going to call side A of the story. Side A contains a classroom full of rocket scientist and engineers who work on rockets for the school/company which they attend. The kidnapped person at the start of the show was supposed to be a new transfer student into their class. The class decides to rescue the kidnapped kid after they find out about it, and send their new ship and pilot to the place he was being held. The pilot crashes the ship due to technical difficulties and goes inside to find the student safe and sound.Not a bad way to start, seems a little over the top maybe but not bad. I was hooked when the transfer student who is named Nagisa Kiryuu is frustrated at the pilot for saving him. The start of the next episode shows him back with the class and telling them that he is there to cut their funding and shut them down. This premise was exciting to me. However this story path never gets fully explored, and the story splits itself into two stories. Side A is the class and the genius teacher trying to keep their class alive and build their rocket. Side B is the political/business side story of Nagisa as he does many things.Unfortunately in my opinion they focused to much into Side A. The classroom\'s story awas full of odd plot holes and strange behavioral and dysfunctions that only drag you out of the anime to make you think ""Why is this situation allowed to even happen?"". However this side of the story is pretty straightforward. Situations occur and the classroom has to deal with their situation and hopefully save their class by the end of it.Side B was what I was truly interested in. I love the way they presented Nagisa. I had the Amagi Brilliant Park vibe coming from him and I was drawn to that. Most of the first part of the show however is mostly about  Side A and the odd mixture of student/boss relationship between Nagisa and the class. However as this story line progress\'s in a less straightforward manner, it allowed for twists to crop up at the end. The last section of the show is dedicated to learning more about Nagisa, the corporation hes working for, the mysterious pilot and many other interesting tidbits of story that involves Nagisa.I don\'t want to complain a lot about the story because I feel that if the characters were made better, it wouldn\'t have been as big of an issue. The story is interesting and the twist\'s at the end were not outrageous or poorly planned. I felt that the show was paced well and had a solid backbone to build an interesting anime around.Art & Sound 7Art was beautiful. The characters and scenery were truly well done. The sound again was decent. Nothing outstanding however nothing terrible either.Characters 4Now we can get into what really makes me frustrated about this anime. Anime is always full of interesting or odd characters. This show however has stupid characters +  stupid interactions.Lets start of with Nagisa. Nagisa seems to be a young genius business man. The second hes introduced he seams intimidating in that leadership fashion. When he does speak or handle a situation you see how well he does it and how fast he does it. His age may make you think he is a novice, but through actions and rumors the viewer finds out he really is amazing at his job. However when he goes to class he is constantly picked on by his classmates/workers. Nobody respects or listens to him and ultimately his position turns into tragic back story character. His role is to learn about friendship, compassion, and begin to heal with the new ""family"" he has joined. This was a let down to me. At first they seemed to be trying to balance the power\'s between Nagisa and the teacher by having Nagisa weak at school but strong in business and politics and vice versa. This would have been acceptable but then Nagisa just became a worthless tool to progress his backstory and only ever turned back into his original persona to conveniently finish off some business items.His classmates consist of Sera Kaito, who is the genius engineer who teaches the class. Sera Kaito is an over excited idiot outside of building rockets. He often thinks something can happen with just saying that he will make it happen and through the show runs into trouble because he has no foresight. Later in the show he does have  fatherly and sagely moments that don\'t fit him. The other two important characters to mention are Sera Mizuki, who plays as the wizened teenage girl who is to heal Nagisa and also act as the cheerful middle man between Sera and Nagisa. She is cheerful and nosy to the point that you cant help but hate her. She mellows out eventually but by that point its really hard to accept her. Then you have Iris shirasake, who plays into Nagisa\'s backstory and is really only there for that purpose. She really has no depth at all. Even at the end, with the emotions she posse\'s you hardly can empathize with her at all.Then you have the pointless class room fillers. There are about 10 characters in the classroom and they only serve the purpose of being snobby little brats.You start with getting to know a little bit about everybody but it doesn\'t really matter. Eventually some classmates have a falling out and leave but soon enough they come back and rejoin the others without so much as an apology and the others accept them without a single bit of resentment. Skipping over this amazing showing of human goodness we can talk about what else they do. They constantly bother Nagisa and seem to not have any concept that they are workers. I should say that this in itself wouldn\'t bother me if it wasn\'t such crazy amount of harassment. They might have been more interesting if they spent more time developing their odd quirks like the super hacker classmate or the lab coat engineer girl..etc. That how you will have to remember them because that\'s how little attention these characters get.Other than these characters you have certain political and business characters and again little is to be said about them. They are there to progress the tragic kid, coming into adulthood story.In summary you have insanely annoying characters with little to no development and odd interaction among one another that doesn\'t really fit into the typical mold of today\'s society.Enjoyment 5I was fully prepared to write a shining review for this anime but I just cant after I finished it. The story has several interesting angels to explore and I cant really complain about it. There are a few plot holes, or possibly things I don\'t understand about it but again nothing so bad as to detract from the experience. The art and sound are fine enough to watch without being distracted in a negative way. The characters are what kills this anime. Between the odd mood swings and questionable judgment calls from the characters you hardly have enough time to find enjoyment in even some of the more relaxed and smile driven episodes. This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that. out in such a way that I don\'t feel strongly about my own opinions.

This anime is not terrible, and I think people should give it a try.TLDR; Watch it, its not terrible. I think it could have been better, but who am I to judge that.', ""Classroom Crisis is way too far from any mainstream anime that I've ever seen. The cute design of characters and colorful approach to artstyle could be misleading as to what the core story of the show really is about. This isn't about cool kids building rocket ships, school festivals or teen drama -- nope. CC is heavily leaning on political matters, hungry corporations, and the manipulations taking place behind the scenes. If this is too much for you, then you are definitely correct about not watching this anime.Classroom Crisis is, plainly put, about a group of bright students working as spaceship engineers, who are told...that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship. The cast is mostly notable for the funny and easy-going teacher, Kaito Sera, his younger sister named Mizuki, and her best friend Iris, the main pilot for projects. Together, they fight against the corporation responsible for them that is trying to shut them down.Storywise, however, CC is as heavy as politics can go. Most anime featuring students would differ them by design and personality, as well as focus on the teenagers in play. This show does not rely on any of these, considering that A-TEC is only a small dot on the entire story map. The concept of gifted children working on rocketships is just a device to attract younger audience to the anime, in order to make up for what would be a story focusing heavily on politics, money and greed. If you checked out CC because of the cute Mizuki smiling at you with the rainbow over her head, then you'd be in for quite the surprise.Otherwise, the anime is quite enjoyable. Even if most viewers wouldn't identify with the concept of elections and huge corporations trying to take over the world, sympathizing with the characters is easy since they are quite likeable, and very fun to watch. I personally found the character development to be great, and the romance happened just when it was needed, without taking much space of the plot. Some characters also do a good job keeping the anime funny and relieving, with Angelina-sensei being extremely funny to me whenever she appeared.Art isn't top notch, but done right and looks good. Colorful, futuristic and really fun. Only a bunch of characters really stand out among the others, but that isn't much of a big issue. It's easier to track the main characters because of that, and relate to them more often than not.Giving this an 8 for great art, great storytelling, nice characters and overall a story well-thought out. Give this a thought if you're in for something more mature, but also light and not too nerve-wrecking to watch. that their class is to be downsized due to the extreme expenses of their projects and very recent failure of flying one of their rocket spaceship.

You should watch it to refresh your mind.-Realist and logical male lead. Some typical anime have nerd, otaku, unrealist, talkaktive, and passive male lead character. But, in this series, the MC has strong personality, ambitious, and mature mind set. (It\'s like Shiba Tatsuya mix Hachiman)-YOU SEARCH FOR RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT. There\'s no romance genre in this series, but from what I saw, there\'s a minor romance between MC and heroines. Yes, add ""s"", because there\'s 2 possible lover for MC, and those two was...best friend. The MC not a bastard guy who not sensitive with romance, he handles those 2 fairly, so they dont break their friendship because of a guy.-Serious conflict, but carefree characters. Many conflicts in this series choose serious ways, but almost all characters handle those conflict with smile, trust, and working together to overcome troubles.That\'s all the reason why you must watch this series. This 7,11 mark is bullshit. I think some guys who gave it mark not an anime addict person, so they still not bore in some mainstream anime. best friend.

The first time, I rated the show a 10 and the second time I affirmed that I made no mistake in my score choice. I understand that this show's major appeals are not for everyone, but this show deserves more recognition as it is able to accomplish creating such a satisfying story in 13 episodes.Here are things I love about the show in no particular order:I love the main character, Nagisa Kiryu, and his development throughout the show. His character is so refreshing to see in the midst of every beta male MC that is common...in modern anime. I love the rest of the cast, and although I may forget about them more easily than others, the A-TEC team has a lovable family atmosphere that I enjoy.I love the OST, especially in hype moments, I find myself getting immersed and tapping my foot along with the catchy beat.I love the themes this anime covers, though not for everyone: Engineering, Politics, Business, Revenge, Self-discovery. Maruto Fumiaki, who had a great hand in the writing of this show, is my favourite writer in the industry and I feel like he's just getting started in his hopefully long career. I love the story because revenge, coming of age, teamwork, and goal-driven plotlines are what I yearn for the most. I love how, the story ends as it leaves on a good note, with major conflicts resolved and only leaving very minor things open for interpretation, possibly in hopes for a season 2.I will definitely rewatch this show again, as I do with all my 10s, in the near future. This show was a roller-coaster ride of emotions that I am always down to ride again. in modern anime.
